            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>They work great!  </li>
            <li>I have used nothing but Remington products for decades and they always worked great.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they could just send me a pack of the correct clips!</li>
            <li>This product does a good job.  </li>
            <li>When will manufacturing companies learn to leave a good product alone and stop replacing their good products with...</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a good curler.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers!  </li>
            <li>so I though hot rollers might be the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>but these hot rollers work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I like them much better!</li>
            <li>it is good, but could be better....</li>
            <li>it is too warm.</li>
            <li>I have used the Remington brand before and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I could kind of make out a curl when I took out some of the rollers, but it fell out almost immediately.</li>
            <li>At first, I loved the rollers!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use those kinds of words even if they are the most appropriate.  </li>
            <li>and that was one too many times.  </li>
            <li>this is not the hair setter I received so I am not at all pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It would be so much better with an on/off switch</li>
            <li>I have no complaints at all, I love these.</li>
            <li>These hair rollers were just ok.</li>
            <li>These are super easy to use and I love them!</li>
            <li>I have hair that is easy to curl and takes to rollers well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this in hopes to be able to curl my hair for a special event.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap, with plastic ends/container that get very VERY hot while you&#x27;re using them - probably hotter than the rollers, given the results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these hot rollers and would recommend them 100%!</li>
            <li>Metal clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers so they slide out of my hair before it can curl.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and has a nice assortment of curlers.</li>
            <li>Found these and was excited.</li>
            <li>I always loved the result I had from curling my hair with an iron but never wanted to take that much time to get ready,</li>
            <li>I then unplugged the set to let them cool a bit before I tried again so as not to burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>only concern might be, that it is good 1/2 nights before refill is required.</li>
            <li>The ends of the rollers were cool enough to handle and the rollers themselves seemed very warm, nearly hot.</li>
            <li>After letting them all completely cool, I removed them and had super springy curls all over my head.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, since one of my favorite beauty bloggers had recommended it.</li>
            <li>I love these rollers heat up pretty fast..</li>
            <li>This is the second one of these roller sets I have owned, and my one gripe is that I wasn&#x27;t sure the first one was heating safely after I had owned it for some time.  </li>
            <li>BUT....about 5 minutes later, spots on the top of my head felt like they were ON FIRE!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend these - they will burn your fingers and the clips do not hold your hair if it is medium or fine unless you clump a lot of hair on one roller but that doesn&#x27;t give you much of a curl.  </li>
            <li>heated them up for a good 35 minutes with the lid closed and set my hair.  </li>
            <li>These Remington H5600A hot rollers claim to be cool to the touch, which they are not.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for quick curls.  </li>
            <li>The color coordinating clips slip right over and do not leave a bump in my hair where the clip goes.</li>
            <li>Once rolled, the rollers felt very hot on the top of my head, but only the top, where my hair is coincidentally the longest, nearly 6 inches.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to find a decent set of hair rollers that are flocked that the clips stay in and stay hot long enough to give a very good curl.  </li>
            <li>First, it stank</li>
            <li>They were so hot when I was rolling my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hot rollers off and on for over 20 years, so I&#x27;m no first-timer here.</li>
            <li>The flocking made it easier to roll my hair onto the hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it was the heat from the core of the rollers, even though they didn&#x27;t feel excessively hot on my head.</li>
            <li>just really hot to touch the curlers.</li>
            <li>Rollers are so hot to work with that</li>
            <li>Ends get way too hot and clamps won&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>Well, I have an old&lt;br /&gt;remington hot roller set</li>
            <li>They do get hot, but isn&#x27;t that what you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plug</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at doing my own hair since it is fine</li>
            <li>However, even after letting the hair cool with the rollers still rolled up for at least 30 minutes, and adding strong hold hairspray after removing the rollers, the curls themselves never lasted me more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a tight fit, but I thought....</li>
            <li>My first set came with cruddy plastic clips, but my second came with metal pins, which were somewhat better, although you may still want to separately buy the kind of pins or clips you like best.</li>
            <li>This product ONLY rates three stars as the ends heat up to the point you cannot easily handle them, and the clips can slip.</li>
            <li>I wish that Remington sold replacement large rollers though.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the instant</li>
            <li>I had straight hair again.</li>
            <li>I gave it 1 star because they don&#x27;t offer 0, and they really should.  </li>
            <li>Have not used this as much as planned.</li>
            <li>The rollers lose way much heat as soon as you take them out of the heating tray.</li>
            <li>them in and when you are ready to use them...unplug it.</li>
            <li>For being iconic, I thought they would be great; but, did not curl well:(</li>
            <li>I have liked Remington rollers for a long time and tried a couple of others when my last set broke.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a cool looking setter to buy for a present.</li>
            <li>new set is pitiful!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced this before, even after so many years of using many different types of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>This product rates three stars for the variety of roller sizes, the quick heat up time, and the fact the curls last.</li>
            <li>I add a little styling product on my ends for a better set on my curls</li>
            <li>Also, even though the rollers heat up very quickly, I believe after no more than 2 minutes they are ready to be used, they also cool down almost as quickly.</li>
            <li>I hope this isn&#x27;t the new normal forever.</li>
            <li>This set is already boxed right back up and going to be returned tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would not recommend these particular hot rollers.</li>
            <li>They get hot fairly quickly, I have enough of the right sizes for my layered long hair, and I love the thin wire-style clips over the wide plastic comb-clip style (no more kinks where the the clips go, and it holds great).</li>
            <li>I live in a humid town.</li>
            <li>Probably other hot rollers would have done the trick, but these absolutely stink!</li>
            <li>Since it wasn&#x27;t the exact same one</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rollers did not get get hot enough to keep my hair curled.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the ends of the rollers were hot enough to curl the hair, let alone burn my scalp.</li>
            <li>The ends of the rollers are so hot that I had to drop them several times before I could sctually roll one into my hair.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find the OLD MODEL!</li>
            <li>Secondly, they did absolutely NOTHING for my hair!</li>
            <li>Small and medium are available, but not the large ones.</li>
            <li>The times i did use it, my curls stayed for about as long as expected with my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>My old rollers didn&#x27;t come out that fast when I was actually removing them.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were like my old set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old</li>
            <li>I got the old fashioned clips for the rollers...not the clips pictured.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t make the old one</li>
            <li>It was very unsuccessful and it took me a second to realize that the clips in the box were not the clips pictured on the box.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and after taking out the rollers, it was.... naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t some American company figure out that people would be willing to pay for the quality of yesteryear if ONLY someone in America would make it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These rollers are no different, they are &amp;#34;chinanized&amp;#34; (my new word) pieces of garbage.  </li>
            <li>and I had hoped this new one would heat the rollers hot enough, but I find that it is not hot enough to set my hair the way I would like.</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Barely any wave, and by the time I walked from my bedroom to my kitchen</li>
            <li>Afterwards, they simply look like naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>They are OK bur not great.</li>
            <li>Once in my hair(I had put it at the crown), I looked down to get another roller and the first one dropped out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically have problems with getting my fingers burned; I unplug before it gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>The ends are little hot when your trying to roll your hair</li>
            <li>Ends tend to be a little hot</li>
            <li>At least the clips are better than the pins of some other Remington models.  </li>
            <li>My old set heated up hot and held their heat in my hair for at least an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have problems with getting my fingers burned; I unplug before it gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> The ends are little hot when your trying to roll your hair</li>
            <li> Ends tend to be a little hot</li>
            <li> At least the clips are better than the pins of some other Remington models.  </li>
            <li> My old set heated up hot and held their heat in my hair for at least an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let them heat up for about 20 minutes thinking that would help and left them in my hair for almost 30 and my hair was still flat, even the ends weren&#x27;t curled.</li>
            <li> First of all, the ends of the rollers heat up so much that they are uncomfortable to work with.</li>
            <li> These heat up very quickly and cool down just as fast, almost before you can get the rollers in your hair, but that&#x27;s not the worst part.  </li>
            <li> I now have a set of rollers that I can only use a few and with those few I have to sit very still and not move because they will fall out.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to roll up the hair when neither plastic end of the roller is remotely cool enough to be handled!</li>
            <li> I tried them three times now on totally dry hair, with curl gel in my hair and with hairspray before I took them out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, they sit on their metal stubs loose like and roll around.</li>
            <li> The set comes with the wire clips, not plastic clips, which are color coded but not very well.</li>
            <li> plus it is less expensive than some other sets and is small enough to fit well on a bathroom counter or in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> They take less than 5 minutes to heat up and the rollers themselves have a velvet type center to help keep the hair from slipping when you roll them in.</li>
            <li> but I dropped the 4th one, bent over to pick it up off the floor and the other three that were in my hair</li>
            <li> so bad right out of the box I had to plug it in on my outside porch for 2 days just to get the bug spray stink off of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so be a little careful.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to differentiate the orange from the red wires.</li>
            <li> What little curl I managed to get before it slide out lasted, literally, 5 minutes tops.  </li>
            <li> Well, my little girl soon thought otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> But I got another one, because it is hard to find what I am looking for: a set that has more than a small handful of rollers, different roller sizes, and a traditional flocked post style, rather than hard knobby rollers (too scary to put that in my hair) or split rollers (have had bad experiences with getting those stuck in my hair.)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick or long hair (just past the shoulders), which allows me to put small strands on each of the rollers.</li>
            <li> the curls they create are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Small and rollers heat unevenly and do not curl hair</li>
            <li> Four hours later, there are still two areas left where it feels as badly burned as with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It cost me 13.00 to send something back that was pictured wrong!</li>
            <li> Could not hold rollers without burning fingers; no cool ends!!!</li>
            <li> These may me the worst set of hot rollers I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> The color distinction on the clips is very hard to see...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, they stood behind their product and I returned it without any issues.</li>
            <li> That was really frustrating.  </li>
            <li> For thin hair, I miss the rollers with teeth that hold the hair on the roll.  </li>
            <li> WRONG AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it that within 2 minutes of putting them in my hair they were STONE COLD.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the lack of curl from this set.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not that thin)!!!  </li>
            <li> and it seems that everything being made is China is crap.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst hair product I have ever purchased.</li>

            <li> This product rates three stars for the variety of roller sizes, the quick heat up time, and the fact the curls last. This product ONLY rates three stars as the ends heat up to the point you cannot easily handle them, and the clips can slip.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers!  I wish that Remington sold replacement large rollers though.  Small and medium are available, but not the large ones.</li>
            <li> I always loved the result I had from curling my hair with an iron but never wanted to take that much time to get ready, so I though hot rollers might be the perfect solution. Probably other hot rollers would have done the trick, but these absolutely stink! They are very cheap, with plastic ends/container that get very VERY hot while you&#x27;re using them - probably hotter than the rollers, given the results. I tried them three times now on totally dry hair, with curl gel in my hair and with hairspray before I took them out. I got NO results. Barely any wave, and by the time I walked from my bedroom to my kitchen I had straight hair again. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Go for a different set!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these and they do nothing! I let them heat up for about 20 minutes thinking that would help and left them in my hair for almost 30 and my hair was still flat, even the ends weren&#x27;t curled. These may me the worst set of hot rollers I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I had owned a set of flocked Remington hair rollers that stopped heating after 3 years. I bought these thinking they were the replacement. BIG MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new set is pitiful!  First, it stank so bad right out of the box I had to plug it in on my outside porch for 2 days just to get the bug spray stink off of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they sit on their metal stubs loose like and roll around. It&#x27;s not a tight fit, but I thought....oh well, maybe it will work anyhow.  NO it doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heated them up for a good 35 minutes with the lid closed and set my hair.  They were so hot when I was rolling my hair I thought they were like my old set. WRONG AGAIN.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it that within 2 minutes of putting them in my hair they were STONE COLD. My old set heated up hot and held their heat in my hair for at least an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m nearly 60 years old and it seems that everything being made is China is crap. These rollers are no different, they are &amp;#34;chinanized&amp;#34; (my new word) pieces of garbage.  Why can&#x27;t some American company figure out that people would be willing to pay for the quality of yesteryear if ONLY someone in America would make it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to find a decent set of hair rollers that are flocked that the clips stay in and stay hot long enough to give a very good curl.  I hope this isn&#x27;t the new normal forever.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job.  I use it with gel, and use hairspray after styling.  This is the second one of these roller sets I have owned, and my one gripe is that I wasn&#x27;t sure the first one was heating safely after I had owned it for some time.  But I got another one, because it is hard to find what I am looking for: a set that has more than a small handful of rollers, different roller sizes, and a traditional flocked post style, rather than hard knobby rollers (too scary to put that in my hair) or split rollers (have had bad experiences with getting those stuck in my hair.)  This set has all of that plus it is less expensive than some other sets and is small enough to fit well on a bathroom counter or in a suitcase.  I don&#x27;t typically have problems with getting my fingers burned; I unplug before it gets extremely hot.  My first set came with cruddy plastic clips, but my second came with metal pins, which were somewhat better, although you may still want to separately buy the kind of pins or clips you like best.</li>
            <li> Did not receive what I ordered.  I got the old fashioned clips for the rollers...not the clips pictured.  The color distinction on the clips is very hard to see...they all look the same.  I am very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> These rollers do not hold in the heat to make curls and they do not stay in your hair with the clips provided.</li>
            <li> Sending back.  Could not hold rollers without burning fingers; no cool ends!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I thought it would replace the last one I got.  Since it wasn&#x27;t the exact same one and they don&#x27;t make the old one anymore I went ahead and purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;The rollers did not get get hot enough to keep my hair curled.&lt;br /&gt;However, they stood behind their product and I returned it without any issues.</li>
            <li> I gave it 1 star because they don&#x27;t offer 0, and they really should.  I have used nothing but Remington products for decades and they always worked great.  These heat up very quickly and cool down just as fast, almost before you can get the rollers in your hair, but that&#x27;s not the worst part.  I have fine hair and the instant I let go of the roller and clip the roller starts sliding out of my hair (it&#x27;s not that thin)!!!  My old rollers didn&#x27;t come out that fast when I was actually removing them.  What little curl I managed to get before it slide out lasted, literally, 5 minutes tops.  When will manufacturing companies learn to leave a good product alone and stop replacing their good products with... can&#x27;t use those kinds of words even if they are the most appropriate.  Done with Remington!!!  And people wonder why companies that have been around for decades go under--THIS IS WHY.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these - they will burn your fingers and the clips do not hold your hair if it is medium or fine unless you clump a lot of hair on one roller but that doesn&#x27;t give you much of a curl.  Bummer</li>
            <li> I bought this product after watching a YouTube video review. I absolutely love these hot rollers and would recommend them 100%! I&#x27;m not very good at doing my own hair since it is fine but these hot rollers work wonderfully. They take less than 5 minutes to heat up and the rollers themselves have a velvet type center to help keep the hair from slipping when you roll them in. The color coordinating clips slip right over and do not leave a bump in my hair where the clip goes. These are super easy to use and I love them! Great product!!</li>
            <li> it is good, but could be better.... it is too warm. it took about 30 minutes to curl all my hair</li>
            <li> I received the same colored rollers but they came with wire grips that kept popping out everytime I attempted to put them in place. I ordered this set because of the three pronged clips in the photo and would like to receive those from the seller as soon as possible as that is what&#x27;s pictured in the photo.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes to be able to curl my hair for a special event. I tried to curl my hair the morning of the event. It was very unsuccessful and it took me a second to realize that the clips in the box were not the clips pictured on the box. They were similar but the clips sent were all one size, the rollers are 3 different sizes. I now have a set of rollers that I can only use a few and with those few I have to sit very still and not move because they will fall out. It would be nice if they could just send me a pack of the correct clips!</li>
            <li> For being iconic, I thought they would be great; but, did not curl well:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hot rollers off and on for over 20 years, so I&#x27;m no first-timer here. I bought this set to start rolling my hair again after letting it grow longer. At first, I loved the rollers! The flocking made it easier to roll my hair onto the hot rollers. The ends of the rollers were cool enough to handle and the rollers themselves seemed very warm, nearly hot. Once rolled, the rollers felt very hot on the top of my head, but only the top, where my hair is coincidentally the longest, nearly 6 inches. After letting them all completely cool, I removed them and had super springy curls all over my head. BUT....about 5 minutes later, spots on the top of my head felt like they were ON FIRE! Four hours later, there are still two areas left where it feels as badly burned as with a curling iron. WHAT THE HECK? It doesn&#x27;t seem like the ends of the rollers were hot enough to curl the hair, let alone burn my scalp. I&#x27;m guessing it was the heat from the core of the rollers, even though they didn&#x27;t feel excessively hot on my head. Whatever it was....I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced this before, even after so many years of using many different types of hot rollers. This set is already boxed right back up and going to be returned tomorrow. Anyone have a fire extinguisher??</li>
            <li> I tried to use these only once and that was one too many times.  The ends of the rollers are so hot that I had to drop them several times before I could sctually roll one into my hair. Once in my hair(I had put it at the crown), I looked down to get another roller and the first one dropped out of my hair.  That was really frustrating.  I then unplugged the set to let them cool a bit before I tried again so as not to burn my fingers. I managed to get three in that time but I dropped the 4th one, bent over to pick it up off the floor and the other three that were in my hair all fell out.  I have hair that is easy to curl and takes to rollers well.  Not this set.</li>
            <li> this is not the hair setter I received so I am not at all pleased with my purchase. It cost me 13.00 to send something back that was pictured wrong!</li>
            <li> Does the job...only concern might be, that it is good 1/2 nights before refill is required. I might buy a larger capacity unit on my next such buy</li>
            <li> Metal clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers so they slide out of my hair before it can curl. No instructions included.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Small and rollers heat unevenly and do not curl hair</li>
            <li> They work great!  just really hot to touch the curlers.</li>
            <li> I have used the Remington brand before and liked it.  This product met expectations.  Would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> These Remington H5600A hot rollers claim to be cool to the touch, which they are not. It is difficult to roll up the hair when neither plastic end of the roller is remotely cool enough to be handled! I guess if one would use gloves that sometimes come with curling irons, it would make it easier. The set comes with the wire clips, not plastic clips, which are color coded but not very well. Sometimes it is hard to differentiate the orange from the red wires. Also, even though the rollers heat up very quickly, I believe after no more than 2 minutes they are ready to be used, they also cool down almost as quickly. I don&#x27;t have particularly thick or long hair (just past the shoulders), which allows me to put small strands on each of the rollers. However, even after letting the hair cool with the rollers still rolled up for at least 30 minutes, and adding strong hold hairspray after removing the rollers, the curls themselves never lasted me more than 30 minutes. Afterwards, they simply look like naturally wavy hair. Overall, I would not recommend these particular hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for quick curls.  Love it!</li>
            <li> For thin hair, I miss the rollers with teeth that hold the hair on the roll.  At least the clips are better than the pins of some other Remington models.  Wish I could find the OLD MODEL!</li>
            <li> I love these rollers heat up pretty fast.. I add a little styling product on my ends for a better set on my curls</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the lack of curl from this set. I was hoping for a good curler. Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Have not used this as much as planned. I live in a humid town. The times i did use it, my curls stayed for about as long as expected with my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> It would be so much better with an on/off switch</li>
            <li> I like this set! I forgot my Conair rollers on a business trip, and picked these up as a replacement. I like them much better! They get hot fairly quickly, I have enough of the right sizes for my layered long hair, and I love the thin wire-style clips over the wide plastic comb-clip style (no more kinks where the the clips go, and it holds great). I have no complaints at all, I love these.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cool looking setter to buy for a present. Well, my little girl soon thought otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look out!  Rollers are so hot to work with that she only used it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found out that the \\&quot;Ionic\\&quot; claim is not what you may think.  Technically, anything that get plugged in will emit an ion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fooled me once.  Oh well.  I guess you get what you pay for.  At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I have liked Remington rollers for a long time and tried a couple of others when my last set broke. No luck there. Found these and was excited. They are OK bur not great. Ends get way too hot and clamps won&#x27;t hold. Wish they would go back to former product heating mode and metal clips.</li>
            <li> These hair rollers were just ok. The ends are little hot when your trying to roll your hair and I felt like the curls they create are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Well, I have an old&lt;br /&gt;remington hot roller set and I had hoped this new one would heat the rollers hot enough, but I find that it is not hot enough to set my hair the way I would like.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, since one of my favorite beauty bloggers had recommended it. First of all, the ends of the rollers heat up so much that they are uncomfortable to work with. Several times I&#x27;ve had to drop the roller because it started burning my fingers. Secondly, they did absolutely NOTHING for my hair! I have naturally wavy hair, and after taking out the rollers, it was.... naturally wavy. I could kind of make out a curl when I took out some of the rollers, but it fell out almost immediately. I didn&#x27;t even have time to grab the hairspray. The rollers lose way much heat as soon as you take them out of the heating tray. Worst hair product I have ever purchased. Will definitely need to return these.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and has a nice assortment of curlers. Ends tend to be a little hot so be a little careful.</li>
            <li> They do get hot, but isn&#x27;t that what you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plug them in and when you are ready to use them...unplug it.</li>
