            <li>I used to use Kent combs as a teenager many years ago.  </li>
            <li>The answer is, sure</li>
            <li>This comb is built from a much more robust plastic.</li>

            <li>Such a great comb.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it handles it with ease while still being gentle enough to put every hair perfectly in place.  </li>

            <li>#34;How excited</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve got 1 to 2 inch long hair and this is really good at keeping it neat.</li>
            <li>I prefer this Kent® comb over the Baxter brand; while both are extremely well crafted; I prefer the Kent® comb over the other, as it just feels better against the skin … this is a great &#x27;Mustache&#x27; sized Comb! ...</li>
            <li>Nice comb,but it is small,no bigger than pocket comb</li>
            <li>Reduces split ends and glides through hair far better than a 99 cent cheapo.</li>

            <li>For me, this was well worth the money</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This Comb has the same great feel as the standard size comb..  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you look for in a comb</li>

            <li>Feels very soft on the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and removes tangled hair with little effort.</li>
            <li>The Conair type plastic ones feel awfull and  are usually harsh to the scalp and can easily cause irritation.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what everyone is talking about. It&#x27;s a comb to me. I can&#x27;t see what so special about it.</li>
            <li> Nice comb,but it is small,no bigger than pocket comb,I wanted big bathroom comb</li>
            <li> Great, well made, strong comb. Reduces split ends and glides through hair far better than a 99 cent cheapo.</li>
            <li> Nice product!! Good for beard and head hair combing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair. Feels solid. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very simple and sturdy. Exactly what you look for in a comb</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a quality comb, you should.  It slips through your hair so easily!  No comparison to cheap combs.</li>
            <li> I prefer this Kent® comb over the Baxter brand; while both are extremely well crafted; I prefer the Kent® comb over the other, as it just feels better against the skin … this is a great &#x27;Mustache&#x27; sized Comb! ... Beard-On!</li>
            <li> I would look at the measurements closely and compare it to a comb in your home.  I didn&#x27;t and ended up purchasing the 6T afterwards.  Quality is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice looking comb but it is not very tall. The tines are only about 1/2&amp;#34; long, so if you have thick or even med. thick hair it&#x27;s to short..</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is.  Good quality comb.  Comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love these natural combs. Worth the extra expense, I find that they don&#x27;t pull. Very important for a long haired lady.</li>
            <li> One may ask: &amp;#34;How excited can you be bout a comb.&amp;#34;  I would answer &amp;#34;very excited.&amp;#34;  Not all combs are the same in my opinion.  The quality of this comb is noticeable from the second you pick it up.  The teeth a perfectly uniform on each half.  The weight is nice and the comb feels very durable.  I think this comb would handle all hair types perfectly.  I have a lot of hair and it handles it with ease while still being gentle enough to put every hair perfectly in place.  This comb is a necessary piece to a grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb. Feels very soft on the scalp and hair. No more buying those cheap combs for me.</li>
            <li> For me, this was well worth the money</li>
            <li> A great comb at a great price. Hand-cut, rounded teeth don&#x27;t dig into your scalp like cheap molded combs do.</li>
            <li> Really high quality and sturdy comb. It&#x27;s the perfect size too. I&#x27;ve got 1 to 2 inch long hair and this is really good at keeping it neat.</li>
            <li> If you want the feel of a real comb then you&#x27;ve found it.  The material they use to make these combs is very smooth and the thickness of the combs is just right for the grip too.  Plus, even the teeth in this comb are very smooth and no edges on the teeth as well so this way you don&#x27;t prick your scalp accidentally when combing.  The spacing of the teeth is just right too for those with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Good comb. Feels solid in your hand.</li>
            <li> Nice quality comb.  Purchased as a gift to go along with other items.</li>
            <li> I used to use Kent combs as a teenager many years ago.  Just discovered them again and they are far superior to anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> The answer is, sure but where are you going to find it this easily.  I have been super impressed with Kent products.  I own two brushes, one bristle, and one styling.  I bought a comb to work on my hard part and executive contour style hair cut.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this comb from a fit and finish stand point.  They are supior products in every way compared to injected molded plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The areas that I made mistakes were underestimating the length needed for the comb and the length of the teeth.  158 mm is long enough for an everyday comb but short enough for bigger pockets as a carry comb as well.  I found that for my liking it is a bit too short so I am ordering a 188mm Kent comb as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the 2T tooth length is too short for my hair thickness.  2T equates to about an 1 - 1/2&amp;#34;  This is not a flaw in the comb obviously but I would recommend that vendors identify metrics that matter and present them to the customer.  Maybe 2T means something to a barber but thats not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have looked high and low for a better comb and haven&#x27;t found one.  I added two other kent combs to my arsenal since.</li>
            <li> Is a very well made comb.</li>
            <li> Good comb. Well made and works well on a beard.  Feels funny on my head though because it doesn&#x27;t scratch like a usual comb does.</li>
            <li> This Comb has the same great feel as the standard size comb..  It&#x27;s a great size for your travel bag.</li>
            <li> Such a great comb. I didn&#x27;t think it was possibly to have a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; comb, but it is. I have fine hair and this comb doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair at all. My old comb would pull out strands and it was hard to brush the scalp. I&#x27;ve only had this comb a week, but only one strand has come out the entire week AND I can completely brush my scalp without tangles. The teeth are short, though, so it may not work as well if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about Kent combs. I always thought a comb is a comb is a comb. I was curious since I started using pomade and taking better care of my hair. So I ordered this comb. I was pleasantly suprized with the quality and crafstmanship. I had no idea about comb quality. Works great on my thin hair. It&#x27;s a strong comb but it really is gentle on my hair and scalp. I&#x27;ll never use another comb again. Well worth the price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find hand-made from natural materials,combs anymore.The Conair type plastic ones feel awfull and  are usually harsh to the scalp and can easily cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:Hand made and not from China.</li>
            <li> The A-2T Kent Hand-Made comb is hands down the nicest comb that I have ever used/purchased. Like the listing states it is 158mm (6&amp;#34; X1&amp;#34;). Which is more than adequate for my needs. They do make larger and smaller combs sold here as well. I have owned it for over a month and have nothing but great things to say about it. It is constructed of a sturdy plastic. Not comparable to the cheaper ACE type drug store combs. This comb is built from a much more robust plastic. I believe that it will provide me with many years of great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Sturdy construction&lt;br /&gt;-Nice finish&lt;br /&gt;-Nice size for my needs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> This has to be the best comb I have ever purchased and used in my lifetime.It is easy to handle and removes tangled hair with little effort.A great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong recommendation.</li>
