            <li> The nice part about buying this big pack of strips is that you end up with quite a few left over, and whenever you notice your teeth starting to dull in color, you can pop a set on your teeth and you&#x27;ll be back to your previous results.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s important not to use a flouride based tooth paste while using these because the flouride will mess up the active ingredient in the whitener and render it useless.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I started to see the change in colour by the second usage. I love them! So easy to use and I felt no discomfort at all. I&#x27;ve recommended them to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great! Better than OTC brands.</li>
            <li> Great. The best on the Market. Happy you are around.&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional...I use to keep up whiteness of my teeth. During two days in a row I use them the same way. 1st I have strips in for half an hour and direct after that I put in 2 new strips for half an hour. For me they work excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional whitening done on my teeth (with the gel and little teeth inserts that were shaped by my dentist) and it only lasted about 2-3 months before the whiteness was gone and I had a dull smile again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these whitestrips from watching a beauty channel on youtube and the person recommending them had extremely white teeth so I was convinced from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using these (even after the professional whitening) my teeth were close to a light tan color. Not white, not yellow, but not a smile I was happy to present to others. After 3 days of using them, I was already seeing a noticeable difference in my teeth. It&#x27;s important not to use a flouride based tooth paste while using these because the flouride will mess up the active ingredient in the whitener and render it useless. Stick to a natural based toothpaste or something that doesn&#x27;t contain flouride (this applies to mouthwash as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips themselves are kinda small and funky, a little hard to get used to a first. On your first few applies you&#x27;ll probably have a little difficulty keeping them on. Try to apply them when you know you&#x27;re not going to be eating or talking or exercising for at least 30 minutes. I didn&#x27;t get any irritation of my gums from using them, but this may be a factor for you if you have sensitive teeth and/or gums, so keep that in mind. Try to apply them once in the morning and then once at night before you go to sleep, but even just once a day will get the trick done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of continuous use, my teeth are actually white. No more tan stained look to them. They look absolutely natural too which is a plus. The nice part about buying this big pack of strips is that you end up with quite a few left over, and whenever you notice your teeth starting to dull in color, you can pop a set on your teeth and you&#x27;ll be back to your previous results.

            <li> Guaranteed to see results in 2 weeks. Also use the 3D mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Good product!  Experation date is September 2016 for my box.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are spot on. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit gunky. Yes, my teeth were sensitive after use. But they work. I saw a difference right away.</li>
            <li> They work. My dentist actually recommended them.</li>
            <li> BRILLIANT PRODUCT. DEFINITELY WORK. ONLY USED A FEW SO FAR. TEETH SENSITIVE ON SECOND DAY BUT AFTER A TWO DAY BREAK WERE FINE. DIDN&#x27;T DAMAGE GUMS OR SHOW WHITE CALCIUM DEPOSITS, SO I&#x27;M REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!  These just work.  I&#x27;m only half-way through the box and what a big difference.  I will certainly be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I use this and the results are fab. I get compliments even from my dentist on how white my teeth are.&lt;br /&gt;I use about 1 time every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> As a dental assistant I bleach my patients teeth on regular bases. We just use the in office version and I wanted to try something for at home....my husband got the crest supreme stips and just finished using them. The result is a much whiter smile. The really got whiter and they look much more healty now. The sensitivity was there but ok to deal with and is now totally gone. Negative point was, that they were moving around in ur mouth like crazy. The were sliding back and forth...30 annoying  min.&lt;br /&gt;I on the other hand used the chest professional effects ones and my color didn&#x27;t not change a all. So we will keep using those for the future.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by my dentist. Watch seller&#x27;s wording carefully- 84 strips means 42 applications. 1 lower and 1 upper strip per application.</li>
            <li> Better than the rest.  Our family of five likes to use white-strips.  We have tried almost everyone one out there.  Although this product appears generic, I can say,for our family, it is the best product out there to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I prefer the, advanced seal ones. These slip off too easily. :(</li>
            <li> They are kind of nasty...slippery and hard to keep on teeth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and have been using Sensodyne for years. This Product works very well but definitely makes my teeth more sensitive. I still continue to use it and deal with the sensitivity</li>
            <li> I have used other Crest strips in the past and I have had no issues.  They do not stick to my teeth as other Crest Whitening strips do.  I would advise using a differnt Crest product.  It also does not indicate the percentage of peroxide anywhere in the documentation or on the box.</li>
