            <li>nice stuff keep it up.</li>
            <li>and it is a truly effective AP/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t seem to be as effective in eliminating armpit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Old Spice before with great results!</li>
            <li>Best Old Spice scent ever.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not too musky -- very clean.</li>
            <li>i found myself sweating more than a nun in a brothel</li>
            <li>and I was \\&quot;ok,</li>
            <li>All 3 of my teenagers (2 boys and 1 girl) love this scent and how well the anti-perspirant works.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re deodorant products work better than the rest.</li>
            <li>My son and I love the smell of this deorderant.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t ever have to pay $5 a can at Target again:)</li>
            <li>Many compliments can be received when using this product, in conjunction with the spray.</li>
            <li>Smells great and does a decent job of fighting sweat.</li>
            <li>Trust Terry Crews when he says it is more powerful than the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Now being serious, it is very good, one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My favorite solid stick, this works great and smells even better.</li>
            <li>so I decided I really wanted to smell good</li>
            <li>There are not too many deodorants that are suitable for both men and women and youth alike that actually smell pleasant and work well too.  </li>
            <li>It straddles the boundary between being strongly scented and overly fragrant.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, she said it was great if I wanted to smell like a 10 year old girl.</li>
            <li>&quot; I don&#x27;t think that is accurate.</li>
            <li>Freedom ain&#x27;t free...</li>
            <li>So far this one and the clear version of the best value deodorants I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
            <li>I smelled like on the first hour!!</li>
            <li>My personal favorite between denali and fiji, has a cool and refreshing body to it and the antiperspirant side of these are amazing, during music rehearsals</li>
            <li>I saw the Old Spice Matterhorn Anti-perspirant and Deodorant  on the Good Morning Show and it was highly recommended for the nice scent and use for either woman or men.  </li>
            <li>I want to smell this good in everywhere not only in my armpits!!</li>
            <li>Good smell with lasting protection.</li>
            <li>So sweet</li>
            <li>thinking I was full of STD&#x27;s</li>
            <li>We both love the scent, it&#x27;s very clean and fresh but still has a masculine air about it.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The 4 pack is a great value, much cheaper than buying in a traditional store.</li>
            <li>Last all day and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>The scent smells fresh and would compliment a scent like cool water.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Fresh Collection does the job for me in terms of helping to keep my underarm perspiration under good control during periods of high heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>i have the other scents ,in the fresh collection,and i have to say the other ones smell alot better than the matterhorn,the fiji and denali are the best</li>
            <li>Plus it offers your underarms a refreshing break from city life with the smell of the Matterhorn.</li>
            <li>I attribute all my success in life to the subtlety and strength of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have used Old Spice for years and am pleased with the newish scents.</li>
            <li>Have yet to find a deodorant&#x27;s fragrance I like more than Old Spice Matterhorn.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite old spice scent.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on it at first, then my wife hit the nail right on the head.  </li>
            <li>As far as antiperspirant goes this stuff is fine.</li>
            <li>yes, as some one said, at first the odor confuses you (seems it mught not be so manly)</li>
            <li>I love how by the end of the day, I can smell different &amp;#34;tones&amp;#34; in the Matterhorn than at the beginning of the day.</li>
            <li>I love this scent but, regrettably, the white bar leaves my shirts stained.  </li>
            <li>3/4 broke the first time I tried to twist them up.  </li>
            <li>strong enough for a man.  </li>
            <li>This is not as strong to me as the red zone product line.  </li>
            <li>So in love with this, will continue to try different scents in the new collection line.</li>
            <li>Its a good scent that is hard to find.</li>
            <li>Really????</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>When Old Spice determine this was in the Fresh Collection, they meant it.</li>
            <li>but it does compliment my cologne very well.</li>
            <li>so brand loyalty has me spending too much of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>but I much prefer the smell of the Fuji.</li>
            <li>would have given it a 5 except Amazon&#x27;s price keeps changing so much.</li>
            <li>My favorite old spice scent that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s a better scent than my B.O., and it lasts quite a long time--usually through to the next morning, I&#x27;m still smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the newer scents of this particular collection</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I would better describe the scent as: what the flower of a vicious mutant man-eating Venus Fly Trap would smell like if you were ever able to get close enough to smell it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This stuff is expensive, but it lasts all day and smells great.</li>
            <li>And the white sticks work so much better than those clear blue gel ones.</li>
            <li>Old Spice&#x27;s new Fresh Collection currently has 33 5 Star reviews on Amazon.com, so I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>This scent drives the ladies wild!  </li>
            <li>I came here to amazon to see if Old Spice made a body spray or something!</li>
            <li>Really I shower at 10am one day and on the next</li>
            <li>I am considering coming back to this deodorant, but I really wish it wouldn&#x27;t stain my shirts.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice used to be a bit of a cliche when it came to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Old Spice deodorants for a while now.  </li>
            <li>Everything I tried for my active daughter didn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough, until I tried Old Spice Matterhorn.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten numerous compliments while wearing about it, particularly after swimming.</li>
            <li>Not much to say other than this scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and if things went well and the little lady found her self in that general area it would be fresh as the mountain snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was busy all day and when I took out my shirt the following day at 5pm (that&#x27;s 1.5days)</li>
            <li>I also use Old spice red zone.  </li>
            <li>so i would naturally stay with the white stick type.  </li>
            <li>Product is the old standard.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to old spice from degree bc</li>

            <li> I recently switched to old spice from degree bc</li>
            <li> So if you sweat a lot or you are really active then go for old spice zone.  </li>
            <li> Being a 2.6 oz stick, it last quite long.</li>
            <li> I have since switched to an Old Spice deodorant that is a clear stick, but that doesn&#x27;t keep the bad odors at bay for very long (even if this clear stick doesn&#x27;t stain my shirt).  </li>
            <li> Product great - howler delivery was awful - over 3 weeks!!!!</li>

            <li> Sadly its the only deodorant I like to wear anymore. I think its a little overpriced but I am a fan.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else! Love the scent!</li>
            <li> This scent drives the ladies wild!  Plus it offers your underarms a refreshing break from city life with the smell of the Matterhorn.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite between denali and fiji, has a cool and refreshing body to it and the antiperspirant side of these are amazing, during music rehearsals i found myself sweating more than a nun in a brothel but all I could think about was how good I smelt.</li>
            <li> I attribute all my success in life to the subtlety and strength of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does a decent job of fighting sweat. Goes well with Matterhorn body wash.</li>
            <li> The odor is great, sometimes a bit too great and i find myself distracted at how good i smell. Unfortunately i find myself still sweating quite a bit (though i can sweat through any deoderant). This has a great scent but may not prevent wetness</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week, and while I do like the scent I mistakenly believe a female is standing next to me on occasion.  Without getting too personal, I used to wear ladies&#x27; Secret in college because, you know, it was (and perhaps still is?) strong enough for a man.  Yeah, I know it was made for a woman but I wanted to find out if the advertising was legit.  This also reminds me a bit of those days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice before with great results! Old Spice&#x27;s new Fresh Collection currently has 33 5 Star reviews on Amazon.com, so I decided to give it a go. The scent I chose was Matterhorn, and the smell is great. If this was listed as simply a deodorant it would get 4-5 stars for smell alone. Unfortunately it supposed to be an Anti-Perspirant as well and that&#x27;s where it falls short. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my body chemistry or what, but using this makes me sweat profusely from the armpits. It might as well be listed as \\&quot;Deodorant and Perspirant\\&quot; as my armpits have suddenly become Niagara Falls, and the wife (understandably) doesn&#x27;t like it at all. Thankfully Amazon&#x27;s great customer service just refunded me for the item and I will be trying something else in the future.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND, BUT HE DIDN&#x27;T LIKE HOW IT LEAVES THE WHITE STUFF ON THE CLOTHES AND IT DOESN&#x27;T WANT TO COME OFF. IT&#x27; SMELLS GOOD BUT I WILL NOT BE BUYING IT AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Smells nice, not too musky -- very clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Excellent antiperpirant and deoderant.  Scent is not overpowering and does not leave residue or stains. Compact. Travels well.</li>
            <li> Really???? Since when do they make these products this good!! The smell is unbelievable!!!  I smelled it at a store and I was \\&quot;ok, seems good\\&quot; but I do not know how it happens that after an hour or so I start smelling awesome every time I rise my arms!! And it last like 2 days!!! Really I shower at 10am one day and on the next I was busy all day and when I took out my shirt the following day at 5pm (that&#x27;s 1.5days) I smelled like on the first hour!! And my girlfriend loves the smell as well. I can&#x27;t keep her away from my armpits. LOL!!!!    I came here to amazon to see if Old Spice made a body spray or something! I want to smell this good in everywhere not only in my armpits!! And I found it!!    Edit: yes, as some one said, at first the odor confuses you (seems it mught not be so manly) but after you analize it you realize it is for men.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses the Matterhorn scent, I buy it here on Amazon when the price fluctuates down a little(makes it a good deal). He needs a strong deodorant that isn&#x27;t going to quit on him halfway through the day, and this works great. We both love the scent, it&#x27;s very clean and fresh but still has a masculine air about it.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, and my girlfriend loves it.  Therefore, it stays.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant. Maybe the smells like WInd and Freedom tag line got me, but i like it. It comes in a pack of 4 so I left one in my gym bag, work, and a couple at home. good deal.</li>
            <li> My skin had a terrible reaction to this anti antiperspirant. My skin started flaking and got red. It may not be for everyone, but I wanted people to know.</li>
            <li> The reviewer below me is right--my girlfriend thinks I smell like an air freshener. But, it&#x27;s a better scent than my B.O., and it lasts quite a long time--usually through to the next morning, I&#x27;m still smelling fresh. Also, buying in a 4-pack like this saves me both a trip to the store and 5 bucks off what 4 sticks would cost me at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I also use Old spice red zone.  This is not as strong to me as the red zone product line.  So if you sweat a lot or you are really active then go for old spice zone.  The scent smells fresh and would compliment a scent like cool water.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant. It can be hard to find in stores so Amazon came to the rescue with their subscription service. My husband and I both love the smell and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I saw the Old Spice Matterhorn Anti-perspirant and Deodorant  on the Good Morning Show and it was highly recommended for the nice scent and use for either woman or men.  Made for a man, but works for a woman!  Everything I tried for my active daughter didn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough, until I tried Old Spice Matterhorn.  All 3 of my teenagers (2 boys and 1 girl) love this scent and how well the anti-perspirant works. My daughter even convinced her friend to try it, and she is hooked too.  There are not too many deodorants that are suitable for both men and women and youth alike that actually smell pleasant and work well too.  Try this if you are looking for a good deodorant/anti-perspirant!</li>
            <li> Best Old Spice scent ever. It lasts all day on my husband. I love how by the end of the day, I can smell different &amp;#34;tones&amp;#34; in the Matterhorn than at the beginning of the day. I love this scent!!</li>
            <li> Good smell with lasting protection. I have used Old Spice for years and am pleased with the newish scents. They&#x27;re deodorant products work better than the rest. They&#x27;re commercials are great as well.</li>
            <li> my skin always would get irritated by the gel types of deodorants so i would naturally stay with the white stick type.  never had a problem with this brand, smells great, and you can basically leave the top off for the duration of its use and it won&#x27;t go like a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i specifically only buy this smell.</li>
            <li> My son and I love the smell of this deorderant. Like the shower gel I can not believe it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> Trust Terry Crews when he says it is more powerful than the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Now being serious, it is very good, one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Too bad my local store stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Fresh Collection does the job for me in terms of helping to keep my underarm perspiration under good control during periods of high heat and humidity. Plus it does not irritate my skin. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> i love it was very impressed with every thing sent. nice stuff keep it up. well done with the work,</li>
            <li> I love this scent but, regrettably, the white bar leaves my shirts stained.  I have since switched to an Old Spice deodorant that is a clear stick, but that doesn&#x27;t keep the bad odors at bay for very long (even if this clear stick doesn&#x27;t stain my shirt).  I am considering coming back to this deodorant, but I really wish it wouldn&#x27;t stain my shirts.  Ugh.</li>
            <li> Old Spice used to be a bit of a cliche when it came to fragrances.  No more.  I really like this product and it is a truly effective AP/deodorant.  What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but it lasts all day and smells great. Buying it from amazon saves me almost 35%!</li>
            <li> Prepare to smell good</li>
            <li> When Old Spice determine this was in the Fresh Collection, they meant it. This deodorant actually smells somewhat like the outdoors but not musky. I&#x27;m not the best with describing the smell but it does compliment my cologne very well. You might want to go test it out before buying because everyone has different taste obviously. This deodorant is also antiperspirant which not all deodorant is. Being a 2.6 oz stick, it last quite long.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than this scent is fantastic. It straddles the boundary between being strongly scented and overly fragrant. I have gotten numerous compliments while wearing about it, particularly after swimming. For guys that have not smelled it, though the cap reads smells like \\&quot;Ice, Wind and Freedom.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t think that is accurate. It is not a rugged scent. I would better describe the scent as: what the flower of a vicious mutant man-eating Venus Fly Trap would smell like if you were ever able to get close enough to smell it. So sweet it&#x27;s deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really good day time scent. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant is damnnn gddd......Last all day and very refreshing. Very good buy, would recommend to others.. So in love with this, will continue to try different scents in the new collection line.</li>
            <li> Product is the old standard.  Can&#x27;t find in shelf anymore... so brand loyalty has me spending too much of deodorant.  Product great - howler delivery was awful - over 3 weeks!!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE ON TAINT...gootch, or what ever other name you use for the space between you junk and your chocolate factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First date so I decided I really wanted to smell good and if things went well and the little lady found her self in that general area it would be fresh as the mountain snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn out all I got was a rash and a chica that ran out of the house thinking I was full of STD&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it works well under the arm pits and bottom side of your tongue.</li>
            <li> I have been using Old Spice deodorants for a while now.  They smell great, without being overpowering.  And while the scent of this one is not too obvious, I know it&#x27;s working because after 8 hours at work in a factory, I don&#x27;t reek of sweat.</li>
            <li> Its a good scent that is hard to find. Works well for me. I recently switched to old spice from degree bc it so working for me after years</li>
            <li> I get these on Subscribe and Save and I don&#x27;t ever have to pay $5 a can at Target again:)</li>
            <li> Have yet to find a deodorant&#x27;s fragrance I like more than Old Spice Matterhorn. Freedom ain&#x27;t free...It costs 5 bucks!</li>
            <li> My favorite old spice scent that actually works for me. Somewhat bummed out that stores no longer carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the newer scents of this particular collection and they don&#x27;t seem to be as effective in eliminating armpit sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matterhorn has worked for me so I stocked up!</li>
            <li> i have the other scents ,in the fresh collection,and i have to say the other ones smell alot better than the matterhorn,the fiji and denali are the best</li>
            <li> The best deodorant a man can get. Many compliments can be received when using this product, in conjunction with the spray.</li>
            <li> 3/4 broke the first time I tried to twist them up.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen before and have been using this stuff for 10yrs.  Not sure if it&#x27;s referb items or what...</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff, works awesome and smells great. The 4 pack is a great value, much cheaper than buying in a traditional store. And the white sticks work so much better than those clear blue gel ones.</li>
            <li> As far as antiperspirant goes this stuff is fine. I like the way it performs just but I much prefer the smell of the Fuji.</li>
            <li> My favorite solid stick, this works great and smells even better. Hope they always keep this one around..</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! My girlfriend loves it. Give this a shot. This is my favorite old spice scent. 10/10 would buy again!</li>
            <li> great product.  would have given it a 5 except Amazon&#x27;s price keeps changing so much.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on it at first, then my wife hit the nail right on the head.  It smells sweet, she said it was great if I wanted to smell like a 10 year old girl.</li>
            <li> I like the scent, and the price is good. So far this one and the clear version of the best value deodorants I&#x27;ve used in my life.</li>
