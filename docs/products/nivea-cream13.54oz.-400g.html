            <li>I would certainly buy this item again.</li>
            <li>These are large containers of Nivea.</li>

            <li> This cream is just so rich and thick but leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> A decent substitute for La Mer, although the European Nivea is a little more difficult to rub in than La Mer.  </li>
            <li> I use it on flaky, dry psoriasis skin on the days I don&#x27;t use my topical treatment.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;consistency are few and far between .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strange</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d keep the little tin in my pockets to keep my hands from drying out from all the constant washing.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, subtle, does not crack or peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my face and hands during the winter and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily like other creams.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful about what I buy for lotions.</li>
            <li> This has a waxier base and seems to work much better.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for a hand and foot cream, so I usually don&#x27;t run out</li>
            <li> use just a little each time after washing my hands &amp; every morning and night on my feet.</li>
            <li> We knew the sun would be harsh on our skin.</li>
            <li> round because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Nivea soaks in, makes my skin feel better, and has neither of these hated attributes.</li>
            <li> recent blind test comparison trials in Europe Nivea&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look no more than 45-50.</li>
            <li> It is working for me, after a few weeks, skin looks a lot healthier!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed the product, because the ingredients is different that I saw online.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and not runny or watery the way some creams are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also hate moisturizers that sit on the surface, so that when your hands get wet, they reconstitute and make my hands slippery.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of creams for people using this as a base because it is so moisturizing and thick.  </li>
            <li> I hate moisturizers that contain alcohol--</li>

            <li> Great product!!! Its a great bargain, I am really satisfied with this deal and looking forward to do future business again.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed the product, because the ingredients is different that I saw online.</li>
            <li> As an update on this product which I received today: it is the German version.  Nivea Creme sold by German Cosmetics Shop is the real one.  Here are the ingredients:  Aqua, paraffinum liquidum, cera microcristalline, glycerin, lanolin alcohol, paraffin, panthenol, decyl oleate, octyldodecanol, aluminum stearates, citric acid, magnesium sulfate, magnesium stearate, parfum, limonene, geraniol, hydroxycitronellol, linalool, citronellol, benzyl benzoate, cinnamyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Received this item in record time.  The jar is huge.  I am very pleased with my purchase. I would certainly buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for many years. This was one of the best deals that I have ever gotten on this. I&#x27;ll be back when I run out.</li>
            <li> Mother in law couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so was very happy when it came</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it every day after a shower.  These are large containers of Nivea. Precisely what I need. I am from Europe and used  this cream when I grew up there.&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea cans were not packaged very well and arrived dented. Because it was for me and not a gift I kept them but would have preferred a perfect product. This is why I gave it four stars instead than five.</li>
            <li> Pauline and I went to Orlando to see Harry Potter. We knew the sun would be harsh on our skin. We read about Nivea Creme  would keep your skin soft. We both were in the hot sun for around seven hours and we both never got sunburned.  Mostly everyone that went to Universal were all sunburned and Pauline and I was not...it was so amazing how great this creme really is. I love the way it smells on my skin too. From now on I will only use Nivea on my beautiful Native American skin. Our skin stayed so soft the whole time we were in the sun and we we never burned. I will tell all my friends about Nivea. I even put it all over my neck, hands and arms and they never burned either. It is definitely worth the money I paid for it and then some. I would love to do a commercial for Nivea Creme!!!</li>
            <li> I always loved this cream and i am glad i found it on amazon for a good price. I highly reccoment this product. It makes my face glow and keep it moisturized</li>
            <li> This stuff is great in winter with the dryness &amp; cold weather that dries out my hands &amp; makes them crack and peel. I&#x27;ve used this cream for several years now &amp; am not disappointed in how well it works and quickly too. A little goes a long way for a hand and foot cream, so I usually don&#x27;t run out fast.&lt;br /&gt;I use just a little each time after washing my hands &amp; every morning and night on my feet. When I was working as  CNA I&#x27;d keep the little tin in my pockets to keep my hands from drying out from all the constant washing.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just keep a jar of this in the house for my hands and feet year round because it works so well. My skin is soft, subtle, does not crack or peel. This stuff is oily feeling when putting on but absorbs quickly &amp; does not stain my clothes. I am happy with how quickly my skin gets soft after using this and how long it lasts once on my skin. The cream is very thick and not runny or watery the way some creams are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this cream and would recommend to anyone I know, especially if you have cracked hands or feet.</li>
            <li> I hate moisturizers that contain alcohol-- isn&#x27;t that an oxymoron? I also hate moisturizers that sit on the surface, so that when your hands get wet, they reconstitute and make my hands slippery. Nivea soaks in, makes my skin feel better, and has neither of these hated attributes.</li>
            <li> Made In Germany @ Niveas Hamburg plant instead&lt;br /&gt;of the inferior far east resource where the quality and&lt;br /&gt;consistency are few and far between .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On recent blind test comparison trials in Europe Nivea&lt;br /&gt;voted Best face cream over nine of the most expensive&lt;br /&gt;brands on the planet  -  Strange But True  -  PC  -  LA .</li>
            <li> You would be stunned to know that I am almost 70 years old. I look no more than 45-50. The reason?  Nivea Cream.  I began using this Nivea Cream on my once gnarly face nine years ago.  A then and now comparison would lead you to believe I am a real life Bejamin Button. Nivea Cream has given me not only a new lease on life but an appearance that has improved my psychological well being and social life by an unimaginable degree.</li>
            <li> Really good size, the cream is great for hands and body, especially in winter time. It absorbs rapidly and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> This Nivea cream is made in Thailand and not Germany.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s stronger than the bath and body works stuff I also like. This cream is just so rich and thick but leaves no residue. Where I work we have to use finger print scanners which requires your hands to be soft to work right. This is the only hand cream that works well enough to last all day for my work.</li>
            <li> Bought it from German Cosmetics Shop, an Amazon merchant.  It is the European Nivea, which I prefer to the Mexican one sold in drugstores in the US -- more creamy, less oily.  A decent substitute for La Mer, although the European Nivea is a little more difficult to rub in than La Mer.  This costs one-hundredth as much as La Mer...</li>
            <li> My husband hates scented lotions so I have to be very careful about what I buy for lotions. This is super moisturizing and unscented so both of us are happy. Mine was from Germany. I read about recommendations to get a German-made product versus the Thailand-made product. Very happy with purchase. Look for the sellers that offer German version.</li>
            <li> keep skin young fights wrinkles use it every day. I am 81</li>
            <li> I make a lot of creams for people using this as a base because it is so moisturizing and thick.  It is different than that sold In the USA.&lt;br /&gt;Here the primary ingredient is Mineral oil.  This has a waxier base and seems to work much better.  It smells great.  Works great.  No idea why they use a different recipe for the US consumer but, I am happy to order this stuff from anywhere in the world.  It is just the best.</li>
            <li> The jar I got was made in Germany.  This stuff is a wonder cream.  I use it on flaky, dry psoriasis skin on the days I don&#x27;t use my topical treatment.  It moisturizes for hours.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my face and hands during the winter and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily like other creams.  The jar will last my husband and I for many months.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> It is working for me, after a few weeks, skin looks a lot healthier! Highly recommended! Will order more for the whole family!</li>
