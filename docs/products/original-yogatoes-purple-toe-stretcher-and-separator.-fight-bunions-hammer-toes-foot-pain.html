            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap, but I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>

            <li>Love my yoga toes.  </li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s more pain than I thought -</li>
            <li>I love how my feet and toes are adjusting to better form after just 4 days.</li>

            <li>Love the purple color.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Yoga Instructor and teach often on the value of having healthy toes, which lead to healthy ankles, knees and hips.</li>
            <li>Love these, I am a nurse and on my feet 12+ hrs a day.</li>
            <li>Love these...</li>
            <li>I bought these not realizing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk around in them.</li>
            <li>And for $5-$10, foot alignment socks are warmer to wear and more</li>
            <li>Love the cooling effect.</li>
            <li>Love my Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li>Love these Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li>Yes, there are many ways to achieve what this device does (e.g. specialty socks, cotton balls, etc)</li>
            <li>If you practice yoga you will love yoga toes.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Now my feet feel better after 20 - 30 minutes in my &amp;#34;yoga toes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>they would.i do not know if they will be able to correct my problem but giving it a try.</li>
            <li>If you have foot pain, sure, I don&#x27;t see how these could hurt you.</li>
            <li>They feel okay</li>
            <li>and i get a stretch that I truly need, enjoy and look forward too!</li>
            <li>These are wonderful after a long day, very comfortable to wear and the stretch is soothing.</li>
            <li>I was able to manage about 30 minutes the first time, worked my way up to an hour fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my have been stretched by these wonderful items, my feet no longer ache and the arches</li>
            <li>I was able to return the product for a refund promptly and easily.</li>
            <li>they are also kind of fun to squeeze and stretch, my kids find them interesting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have foot problems because I wear really good shoes every day</li>
            <li>Clear gel is attractive and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet sure of the long-term benefits, but at the start, these fit well, and they&#x27;re comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The yogatoes are well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was doing that, I made such great progress with my healing that I decided to up the ante and try something made more specifically for my purpose.</li>
            <li>I could get an equally good stretch for a much lower price by using cheap cosmetic sponges between each toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They keep my foot warmer (which is good) than Yoga Toes because they cover the back of the foot and ankle with warm fabric.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my feet felt great, kind of like the mild soreness you feel after a workout.</li>
            <li>The space between each toe on the Yoga Toes is wider than that on the pedicure separator, which gives my foot more of a stretch, and that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>amazing results after the super HIgh FEndi pumps!!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to wear and easy to clean with running water &amp; soap.</li>
            <li>They are nice material--soft, flexible, and very durable.</li>
            <li>and I liked them so much I am ordering a pair for me.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>By the next evening, they felt great.</li>
            <li>Look for brand names such as Comfy Toes or Happy Feet (or their imitators) - see [</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(There is also a product available for this purpose, [</li>
            <li>I was able to wear these for 1 hour right away without having any pain.  </li>
            <li>I almost got the medium according to the reviews that I read but changed my mind and decided to try the small and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I wear a 7.5/8 and the small fit perfect.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!!</li>
            <li>I look pretty goofy, but they work.  </li>
            <li>Works great after long runs.</li>
            <li>Love YogaToes so much!</li>
            <li>You feel Great Relief for your feet after a long day of walking or standing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty easy to put on and take off and the gel material is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Because our feet is the major connector to our back and hip, it makes perfect sense.</li>
            <li>I thought they were kind of pricey, but they have completely eliminated the cramping in my feet.  </li>
            <li>they really make my feet feel more relaxed after using.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true the socks may need laundering and can eventually wear out (which the Yoga Toes don&#x27;t), I find that I prefer the socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do these two things, you may find that your hammer toes clear up on their own without buying a $40 pair of Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li>feet feel much better, and they look better too - normally spaced toes almost ready for sandals.</li>
            <li>shopped further, and discovered foot alignment socks which are much more reasonably priced (around $5-$10 here on Amazon), and equally effective for me.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone, whether you have foot problems or just want to make your feet feel better!</li>
            <li>Very well made and fit like a glove.</li>
            <li>I use my pedicure socks (open toe area) to keep my feet warm while using the YogaToes.</li>
            <li>The YogaToes have helped me realize I need to be more conscious about activating my toes when I am standing, and this has also played a role in my new-found foot health.</li>
            <li>I thought these Yoga Toes looked like a fun way to stretch out my toes and they are really fun.</li>
            <li>Stretching the toes, as with other parts of the body, does feel good; but of course must be repeated.</li>
            <li>You will like these if you get the right size.</li>
            <li>I wear them for about 15-45 minutes a day, either in bed right before sleep, or sometimes during the day when I&#x27;m working from home.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>, I think it fits just right.</li>
            <li>lost my orginal ones love these, they are a little bigger, but still work great</li>
            <li>The material feels good and smooth but it is too thick for my toes.  </li>
            <li>Finally, to get the right amount of stretch, be sure to use the chart and order based on your shoe size.  </li>
            <li>first helps a lot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe her until I tried these for the first time almost as soon as I received them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend YogaToes!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying yoga toes..love em.  </li>
            <li>I spray them with water first to make them easier to put on.</li>
            <li>and it works fast!</li>
            <li>However, considering that the Yoga Toes are priced at appx $40 per pair, they&#x27;re not enough better than the pedicure toe separator to justify the exorbitantly higher price.</li>
            <li>I wore them for about 15 minutes the first time, then about 30 minutes while reading in bed.</li>
            <li>At first when I was getting used to them, they hurt my toes.  </li>
            <li>Overall, just ok.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>Very soothing for my toes!</li>
            <li>Slip them on while I do my meditation and get the benefits of a foot stretch and my &amp;#34;mindful time&amp;#34; Great way to wind down after busy ER shift on my feet.</li>
            <li>At first I was surprised at the large spaces between toes, but it is easier to fit them over time.</li>
            <li>Initially, I feel pain while using it, but it is a good kind of pain than tends to relieve other deep seated pains.</li>
            <li>I get frequent toe/foot cramps and have mild bunions, so I was definitely interested in trying this</li>
            <li>These have changed my life in a positive way.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this out on my feet, I felt like my feet were refreshed and ready to go again.</li>
            <li>my toes are pretty straight, buti was stil hoping to feel some stretching and relief, and I did not.</li>
            <li>A few friends of mine suggested them and I&#x27;m so glad I bought them and gave them a try!</li>
            <li>It really is relaxing and helps foot aches and pains.</li>
            <li>and and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li>The Yoga Toes really seem to be beneficial for my feet and my feet problems.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get the yoga toes wet</li>
            <li>I have had bunions my whole life.</li>
            <li>Really retrains my hammer toes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend YogaToes for any lower body issues!</li>
            <li>I really like using these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Yogatoes!</li>
            <li>They also REALLY make your toes spread.</li>
            <li>It really hurts my toes.</li>
            <li>These really helped my feet.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>make my tired feet happy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but this is a very convenient and hygienic way to get the results.</li>
            <li>these are great for tired smashed up feet,&lt;br</li>
            <li>really think they are helping my hammer toe.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t spend much time on my feet.</li>
            <li>Wearing the yoga toes really relaxes my feet.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps to relax and stretch out the toes.</li>
            <li>I felt these were very overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li>Not only have YogaToes helped with circulation in my right leg, but I got the added benefit of better hip and back alignment.</li>
            <li>Its kind of hard to explain and its hard to tell from the picture, but on the outer edge of the big toe and outer edge of the pinky toe, the top and bottom are not connected so the edges just kind of flop around, get caught on things, and dont always stay in place.</li>
            <li>The spacers are pretty large to fit between your toes, and don&#x27;t stay on the little toes very well.  </li>
            <li>feeling by any means, and I made sure to order the smaller size even though my shoe size says I could wear the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Made in the USA is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them almost every day for a few months, I can tell my feet are much stronger and more flexible.</li>
            <li>However, loose, fluffy-type socks WILL fit over this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone who is on their feet a lot; I am also a runner and these help with keeping my feet conditioned for that as well.</li>
            <li>Also, my daughter can wear her high heels again without pain.</li>
            <li>This has been working really well for me, and my smaller bunion vanished completely, while the larger one shrunk substantially and most of the pain went away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend YogaToes.</li>
            <li>They arent super sticky or anything, and dont really attract hair and dust as much as I was led to believe from other reviews.</li>
            <li>so far I believe these really do work I have recommended them to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I initially had a lot of trepidation about purchasing these, but it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good quality, fun color, hard to put on the first few times!  </li>
            <li>I have had these before just needed new ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them about 5 times already in the last 4 days and feel I have got to know them pretty well during the trial period.</li>
            <li>for hammer toes, 1) Avoid wearing shoes that don&#x27;t have a back on them to hug the heel (ie, avoid flip-flops, backless clogs, Birkenstocks, etc), and 2) Also make sure you buy shoes with a big enough toe box.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the first products I purchased that actually worked.</li>
            <li>High quality, durable they work well.&lt;br /&gt;Silicone rubber plastic is very flexible yet rid enough to</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have also just recently had surgery on my feet, my toes aren&#x27;t as straight as I wish they were.</li>
            <li>in them, don&#x27;t plan on going far.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble inserting my toes, perhaps because I have Five Fingers that I wear for rocky beaches, and compared to those these YogaToes are a cakewalk.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the pain from not being able to walk on them - at least for me - makes this a solid 4-star.</li>
            <li>This product seemed kind of weird and gimmicky, but I am pleased wiht the purchase and recommend Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li>This are a might more trouble to get into than socks and rather rigid in individual sizing.  </li>
            <li>The materials are high quality and has no strange smells whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I originally bought YogaToes to help with poor circulation in my right leg.</li>
            <li>A very tight fit but does do the job.  </li>
            <li>Using the YogaToes to stretch out my feet has seriously improved the health of my feet, which just makes life better.</li>
            <li>Extra small would have been better for me.  </li>
            <li>giving them two stars because if you really want to sit back and give your toes a BIG stretch than you will probably like these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure these really do much for my toes, I guess my feet feel little bit better after wearing them</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to but fine for long term</li>
            <li>I bought these yoga toes because I do a lot of Latin dancing which requires me to be on the balls of my feet in high heels for 3 hours at a time consequently, my toes are sometimes sore after a long night of salsa dancing.</li>
            <li>The pros of this product: I wear a 7.5 or 8 and these fit just fine, I dont find them difficult to put on (but if you do then just get them wet like they suggest, to help them slip on).</li>
            <li>When your toes are not straight this is a real problem.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of tight fitting shoes and don&#x27;t have any health issues with my feet, but they do tend to get sore often because I do a little bit of barefoot excercising.</li>
            <li>A little about me first: I&#x27;m 26</li>
            <li>I tried them for only 5 minutes (quickly realizing I couldn&#x27;t walk in them) and after that small amount of time my toes were aching.</li>
            <li>For the price I at least expected them to come in a case I could store them in, but they just came in cheap flimsy clear plastic.</li>
            <li>Misplaced my first pair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;YogaToes are designed to stretch the toes, provide greater circulation to the feet, and improve common foot conditions such as bunions, hammer toes, and other types of pain.  </li>
            <li>I now use my yoga toes the night and morning after dancing and I noticed that my toes are much less sore afterwards and they recover much quicker.</li>
            <li>They are very helpful to my bunion and the redness and swelling is considerably less.</li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;m on the tighter side for the Small size, but I wear them only for 15 min at a time right now.</li>

            <li> So I love how they stretch my toes and straight them and even them out and all that great stuff that you need for great yoga toes.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheap, but I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> and once you get the right fit, extremely good for having happy toes and feet.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> Love my yoga toes.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried them you really need to, your feet will be happy</li>
            <li> Love this yogitoes that I got as a Xmas gift, hence no verified purchase.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more pain than I thought -</li>
            <li> I love how my feet and toes are adjusting to better form after just 4 days.</li>
            <li> I think it might be helping because the nerve pain seems to be better.  </li>
            <li> Love the purple color.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Yoga Instructor and teach often on the value of having healthy toes, which lead to healthy ankles, knees and hips.</li>
            <li> Love these, I am a nurse and on my feet 12+ hrs a day.</li>
            <li> Love these...</li>
            <li> I bought these not realizing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk around in them.</li>
            <li> And for $5-$10, foot alignment socks are warmer to wear and more</li>
            <li> Love the cooling effect.</li>
            <li> Love my Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> Love these Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> Yes, there are many ways to achieve what this device does (e.g. specialty socks, cotton balls, etc)</li>
            <li> If you practice yoga you will love yoga toes.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Now my feet feel better after 20 - 30 minutes in my &amp;#34;yoga toes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> they would.i do not know if they will be able to correct my problem but giving it a try.</li>
            <li> If you have foot pain, sure, I don&#x27;t see how these could hurt you.</li>
            <li> They feel okay</li>
            <li> and i get a stretch that I truly need, enjoy and look forward too!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful after a long day, very comfortable to wear and the stretch is soothing.</li>
            <li> I was able to manage about 30 minutes the first time, worked my way up to an hour fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my have been stretched by these wonderful items, my feet no longer ache and the arches</li>
            <li> I was able to return the product for a refund promptly and easily.</li>
            <li> they are also kind of fun to squeeze and stretch, my kids find them interesting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have foot problems because I wear really good shoes every day</li>
            <li> Clear gel is attractive and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet sure of the long-term benefits, but at the start, these fit well, and they&#x27;re comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The yogatoes are well made and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was doing that, I made such great progress with my healing that I decided to up the ante and try something made more specifically for my purpose.</li>
            <li> I could get an equally good stretch for a much lower price by using cheap cosmetic sponges between each toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They keep my foot warmer (which is good) than Yoga Toes because they cover the back of the foot and ankle with warm fabric.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my feet felt great, kind of like the mild soreness you feel after a workout.</li>
            <li> The space between each toe on the Yoga Toes is wider than that on the pedicure separator, which gives my foot more of a stretch, and that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> amazing results after the super HIgh FEndi pumps!!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to wear and easy to clean with running water &amp; soap.</li>
            <li> They are nice material--soft, flexible, and very durable.</li>
            <li> and I liked them so much I am ordering a pair for me.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> By the next evening, they felt great.</li>
            <li> Look for brand names such as Comfy Toes or Happy Feet (or their imitators) - see [</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (There is also a product available for this purpose, [</li>
            <li> I was able to wear these for 1 hour right away without having any pain.  </li>
            <li> I almost got the medium according to the reviews that I read but changed my mind and decided to try the small and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wear a 7.5/8 and the small fit perfect.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!!</li>
            <li> I look pretty goofy, but they work.  </li>
            <li> Works great after long runs.</li>
            <li> Love YogaToes so much!</li>
            <li> You feel Great Relief for your feet after a long day of walking or standing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty easy to put on and take off and the gel material is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Because our feet is the major connector to our back and hip, it makes perfect sense.</li>
            <li> I thought they were kind of pricey, but they have completely eliminated the cramping in my feet.  </li>
            <li> they really make my feet feel more relaxed after using.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true the socks may need laundering and can eventually wear out (which the Yoga Toes don&#x27;t), I find that I prefer the socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do these two things, you may find that your hammer toes clear up on their own without buying a $40 pair of Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> feet feel much better, and they look better too - normally spaced toes almost ready for sandals.</li>
            <li> shopped further, and discovered foot alignment socks which are much more reasonably priced (around $5-$10 here on Amazon), and equally effective for me.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone, whether you have foot problems or just want to make your feet feel better!</li>
            <li> Very well made and fit like a glove.</li>
            <li> I use my pedicure socks (open toe area) to keep my feet warm while using the YogaToes.</li>
            <li> The YogaToes have helped me realize I need to be more conscious about activating my toes when I am standing, and this has also played a role in my new-found foot health.</li>
            <li> I thought these Yoga Toes looked like a fun way to stretch out my toes and they are really fun.</li>
            <li> Stretching the toes, as with other parts of the body, does feel good; but of course must be repeated.</li>
            <li> You will like these if you get the right size.</li>
            <li> I wear them for about 15-45 minutes a day, either in bed right before sleep, or sometimes during the day when I&#x27;m working from home.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> , I think it fits just right.</li>
            <li> lost my orginal ones love these, they are a little bigger, but still work great</li>
            <li> The material feels good and smooth but it is too thick for my toes.  </li>
            <li> Finally, to get the right amount of stretch, be sure to use the chart and order based on your shoe size.  </li>
            <li> first helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe her until I tried these for the first time almost as soon as I received them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend YogaToes!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying yoga toes..love em.  </li>
            <li> I spray them with water first to make them easier to put on.</li>
            <li> and it works fast!</li>
            <li> However, considering that the Yoga Toes are priced at appx $40 per pair, they&#x27;re not enough better than the pedicure toe separator to justify the exorbitantly higher price.</li>
            <li> I wore them for about 15 minutes the first time, then about 30 minutes while reading in bed.</li>
            <li> At first when I was getting used to them, they hurt my toes.  </li>
            <li> Overall, just ok.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> It really does what it claims to do!  </li>
            <li> Very soothing for my toes!</li>
            <li> Slip them on while I do my meditation and get the benefits of a foot stretch and my &amp;#34;mindful time&amp;#34; Great way to wind down after busy ER shift on my feet.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised at the large spaces between toes, but it is easier to fit them over time.</li>
            <li> Initially, I feel pain while using it, but it is a good kind of pain than tends to relieve other deep seated pains.</li>
            <li> I get frequent toe/foot cramps and have mild bunions, so I was definitely interested in trying this</li>
            <li> These have changed my life in a positive way.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this out on my feet, I felt like my feet were refreshed and ready to go again.</li>
            <li> my toes are pretty straight, buti was stil hoping to feel some stretching and relief, and I did not.</li>
            <li> A few friends of mine suggested them and I&#x27;m so glad I bought them and gave them a try!</li>
            <li> It really is relaxing and helps foot aches and pains.</li>
            <li> and and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> The Yoga Toes really seem to be beneficial for my feet and my feet problems.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get the yoga toes wet</li>
            <li> I have had bunions my whole life.</li>
            <li> Really retrains my hammer toes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend YogaToes for any lower body issues!</li>
            <li> I really like using these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Yogatoes!</li>
            <li> They also REALLY make your toes spread.</li>
            <li> It really hurts my toes.</li>
            <li> These really helped my feet.  </li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> make my tired feet happy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but this is a very convenient and hygienic way to get the results.</li>
            <li> these are great for tired smashed up feet,&lt;br</li>
            <li> really think they are helping my hammer toe.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t spend much time on my feet.</li>
            <li> Wearing the yoga toes really relaxes my feet.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps to relax and stretch out the toes.</li>
            <li> I felt these were very overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li> Not only have YogaToes helped with circulation in my right leg, but I got the added benefit of better hip and back alignment.</li>
            <li> Its kind of hard to explain and its hard to tell from the picture, but on the outer edge of the big toe and outer edge of the pinky toe, the top and bottom are not connected so the edges just kind of flop around, get caught on things, and dont always stay in place.</li>
            <li> The spacers are pretty large to fit between your toes, and don&#x27;t stay on the little toes very well.  </li>
            <li> feeling by any means, and I made sure to order the smaller size even though my shoe size says I could wear the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Made in the USA is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them almost every day for a few months, I can tell my feet are much stronger and more flexible.</li>
            <li> However, loose, fluffy-type socks WILL fit over this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone who is on their feet a lot; I am also a runner and these help with keeping my feet conditioned for that as well.</li>
            <li> Also, my daughter can wear her high heels again without pain.</li>
            <li> This has been working really well for me, and my smaller bunion vanished completely, while the larger one shrunk substantially and most of the pain went away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend YogaToes.</li>
            <li> They arent super sticky or anything, and dont really attract hair and dust as much as I was led to believe from other reviews.</li>
            <li> so far I believe these really do work I have recommended them to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I initially had a lot of trepidation about purchasing these, but it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fun color, hard to put on the first few times!  </li>
            <li> I have had these before just needed new ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them about 5 times already in the last 4 days and feel I have got to know them pretty well during the trial period.</li>
            <li> for hammer toes, 1) Avoid wearing shoes that don&#x27;t have a back on them to hug the heel (ie, avoid flip-flops, backless clogs, Birkenstocks, etc), and 2) Also make sure you buy shoes with a big enough toe box.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the first products I purchased that actually worked.</li>
            <li> High quality, durable they work well.&lt;br /&gt;Silicone rubber plastic is very flexible yet rid enough to</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have also just recently had surgery on my feet, my toes aren&#x27;t as straight as I wish they were.</li>
            <li> in them, don&#x27;t plan on going far.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble inserting my toes, perhaps because I have Five Fingers that I wear for rocky beaches, and compared to those these YogaToes are a cakewalk.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the pain from not being able to walk on them - at least for me - makes this a solid 4-star.</li>
            <li> This product seemed kind of weird and gimmicky, but I am pleased wiht the purchase and recommend Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> This are a might more trouble to get into than socks and rather rigid in individual sizing.  </li>
            <li> The materials are high quality and has no strange smells whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I originally bought YogaToes to help with poor circulation in my right leg.</li>
            <li> A very tight fit but does do the job.  </li>
            <li> Using the YogaToes to stretch out my feet has seriously improved the health of my feet, which just makes life better.</li>
            <li> Extra small would have been better for me.  </li>
            <li> giving them two stars because if you really want to sit back and give your toes a BIG stretch than you will probably like these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these really do much for my toes, I guess my feet feel little bit better after wearing them</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but fine for long term</li>
            <li> I bought these yoga toes because I do a lot of Latin dancing which requires me to be on the balls of my feet in high heels for 3 hours at a time consequently, my toes are sometimes sore after a long night of salsa dancing.</li>
            <li> The pros of this product: I wear a 7.5 or 8 and these fit just fine, I dont find them difficult to put on (but if you do then just get them wet like they suggest, to help them slip on).</li>
            <li> When your toes are not straight this is a real problem.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wear a lot of tight fitting shoes and don&#x27;t have any health issues with my feet, but they do tend to get sore often because I do a little bit of barefoot excercising.</li>
            <li> A little about me first: I&#x27;m 26</li>
            <li> I tried them for only 5 minutes (quickly realizing I couldn&#x27;t walk in them) and after that small amount of time my toes were aching.</li>
            <li> For the price I at least expected them to come in a case I could store them in, but they just came in cheap flimsy clear plastic.</li>
            <li> Misplaced my first pair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;YogaToes are designed to stretch the toes, provide greater circulation to the feet, and improve common foot conditions such as bunions, hammer toes, and other types of pain.  </li>
            <li> I now use my yoga toes the night and morning after dancing and I noticed that my toes are much less sore afterwards and they recover much quicker.</li>
            <li> They are very helpful to my bunion and the redness and swelling is considerably less.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m on the tighter side for the Small size, but I wear them only for 15 min at a time right now.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks of wearing them consistently, I am back to running (more like a slow trot).  </li>
            <li> After using these for a few days, I notice I have less and less pains on my feet, even when standing up most of the day doing chores.</li>
            <li> little tricky to get on (take the advice in the instructions and get your toes wet first - makes a big difference.)</li>
            <li> Definitely have to start wearing them for short period of time and they can be hard to get on at first, but with a bit of use you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely feel not just my toes, but the feet being  stretched.</li>
            <li> At first, I was only able to wear my YogaToes for a short period of time, and trying to walk in them was painful!  </li>
            <li> It was very uncomfortable, not a \\&quot;nice stretch\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is TOUGH LOVE for the cramped-up toe: be prepared to try it a little at a time to get your toes used to the stretch.</li>
            <li> The silicone material they are made out of is stretchy but yet very tough at the same time, they are very durable and wont tear or get stretched out not matter how much you pull on them, they will certainly last.</li>
            <li> When I got them a few months ago I started out wearing them for 15 minutes a day when I got home from work, and I gradually increased the time I wear them to up to an hour, depending on how long I can sit in one place.&lt;br /&gt;The material is high quality, so even when I yank and pull at them to get them on my toes</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I cannot sleep in them, but that is not possible because of the open ends and the gel material itself catching on fabric.</li>
            <li> In the evening, I sit down with a book or a TV show or a conversation with my husband (who is much amused by them) and wear them for an hour to an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I wore them, it hurt a little.</li>
            <li> They have helped my feet and stretched my toes.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 8 shoe and while my feet are not considered &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; they&#x27;re far from narrow.  </li>
            <li> I still think they help in the long run for hammer toe, bunions, and in my case Turf Toe pain.</li>
            <li> anyone on their feet for long period of times.</li>
            <li> They stretch your achy feet out after a long day in heels!</li>
            <li> I tried without lotion on dry feet</li>
            <li> Might work for some people but too large to fit through my little toe and painful.  </li>
            <li> It was a little hard at first to get them on my toes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re impossible to sleep with, they roll off as soon as the top sheet touches them.</li>
            <li> However, a $1 product from my local drugstore has proven to do everything they do, and for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> My sister showed me hers when I was visiting a few months ago and showed me how they go on the toes, and then explained how relaxed they made her feet and such.</li>
            <li> They really help with tired feet/arches and to relieve calf cramps.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to slipping on my YogaToes.</li>
            <li> They feel ver ygood and stretch and spread my toes wide.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on these when there are cheaper versions of basically the same thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The YogaToes can be a little difficult to slip on, but dampening them helps significantly.  </li>
            <li> They were only a little uncomfortable the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> If you have long narrow feet, order the extra small -</li>
            <li> See my other review for the extra small size.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this would do what it says it does, but it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I ordered the small and that was WAY to big for my toes.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these as she does her other exercises, so she gets a 2 for 1 experience.  </li>
            <li> Due to an illness she has lost the feeling in her feet, but the &amp;#34;toes&amp;#34; have made a difference in the shape of her feet.</li>
            <li> After a little bit I made my toes wet and BINGO.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I put them on at night, when I sit down to watch TV/read.</li>
            <li> I pop them on when I&#x27;m sitting down reading or watching TV.</li>
            <li> Too wide, too stiff.</li>
            <li> I have slight bunions.  </li>
            <li> Using these for half an hour after a shower at night is working wonders to relieve my pains.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my feet and my toes are a mess.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly; however, the material is very hard and difficult to get on my toes.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to,  but once you are it relaxes my feet after work.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed and dried them before use and also put on lotion all over my feet to make it easier to &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; them on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that done too a few years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They did not fit on my toes and would not have worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my Yoga Toes everyday</li>
            <li> As a result of bunions, my big toes have &amp;#34;migrated&amp;#34; uncomfortably inward, crowding the other toes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure they&#x27;re working (to straighten out my misaligned toe), but figure the old adage of &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; must be at work as they do become uncomfortable after having them on for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I guess your toes have to be in pretty bad shape for you to feel anything.</li>
            <li> At first it was painful, but now my feet are used to it</li>
            <li> A little hard to get on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how else to explain how I feel about YogaToes.</li>
            <li> They make a big difference if my feet are tired!</li>
            <li> The description says they are small for women&#x27;s size 7.5-11</li>
            <li> I wear a size 9 AAAA and ordered the extra small after these were too difficult to use because of my toe spread.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks they are straighter and I can spread all my toes again!</li>
            <li> I wear a size 9 show and a small fits</li>
            <li> and I have the size small</li>
            <li> and I bought the small size.</li>
            <li> No more foot cramps.</li>
            <li> too big and a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> The only possible downside I see to this product is that it&#x27;s tough to wear them in winter--my feet get cold!  </li>
            <li> and it was hard to get them in so some foot lotion</li>
            <li> Hard to get on.  </li>
            <li> Hoping to avoid (or at least defer) surgery, I decided to try these (with my Doc&#x27;s blessing).  </li>
            <li> I do use them at least five or six days a week.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t work for me due to rheumatoid arthritis in my feet.</li>
            <li> do not start to tense up.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to put on</li>
            <li> After several times of use, my toes hurt so badly that I gave up.</li>
            <li> They suck so bad that I will write a second review.</li>
            <li> I wear heels quite often and started getting painful cramps that would last for 10+ minutes in the arches of my feet.  </li>
            <li> Im not good about using them as often as I&#x27;d like, but they work well when I do use them.</li>
            <li> Walking--while a bit awkward due to the size of the YogaToes--is not at all painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little awkward to get used to</li>
            <li> It has been broken and just won&#x27;t stretch.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find these painful or even uncomfortable to wear, and I can walk around with them on if I need to or leave them on for as long as I feel like.</li>
            <li> In the beginning they were uncomfortable to wear, but over time my feet and toes got used to them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this second pair for a friend, she hated them too!</li>
            <li> My feet also unfortunately still hurt where my bunion used to be.</li>
            <li> I try to sleep in them, but I wake up uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Once tried I felt uncomfortable returning them.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to get on.  </li>
            <li> However, they are difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they were for someone that is a size 10 :(</li>
            <li> (instead of the usual awful pain when my feet hit the floor in the morning)</li>
            <li> Very difficult to put on.  </li>
            <li> Almost impossible to put them on my toes.</li>
            <li> I did expect that they would be painful</li>
            <li> Stuck with something to painful to wear.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> the cons: I was disappointed in the fact that on both ends, the sides are not connected.</li>
            <li> I assume they did that to make them easier to put on and take off, but I just find that feature annoying.</li>
            <li> It is painful to walk in them even if it&#x27;s just to go to the kitchen to get a cuppa tea!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been having horrific cramps in both feet along with pain from a bunion.</li>
            <li> All together the product cost me $70 which is insane.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a wonderful invention!  I have arthritis in my feet and my toes are a mess.  This is a great way to relax my toes and spread them (which I could no longer do on my own).  Now I sit and relax in my recliner while I read and my toes get a workout.</li>
            <li> Second pair I have bought. Love them.  Wish I could sleep in them, but since I cant thats why I bough the foot alignment socks.</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised at the large spaces between toes, but it is easier to fit them over time. They have helped my feet and stretched my toes.</li>
            <li> Great idea, relaxing and helps with bunions.</li>
            <li> Item is as described.  I like the stretch they give my toes.  Easy to use, to put on and take off.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My toes/feet feel amazing after using these!</li>
            <li> Product supplied as advertised in the correct time frame.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely.  After several times of use, my toes hurt so badly that I gave up.</li>
            <li> Love my yoga toes.  Takes a little getting used to,  but once you are it relaxes my feet after work.  If you haven&#x27;t tried them you really need to, your feet will be happy</li>
            <li> I wear heels quite often and started getting painful cramps that would last for 10+ minutes in the arches of my feet.  I went to my chiropractor and he recommended YogaToes.  I thought they were kind of pricey, but they have completely eliminated the cramping in my feet.  In the beginning they were uncomfortable to wear, but over time my feet and toes got used to them.  I wear them as often as possible (watching movies, working at my desk, painting my toes, etc.).  They are nice material--soft, flexible, and very durable.</li>
            <li> Love this yogitoes that I got as a Xmas gift, hence no verified purchase. I&#x27;ve tried them about 5 times already in the last 4 days and feel I have got to know them pretty well during the trial period. They do look slightly different than the photo. I rinsed and dried them before use and also put on lotion all over my feet to make it easier to &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; them on. I tried without lotion on dry feet and it was hard to get them in so some foot lotion first helps a lot. So I love how they stretch my toes and straight them and even them out and all that great stuff that you need for great yoga toes. What I didn&#x27;t anticipate is that you just can&#x27;t walk in them. It is painful to walk in them even if it&#x27;s just to go to the kitchen to get a cuppa tea! So you need to wear them when you are sitting. I did expect that they would be painful but it&#x27;s more pain than I thought - I wear shoe size 7.5 (37-38 European size I think) so maybe I&#x27;m on the tighter side for the Small size, but I wear them only for 15 min at a time right now. I love how my feet and toes are adjusting to better form after just 4 days. I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the pain from not being able to walk on them - at least for me - makes this a solid 4-star.</li>
            <li> They suck so bad that I will write a second review. I bought this second pair for a friend, she hated them too!</li>
            <li> Wow. Wow. Wow. I&#x27;m not sure how else to explain how I feel about YogaToes. My sister showed me hers when I was visiting a few months ago and showed me how they go on the toes, and then explained how relaxed they made her feet and such. I didn&#x27;t believe her until I tried these for the first time almost as soon as I received them. My toes feel great. My feet feel great. It really is relaxing and helps foot aches and pains. I highly recommend YogaToes!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying yoga toes..love em.  I do have one suggestion though.  I wear a size 8 shoe and while my feet are not considered &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; they&#x27;re far from narrow.  I almost got the medium according to the reviews that I read but changed my mind and decided to try the small and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the yogatoes for my daughter and I liked them so much I am ordering a pair for me.</li>
            <li> My foot doctor recommended the Yoga Toes to perhaps correct some crooked toes&lt;br /&gt;issues instead of surgery. By the way surgery does not work for hammertoes I had&lt;br /&gt;that done too a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The Yoga Toes are not meant for people who have had foot surgery in their past.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Yoga Toes over a period of two months had bruising show up each month.&lt;br /&gt;It would take weeks to get over the bruising plus had to limit walking for exercise&lt;br /&gt;until the bruising healed, etc. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a gift after having a pair for a while myself.  They really help with tired feet/arches and to relieve calf cramps.  Definitely have to start wearing them for short period of time and they can be hard to get on at first, but with a bit of use you get used to it.  They make a big difference if my feet are tired!</li>
            <li> I was able to wear these for 1 hour right away without having any pain.  I try to wear them 2-3 times a day for 1 hour because of my bunions and nerve pain in my toes.  I think it might be helping because the nerve pain seems to be better.  Love the purple color.</li>
            <li> I look pretty goofy, but they work.  My feet aren&#x27;t as sore as they used to be.  I just put them on and watch TV!</li>
            <li> The yoga toes work just like ther&#x27;er supposed to and and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> The Yoga Toes really seem to be beneficial for my feet and my feet problems.  I am disappointed that I cannot sleep in them, but that is not possible because of the open ends and the gel material itself catching on fabric.</li>
            <li> lost my orginal ones love these, they are a little bigger, but still work great</li>
            <li> amazing results after the super HIgh FEndi pumps!!!</li>
            <li> I wear them about 15 minutes at a time. I heard they are good for me, time will tell!</li>
            <li> I bought these yoga toes because I do a lot of Latin dancing which requires me to be on the balls of my feet in high heels for 3 hours at a time consequently, my toes are sometimes sore after a long night of salsa dancing. I now use my yoga toes the night and morning after dancing and I noticed that my toes are much less sore afterwards and they recover much quicker. Be sure to get the yoga toes wet so they will glide on nicely. I highly recommend these for anyone who is on their feet a lot; I am also a runner and these help with keeping my feet conditioned for that as well.</li>
            <li> I wear heels almost every day and these help with the pain at night and helps separate them.  At first it was painful, but now my feet are used to it and I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The sizing is off.  The description says they are small for women&#x27;s size 7.5-11 but when I got the yoga toes in the mail, the packaging said size 6-9.  Unfortunately, they were for someone that is a size 10 :(</li>
            <li> love these, great for laying around watching TV, easy to use, can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I have had bunions my whole life. I have also just recently had surgery on my feet, my toes aren&#x27;t as straight as I wish they were. My feet also unfortunately still hurt where my bunion used to be. I also have a standing job where I&#x27;m standing all day. When I first tried this out on my feet, I felt like my feet were refreshed and ready to go again. Loving it so far!!</li>
            <li> They did not fit on my toes and would not have worked for me.  Very difficult to put on.  Would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> If you have long narrow feet, order the extra small - I wear a size 9 AAAA and ordered the extra small after these were too difficult to use because of my toe spread. Great concept and once you get the right fit, extremely good for having happy toes and feet. See my other review for the extra small size. You will like these if you get the right size.</li>
            <li> Im not good about using them as often as I&#x27;d like, but they work well when I do use them.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist recommended these and they have been very effective.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this would do what it says it does, but it actually worked. Within a week of using it I saw results. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love these. Misplaced my first pair. Really retrains my hammer toes. Also, I have had bunion surgery on both feet. My big toes like to turn inward. After a few weeks they are straighter and I can spread all my toes again!</li>
            <li> After being on my feet for 8 hours a day, it&#x27;s such a pleasure to put these on. My feet seem to be very happy!</li>
            <li> I originally bought YogaToes to help with poor circulation in my right leg. I was in a car accident years ago and have had back issues since then. Not only have YogaToes helped with circulation in my right leg, but I got the added benefit of better hip and back alignment. Because our feet is the major connector to our back and hip, it makes perfect sense. I highly recommend YogaToes for any lower body issues!</li>
            <li> Wish I had found them years ago !</li>
            <li> I like those YogaToes. They relax your feet and after 30 Min, or longer, when you take them off, your toes stay for awhile separated. I&#x27;m a Yoga Instructor and teach often on the value of having healthy toes, which lead to healthy ankles, knees and hips. Great value, a bit pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li> A little hard to get on.</li>
            <li> Not sure they&#x27;re working (to straighten out my misaligned toe), but figure the old adage of &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; must be at work as they do become uncomfortable after having them on for about 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 3 weeks and have no noticeable difference. I put them on at night, when I sit down to watch TV/read. They&#x27;re impossible to sleep with, they roll off as soon as the top sheet touches them.</li>
            <li> A very tight fit but does do the job.  Takes a little getting used to but fine for long term</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet sure of the long-term benefits, but at the start, these fit well, and they&#x27;re comfortable.  I wear them for about 15-45 minutes a day, either in bed right before sleep, or sometimes during the day when I&#x27;m working from home.  They do make my feet feel refreshed, and I&#x27;m hoping to see a reduction in my bunions over time.</li>
            <li> These feel really great on my feet!</li>
            <li> Love these, I am a nurse and on my feet 12+ hrs a day. I have bunions and plantar fasciitis and a lot of pain in both feet. These are wonderful after a long day, very comfortable to wear and the stretch is soothing. Would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feel great.  They are helping my hammer toe. They were only a little uncomfortable the first time I used them.  By the next evening, they felt great.</li>
            <li> Great stretches, helps my feet to feel better.</li>
            <li> Love these...they really make my feet feel more relaxed after using.  I spray them with water first to make them easier to put on.</li>
            <li> These hurt like hell when you have them on.  I try to sleep in them, but I wake up uncomfortable.  I guess my feet aren&#x27;t made for these.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 9 show and a small fits just right. I&#x27;m happy with the yoga toes.</li>
            <li> As a result of bunions, my big toes have &amp;#34;migrated&amp;#34; uncomfortably inward, crowding the other toes.  Hoping to avoid (or at least defer) surgery, I decided to try these (with my Doc&#x27;s blessing).  I do use them at least five or six days a week.  In the evening, I sit down with a book or a TV show or a conversation with my husband (who is much amused by them) and wear them for an hour to an hour and a half.  While it is possible to walk (hobble?) in them, don&#x27;t plan on going far.  I have no trouble inserting my toes, perhaps because I have Five Fingers that I wear for rocky beaches, and compared to those these YogaToes are a cakewalk.  Start with your big toe and work outward.  No problem.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard at first to get them on my toes. After a little bit I made my toes wet and BINGO. I try to use them every night.. They feel good and my toes say: Thank you.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> AAAHHHHHHHH! Just cream your toes and slip them on.</li>
            <li> Yoga Toes are absolutely wonderful!  They help relieve my foot pain from bunions and plantar fasciitis.  My nursing friend bought a pair and thinks they&#x27;re great.  Also, my daughter can wear her high heels again without pain.</li>
            <li> Extra small would have been better for me.  I am a women 6.5</li>
            <li> I have had these before just needed new ones. I really like using these.</li>
            <li> I have been having horrific cramps in both feet along with pain from a bunion. I have been using my Yoga Toes everyday and I have noticed a decline in the number of foot cramps.  Seems to be working!</li>
            <li> i never thought that separating your toes could feel so good. Ive done it every night since i bought them and thats going on two weeks now. my feet feel great</li>
            <li> If you suffer from bunion pain, this is a god-send!</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my massage therapist for my plantar fasciatis and hammer toe.  My feet feel amazing!  No more foot pain when I first step on them in the morning or after I have been sitting a while.  After just a few weeks of wearing them consistently, I am back to running (more like a slow trot).  I highly recommend Yogatoes!</li>
            <li> It works! and it works fast!</li>
            <li> Reaaaaaaaly stretchy!! Seems to be doing my toes good. Clear gel is attractive and cleans up easily. This is TOUGH LOVE for the cramped-up toe: be prepared to try it a little at a time to get your toes used to the stretch.</li>
            <li> I bought these not realizing I wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk around in them. I have three children 4 and under, so that is not an option for me. They also REALLY make your toes spread. I tried them for only 5 minutes (quickly realizing I couldn&#x27;t walk in them) and after that small amount of time my toes were aching. It was very uncomfortable, not a \\&quot;nice stretch\\&quot; feeling by any means, and I made sure to order the smaller size even though my shoe size says I could wear the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving them two stars because if you really want to sit back and give your toes a BIG stretch than you will probably like these. Also, the YogaToes company has EXCELLENT customer service. I was able to return the product for a refund promptly and easily.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a size chart to give you an idea of what size would work best. I ordered the small and that was WAY to big for my toes. Once tried I felt uncomfortable returning them. Stuck with something to painful to wear.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses these as she does her other exercises, so she gets a 2 for 1 experience.  The yogatoes are well made and easy to use.  Due to an illness she has lost the feeling in her feet, but the &amp;#34;toes&amp;#34; have made a difference in the shape of her feet.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to get on.  When your toes are not straight this is a real problem.</li>
            <li> Works great after long runs. Helps stretch the toes and metatarsals. Love them!</li>
            <li> Over the course of 2 years, I managed to heal a bunion by using pedicure toe separators - the foam ones the salon puts between your toes when they polish them. I would also put a makeup sponge between my big toe and the one next to it. This has been working really well for me, and my smaller bunion vanished completely, while the larger one shrunk substantially and most of the pain went away. (My bunion was caused by pointy-toed shoes.) The pedicure toe separators cost only about a dollar for a pair of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was doing that, I made such great progress with my healing that I decided to up the ante and try something made more specifically for my purpose. So I decided to try Yoga Toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they do separate my toes. The space between each toe on the Yoga Toes is wider than that on the pedicure separator, which gives my foot more of a stretch, and that&#x27;s probably not a bad thing. However, considering that the Yoga Toes are priced at appx $40 per pair, they&#x27;re not enough better than the pedicure toe separator to justify the exorbitantly higher price. I could get an equally good stretch for a much lower price by using cheap cosmetic sponges between each toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped further, and discovered foot alignment socks which are much more reasonably priced (around $5-$10 here on Amazon), and equally effective for me. Look for brand names such as Comfy Toes or Happy Feet (or their imitators) - see [[ASIN:B001RYWZN8 Comfy Toes Foot Alignment Socks (Small/Medium)]] . They keep my foot warmer (which is good) than Yoga Toes because they cover the back of the foot and ankle with warm fabric.  While it&#x27;s true the socks may need laundering and can eventually wear out (which the Yoga Toes don&#x27;t), I find that I prefer the socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought the Yoga Toes. Yes, they do what they are intended to do, and they&#x27;ll be beneficial for people like me whose bunions were caused by pointy-toed shoes. However, a $1 product from my local drugstore has proven to do everything they do, and for a lot less money.  And for $5-$10, foot alignment socks are warmer to wear and more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hammer toes, 1) Avoid wearing shoes that don&#x27;t have a back on them to hug the heel (ie, avoid flip-flops, backless clogs, Birkenstocks, etc), and 2) Also make sure you buy shoes with a big enough toe box.  If you do these two things, you may find that your hammer toes clear up on their own without buying a $40 pair of Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> The material feels good and smooth but it is too thick for my toes.  I can wear it for about ten minutes and then it has to come off.  It really hurts my toes.</li>
            <li> High quality, durable they work well.&lt;br /&gt;Silicone rubber plastic is very flexible yet rid enough to&lt;br /&gt;Do a good job!</li>
            <li> This is one of the first products I purchased that actually worked. I was having issues with a bunion. After wearing the YogaToes nightly, the pain has subsided. I highly recommend YogaToes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these!</li>
            <li> These really helped my feet.  I have slight bunions.  I didn&#x27;t think these would make a difference, but they did.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Size fits. Love the cooling effect. Makes my toes feel much better after use Great product. Use them daily after a workout.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed by this product. Thank G-d my toes are pretty straight, buti was stil hoping to feel some stretching and relief, and I did not. I guess your toes have to be in pretty bad shape for you to feel anything.</li>
            <li> Love my Yoga Toes. I use them every night when I get home from work.&lt;br /&gt;They make my tired feet happy.</li>
            <li> After my have been stretched by these wonderful items, my feet no longer ache and the arches do not start to tense up.  These are the best products ever.  Thank you Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> These are great, but they fall off when you walk around. I don&#x27;t know how the product could change to stay on your feel, but I thought the point was to train the muscles when you walk. I still think they help in the long run for hammer toe, bunions, and in my case Turf Toe pain.</li>
            <li> I was refered to YogaToes by a friend because I had Planters Fasciitis and it&#x27;s helping. She is a jogger and get the Planters Fasciitis often from jogging. The only regret is I ordered the purple and you sent me the blue. I like to receive what I requested but for some reason you sent the blue. That was my only issue. I gave them a 5 star because they&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re suppose to.</li>
            <li> Love these!  My 2nd pair!  They are very helpful to my bunion and the redness and swelling is considerably less. It won&#x27;t correct the damage, but hopefully will prevent further joint deterioration.  In conjunction with proper footwear choices, it has relieved a lot of my pain!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product functions as advertised. However, they are difficult to put on. They cause some discomfort as you put them on.</li>
            <li> These toe separators would be great for most people. Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t work for me due to rheumatoid arthritis in my feet.</li>
            <li> Love YogaToes so much! If you&#x27;re a woman who wears heels, these are a must! By the end of the day wearing heels, ladies our feet are killing us. Heels also cause hammer toes, etc. These are perfect for men as well, runners...anyone on their feet for long period of times. I look forward to slipping on my YogaToes. I can tell you this, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis...and they even ease my pain associated with that. A few friends of mine suggested them and I&#x27;m so glad I bought them and gave them a try!</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly; however, the material is very hard and difficult to get on my toes.</li>
            <li> the product was alight but coming from the US to Canada was another $20 brokerage fee. I was not expecting this extra charge. All together the product cost me $70 which is insane. I was unhappy</li>
            <li> Love these Yoga Toes. They stretch your achy feet out after a long day in heels! I wear a 7.5/8 and the small fit perfect.</li>
            <li> I have a hammertoe developing and YogaToes gives immediate relief to the tendon that cramps of the toe. I use my pedicure socks (open toe area) to keep my feet warm while using the YogaToes.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to put on but it does work.</li>
            <li> I wore them for about 15 minutes the first time, then about 30 minutes while reading in bed. I could definitely feel not just my toes, but the feet being  stretched. The next morning my feet felt great, kind of like the mild soreness you feel after a workout. (instead of the usual awful pain when my feet hit the floor in the morning) These are going to become a part of my routine every day. They do collect lint and I will probably rinse them off with every use. I&#x27;m a shoe size 8 and I have the size small, I think it fits just right.</li>
            <li> They are everything that they said they were. Good shipping time. They are good.</li>
            <li> Using these for half an hour after a shower at night is working wonders to relieve my pains. Initially, I feel pain while using it, but it is a good kind of pain than tends to relieve other deep seated pains. After using these for a few days, I notice I have less and less pains on my feet, even when standing up most of the day doing chores. It is easy to wear and easy to clean with running water &amp; soap. The materials are high quality and has no strange smells whatsoever. Yes, there are many ways to achieve what this device does (e.g. specialty socks, cotton balls, etc) but this is a very convenient and hygienic way to get the results. I do wish they came with a clam shell type of carry case, though.</li>
            <li> these are great for tired smashed up feet,&lt;br /&gt;they feel wierd when they are on, but your feet feel great when you take them off</li>
            <li> You feel Great Relief for your feet after a long day of walking or standing. Easy to use, washable, great to separate your toes. If you practice yoga you will love yoga toes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Almost impossible to put them on my toes. Too bulky</li>
            <li> Good quality, fun color, hard to put on the first few times!  Work well!</li>
            <li> I love them. The first few times I wore them, it hurt a little. But now that I&#x27;ve worked my time up, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;I really think they are helping my hammer toe. And that&#x27;s why I bought them.</li>
            <li> I like these.  At first when I was getting used to them, they hurt my toes.  Now my feet feel better after 20 - 30 minutes in my &amp;#34;yoga toes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is great, if you just plan on wearing it to sit around.  The material stick to sheets so you cant wear it to bed and its too bulky to walk in.</li>
            <li> The spacers are pretty large to fit between your toes, and don&#x27;t stay on the little toes very well.  Overall, just ok.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and relaxing. I initially had a lot of trepidation about purchasing these, but it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by a friend. the  productcame sooner than they said they would.i do not know if they will be able to correct my problem but giving it a try. good product</li>
            <li> After bunion surgery (both sides of both feet), I felt like my toes were squashed together and &amp;#34;tight,&amp;#34; so I thought I would give these a try. What a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little tricky to get on (take the advice in the instructions and get your toes wet first - makes a big difference.) The suggested time is 5-10 minutes in the beginning, working up to an hour. I was able to manage about 30 minutes the first time, worked my way up to an hour fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet feel much better, and they look better too - normally spaced toes almost ready for sandals. This product seemed kind of weird and gimmicky, but I am pleased wiht the purchase and recommend Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> No pain. Works well but not sure it will really realign the bone! We&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> A little awkward to get used to but they do the trick</li>
            <li> Very well made and fit like a glove. I am a men&#x27;s ten and I bought the small size. They feel ver ygood and stretch and spread my toes wide. I am very pleased to have bought them.</li>
            <li> These have changed my life in a positive way. I&#x27;ve had plantar fasciitis for about 10 years, and it bothers me on and off. I work on my feet, which can trigger cramping in the soles of my feet and that feeling that I have a rock in my shoes under my heel and/or the ball of my foot. Using the YogaToes to stretch out my feet has seriously improved the health of my feet, which just makes life better. When I got them a few months ago I started out wearing them for 15 minutes a day when I got home from work, and I gradually increased the time I wear them to up to an hour, depending on how long I can sit in one place.&lt;br /&gt;The material is high quality, so even when I yank and pull at them to get them on my toes I am not concerned they will rip. They aren&#x27;t cheap, but I suppose that&#x27;s a good thing. Made in the USA is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them almost every day for a few months, I can tell my feet are much stronger and more flexible. The YogaToes have helped me realize I need to be more conscious about activating my toes when I am standing, and this has also played a role in my new-found foot health. I&#x27;m planning to buy a pair for my mom, who has suffered from heel spurs as a result of her plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Really! I cannot believe how much better my feet feel, I even have my husband wearing them!</li>
            <li> so far I believe these really do work I have recommended them to others.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This are a might more trouble to get into than socks and rather rigid in individual sizing.  Colors are nice.  Stretching the toes, as with other parts of the body, does feel good; but of course must be repeated.</li>
            <li> Might work for some people but too large to fit through my little toe and painful.  It has been broken and just won&#x27;t stretch.</li>
            <li> Hard to get on.  I probably will not use them at all.  I would like to return them.</li>
            <li> Use these daily after work. Slip them on while I do my meditation and get the benefits of a foot stretch and my &amp;#34;mindful time&amp;#34; Great way to wind down after busy ER shift on my feet. No more foot cramps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have foot problems because I wear really good shoes every day and I don&#x27;t spend much time on my feet. I thought these Yoga Toes looked like a fun way to stretch out my toes and they are really fun. I pop them on when I&#x27;m sitting down reading or watching TV. They don&#x27;t hurt my feet at all. They&#x27;re pretty easy to put on and take off and the gel material is comfortable. Would I actually recommend them? If you have foot pain, sure, I don&#x27;t see how these could hurt you.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really does what it claims to do!  I have been using it for about two weeks to straighten out hammertoes, and I see an improvement already. Yea!</li>
            <li> NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YogaToes are designed to stretch the toes, provide greater circulation to the feet, and improve common foot conditions such as bunions, hammer toes, and other types of pain.  I get frequent toe/foot cramps and have mild bunions, so I was definitely interested in trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The YogaToes can be a little difficult to slip on, but dampening them helps significantly.  (There is also a product available for this purpose, [[ASIN:B00GR9KWEW Yoga Toes Organic Purifying Spray]].)  Once on, you can immediately feel your toes stretching.  At first, I was only able to wear my YogaToes for a short period of time, and trying to walk in them was painful!  However, my feet soon got used to them and even came to crave the stretch that they provide.  Walking--while a bit awkward due to the size of the YogaToes--is not at all painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear the YogaToes regularly, I definitely see a decrease in toe/foot cramps.  The only possible downside I see to this product is that it&#x27;s tough to wear them in winter--my feet get cold!  However, loose, fluffy-type socks WILL fit over this product.  Please note that these are NOT the same as wearing the foam separators used for pedicures, which provide NO stretch to the toes.  Finally, to get the right amount of stretch, be sure to use the chart and order based on your shoe size.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone, whether you have foot problems or just want to make your feet feel better!</li>
            <li> Wearing the yoga toes really relaxes my feet.  I&#x27;ve walked in 1/2k marathon&#x27;s and afterwards use the yoga toes and it really helps to relax and stretch out the toes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them on. Too wide, too stiff. Gave them to my daughter and she likes them.</li>
            <li> They feel okay but I haven&#x27;t felt a difference after wearing them, although I&#x27;m not religious about it.</li>
            <li> too big and a bit uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Very soothing for my toes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet all day!  When I need to relax I place yoga toes on my feet and i get a stretch that I truly need, enjoy and look forward too!</li>
            <li> A little about me first: I&#x27;m 26, I don&#x27;t wear a lot of tight fitting shoes and don&#x27;t have any health issues with my feet, but they do tend to get sore often because I do a little bit of barefoot excercising. The pros of this product: I wear a 7.5 or 8 and these fit just fine, I dont find them difficult to put on (but if you do then just get them wet like they suggest, to help them slip on). My toes do not turn purple, the circulation does not get cut off. The silicone material they are made out of is stretchy but yet very tough at the same time, they are very durable and wont tear or get stretched out not matter how much you pull on them, they will certainly last. they are also kind of fun to squeeze and stretch, my kids find them interesting. They arent super sticky or anything, and dont really attract hair and dust as much as I was led to believe from other reviews. I don&#x27;t find these painful or even uncomfortable to wear, and I can walk around with them on if I need to or leave them on for as long as I feel like. I didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;work up\\&quot; to wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;Now the cons: I was disappointed in the fact that on both ends, the sides are not connected. Its kind of hard to explain and its hard to tell from the picture, but on the outer edge of the big toe and outer edge of the pinky toe, the top and bottom are not connected so the edges just kind of flop around, get caught on things, and dont always stay in place. I assume they did that to make them easier to put on and take off, but I just find that feature annoying. I felt these were very overpriced for what you get. For the price I at least expected them to come in a case I could store them in, but they just came in cheap flimsy clear plastic. I&#x27;m not sure these really do much for my toes, I guess my feet feel little bit better after wearing them but it doesnt seem like these do anything the cheaper versions called \\&quot;toe stretchers\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t do. Dont waste your money on these when there are cheaper versions of basically the same thing.</li>
