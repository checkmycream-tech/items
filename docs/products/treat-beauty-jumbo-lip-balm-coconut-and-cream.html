            <li>Smells amazing, but feels like wax on my lips.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice all-natural lip balm that does have a nice buttercream smell to it.  </li>

            <li>The vanilla flavor tastes nice, too.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been a hard-core Burts Bees fan ever since I stopped creating my own, but no longer.</li>
            <li>scent/flavor is delicious - it has a mildly sweet flavor if you accidentally lick some off and it has a light, creamy vanilla</li>
            <li>The smell is like a normal vanilla lip balm -  but still just great!</li>
            <li>I use it at home, especially right before bedtime, to keep my lips moist.  </li>

            <li>It is amazingly effective and I am having no allergic reaction - something I tend to have with most of these types of products.</li>
            <li>product is ok, i like it but dont love it, really smooth and glides very nice on my lips</li>
            <li>I ordered this lip balm because a YouTuber touted this as her most favorite lip balm, I also saw a ton of amazing reviews on this here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>No shine, great light scent, fabulous size, super moisturizing and addicting!!</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth and silky texture when applied and</li>

            <li>The scent is very light.</li>
            <li>The flavor is not too strong and nice.</li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on smoothly without chunks or a super waxy feeling.</li>
            <li>I think the huge size is cute and love showing it off when I use it!</li>
            <li>This lip balm is huge!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite internet makeup gals recommended this lip balm, and I was pleased to be able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for the best lip balm for ages and while I&#x27;ve come close, I think I&#x27;ve finally found it!</li>
            <li>I have more on the way to me so that I can keep one in my purse, bedside table, book bag etc.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff feels.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how I was able to let the others go :)</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and feel incredible on your lips.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying for the smell. :)</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I reviewed this product because I noticed one reviewer that rated it one star.</li>
            <li>i just wish the scent and flavor were more consisant since it is a semi-expensive product.</li>
            <li>This would explain why it costs more for this product.</li>
            <li>Love this one though</li>
            <li>just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>I received my lip balm yesterday and love it.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product my lips feel nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to eat it rather than wear it as a lip balm.  : )  </li>
            <li>I have used it all day, and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love these jumbo lip balms</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this since I am a Chapstick addict</li>
            <li>but it was just ok.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had better staying power...</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite chapstick ever &amp; I got it on Kandee Johnson&#x27;s reccommendation.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes even better than my Bath &amp; Body Works 8 hour recovery balm.</li>
            <li>still totally portable and perfect for throwing in a purse if you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and Leaping Bunny certified as cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more 💜</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many organics.</li>
            <li>I love this balm.</li>
            <li>I like this the flavor and smell of this lip balm, but I wish it were a bit more moisturizing and lasted longer.  </li>
            <li>favorite is the buttercream</li>
            <li>since I just paid the most I ever paid for a Lip Balm.</li>
            <li>A girl on you tube told everyone this product was her favorite, so I decided try it, I love the vanilla scent, which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use this product on more than my lips.</li>
            <li>and I have  tried so many lip treatments.</li>
            <li>That means most of the stuff market is a no</li>
            <li>so I am so glad this is a jumbo sized product.</li>
            <li>Thank Kandee! :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise I would have ordered more...</li>
            <li>I love the size of the lip balm, it smells</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I wont run out any time soon...</li>
            <li>I like how it feels and it tastes delicious, but I don&#x27;t feel like it soaks into my lips enough.</li>
            <li>This is very jumbo though, great size for the price, HUGE!</li>
            <li>I love the jumbo size of it, and what girl wouldn&#x27;t love a sweet taste on her lips!</li>
            <li>soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Treat for making this amazing lip balm!</li>
            <li>Best lip balm I have tried in a long time</li>
            <li>I have dryness-prone lips and have been on the hunt for the best lip balm formula for a long time.  </li>
            <li>But, I will purchase more at full price!</li>
            <li>The balm goes on smoothly, is super emollient and feels nice on my lips.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing like super yummy Satsuma.</li>
            <li>This smells good, feels good, and it will last me forever because of the size.</li>
            <li>Wonderful big size and makes your lips silky smooth.</li>
            <li>They have a nice light scent, but very delectable and they moisturize wonderfully, best of all the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s so huge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have a light scent/taste and then forget about it because I know that my lips are moisturized and that&#x27;s what I care about the most, so</li>
            <li>I am a lip balm junkie and gave tons of lip product and this by far is a favorite!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this balm!</li>
            <li>It also tastes sweet!</li>
            <li>I got this and the first time I tried it I was in Love!  </li>
            <li>It tastes very mildly like vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just want to eat it and come on, I love the size, makes me smile every time :)</li>
            <li>It smells great, it goes on soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t nourish my lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think the quality is exceptional, and I would highly recommend this brand of lip balm!</li>
            <li>With that being said, the ingredients are great, they are natural and they don&#x27;t test on animals which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I like to smell and feel the balm, but sometimes when it&#x27;s too strong</li>
            <li>Omg....This is big for the price I love the favor and how it goes on very smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li>and feels so soft and nice on your lips!  </li>
            <li>okay, I had read a review about how yummy it smelled...not so true...</li>
            <li>This keeps the product less portable, however it really is an awesome chapstick.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have mentioned that the scent is either strong or light, the one I got was on the lighter side</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because its super moisturizing but has noo smell at all!  </li>
            <li>I was NOT expecting the tube to be so huge.</li>
            <li>Also, It&#x27;s a huge tube</li>
            <li>lip balm tube itself is HUGE,</li>
            <li>This is huge and such great taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It does not moisturize and it feels and smells extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and not waxy or tacky.</li>
            <li>Great, big balm!</li>
            <li>As a plus, the product is certified organic and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It has organic coconut oil in it, which I personally know is great for moisturizing your skin and lips.  </li>
            <li>The lip balm goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, not overpowering</li>
            <li>This lip balm is so silky and goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My lips stay hydrated for many hours after the balm wears off from drinking or eating which seems to be a rare feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s worth more than $10 to me and I will buy again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li>I also really like the big size of the tube, really great product!</li>
            <li>and I love that I can feel good about the ingredients I&#x27;m putting on my lips (especially since it&#x27;s so yummy that I can&#x27;t help but lick it off )</li>
            <li>The formula is mostly organic shea butter and some other great organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm, it&#x27;s very large size</li>
            <li>While the tube is large, it makes it easy to find in my purse!</li>
            <li>The vanilla buttercream smells like fresh icing!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my $13.00 lip balm, $8.00 with $5.00 shipping.</li>
            <li>first off, this is a great lip balm for the winter ( it had lot more dry )</li>
            <li>This nice size not only gives more to use, but also I can always find it in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I love the large lip balm and I adore the vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>This product is a true lip balm providing moisture and softness.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had a stronger scent, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good for occasional use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly coconut oil &amp; really moisturizes lips</li>
            <li>love these so much</li>
            <li>This smells and tastes good, but it&#x27;s a bit too big to carry in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I was so bummed when I went to smell the sweet smell of Vanilla Butter Cream.</li>
            <li>right away I noticed the Cruelty Free bunny logo.</li>
            <li>It smells great and the large size means it should last forever!</li>
            <li>Ok so I ordered this because I love sweet smelling products especially vanilla and buttercream.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a wonderful vanilla buttercream that&#x27;s subtle and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>so glad Kandee Johnson mentioned it in one of her most recent youtube videos</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think 9 bucks is a lot as this thing is tremendous.</li>
            <li>feel like maybe there&#x27;s some haters of the particular (and lovely) blogger who recommended it</li>
            <li>SUPER well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed after using it a while, I can go longer without chapsticks if I have to which means it is actually conditioning my lips and not making me need more and more of it</li>
            <li>This is super moisturizing on your lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super size ;) kept my lips smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very surprised at first sniff, as it does not smell at all like any kind of candy.  </li>
            <li>and I was very interested at trying one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so large and this makes it easy to find in my purse.</li>
            <li>lip balm on the other hand has made my lips feel amazing!</li>
            <li>I was hooked on first application!</li>
            <li>but I mention this product first!    </li>
            <li>You get so much product in this tube and it smells DEVINE!!</li>
            <li>It makes your lips super soft,  I&#x27;m going to buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li>So glad a natural lip balm can be delicious and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The taste is very light and natural.</li>
            <li>but I love the huge size because it will last forever, so</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% natural,</li>
            <li>I love that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that is because it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Really, a 7 year old loved it so much she swiped it.</li>
            <li>Three stars instead of two because my 11 year old enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I made lip balm and sold all natural vegan lip balm for many years and sold it as a business ...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth 8 bucks</li>
            <li>I do wish, though, that the smell and taste lasted longer; they dissipate pretty quickly when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my lips right before I went to sleep</li>
            <li>They said that they might have gotten a defective balm, and they are right.</li>
            <li>The texture is a nice balance between slick and waxy and gives lips a healthy sheen.  </li>
            <li>Very grainy and nothing special</li>
            <li>But other than that, the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This to me smells like any other normal vanilla balm, definitely nothing special, and I feel like most people are getting this because you are expecting an amazing smell!</li>
            <li>I own probably 20 different lip balms, because I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this balm.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much I did buy a ton as presents for a bunch of my girl friends and had a hard time giving them away because I love them so much haha--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, I do really like it!  </li>
            <li>Wish I knew of a product that really works!</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or cakey and has a fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li>none are grainy at all, a big reason I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it as gifts and nobody has ever said anything except they&#x27;re addicted.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>, I will be purchasing more as back up and to stash in my purse, car, and by my bed!!</li>
            <li>After reading several articles about the ingredients in most lip balms I learned why.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I received it in the mail was the smell...</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it was when I was going to bed.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lip balms, but this one actually works for me.  </li>
            <li>It smelled *exactly* like something, but it took me forever to figure out what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like my bald baby boy 1985 Coleco Cabbage Patch Kid.  </li>
            <li>do not believe Kandee is a liar, and even with scent being as (very!)</li>
            <li>Over 3x as much!</li>
            <li>i love it so much , SO BIG !</li>
            <li>This tastes exactly like buttercream frosting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lip balms.</li>
            <li>It lightly covers my lips making them feel moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>, I lost a chunk of lip balm because it was dry/cracked when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my second favorite is her newer coconut</li>
            <li>think the first thing lots of people would notice is that it looks like a glue</li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla buttercream in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This balm works absolute wonders!</li>
            <li>This one absolutely does the trick for me!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and exactly what my chapped lips need.</li>
            <li>First off in the scent.</li>
            <li>The balm itself is also very nice; it is not sticky, very moist, and you only need one application to have enough of the product on your lips to boot!</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and disappears pretty quickly, which I consider to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural, just coconut oil,beeswax, vegetable glycerin, shea butter, and natural vanilla flavoring.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve come to love the chapstick so much and will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li>The price is good especially for such a large lip balm.</li>
            <li>And not in that slap-you-in-the-face sugary sweet smell but this soft cotton candy-esqe way.</li>
            <li>When I first applied this product, my lips were instantly hydrated with a smooth layer of vanilla.</li>
            <li>In the mornings, my lips are super soft and still hydrated.</li>
            <li>The formula is super soft and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>yes my lips are super soft from 1st application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scented but mine certainly does not smell like plastic.</li>
            <li>bees, carmex, and vasaline) tends to sit on top of the lip but this seeped in and left my lips feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this but certain things just threw me wayyyy off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Little to no taste and softens nicely.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my lips stop pealing and cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very vanilla-cotton candyish.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the word \\&quot;moist\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that makes me lips smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this chapstick.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>The stick is truly jumbo, in the real sense of the word.</li>
            <li>and I know I wouldn&#x27;t be running out of it very</li>
            <li>None of the hundreds of balms I tried did much for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>was hoping for more..not very emollient</li>
            <li>I like this so much</li>
            <li>And I love how the ingredients are natural and simple.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I may have received an old lip balm, but there was no scent or flavor which was mostly the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so fun, yummy and totally free of yucky mineral oils and other byproducts.</li>
            <li>I do love this balm but after having for a few months it has developed a little odor to it, which isn&#x27;t pleasant....</li>
            <li>The lip balm is oversized, while normal chapticks are the size of your pinkie, this one by Treat is the size of your thumb!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell super buttercreamy or vanilla at all, which is a major bummer since that&#x27;s my main reason for purchasing</li>
            <li>Love the taste and the lip cream is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different lip balms, glosses, lipstick, and other various lip items.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and not too ridiculously sweet like most candy lip balms.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed is how huge this product is: 0.50 oz vs. 0.15 oz in your average lip balm.</li>
            <li>but I recently saw this lip balm on a YouTube video about different make-up products from one of my favorite make-up artists.</li>
            <li>I made a second purchase of 4 more for the convenience; for my purse, car and various locations.</li>
            <li>Apparently size really does matter ;)</li>
            <li>I was psyched to finally have a product that I loved but a few months into using this tube the products seemed to have separated and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will definetly purchase again.</li>
            <li>She highly recommended this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I love both the pink and vanilla buttercream lip balms sold by treat!!!</li>
            <li>Does not make my lips smooth and leaves a wet feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lip products that have dried my lips out, that I could write a book on it.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is in no way dry and most DEFINITELY has a candy-like sent and flavor!!!    </li>
            <li>Also I feel like this does not wear a super long time.</li>
            <li>It is a very large stick so it should last a while.</li>
            <li>I reeeally wanted to try their new coconut one, but....</li>
            <li>(you need your whole hand to hold it because it&#x27;s more than 3x larger than other lip balms!)</li>
            <li>It lasts and makes my lips very soft.</li>
            <li>thought perhaps I should mention the lip balm I have been using for a long while that works for me, and is well worth the money - Pangea Organics in Pyrenees Lavender with Cardamon.  </li>
            <li>It says &amp;#34;Vanilla buttercream soft candy&amp;#34; but it smells like a yummy Carnival cotton candy or something!</li>
            <li>I finally decided to go back to my original brand...</li>
            <li>completely organic!</li>
            <li>(fun fact, folks: crude oil bi-products aren&#x27;t actually moisturizing or good for lips!)</li>
            <li>The lip balm is all natural, and very soft on your lips.</li>
            <li>I know that this will last me a long time which makes it totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>is extra large...</li>
            <li>Find it difficult to be precise, not that lip balms need to go on precisely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and it softens.</li>
            <li>I use this before bed every night and it keeps my lips soft and moist .</li>
            <li>As far as the size</li>
            <li>This review is for Treat Soft Candy vanilla buttercream jumbo lip balm.</li>
            <li>Ingredients: Coconut oil, beeswax, Kosher vegetable glycerin, Shea butter, Natural vanilla</li>
            <li>The Treat Soft Candy jumbo lip balm was scented like vanilla buttercream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft and lickably delish.</li>
            <li>The formulas isn&#x27;t greasy or anything, its soft.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients makes this purchase a plus.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re all natural and made here in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels so soft when worn, smells like heaven.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;Treat completely exceed what I was expecting</li>
            <li>and it literally makes your lips soft</li>
            <li>Secondly if doesnt moisturize very well at all.</li>
            <li>I like that all the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only free of gross chemicals, it actually helps your lips as opposed to petroleum jelly or mineral oil</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel really soft and smooth...and</li>
            <li>Not goopy and soft...</li>
            <li>The other tubes I&#x27;ve purchased are fine, but the vanilla one is  gross now.</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly like buttercream frosting and has a texture that is a nice middle ground of a thick balm and the smooth, slickness of a thin one.  </li>
            <li>BUT that size is what is going to make it last a long time and makes the cost worth it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any female in my life.</li>
            <li>I put it on every night before bed and the next morning, baby soft lips!!</li>
            <li>its very moisturizing and stays on your lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>For starters, this balm is much larger than normal.</li>
            <li>I find that many lip \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; are just heavy waxes that sit on your lip but never really moisturize.  </li>
            <li>The texture is grainy which is to be expected with most of the ingredients in it from repetitive heating/cooling.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips so soft and last on my lips forever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of different lip glosses and lip balms looking for one that would make my lips soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It makes my old lip balms seem so tiny now!!</li>
            <li>Maybelline Baby Lips was about the only product that helped, but my lips still weren&#x27;t completely healed.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth - this is as much balm as at least 2-3 normal-sized tubes.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my 4 year old daughter because I won&#x27;t let her use gross chapstick.</li>
            <li>My lips were dry, cracked and bleeding before I started using this, now they are completely healed, soft with no cracked areas.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND GOING TO BUY ANOTHER TO PUT NEXT TO MY BED AT NIGH TIME :) VERY MOISTURIZING AND DOESN&#x27;T TAKE BAD</li>
            <li>While they feel better for a little while, it is these ingredients that make them feel dried out again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It makes my lips soft and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li>Over the next 3 days I developed very dry chapped lips.</li>

            <li> First of all, it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!</li>
            <li> It has it all, scent, emolliency, feel on the lipst and more!</li>
            <li> I primarily use this product at night and before applying lip gloss or lip stain, and it really is a great product.</li>
            <li> And tastes amazing.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is huge which is great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works amazing, it&#x27;s not waxy at all.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but feels like wax on my lips.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice all-natural lip balm that does have a nice buttercream smell to it.  </li>
            <li> you try it for yourself  and form your own opinion.</li>
            <li> The vanilla flavor tastes nice, too.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and I like the jumbo sized tube</li>
            <li> It moisturizes though, but feels kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hard-core Burts Bees fan ever since I stopped creating my own, but no longer.</li>
            <li> scent/flavor is delicious - it has a mildly sweet flavor if you accidentally lick some off and it has a light, creamy vanilla</li>
            <li> The smell is like a normal vanilla lip balm -  but still just great!</li>
            <li> I use it at home, especially right before bedtime, to keep my lips moist.  </li>
            <li> I was super stoked to get this, I heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> It smells/tastes delicious and makes my lips so soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful and natural!</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the choice to purchase this at a reduced cost in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> First off the presentation is beautiful and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is amazingly effective and I am having no allergic reaction - something I tend to have with most of these types of products.</li>
            <li> product is ok, i like it but dont love it, really smooth and glides very nice on my lips</li>
            <li> I ordered this lip balm because a YouTuber touted this as her most favorite lip balm, I also saw a ton of amazing reviews on this here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> No shine, great light scent, fabulous size, super moisturizing and addicting!!</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth and silky texture when applied and</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not too strong and nice.</li>
            <li> It smells great and goes on smoothly without chunks or a super waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> I think the huge size is cute and love showing it off when I use it!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is huge!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite internet makeup gals recommended this lip balm, and I was pleased to be able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for the best lip balm for ages and while I&#x27;ve come close, I think I&#x27;ve finally found it!</li>
            <li> I have more on the way to me so that I can keep one in my purse, bedside table, book bag etc.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff feels.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how I was able to let the others go :)</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and feel incredible on your lips.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying for the smell. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I reviewed this product because I noticed one reviewer that rated it one star.</li>
            <li> i just wish the scent and flavor were more consisant since it is a semi-expensive product.</li>
            <li> This would explain why it costs more for this product.</li>
            <li> Love this one though</li>
            <li> just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I received my lip balm yesterday and love it.  </li>
            <li> When I use this product my lips feel nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to eat it rather than wear it as a lip balm.  : )  </li>
            <li> I have used it all day, and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love these jumbo lip balms</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since I am a Chapstick addict</li>
            <li> but it was just ok.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had better staying power...</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite chapstick ever &amp; I got it on Kandee Johnson&#x27;s reccommendation.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes even better than my Bath &amp; Body Works 8 hour recovery balm.</li>
            <li> still totally portable and perfect for throwing in a purse if you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and Leaping Bunny certified as cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more 💜</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many organics.</li>
            <li> I love this balm.</li>
            <li> I like this the flavor and smell of this lip balm, but I wish it were a bit more moisturizing and lasted longer.  </li>
            <li> favorite is the buttercream</li>
            <li> since I just paid the most I ever paid for a Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> A girl on you tube told everyone this product was her favorite, so I decided try it, I love the vanilla scent, which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I use this product on more than my lips.</li>
            <li> and I have  tried so many lip treatments.</li>
            <li> That means most of the stuff market is a no</li>
            <li> so I am so glad this is a jumbo sized product.</li>
            <li> Thank Kandee! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I would have ordered more...</li>
            <li> I love the size of the lip balm, it smells</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I wont run out any time soon...</li>
            <li> I like how it feels and it tastes delicious, but I don&#x27;t feel like it soaks into my lips enough.</li>
            <li> This is very jumbo though, great size for the price, HUGE!</li>
            <li> I love the jumbo size of it, and what girl wouldn&#x27;t love a sweet taste on her lips!</li>
            <li> soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Treat for making this amazing lip balm!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I have tried in a long time</li>
            <li> I have dryness-prone lips and have been on the hunt for the best lip balm formula for a long time.  </li>
            <li> But, I will purchase more at full price!</li>
            <li> The balm goes on smoothly, is super emollient and feels nice on my lips.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing like super yummy Satsuma.</li>
            <li> This smells good, feels good, and it will last me forever because of the size.</li>
            <li> Wonderful big size and makes your lips silky smooth.</li>
            <li> They have a nice light scent, but very delectable and they moisturize wonderfully, best of all the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s so huge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a light scent/taste and then forget about it because I know that my lips are moisturized and that&#x27;s what I care about the most, so</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm junkie and gave tons of lip product and this by far is a favorite!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this balm!</li>
            <li> It also tastes sweet!</li>
            <li> I got this and the first time I tried it I was in Love!  </li>
            <li> It tastes very mildly like vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just want to eat it and come on, I love the size, makes me smile every time :)</li>
            <li> It smells great, it goes on soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t nourish my lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think the quality is exceptional, and I would highly recommend this brand of lip balm!</li>
            <li> With that being said, the ingredients are great, they are natural and they don&#x27;t test on animals which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I like to smell and feel the balm, but sometimes when it&#x27;s too strong</li>
            <li> Omg....This is big for the price I love the favor and how it goes on very smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> and feels so soft and nice on your lips!  </li>
            <li> okay, I had read a review about how yummy it smelled...not so true...</li>
            <li> This keeps the product less portable, however it really is an awesome chapstick.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have mentioned that the scent is either strong or light, the one I got was on the lighter side</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because its super moisturizing but has noo smell at all!  </li>
            <li> I was NOT expecting the tube to be so huge.</li>
            <li> Also, It&#x27;s a huge tube</li>
            <li> lip balm tube itself is HUGE,</li>
            <li> This is huge and such great taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It does not moisturize and it feels and smells extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and not waxy or tacky.</li>
            <li> Great, big balm!</li>
            <li> As a plus, the product is certified organic and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It has organic coconut oil in it, which I personally know is great for moisturizing your skin and lips.  </li>
            <li> The lip balm goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, not overpowering</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so silky and goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li> My lips stay hydrated for many hours after the balm wears off from drinking or eating which seems to be a rare feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s worth more than $10 to me and I will buy again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> I also really like the big size of the tube, really great product!</li>
            <li> and I love that I can feel good about the ingredients I&#x27;m putting on my lips (especially since it&#x27;s so yummy that I can&#x27;t help but lick it off )</li>
            <li> The formula is mostly organic shea butter and some other great organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, it&#x27;s very large size</li>
            <li> While the tube is large, it makes it easy to find in my purse!</li>
            <li> The vanilla buttercream smells like fresh icing!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my $13.00 lip balm, $8.00 with $5.00 shipping.</li>
            <li> first off, this is a great lip balm for the winter ( it had lot more dry )</li>
            <li> This nice size not only gives more to use, but also I can always find it in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I love the large lip balm and I adore the vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> This product is a true lip balm providing moisture and softness.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had a stronger scent, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Good for occasional use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly coconut oil &amp; really moisturizes lips</li>
            <li> love these so much</li>
            <li> This smells and tastes good, but it&#x27;s a bit too big to carry in my purse.  </li>
            <li> I was so bummed when I went to smell the sweet smell of Vanilla Butter Cream.</li>
            <li> right away I noticed the Cruelty Free bunny logo.</li>
            <li> It smells great and the large size means it should last forever!</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this because I love sweet smelling products especially vanilla and buttercream.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a wonderful vanilla buttercream that&#x27;s subtle and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> so glad Kandee Johnson mentioned it in one of her most recent youtube videos</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think 9 bucks is a lot as this thing is tremendous.</li>
            <li> feel like maybe there&#x27;s some haters of the particular (and lovely) blogger who recommended it</li>
            <li> SUPER well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed after using it a while, I can go longer without chapsticks if I have to which means it is actually conditioning my lips and not making me need more and more of it</li>
            <li> This is super moisturizing on your lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super size ;) kept my lips smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very surprised at first sniff, as it does not smell at all like any kind of candy.  </li>
            <li> and I was very interested at trying one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so large and this makes it easy to find in my purse.</li>
            <li> lip balm on the other hand has made my lips feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I was hooked on first application!</li>
            <li> but I mention this product first!    </li>
            <li> You get so much product in this tube and it smells DEVINE!!</li>
            <li> It makes your lips super soft,  I&#x27;m going to buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> So glad a natural lip balm can be delicious and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The taste is very light and natural.</li>
            <li> but I love the huge size because it will last forever, so</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% natural,</li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that is because it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Really, a 7 year old loved it so much she swiped it.</li>
            <li> Three stars instead of two because my 11 year old enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I made lip balm and sold all natural vegan lip balm for many years and sold it as a business ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth 8 bucks</li>
            <li> I do wish, though, that the smell and taste lasted longer; they dissipate pretty quickly when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my lips right before I went to sleep</li>
            <li> They said that they might have gotten a defective balm, and they are right.</li>
            <li> The texture is a nice balance between slick and waxy and gives lips a healthy sheen.  </li>
            <li> Very grainy and nothing special</li>
            <li> But other than that, the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This to me smells like any other normal vanilla balm, definitely nothing special, and I feel like most people are getting this because you are expecting an amazing smell!</li>
            <li> I own probably 20 different lip balms, because I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this balm.</li>
            <li> I loved them so much I did buy a ton as presents for a bunch of my girl friends and had a hard time giving them away because I love them so much haha--</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, I do really like it!  </li>
            <li> Wish I knew of a product that really works!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or cakey and has a fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li> none are grainy at all, a big reason I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it as gifts and nobody has ever said anything except they&#x27;re addicted.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> , I will be purchasing more as back up and to stash in my purse, car, and by my bed!!</li>
            <li> After reading several articles about the ingredients in most lip balms I learned why.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I received it in the mail was the smell...</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it was when I was going to bed.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lip balms, but this one actually works for me.  </li>
            <li> It smelled *exactly* like something, but it took me forever to figure out what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like my bald baby boy 1985 Coleco Cabbage Patch Kid.  </li>
            <li> do not believe Kandee is a liar, and even with scent being as (very!)</li>
            <li> Over 3x as much!</li>
            <li> i love it so much , SO BIG !</li>
            <li> This tastes exactly like buttercream frosting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lip balms.</li>
            <li> It lightly covers my lips making them feel moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> , I lost a chunk of lip balm because it was dry/cracked when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my second favorite is her newer coconut</li>
            <li> think the first thing lots of people would notice is that it looks like a glue</li>
            <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla buttercream in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This balm works absolute wonders!</li>
            <li> This one absolutely does the trick for me!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and exactly what my chapped lips need.</li>
            <li> First off in the scent.</li>
            <li> The balm itself is also very nice; it is not sticky, very moist, and you only need one application to have enough of the product on your lips to boot!</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and disappears pretty quickly, which I consider to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural, just coconut oil,beeswax, vegetable glycerin, shea butter, and natural vanilla flavoring.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve come to love the chapstick so much and will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> The price is good especially for such a large lip balm.</li>
            <li> And not in that slap-you-in-the-face sugary sweet smell but this soft cotton candy-esqe way.</li>
            <li> When I first applied this product, my lips were instantly hydrated with a smooth layer of vanilla.</li>
            <li> In the mornings, my lips are super soft and still hydrated.</li>
            <li> The formula is super soft and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> yes my lips are super soft from 1st application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scented but mine certainly does not smell like plastic.</li>
            <li> bees, carmex, and vasaline) tends to sit on top of the lip but this seeped in and left my lips feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but certain things just threw me wayyyy off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little to no taste and softens nicely.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my lips stop pealing and cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very vanilla-cotton candyish.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the word \\&quot;moist\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that makes me lips smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this chapstick.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li> The stick is truly jumbo, in the real sense of the word.</li>
            <li> and I know I wouldn&#x27;t be running out of it very</li>
            <li> None of the hundreds of balms I tried did much for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> was hoping for more..not very emollient</li>
            <li> I like this so much</li>
            <li> And I love how the ingredients are natural and simple.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I may have received an old lip balm, but there was no scent or flavor which was mostly the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fun, yummy and totally free of yucky mineral oils and other byproducts.</li>
            <li> I do love this balm but after having for a few months it has developed a little odor to it, which isn&#x27;t pleasant....</li>
            <li> The lip balm is oversized, while normal chapticks are the size of your pinkie, this one by Treat is the size of your thumb!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell super buttercreamy or vanilla at all, which is a major bummer since that&#x27;s my main reason for purchasing</li>
            <li> Love the taste and the lip cream is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different lip balms, glosses, lipstick, and other various lip items.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and not too ridiculously sweet like most candy lip balms.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed is how huge this product is: 0.50 oz vs. 0.15 oz in your average lip balm.</li>
            <li> but I recently saw this lip balm on a YouTube video about different make-up products from one of my favorite make-up artists.</li>
            <li> I made a second purchase of 4 more for the convenience; for my purse, car and various locations.</li>
            <li> Apparently size really does matter ;)</li>
            <li> I was psyched to finally have a product that I loved but a few months into using this tube the products seemed to have separated and</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will definetly purchase again.</li>
            <li> She highly recommended this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I love both the pink and vanilla buttercream lip balms sold by treat!!!</li>
            <li> Does not make my lips smooth and leaves a wet feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lip products that have dried my lips out, that I could write a book on it.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is in no way dry and most DEFINITELY has a candy-like sent and flavor!!!    </li>
            <li> Also I feel like this does not wear a super long time.</li>
            <li> It is a very large stick so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I reeeally wanted to try their new coconut one, but....</li>
            <li> (you need your whole hand to hold it because it&#x27;s more than 3x larger than other lip balms!)</li>
            <li> It lasts and makes my lips very soft.</li>
            <li> thought perhaps I should mention the lip balm I have been using for a long while that works for me, and is well worth the money - Pangea Organics in Pyrenees Lavender with Cardamon.  </li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;Vanilla buttercream soft candy&amp;#34; but it smells like a yummy Carnival cotton candy or something!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to go back to my original brand...</li>
            <li> completely organic!</li>
            <li> (fun fact, folks: crude oil bi-products aren&#x27;t actually moisturizing or good for lips!)</li>
            <li> The lip balm is all natural, and very soft on your lips.</li>
            <li> I know that this will last me a long time which makes it totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> is extra large...</li>
            <li> Find it difficult to be precise, not that lip balms need to go on precisely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and it softens.</li>
            <li> I use this before bed every night and it keeps my lips soft and moist .</li>
            <li> As far as the size</li>
            <li> This review is for Treat Soft Candy vanilla buttercream jumbo lip balm.</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Coconut oil, beeswax, Kosher vegetable glycerin, Shea butter, Natural vanilla</li>
            <li> The Treat Soft Candy jumbo lip balm was scented like vanilla buttercream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft and lickably delish.</li>
            <li> The formulas isn&#x27;t greasy or anything, its soft.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients makes this purchase a plus.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re all natural and made here in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels so soft when worn, smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;Treat completely exceed what I was expecting</li>
            <li> and it literally makes your lips soft</li>
            <li> Secondly if doesnt moisturize very well at all.</li>
            <li> I like that all the ingredients are natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only free of gross chemicals, it actually helps your lips as opposed to petroleum jelly or mineral oil</li>
            <li> It makes your lips feel really soft and smooth...and</li>
            <li> Not goopy and soft...</li>
            <li> The other tubes I&#x27;ve purchased are fine, but the vanilla one is  gross now.</li>
            <li> The smell is exactly like buttercream frosting and has a texture that is a nice middle ground of a thick balm and the smooth, slickness of a thin one.  </li>
            <li> BUT that size is what is going to make it last a long time and makes the cost worth it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any female in my life.</li>
            <li> I put it on every night before bed and the next morning, baby soft lips!!</li>
            <li> its very moisturizing and stays on your lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> For starters, this balm is much larger than normal.</li>
            <li> I find that many lip \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; are just heavy waxes that sit on your lip but never really moisturize.  </li>
            <li> The texture is grainy which is to be expected with most of the ingredients in it from repetitive heating/cooling.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips so soft and last on my lips forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of different lip glosses and lip balms looking for one that would make my lips soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It makes my old lip balms seem so tiny now!!</li>
            <li> Maybelline Baby Lips was about the only product that helped, but my lips still weren&#x27;t completely healed.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth - this is as much balm as at least 2-3 normal-sized tubes.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my 4 year old daughter because I won&#x27;t let her use gross chapstick.</li>
            <li> My lips were dry, cracked and bleeding before I started using this, now they are completely healed, soft with no cracked areas.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND GOING TO BUY ANOTHER TO PUT NEXT TO MY BED AT NIGH TIME :) VERY MOISTURIZING AND DOESN&#x27;T TAKE BAD</li>
            <li> While they feel better for a little while, it is these ingredients that make them feel dried out again.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It makes my lips soft and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> Over the next 3 days I developed very dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a really thick balm, so I find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other balms</li>
            <li> I can go through a normal chapstick in less than a week</li>
            <li> Extra large, pricey, it lasts forever, but applying it looks pretty silly.</li>
            <li> these are so big they last a really long time, even with lots of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last a long time</li>
            <li> so should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works well and totally solved my dry lip problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long review</li>
            <li> The only other lip treatment that was this moisturizing is aquaphor</li>
            <li> I was always having a problem with extremely dry lips</li>
            <li> Minuets after I apply it, my lips are dry again.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works wonders for dry and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I get seriously dry lips</li>
            <li> Smelling the product directly in the tube, there is a slight plastic smell to the balm (my only negative comment), but it&#x27;s not enough for me to knock any stars off.</li>
            <li> first few uses I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well or have much of a taste</li>
            <li> I have eczema and a thyroid problem which means I am just an all around dry person!</li>
            <li> and I felt like it didn&#x27;t last long and dried my lips out.  </li>
            <li> A little gritty</li>
            <li> No real moisturizing effect going on there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Take a wet wash cloth and exfoliate your lips at nite, pat dry, and add a few swipes.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tested on animals like 99.9% of the other cosmetics out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blows away any other balm I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> other times theres no scent of flavor.</li>
            <li> ▒░&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this due to hearing Kandee Johnson rave about it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try out all of the other favors.</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to everyone and will be adding to my collection with other scents/flavors.</li>
            <li> The size is a little annoying in some ways since it can&#x27;t be thrown in a pants pocket without being obtrusive, but it is a handy size for a purse or bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They must have very lonely lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly, I want to mention that some lip balms have broken me out around my mouth and this does not give me any acne and does not leave a gross, greasy, or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t linger very long</li>
            <li> The pink is a little sweeter smelling and tasting than the vanilla</li>
            <li> This bad boy is huge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your average size balm stick...</li>
            <li> this felt like it was sliding down and around.</li>
            <li> this time i got it and it has an odd olive oil scent to it that almost makes me nauseas.</li>
            <li> I also notice that some lip balms will slightly burn my lips as they soak in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say its about 2-3 inches long and about an inch thick.</li>
            <li> Buy it, it helps with: acne and dark under eyes !</li>
            <li> I was into Alba&#x27;s yummy little lip balms.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a little pricey</li>
            <li> Not worth the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, at 12$ a tube, but the tube lasts a very long time, and it&#x27;s the only thing that has ever done my lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also obsessed with all natural makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your Money on this Chap Stick.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s flipping huge which can be annoying if you have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> All the preservatives and other artificial ingredients are actually drying out your lips.</li>
            <li> I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s lip balm</li>
            <li> you usually expect the quality you pay for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself reapplying it excessively.</li>
            <li> However, for the past 6 months they have been chapped and my lips would peel.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the silly size</li>
            <li> but I usually have to reapply every hour or so.</li>
            <li> Even the vanilla scent is natural which took some getting used to because I am so used to artificial smells in beauty products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they don´t offer international shipping (</li>
            <li> The smell was very subtle,  and there&#x27;s not much of a taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all hard or waxy feeling like some balms.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this lip balm is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> The result - my lips wind up worse with winter wind burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this</li>
            <li> I must say I am disappointed because of a few things.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with Treat Beauty.</li>
            <li> random additional info</li>
            <li> guess the cost was a lot expensive because of the quantity</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s where the negative reviews come from, because they seemingly follow her about dropping rude and nasty feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid to now.</li>
            <li> , I have to wonder if something in the product changed, or went &#x27;bad&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so bad I can&#x27;t stand to wear it.</li>
            <li> But if your buying strictly for the smell/taste of the vanilla butter cream you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But, I am usually disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like stuff you could get from the dollar store, horrible!</li>
            <li> I hate sticky lip balm and lip gloss!</li>
            <li> The flavor/scent is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of my favorite internet makeup gals recommended this lip balm, and I was pleased to be able to find it here on Amazon. This is a really nice all-natural lip balm that does have a nice buttercream smell to it.  I do wish, though, that the smell and taste lasted longer; they dissipate pretty quickly when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s not a really thick balm, so I find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other balms I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I do really like it!  It smells great and the large size means it should last forever!</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for the best lip balm for ages and while I&#x27;ve come close, I think I&#x27;ve finally found it! This smells good, feels good, and it will last me forever because of the size. I have more on the way to me so that I can keep one in my purse, bedside table, book bag etc. love this product! so glad Kandee Johnson mentioned it in one of her most recent youtube videos</li>
            <li> I primarily use this product at night and before applying lip gloss or lip stain, and it really is a great product. It smells great too. I love the jumbo size of it, and what girl wouldn&#x27;t love a sweet taste on her lips!</li>
            <li> Love the taste and the lip cream is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. When I use this, I would have to put this on all the time and I just don&#x27;t. The result - my lips wind up worse with winter wind burn. Wish I knew of a product that really works!</li>
            <li> this lasts forever! And tastes amazing. So glad a natural lip balm can be delicious and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it keeps your lips moist the smell and taste is awesome.  This lip balm is huge which is great.  I would highly recommend this product and will definetly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on a review I saw on youtube and I am happy I did.  I find that many lip \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot; are just heavy waxes that sit on your lip but never really moisturize.  This product is a true lip balm providing moisture and softness.  It is not heavy or cakey and has a fabulous scent.  I also find that this balm is a great base underneath my lipstick or gloss.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff feels. It&#x27;s not sticky and glides on smoothly. It has a bit of a gloss to it, which I like. I just wish it had a stronger scent, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this lip balm is not pleasant. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great smell and very good for lips.  Not too oily, not drying.  Just right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to the reviewers that said this is grainy. I have three, one in my bag, one next to the bed and one in my truck none are grainy at all, a big reason I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it as gifts and nobody has ever said anything except they&#x27;re addicted.&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewer that said it&#x27;s like an Elmer glue stick..and something about it getting on her chin...seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big fat lip balm. It&#x27;s certified organic. It has six ingredients. It&#x27;s not tested on animals like 99.9% of the other cosmetics out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works amazing, it&#x27;s not waxy at all. It&#x27;s soft and it softens. It&#x27;s scented but mine certainly does not smell like plastic. It smells like buttercream which in my opinion is a delightful scent to catch a whiff of every so often. It tastes very mildly like vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think 9 bucks is a lot as this thing is tremendous. It blows the jumbo zums away. It blows away any other balm I&#x27;ve ever used and I happen to be a balm addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like maybe there&#x27;s some haters of the particular (and lovely) blogger who recommended it and that&#x27;s where the negative reviews come from, because they seemingly follow her about dropping rude and nasty feedback. They must have very lonely lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reiterate what another reviewer said that it&#x27;s great on skin, I know it works wonders on my cuticles and I&#x27;ve used it as hand moisturizer in a pinch and cheers to that outcome as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what I suggest...you try it for yourself  and form your own opinion. That&#x27;s what I did and I&#x27;m glad I did. My lips are happier and I know my husband&#x27;s are every kiss he steals when I have it on.</li>
            <li> I love both the pink and vanilla buttercream lip balms sold by treat!!! They have a nice light scent, but very delectable and they moisturize wonderfully, best of all the ingredients are all natural. The pink is a little sweeter smelling and tasting than the vanilla but they are both amazing! Some reviewers have mentioned that the scent is either strong or light, the one I got was on the lighter side and I don&#x27;t mind because some scents are overpowering and can give me a headache. I like to smell and feel the balm, but sometimes when it&#x27;s too strong I keep thinking about it and it&#x27;s bothersome, so I&#x27;d rather have a light scent/taste and then forget about it because I know that my lips are moisturized and that&#x27;s what I care about the most, so that&#x27;s why this is perfect for me. My boyfriend also does&#x27;t like a lot of balms or glosses I wear, but he does like these. I loved them so much I did buy a ton as presents for a bunch of my girl friends and had a hard time giving them away because I love them so much haha-- but I love the huge size because it will last forever, so that&#x27;s how I was able to let the others go :) I think the huge size is cute and love showing it off when I use it! I keep one at my office, one in my bag and one on my nightstand so I can use it before I go to bed at night and it keeps my lips moisturized until I wake up! This doesn&#x27;t get a fishy smell over time and the consistency of the balm doesn&#x27;t change over time either, even after I&#x27;ve left one in my car overnight. Lastly, I want to mention that some lip balms have broken me out around my mouth and this does not give me any acne and does not leave a gross, greasy, or sticky feeling. I JUST LOVE IT!!! Thank you Treat, please don&#x27;t ever stop making these!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s lip balm but I recently saw this lip balm on a YouTube video about different make-up products from one of my favorite make-up artists. She highly recommended this product so I decided to give it a try. I was hooked on first application! The ingredients are all natural and feel incredible on your lips. I also really like the big size of the tube, really great product! I will defiantly be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Like stuff you could get from the dollar store, horrible! It does not moisturize and it feels and smells extremely cheap. Would not recommend at all!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels amazing! I&#x27;m addicted to this but because it&#x27;s a big tube I leave it at home and use it when I&#x27;m there.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  An in-depth review video link is posted below!  It&#x27;s a long review but I mention this product first!    [...]</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm junkie and gave tons of lip product and this by far is a favorite!! If you are debating on getting the lip balm, just do it you will not regret it! It makes my lips so soft and last on my lips forever! I love that it is 100% natural, that way I don&#x27;t mind using it on my younge children. Best lip balm I have tried in a long time, I will be purchasing more as back up and to stash in my purse, car, and by my bed!! LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of different lip glosses and lip balms looking for one that would make my lips soft and refreshed. After reading several articles about the ingredients in most lip balms I learned why. All the preservatives and other artificial ingredients are actually drying out your lips. While they feel better for a little while, it is these ingredients that make them feel dried out again.&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm on the other hand has made my lips feel amazing! I have eczema and a thyroid problem which means I am just an all around dry person! This has really helped my lips stop pealing and cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the size! It&#x27;s so large and this makes it easy to find in my purse. I know that this will last me a long time which makes it totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip balm! It smells/tastes delicious and makes my lips so soft! I love that the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few uses I was a little disappointed because it didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize very well or have much of a taste but I&#x27;m thinking maybe the product just needed to warm up or something because it works great now!</li>
            <li> This lip balm smells amazing! I have to keep myself from licking my lips while I have it on. It definitely moisturizes, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle product by any means. I&#x27;ll keep buying for the smell. :)</li>
            <li> This lip balm is AMAZING! The first thing I noticed when I received it in the mail was the smell... very vanilla-cotton candyish. The balm itself is also very nice; it is not sticky, very moist, and you only need one application to have enough of the product on your lips to boot! ANYWAYS- The first time I tried it was when I was going to bed. I applied it to my lips right before I went to sleep and when I woke up the next morning, it was still on my lips! And still moist! (p.s. I really don&#x27;t like the word \\&quot;moist\\&quot;... it grosses me out. Haha. But that is the best word to describe this lip balm!)     I wanted to make sure I reviewed this product because I noticed one reviewer that rated it one star. They said that they might have gotten a defective balm, and they are right. This lip balm is in no way dry and most DEFINITELY has a candy-like sent and flavor!!!    I will by buying again! And will be raving about it to my friends!! &lt;3 (:</li>
            <li> I love the large lip balm and I adore the vanilla smell. I use this before bed every night and it keeps my lips soft and moist . Good buy!</li>
            <li> im realizing ths product is a hit or miss. sometimes you&#x27;ll get it and it will smell and taste just like vanilla frosting. other times theres no scent of flavor. this time i got it and it has an odd olive oil scent to it that almost makes me nauseas. its very moisturizing and stays on your lips for a long time. i just wish the scent and flavor were more consisant since it is a semi-expensive product. you usually expect the quality you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural. It smells and tastes SO GOOD! I just want to eat it and come on, I love the size, makes me smile every time :)</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered this because I love sweet smelling products especially vanilla and buttercream.  I gave this 3 stars because its super moisturizing but has noo smell at all!  Also it&#x27;s flipping huge which can be annoying if you have a small mouth.  The only other lip treatment that was this moisturizing is aquaphor so I may or may not reorder.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used and the tube lasts for ever. I like it because it does not have sunscreen in it and you can use it before bed..Made in the USA. I gave it for stocking stuffers this year and everyone loves to.</li>
            <li> This is really a great moisturizing balm for the lips. But if your buying strictly for the smell/taste of the vanilla butter cream you&#x27;ll be disappointed. The smell was very subtle,  and there&#x27;s not much of a taste. As far as the size it&#x27;s no bigger than the big tubes of Bonne Bell lip balm from the 70/80&#x27;s.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural, just coconut oil,beeswax, vegetable glycerin, shea butter, and natural vanilla flavoring.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fun, yummy and totally free of yucky mineral oils and other byproducts. Everytime I whip it out of my purse someone asks me where I got it.</li>
            <li> I took a star off for the packaging.. Once I received the package, it was obvious what the contents were. It was just thrown in with a piece of plastic wrap. But other than that, the product itself is pretty good. A little gritty but I&#x27;m sure that is because it is made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> ░▒▓█▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀█▓▒░&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * E D I T * * *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought perhaps I should mention the lip balm I have been using for a long while that works for me, and is well worth the money - Pangea Organics in Pyrenees Lavender with Cardamon.  I have tried many lip balms, but this one actually works for me.  Keeps my lips from getting peely, which nothing else has ever done.  It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, at 12$ a tube, but the tube lasts a very long time, and it&#x27;s the only thing that has ever done my lips right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;░▒▓█▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀█▓▒░&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this due to hearing Kandee Johnson rave about it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised at first sniff, as it does not smell at all like any kind of candy.  It smelled *exactly* like something, but it took me forever to figure out what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cabbage Patch Kid.  Smells exactly like my bald baby boy 1985 Coleco Cabbage Patch Kid.  It&#x27;s a good smell, like baby powder, but not a smell I want in my lip product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe Kandee is a liar, and even with scent being as (very!) subjective as it is, I have to wonder if something in the product changed, or went &#x27;bad&#x27;.  I dunno.  I reeeally wanted to try their new coconut one, but.... I&#x27;m too afraid to now.</li>
            <li> This review is for Treat Soft Candy vanilla buttercream jumbo lip balm. Ingredients: Coconut oil, beeswax, Kosher vegetable glycerin, Shea butter, Natural vanilla flavoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is how huge this product is: 0.50 oz vs. 0.15 oz in your average lip balm. Over 3x as much! This would explain why it costs more for this product. When I first applied this product, my lips were instantly hydrated with a smooth layer of vanilla. The scent is subtle and disappears pretty quickly, which I consider to be a good thing. Smelling the product directly in the tube, there is a slight plastic smell to the balm (my only negative comment), but it&#x27;s not enough for me to knock any stars off. I also notice that some lip balms will slightly burn my lips as they soak in. This product does not do this at all. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping on your night stand and putting on before bed. Its jumbo size also means it won&#x27;t get lost amongst all the night creams and foot creams on my night stand. In the mornings, my lips are super soft and still hydrated. Great value and awesome product.</li>
            <li> I was always having a problem with extremely dry lips and I think I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market. I was told by a dermatologist to look for a product with shea butter in it and discovered this product. This lip balm works well and totally solved my dry lip problem. It also tastes like dessert with no calories.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this chunky lip balm! You get so much product in this tube and it smells DEVINE!! It says &amp;#34;Vanilla buttercream soft candy&amp;#34; but it smells like a yummy Carnival cotton candy or something! It&#x27;s smooth and not waxy or tacky. I hate sticky lip balm and lip gloss! Yuck. Love this one though and I love that I can feel good about the ingredients I&#x27;m putting on my lips (especially since it&#x27;s so yummy that I can&#x27;t help but lick it off ) Can&#x27;t wait to try out all of the other favors.</li>
            <li> Great, big balm! I would just like a non &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; option</li>
            <li> I do love this balm but after having for a few months it has developed a little odor to it, which isn&#x27;t pleasant....still works good just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I received my lip balm yesterday and love it.  The balm goes on smoothly, is super emollient and feels nice on my lips.  It&#x27;s not at all hard or waxy feeling like some balms.  The vanilla flavor tastes nice, too.  As a plus, the product is certified organic and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with Treat Beauty. I am a Chapstick horder. I have to try every lip balm that I see. But, I am usually disappointed. That&#x27;s not the case with the jumbo lip balms. They are perfect for me. For starters, this balm is much larger than normal. When I use this product my lips feel nourished and healthy. And, they smell amazing! The vanilla buttercream smells like fresh icing! I did receive this product at a discount. But, I will purchase more at full price!</li>
            <li> This came so fast, smells like heaven!!!!!!!!! Buy it, it helps with: acne and dark under eyes ! i love it so much , SO BIG !</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, it smells good feels good when on and make my lips soft. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The texture is grainy which is to be expected with most of the ingredients in it from repetitive heating/cooling. The flavor/scent is awful. It smells like sugar and plastic. Gross.</li>
            <li> This lipbalm is a whopping .5 oz, which is awesome when most are .15 and around $3 a tube.  The smell is exactly like buttercream frosting and has a texture that is a nice middle ground of a thick balm and the smooth, slickness of a thin one.  And I love how the ingredients are natural and simple.  Great for any lip balm lover!</li>
            <li> I own probably 20 different lip balms, because I&#x27;m very picky. This is by far my favorite. I prefer this scent over the coconut, but they&#x27;re both good.</li>
            <li> Yum, when I received this it smelled so great I wanted to eat it rather than wear it as a lip balm.  : )  The Treat Soft Candy jumbo lip balm was scented like vanilla buttercream.  The lip balm is oversized, while normal chapticks are the size of your pinkie, this one by Treat is the size of your thumb! This nice size not only gives more to use, but also I can always find it in my purse.  The lip balm is all natural, and very soft on your lips. It has organic coconut oil in it, which I personally know is great for moisturizing your skin and lips.  I have used it all day, and love it.  I am glad I made the choice to purchase this at a reduced cost in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Yummy!!!!!! I know it&#x27;s lip balm, but it also tastes great too! It&#x27;s not your average size balm stick... It&#x27;s super size ;) kept my lips smooth and hydrated so I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest/unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Taste and smell so good. I love these jumbo lip balms</li>
            <li> This is a great lip balm  You don&#x27;t have to use it as often to keep your lips moist.. A bit pricey, but good.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! I LOVE this lip balm! It is SO BIG (you need your whole hand to hold it because it&#x27;s more than 3x larger than other lip balms!) and feels so soft and nice on your lips!  It has a very smooth and silky texture when applied and the smell is great.  It makes me want to eat it!  I really can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this balm. It&#x27;ll last a long time and I couldn&#x27;t possibly lose this in my purse! *I received a sample of this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*</li>
            <li> This tastes exactly like buttercream frosting. It&#x27;s incredibly soft and lickably delish. I would highly recommend this to any female in my life. Perfect gift and great for stocking stuffers too.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since I am a Chapstick addict but it was just ok. The smell is nice and I like the jumbo sized tube but I used it all day at work and I felt like it didn&#x27;t last long and dried my lips out.  Good for occasional use I just wish it had better staying power...</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite chapstick ever &amp; I got it on Kandee Johnson&#x27;s reccommendation. It&#x27;s mostly coconut oil &amp; really moisturizes lips SUPER well. I always reach for this at nighttime &amp; during the day as well. Moisturizes even better than my Bath &amp; Body Works 8 hour recovery balm. It doesn&#x27;t smell super buttercreamy or vanilla at all, which is a major bummer since that&#x27;s my main reason for purchasing but I&#x27;ve come to love the chapstick so much and will definitely be buying this again! Also, you can use this on your skin since all the ingredients are great for skin! Definitely will be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful big size and makes your lips silky smooth. Smells so yummy! Really, a 7 year old loved it so much she swiped it. Must replace it asap, next time I am buying atleast 2.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is huge! If you&#x27;re the type of person that never finishes their chapstick before they lose it, this is the lip balm for you. It&#x27;s about the size of a glue stick-- still totally portable and perfect for throwing in a purse if you&#x27;re on the go. The scent is a wonderful vanilla buttercream that&#x27;s subtle and not at all overpowering. The formula is super soft and long-lasting. I don&#x27;t find myself reapplying it excessively. I love that it&#x27;s organic and Leaping Bunny certified as cruelty-free. I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Wow!! First off the presentation is beautiful and right away I noticed the Cruelty Free bunny logo. Love that!  All organic and yes my lips are super soft from 1st application. Can&#x27;t wait to try more 💜</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lip balms. I&#x27;ve tried many organics. However, for the past 6 months they have been chapped and my lips would peel. I finally decided to go back to my original brand... Chapstick. It&#x27;s the only one that makes me lips smooth. I purchased this at a discount for my unbiased review. Not too fond of it. Does not make my lips smooth and leaves a wet feeling. Three stars instead of two because my 11 year old enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> This bad boy is huge. I&#x27;d say its about 2-3 inches long and about an inch thick. This keeps the product less portable, however it really is an awesome chapstick. I&#x27;ve noticed after using it a while, I can go longer without chapsticks if I have to which means it is actually conditioning my lips and not making me need more and more of it all the time. The smell is subtle and not too ridiculously sweet like most candy lip balms. The formulas isn&#x27;t greasy or anything, its soft. I really like this chapstick. My only concern is the silly size BUT that size is what is going to make it last a long time and makes the cost worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm, it&#x27;s very large size so it doesn&#x27;t get lost in the bottom of my purse. It makes your lips super soft,  I&#x27;m going to buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I have tried so many lip products that have dried my lips out, that I could write a book on it. This is super moisturizing on your lips. Best of all smells amazing! Like putting a Vanilla Cupcake on your lips. Smell isn&#x27;t too over powering. Recommend this to any age. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I may have received an old lip balm, but there was no scent or flavor which was mostly the reason I purchased it. It moisturizes though, but feels kind of greasy. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This is great!  It smells and tastes wonderful.  I have put it on my lips every night since it arrived.  It lightly covers my lips making them feel moisturized and soft.  A great winter product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful and natural! I use it all the time, softens and smells great! I need to get more!</li>
            <li> I made a second purchase of 4 more for the convenience; for my purse, car and various locations. I love this balm.</li>
            <li> The best chapstick ever! Love the flavor!</li>
            <li> Awesome lip balm. Natural ingredients makes this purchase a plus. The lip balm goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. I wish it lasted a bit longer on my lips but I usually have to reapply every hour or so. The smell and flavor is great as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the recommendations from friends and reviews. I really wanted to like this but certain things just threw me wayyyy off.&lt;br /&gt;First off...the price...$10...My opinion? Pricey.&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging, Its like a Elmer&#x27;s glue stick but lip balm. Find it difficult to be precise, not that lip balms need to go on precisely but I prefer my lip balm to stay on my lips...not my chin.&lt;br /&gt;As for quality and texture. I felt that the product was greasy. Waxy I can handle but this felt like it was sliding down and around. Also, when applying it felt a bit grainy. Rubbing my lips together didn&#x27;t help \\&quot;melting\\&quot; or softening the grainy parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, I personally feel is off putting. It smells like plastic, sugar, and candy. It&#x27;s not a strong fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t linger very long but I personally can&#x27;t stand it even during the initial application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just random additional info, I lost a chunk of lip balm because it was dry/cracked when I first opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would rather stick to EOS.</li>
            <li> I like this the flavor and smell of this lip balm, but I wish it were a bit more moisturizing and lasted longer.  (And, wish I could get it in a regular size . . . )</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different lip balms, glosses, lipstick, and other various lip items. I really like this lip balm. The stick is truly jumbo, in the real sense of the word. The taste is very light and natural. It goes on very smooth. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or thick. It makes my lips feel silky and soft. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was NOT expecting the tube to be so huge. It&#x27;s literally the same size as a glue stick!! I made lip balm and sold all natural vegan lip balm for many years and sold it as a business ...this stuff is almost identical to what I made. I&#x27;ve been a hard-core Burts Bees fan ever since I stopped creating my own, but no longer. No shine, great light scent, fabulous size, super moisturizing and addicting!! Way to go, Treat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a self confessed lip balm junkie. I&#x27;m serious. I must have a lip balm within arms reach at all times in every room of my house and car. I&#x27;m also obsessed with all natural makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I found Treat I was into Alba&#x27;s yummy little lip balms. But this has changed all that. It&#x27;s so soft and smells wonderful! The scent is light, not overpowering but it&#x27;s delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the buttercream my second favorite is her newer coconut flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these so much I bought 8 at once to give to my best girlfriends and to stash in every corner of my house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love these!! And they&#x27;re all natural and made here in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they&#x27;re a little pricey but these things are HUGE!! It makes my old lip balms seem so tiny now!! Apparently size really does matter ;) these are so big they last a really long time, even with lots of use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Feels so soft when worn, smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I had never purchased a lip balm by Treat and I was very interested at trying one.&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the good reviews, I decided to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;Treat completely exceed what I was expecting&lt;br /&gt;So first off, this is a great lip balm for the winter ( it had lot more dry )&lt;br /&gt;I think the first thing lots of people would notice is that it looks like a glue stick.&lt;br /&gt;Next the scent is remarkable and smells like vanilla. 100% organic so that is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizers great and it literally makes your lips soft&lt;br /&gt;I guess the cost was a lot expensive because of the quantity and I know I wouldn&#x27;t be running out of it very soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Treat for making this amazing lip balm!</li>
            <li> I was super stoked to get this, I heard great things about it. It smells great, it goes on soft and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t nourish my lips. Minuets after I apply it, my lips are dry again. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This smells and tastes good, but it&#x27;s a bit too big to carry in my purse.  I use it at home, especially right before bedtime, to keep my lips moist.  The price is good especially for such a large lip balm.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my $13.00 lip balm, $8.00 with $5.00 shipping. I was so bummed when I went to smell the sweet smell of Vanilla Butter Cream. No sent. I was using it anyway since I just paid the most I ever paid for a Lip Balm. Over the next 3 days I developed very dry chapped lips. My lips were burning. I went back to my Avalon Organics Vitamin C Lip Balm. It smells amazing like super yummy Satsuma. I highly recommend it. It is only 4-5 bucks. It is .25 oz. Just saying try it. Don&#x27;t waste your Money on this Chap Stick.</li>
            <li> First thing, this balm smells absolutely delicious!! I put it on every night before bed and the next morning, baby soft lips!! Also, It&#x27;s a huge tube so should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm without any waxy feel and it lasts forever! The flavor is not too strong and nice. While the tube is large, it makes it easy to find in my purse!</li>
            <li> I was a bit put off when I received my order. First of all it doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla buttercream in my opinion. Secondly if doesnt moisturize very well at all. The scent is so bad I can&#x27;t stand to wear it. I was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Taste great!&lt;br /&gt;Size is extra large... ++&lt;br /&gt;Keeps lips moist!!&lt;br /&gt;The prior reviews have said it all.... a great produc</li>
            <li> I have been trying everything this winter to bring my severely chapped lips back to life. None of the hundreds of balms I tried did much for me. Maybelline Baby Lips was about the only product that helped, but my lips still weren&#x27;t completely healed. After seeing a recommendation from a fav beauty blogger (Kandee Johnson) I decided to give to a try. This balm works absolute wonders! Lasts about 3 hours on my lips, but I still reapply often. The stick is ginormous, so it&#x27;ll last forever, and the scent is divine. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this balm! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so silky and goes on so smooth.  I like that all the ingredients are natural.  Even the vanilla scent is natural which took some getting used to because I am so used to artificial smells in beauty products. This is great.</li>
            <li> Extra large, pricey, it lasts forever, but applying it looks pretty silly. It&#x27;s really massive... I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. On the up side, it smells/tastes like buttercream sugar.</li>
            <li> I have dryness-prone lips and have been on the hunt for the best lip balm formula for a long time.  This one absolutely does the trick for me!  The texture is a nice balance between slick and waxy and gives lips a healthy sheen.  My lips stay hydrated for many hours after the balm wears off from drinking or eating which seems to be a rare feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent/flavor is delicious - it has a mildly sweet flavor if you accidentally lick some off and it has a light, creamy vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm tube itself is HUGE, so you&#x27;re definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth - this is as much balm as at least 2-3 normal-sized tubes.  The size is a little annoying in some ways since it can&#x27;t be thrown in a pants pocket without being obtrusive, but it is a handy size for a purse or bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the quality is exceptional, and I would highly recommend this brand of lip balm!</li>
            <li> product is ok, i like it but dont love it, really smooth and glides very nice on my lips</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great! I enjoy using it and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s so huge.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! First of all, it smells delicious. And not in that slap-you-in-the-face sugary sweet smell but this soft cotton candy-esqe way. It also tastes sweet! I bought it for my 4 year old daughter because I won&#x27;t let her use gross chapstick. The formula is mostly organic shea butter and some other great organic ingredients. It&#x27;s not only free of gross chemicals, it actually helps your lips as opposed to petroleum jelly or mineral oil (fun fact, folks: crude oil bi-products aren&#x27;t actually moisturizing or good for lips!)</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! A girl on you tube told everyone this product was her favorite, so I decided try it, I love the vanilla scent, which is my favorite. It makes my lips soft and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> This lip balm works wonders for dry and chapped lips. It makes your lips feel really soft and smooth...and the best part, it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product smells so good I could eat it. I use this product on more than my lips. I use it on my hands and cucticales</li>
            <li> WHEN I WEAR IT AND TALK IVE HAD GUYS GO HMMMM YOU SMELL  LIKE CAKE HAAAAA...I ASKED IF THAT WAS GOOD AND THEY SAY YES!!! I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND GOING TO BUY ANOTHER TO PUT NEXT TO MY BED AT NIGH TIME :) VERY MOISTURIZING AND DOESN&#x27;T TAKE BAD AT ALL!!!</li>
            <li> Omg....This is big for the price I love the favor and how it goes on very smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is huge and such great taste.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but feels like wax on my lips.  No real moisturizing effect going on there.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for more..not very emollient</li>
            <li> I just need to share: this is an ammaaaaazing product. I am a lip gloss/balm/stick-aholic and I have  tried so many lip treatments. I get seriously dry lips and I&#x27;ve been trying to steer away from petroleum based products. That means most of the stuff market is a no no. I got this and the first time I tried it I was in Love!  A lot of products ( esp burts  bees, carmex, and vasaline) tends to sit on top of the lip but this seeped in and left my lips feeling soft! Not goopy and soft... That&#x27;s worth more than $10 to me and I will buy again if I ever run out. Give it a try. Take a wet wash cloth and exfoliate your lips at nite, pat dry, and add a few swipes.   Updated post: I cannot figure out what happened to my lip balm!  I was psyched to finally have a product that I loved but a few months into using this tube the products seemed to have separated and now the 90% of product that remains is waxy and grainy. The other tubes I&#x27;ve purchased are fine, but the vanilla one is  gross now. I might Contact the manufacturer do a return. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by this lip balm. It smells great and goes on smoothly without chunks or a super waxy feeling. I can go through a normal chapstick in less than a week so I am so glad this is a jumbo sized product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent! Smells good. The scent is very light. Little to no taste and softens nicely. Perfect amount of moisture, not too greasy. Recommend by Kandee Johnson. Thank Kandee! :)</li>
            <li> I received the lip balm this week and have been using it. It has a wonderful, light vanilla fragrance. It is amazingly effective and I am having no allergic reaction - something I tend to have with most of these types of products. My lips were dry, cracked and bleeding before I started using this, now they are completely healed, soft with no cracked areas. I like this so much I am going to order some for Christmas stocking stuffers, and an extra one for myself. This is a generously sized tube, great value!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Exactly as described and exactly what my chapped lips need. Will probably try the coconut cream next!</li>
            <li> May be the best lip balm I have ever used.  It has it all, scent, emolliency, feel on the lipst and more!</li>
            <li> Great product. completely organic! Unfortunately they don´t offer international shipping (europe).&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I would have ordered more...The smell is like a normal vanilla lip balm -  but still just great! I use it every night</li>
            <li> I love the size of the lip balm, it smells okay, I had read a review about how yummy it smelled...not so true... and I&#x27;m sure I wont run out any time soon...It goes on nicely but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long, maybe I should have picked a different flavor, but I wont purchase again...</li>
            <li> I put this on and I can still feel it hours later. It lasts and makes my lips very soft. I can smell the vanilla and it is such a soothing scent. It is a very large stick so it should last a while. I will recommend it to everyone and will be adding to my collection with other scents/flavors.</li>
            <li> This is a great flavor, a great lip balm, and well, my favorite.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lip balm because a YouTuber touted this as her most favorite lip balm, I also saw a ton of amazing reviews on this here on Amazon. I must say I am disappointed because of a few things. First off in the scent. This to me smells like any other normal vanilla balm, definitely nothing special, and I feel like most people are getting this because you are expecting an amazing smell! Also I feel like this does not wear a super long time. With that being said, the ingredients are great, they are natural and they don&#x27;t test on animals which is important to me. I don&#x27;t think this is worth 8 bucks and I probably would&#x27;t purchase this again, but with the size of it, I don&#x27;t think I will need to!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price! Very grainy and nothing special</li>
            <li> I like how it feels and it tastes delicious, but I don&#x27;t feel like it soaks into my lips enough. This is very jumbo though, great size for the price, HUGE!</li>
