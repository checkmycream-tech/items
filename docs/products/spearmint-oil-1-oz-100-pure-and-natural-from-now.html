            <li>Nice spearmint smell.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle...</li>
            <li>I bought this to try to make my own oraMD.</li>
            <li>It smells really good have not been able to use yet.</li>
            <li>so I opted to do my own mixture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very versatile and smells great!</li>
            <li>Have not tried this particular oil in another brand, but this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It was sent to me quickly and wrapped great.</li>
            <li>very strong</li>
            <li>the oil has a very good smell and our camper will smell very fresn in the spring.</li>
            <li>And a nice refreshing minty tingle.  </li>
            <li>Also, out of frustration with flaky atomizers we&#x27;ve been using for fragrance in the bathroom, we made our own spearmint water spray and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I made some natural lip balm with it and it smelled soooo good and tasted even yummier with each lick of my lips!!</li>
            <li>We put it in spray bottles that adjust to a very fine mist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy i found it on amazon and for such a great price from this seller.</li>
            <li>The first bottle  I ordered was great.</li>
            <li>Great oil and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Great scent and good for general use.  </li>
            <li>Good product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and in good order.</li>
            <li>I mixed with eucalyptus and lavender and it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>my mix will be more concentrated.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this again when I need more.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>love the sent</li>
            <li>Okay, but something off in the aroma.</li>
            <li>I love spearmint, so this was a must try.</li>
            <li>I love metromint water but not the price.  </li>
            <li>I even tried using more drops and got nothing.</li>
            <li>RHS oil is much more viscous and it takes about 15 seconds for 1 drop to fall.  </li>
            <li>My dad loves his spearmint flavored ice cream :)</li>
            <li>We like the fragrance even better than the peppermint.  </li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING..</li>
            <li>Any one that likes spearmint, will LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>More Info ?</li>
            <li>I love working on aromatherapy products.  </li>
            <li>I love spearmint and peppermint and look forward to using it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love spearmint.</li>
            <li>Spearmint should NOT be used by anyone who may be pregnant, otherwise it is generally a very safe herb.</li>
            <li>Mild scent - mixes nicely with orange and cedarwood.</li>
            <li>Its pure and the smell is good.</li>
            <li>the product came fast and the size is good for the cost.  </li>
            <li>The oil kills bacteria that causes odor...and who doesn&#x27;t love the fresh smell of spearmint!  </li>
            <li>The added stopper make it easy to just shake the amount I need.</li>
            <li>This stuff is as strong as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Strong stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this spearmint oil very much and would recommend it to everyone. :)</li>
            <li>(peppermint oil actually works better for sore muscles, but the strong scent is off-putting to people when I&#x27;m out and about, so I use the spearmint, which people find pleasant...</li>
            <li>Very Strong &amp; pure!</li>
            <li>So far it has worked perfectly with only one drop as it is surprisingly potent</li>
            <li>Put a few drops in a spray bottle and you have the best smelling mouse repellant on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also smells great mixed with tangerine in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Like most NOW essential oils, the staying power is lacking a bit, but what&#x27;s there is good.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>NOW Foods essential oils are very good, pure, therapeutic grade oils.</li>
            <li>i chose to add some coconut oil as it also works to clean teeth along with the rest of ingredients which included distilled water, grape seed extract &amp; grapefruit seed extract.</li>
            <li>This is such a pleasant fragrance we have used it for our cars as well as our bathroom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is spot on, sweet and minty clean.</li>
            <li>I must say, I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>what more can I say, it&#x27;s really spearminty.</li>
            <li>I use this along with other oils for a mouth freshener and to brush my teeth works great</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li>This is very potent oil - you definitely don&#x27;t want to over do</li>
            <li>Their essential oils are high quality at a great price.  </li>
            <li>One of my new favorite oils to use in my diffuser.</li>
            <li>Next project for me is to make it into a refreshing shampoo!</li>
            <li>It is my favorite scent we&#x27;ve used so far!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li>And the Now brand is very affordable and suits my purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve been struggling with NOW&#x27;s rose hip seed oil because they use the same dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a smaller bottle, but its a nice size amount.  </li>
            <li>This product exceeded my expectations, had the aroma of fresh spearmint</li>
            <li>I mix this with my cologne before going to work and it gives me a really nice fresh smell most of the day on just a few drops to the wrist.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet and shoes fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is intense - two drops in a bottle of Root Bear is enough to give it a *STRONG* flavor (I recommend one drop * 2 liter for a nice minty taste - much like Birch Bear)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not economical and it&#x27;s my favorite way to drink more water.  </li>
            <li>I find drinking spearmint tea (made from fresh or dried leaves) is a great way to perform a gentle body cleanse.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but nice that it can be added to another order for free shipping.</li>
            <li>It tastes very much like my spearmint metromint at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Instead of purchasing spearmint tea I decided it world probably be more economical to order this pure spearmint essential oil.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and you have an oil diffuser (I had run out of bamboo at first though,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the NOW brand and will look into buying different essential oils/reordering this one from them in the future.</li>
            <li>I use it for my diffuser, in my bubble bath and in my hot tea.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>How Many Sticks Of Gum To Equal ?</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>Thanks Again Amazon !</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know the exact liquid proportions used to make oraMD, so I was unsuccessful at it.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it in a bee supplement but had to open it as I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Most of these ingredients can be found in commercial products, however the products in the marketplace also contain grain alcohol, an ingredient that is harmful for the dog</li>
            <li>It smells exactly what you think it smells like.</li>
            <li>This oil has such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>We buy many of them and use or take (supplements) them daily.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of spearmint in general and used this in my diffuser to help with my first trimester nausea.</li>
            <li>but the smell is strong enough to not need them).</li>
            <li>Bottle comes different than pictured but the smell is strong and heavenly.</li>
            <li>Kept all sorts of bugs away, mosquitoes, flying ants, and I even noticed the deer flies seemed to leave me alone more, not to mention I didn&#x27;t get a single tick.</li>
            <li>I am VERY picky on getting PURE products to use on the hives.</li>
            <li>This seemed to be just what it said it was, I am not familiar enough with essential oils to comment on quality, but I am very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>much cooler than the peppermint oil</li>
            <li>I have yet to experiment too much with it.  </li>
            <li>After much research, I chose to purchase the NOW foods brand of spearmint oil.  </li>
            <li>16 oz is just too much for my needs.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of Spearmint.  </li>
            <li>This worked very well to keep mice away.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the stopper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also has many other uses.  </li>
            <li>My favorite use for the oil is freezing it in ice cubes, then putting them down the garbage disposal.  </li>
            <li>This spearmint oil is fresh and strong, and the one-ounce bottle means that it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use spearmint in several essential oil master blends, but my favorite use is to add a couple drops to an ounce of coconut oil blended with baking soda.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest owning this oil for your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Even though this is not an organic oil, NOW products are always high grade.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly reccomend and buy again to use.</li>
            <li>Says 100% pure and natural.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very knowledgeable about natural living and supplement products.</li>
            <li>Now products are always fresh and the only limit is your imagination.</li>
            <li>So far I do love it, but wish it was a little stronger</li>
            <li>When I get a new article of clothing and want to remove the fold marks I spritz it with the oil water and put it in the dryer for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and yet it&#x27;s been gentile enough in hot water as tea and on my skin neat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spearmint is known for being an antiseptic, antispasmodic, disinfectant, carminative, cephalic, emenagogue,  stimulant, restorative, insectacide, decongestant (moves fluid), and becomes the menthol content is low it is child friendly.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of any essential oil</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to leave it in direct contact with your skin, however throughout the summer months I would put 2 drops of spearmint oil, and 2 drops of citronella oil on a paper towel, and clip it to my waistband.</li>
            <li>I use these oils in natural soaps I make as well as linen and air spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also acts as a natural mosquito</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to chemical smells, doesn&#x27;t want to deal with mice, has kids.</li>
            <li>(Even though my skin is sensitive, I can usually put it right on my skin without any adverse reaction, but I would spot-test it first or diffuse it with a carrier</li>
            <li>for my own preference the smell is very subtle and I prefer the now peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyway, you can use this as as air freshener and for other uses that I can&#x27;t think of right now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone looking to use essential oils.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll definitely buy again and do highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>MAJOR improvement.</li>
            <li>I could barely get two drops out and the aroma would make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spearmint is supposedly the more gentle \\&quot;cousin\\&quot; of peppermint oil, and, as such and if I&#x27;m not feeling up to the strength of peppermint oil, I use a few small dabs of this on my temples to help with migraines or a bit around my nose to help with congestion.  </li>
            <li>it is suggested to add with another oil rather than use straight because of its extreme concentration..</li>
            <li>It helps with stress relief if you dab a bit around your temples, and you can also add a few drops to the bottom of your hot shower to help de-congest your sinuses.  </li>
            <li>Also a few drops in a hot bath for invigoration.  </li>
            <li>This second bottle I ordered barely smelled and definitely was not invigorating or stimulating on my scalp.</li>
            <li>along with the other ingredients it seems to be working..being highly concentrated it takes a very tiny bit.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> come to think of it, we didn&#x27;t have ghosts before I used this oil either so, it may not be good for banishing spirits</li>
            <li> but it still smells good.</li>
            <li> My sons used this on tooth picks and they loved it.</li>
            <li> Good oil to use in diffuser.</li>
            <li> Good value and quality.</li>

            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> It feels amazing on your scalp and when added to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am using to make my own toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great add some drops in water as mouthwash or a on the go toothpaste the best, some drops for stomach discomfort last forever</li>
            <li> Nice spearmint smell.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle...</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to make my own oraMD.</li>
            <li> It smells really good have not been able to use yet.</li>
            <li> so I opted to do my own mixture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very versatile and smells great!</li>
            <li> Have not tried this particular oil in another brand, but this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It was sent to me quickly and wrapped great.</li>
            <li> very strong</li>
            <li> the oil has a very good smell and our camper will smell very fresn in the spring.</li>
            <li> And a nice refreshing minty tingle.  </li>
            <li> Also, out of frustration with flaky atomizers we&#x27;ve been using for fragrance in the bathroom, we made our own spearmint water spray and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I made some natural lip balm with it and it smelled soooo good and tasted even yummier with each lick of my lips!!</li>
            <li> We put it in spray bottles that adjust to a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i found it on amazon and for such a great price from this seller.</li>
            <li> The first bottle  I ordered was great.</li>
            <li> Great oil and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great scent and good for general use.  </li>
            <li> Good product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and in good order.</li>
            <li> I mixed with eucalyptus and lavender and it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> my mix will be more concentrated.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> love the sent</li>
            <li> Okay, but something off in the aroma.</li>
            <li> I love spearmint, so this was a must try.</li>
            <li> I love metromint water but not the price.  </li>
            <li> I even tried using more drops and got nothing.</li>
            <li> RHS oil is much more viscous and it takes about 15 seconds for 1 drop to fall.  </li>
            <li> My dad loves his spearmint flavored ice cream :)</li>
            <li> We like the fragrance even better than the peppermint.  </li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING..</li>
            <li> Any one that likes spearmint, will LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> Love It</li>
            <li> More Info ?</li>
            <li> I love working on aromatherapy products.  </li>
            <li> I love spearmint and peppermint and look forward to using it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love spearmint.</li>
            <li> Spearmint should NOT be used by anyone who may be pregnant, otherwise it is generally a very safe herb.</li>
            <li> Mild scent - mixes nicely with orange and cedarwood.</li>
            <li> Its pure and the smell is good.</li>
            <li> the product came fast and the size is good for the cost.  </li>
            <li> The oil kills bacteria that causes odor...and who doesn&#x27;t love the fresh smell of spearmint!  </li>
            <li> The added stopper make it easy to just shake the amount I need.</li>
            <li> This stuff is as strong as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Strong stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this spearmint oil very much and would recommend it to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> (peppermint oil actually works better for sore muscles, but the strong scent is off-putting to people when I&#x27;m out and about, so I use the spearmint, which people find pleasant...</li>
            <li> Very Strong &amp; pure!</li>
            <li> So far it has worked perfectly with only one drop as it is surprisingly potent</li>
            <li> Put a few drops in a spray bottle and you have the best smelling mouse repellant on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also smells great mixed with tangerine in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Like most NOW essential oils, the staying power is lacking a bit, but what&#x27;s there is good.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> NOW Foods essential oils are very good, pure, therapeutic grade oils.</li>
            <li> i chose to add some coconut oil as it also works to clean teeth along with the rest of ingredients which included distilled water, grape seed extract &amp; grapefruit seed extract.</li>
            <li> This is such a pleasant fragrance we have used it for our cars as well as our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is spot on, sweet and minty clean.</li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> what more can I say, it&#x27;s really spearminty.</li>
            <li> I use this along with other oils for a mouth freshener and to brush my teeth works great</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li> This is very potent oil - you definitely don&#x27;t want to over do</li>
            <li> Their essential oils are high quality at a great price.  </li>
            <li> One of my new favorite oils to use in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Next project for me is to make it into a refreshing shampoo!</li>
            <li> It is my favorite scent we&#x27;ve used so far!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> And the Now brand is very affordable and suits my purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been struggling with NOW&#x27;s rose hip seed oil because they use the same dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a smaller bottle, but its a nice size amount.  </li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations, had the aroma of fresh spearmint</li>
            <li> I mix this with my cologne before going to work and it gives me a really nice fresh smell most of the day on just a few drops to the wrist.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet and shoes fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is intense - two drops in a bottle of Root Bear is enough to give it a *STRONG* flavor (I recommend one drop * 2 liter for a nice minty taste - much like Birch Bear)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not economical and it&#x27;s my favorite way to drink more water.  </li>
            <li> I find drinking spearmint tea (made from fresh or dried leaves) is a great way to perform a gentle body cleanse.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but nice that it can be added to another order for free shipping.</li>
            <li> It tastes very much like my spearmint metromint at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Instead of purchasing spearmint tea I decided it world probably be more economical to order this pure spearmint essential oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and you have an oil diffuser (I had run out of bamboo at first though,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the NOW brand and will look into buying different essential oils/reordering this one from them in the future.</li>
            <li> I use it for my diffuser, in my bubble bath and in my hot tea.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> How Many Sticks Of Gum To Equal ?</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> Thanks Again Amazon !</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t know the exact liquid proportions used to make oraMD, so I was unsuccessful at it.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it in a bee supplement but had to open it as I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Most of these ingredients can be found in commercial products, however the products in the marketplace also contain grain alcohol, an ingredient that is harmful for the dog</li>
            <li> It smells exactly what you think it smells like.</li>
            <li> This oil has such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> We buy many of them and use or take (supplements) them daily.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of spearmint in general and used this in my diffuser to help with my first trimester nausea.</li>
            <li> but the smell is strong enough to not need them).</li>
            <li> Bottle comes different than pictured but the smell is strong and heavenly.</li>
            <li> Kept all sorts of bugs away, mosquitoes, flying ants, and I even noticed the deer flies seemed to leave me alone more, not to mention I didn&#x27;t get a single tick.</li>
            <li> I am VERY picky on getting PURE products to use on the hives.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be just what it said it was, I am not familiar enough with essential oils to comment on quality, but I am very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> much cooler than the peppermint oil</li>
            <li> I have yet to experiment too much with it.  </li>
            <li> After much research, I chose to purchase the NOW foods brand of spearmint oil.  </li>
            <li> 16 oz is just too much for my needs.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of Spearmint.  </li>
            <li> This worked very well to keep mice away.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the stopper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also has many other uses.  </li>
            <li> My favorite use for the oil is freezing it in ice cubes, then putting them down the garbage disposal.  </li>
            <li> This spearmint oil is fresh and strong, and the one-ounce bottle means that it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use spearmint in several essential oil master blends, but my favorite use is to add a couple drops to an ounce of coconut oil blended with baking soda.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest owning this oil for your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Even though this is not an organic oil, NOW products are always high grade.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly reccomend and buy again to use.</li>
            <li> Says 100% pure and natural.  </li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very knowledgeable about natural living and supplement products.</li>
            <li> Now products are always fresh and the only limit is your imagination.</li>
            <li> So far I do love it, but wish it was a little stronger</li>
            <li> When I get a new article of clothing and want to remove the fold marks I spritz it with the oil water and put it in the dryer for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s been gentile enough in hot water as tea and on my skin neat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spearmint is known for being an antiseptic, antispasmodic, disinfectant, carminative, cephalic, emenagogue,  stimulant, restorative, insectacide, decongestant (moves fluid), and becomes the menthol content is low it is child friendly.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any essential oil</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to leave it in direct contact with your skin, however throughout the summer months I would put 2 drops of spearmint oil, and 2 drops of citronella oil on a paper towel, and clip it to my waistband.</li>
            <li> I use these oils in natural soaps I make as well as linen and air spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also acts as a natural mosquito</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to chemical smells, doesn&#x27;t want to deal with mice, has kids.</li>
            <li> (Even though my skin is sensitive, I can usually put it right on my skin without any adverse reaction, but I would spot-test it first or diffuse it with a carrier</li>
            <li> for my own preference the smell is very subtle and I prefer the now peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyway, you can use this as as air freshener and for other uses that I can&#x27;t think of right now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone looking to use essential oils.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll definitely buy again and do highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> MAJOR improvement.</li>
            <li> I could barely get two drops out and the aroma would make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spearmint is supposedly the more gentle \\&quot;cousin\\&quot; of peppermint oil, and, as such and if I&#x27;m not feeling up to the strength of peppermint oil, I use a few small dabs of this on my temples to help with migraines or a bit around my nose to help with congestion.  </li>
            <li> it is suggested to add with another oil rather than use straight because of its extreme concentration..</li>
            <li> It helps with stress relief if you dab a bit around your temples, and you can also add a few drops to the bottom of your hot shower to help de-congest your sinuses.  </li>
            <li> Also a few drops in a hot bath for invigoration.  </li>
            <li> This second bottle I ordered barely smelled and definitely was not invigorating or stimulating on my scalp.</li>
            <li> along with the other ingredients it seems to be working..being highly concentrated it takes a very tiny bit.</li>
            <li> this is truly pure spearmint oil as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Apparently is not returnable, so I am waiting to hear from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This makes a great rodent repellent.</li>
            <li> I use it on my sore muscles mixed with other essentials oils.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to taste like spearmint but it is bitter tasting.</li>
            <li> I have put a few drops on a cotton ball and set it in front of fan in the back bedroom</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my foot pain due to a bone spur.</li>
            <li> From candles, soaps, lotions, lip balms, mouthwash, toothpaste and powder, cooking, tea, the uses for this are endless.  </li>
            <li> I can smell it even with the bottle closed!</li>
            <li> Just remember, a little goes a very long way!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my front-loading washing machine because I heard it would help cut down on the smelly mildew that forms in the drum and gasket.</li>
            <li> I looked at GNC and other health food stores and could not find spearmint oil anywhere!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using peppermint oil to help keep mice out of our cars and decided to add spearmint to the mix for a little variety.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be a little stronger than it is.</li>
            <li> Now my stinky washer smells like spearmint and the visible trouble areas</li>
            <li> I also drop a few drops of it in my bath with rosemary.  </li>
            <li> I simmer water with a few drops of this on my stove after cooking to refresh the air.</li>
            <li> It was one of the few smells I could even tolerate.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on everyone&#x27;s shoes at the house and it takes the bad odors right out (even the combat boots).</li>
            <li> I dabbed a little on a diffuser and came home to a house smelling of spearmint!</li>
            <li> make into lollipops, hard candy, just add a few drops...</li>
            <li> I usually purchase peppermint oil, but thought I would switch and try spearmint oil</li>
            <li> NOW sells high quality products; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Sent me the wrong flavor oil</li>
            <li> I use cold filtered water that I filter through a brita water pitcher and put one drop of mint to about 16 to 20 oz of cold water and mix/shake it.  </li>
            <li> I have never purchased a bad product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re scummy, creepy, nasty and sneaky.  </li>

            <li> Smells and tastes great.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> t&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a pleasnt but not overpowering scent!  I used when I had a headache and it worked!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Great quality.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i bought this to use to make bath salt Christmas gift. Has a very nice sent just don&#x27;t over do the amount. I mixed with eucalyptus and lavender and it was wonderful. Everybody loved it.</li>
            <li> Works well for my purposes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of mint oil esp this spearmint! much cooler than the peppermint oil... love it!</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! You don&#x27;t want to leave it in direct contact with your skin, however throughout the summer months I would put 2 drops of spearmint oil, and 2 drops of citronella oil on a paper towel, and clip it to my waistband. Kept all sorts of bugs away, mosquitoes, flying ants, and I even noticed the deer flies seemed to leave me alone more, not to mention I didn&#x27;t get a single tick. But above and beyond that! If you want to refresh your home with a wonderful clean smell, place 5 drops in a bowl and dilute with a quarter cup olive oil, place bamboo skewers in there and you have an oil diffuser (I had run out of bamboo at first though, but the smell is strong enough to not need them). I make candles. You guessed it, I put this in a batch to see if it works. It does, and exceeds my expectations. On EVERY count! If you are considering buying something that you can use for aromatherapy, to keep the bugs away, to add to your candles, soaps, or lotions, May I recommend this? Next project for me is to make it into a refreshing shampoo!</li>
            <li> Just what it is suppose to be and a drop or two makes my house smell so good.</li>
            <li> will mix this with the peppermint oil to make mouse away. my mix will be more concentrated. this is truly pure spearmint oil as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Instead of purchasing spearmint tea I decided it world probably be more economical to order this pure spearmint essential oil. So far it has worked perfectly with only one drop as it is surprisingly potent and yet it&#x27;s been gentile enough in hot water as tea and on my skin neat. It feels amazing on your scalp and when added to shampoo. I&#x27;m really impressed with the NOW brand and will look into buying different essential oils/reordering this one from them in the future.</li>
            <li> This oil is great, works well with Eucalyptus.  I have yet to experiment too much with it.  Highly recommend it to anyone looking to use essential oils.</li>
            <li> NOW Foods essential oils are very good, pure, therapeutic grade oils. This spearmint EO is no exception. I use these oils in natural soaps I make as well as linen and air spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is spot on, sweet and minty clean. Very nice. Superb value.</li>
            <li> Have not used it as yet but plan to make spearmint candy from it....make into lollipops, hard candy, just add a few drops...very strong</li>
            <li> This oil is great! I have been using this on everyone&#x27;s shoes at the house and it takes the bad odors right out (even the combat boots). The added stopper make it easy to just shake the amount I need. I highly suggest owning this oil for your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Facts on what it can be used for;&lt;br /&gt;-few drops rubbed on forehead for headache relief&lt;br /&gt;-scent can be used as air fresher or in cleaners&lt;br /&gt;-cooking flavoring&lt;br /&gt;-analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-spasmodic properties can be used on sore muscles&lt;br /&gt;-can also help pass gas easier through the digestive tract</li>
            <li> we purchased this oil because we heard that it is good to keep mice awy in our camper. we do not have mice and do not want any. the oil has a very good smell and our camper will smell very fresn in the spring. price was the best we could find for the size</li>
            <li> We are apiarist and needed spearmint oil for our treatment of our bee hives. I am VERY picky on getting PURE products to use on the hives. THIS product was perfectly what I was looking for. I will be ordering this again when I need more.</li>
            <li> After much research, I chose to purchase the NOW foods brand of spearmint oil.  The packaging is good, no leakage during shipping, and the quality of the oil is excellent!  I am using it as part of a mixture for tooth oil to replace my silica based toothpaste.  So far, I am very pleased with this product.  My only wish is that it came in a 4 oz. size (like the peppermint oil).  I have only seen the NOW foods spearmint oil in 1 oz. or 16 oz. sizes.  16 oz is just too much for my needs.</li>
            <li> Adding it to my collection of NOW oils</li>
            <li> This oil has been wonderful for my stomach problems. I use it daily and won&#x27;t be without it. Have not tried this particular oil in another brand, but this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil for a good price</li>
            <li> We use spearmint in several essential oil master blends, but my favorite use is to add a couple drops to an ounce of coconut oil blended with baking soda. We use this mixture for brushing teeth or cleaning dentures with GREAT results! I wish I had learned of this years ago before dealing with a rogue dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spearmint is known for being an antiseptic, antispasmodic, disinfectant, carminative, cephalic, emenagogue,  stimulant, restorative, insectacide, decongestant (moves fluid), and becomes the menthol content is low it is child friendly. I find drinking spearmint tea (made from fresh or dried leaves) is a great way to perform a gentle body cleanse. Spearmint should NOT be used by anyone who may be pregnant, otherwise it is generally a very safe herb.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering [[ASIN:B000J3Z75G Spearmint Oil 1 Ounces]]. A little goes a long way. Put a few drops in a spray bottle and you have the best smelling mouse repellant on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate mice.  They&#x27;re scummy, creepy, nasty and sneaky.  I haven&#x27;t seen one but from time to time, I see the signs.  So, I spray my countertops and stove every night and see no signs of em... But if I miss a night I&#x27;ll see a sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came in a 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s potent and smells wonderful. I use it for my diffuser, in my bubble bath and in my hot tea. I will not be without spearmint because its a sweeter smell and taste than peppermint. And the Now brand is very affordable and suits my purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be just what it said it was, I am not familiar enough with essential oils to comment on quality, but I am very happy with purchase. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I looked at GNC and other health food stores and could not find spearmint oil anywhere! I&#x27;m so happy i found it on amazon and for such a great price from this seller. It was sent to me quickly and wrapped great. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bottle comes different than pictured but the smell is strong and heavenly. One of my new favorite oils to use in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> love the sent it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I could not find good spearmint oil around my home ground without spending an arm and a leg- this is good quality at a great price</li>
            <li> Okay, but something off in the aroma.</li>
            <li> A fan of NOW Foods. I have never purchased a bad product. This one included. I&#x27;ve made mouthwash with this product and it tastes great and is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my foot pain due to a bone spur. Mixed with another oil, it helps ALOT. I highly recommend. Also smells great mixed with tangerine in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, no problems.  It will work for some of my essential oil blends.  I have been happy with the NOW brand. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love spearmint, so this was a must try. I must say, I&#x27;m loving it so far. Using it in my DIY lotions.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of Spearmint.  This is a great product for the price.  Says 100% pure and natural.  I am using to make my own toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love metromint water but not the price.  It&#x27;s just not economical and it&#x27;s my favorite way to drink more water.  I use cold filtered water that I filter through a brita water pitcher and put one drop of mint to about 16 to 20 oz of cold water and mix/shake it.  It tastes very much like my spearmint metromint at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this for scenting soap.  It is my favorite scent we&#x27;ve used so far!  I&#x27;ve also purchased spearmint essential oil from a different company, and there is no comparison.  Every time I walk into the room where the soap is curing, I have to go over and take a sniffâ€¦it is wonderful!  I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> From candles, soaps, lotions, lip balms, mouthwash, toothpaste and powder, cooking, tea, the uses for this are endless.  Now products are always fresh and the only limit is your imagination.</li>
            <li> The first bottle  I ordered was great. It was stimulating and invigorating. I could barely get two drops out and the aroma would make my eyes water. This second bottle I ordered barely smelled and definitely was not invigorating or stimulating on my scalp. I even tried using more drops and got nothing. Apparently is not returnable, so I am waiting to hear from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is everything that it was advertised to be.  It is a very potent product and serves the purpose.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for a homemade toothpaste recipe I wanted to try.  Works really well!  Just threw together xylitol, calcium carbonate, coconut oil, baking soda, and this spearmint oil.  Love the flavor!  And a nice refreshing minty tingle.  Just remember, a little goes a very long way!  This is very potent oil - you definitely don&#x27;t want to over do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drop dispenser works well too - I&#x27;ve been struggling with NOW&#x27;s rose hip seed oil because they use the same dispenser.  RHS oil is much more viscous and it takes about 15 seconds for 1 drop to fall.  This spearmint oil drops at about 2 drops per second.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confuse extract with oil.  This stuff is as strong as it gets.  My dad loves his spearmint flavored ice cream :)</li>
            <li> I sprinkle this stuff in doorways to keep ants out. Works but the house smells like toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great add some drops in water as mouthwash or a on the go toothpaste the best, some drops for stomach discomfort last forever</li>
            <li> This is such a pleasant fragrance we have used it for our cars as well as our bathroom.  We&#x27;ve been using peppermint oil to help keep mice out of our cars and decided to add spearmint to the mix for a little variety.  We like the fragrance even better than the peppermint.  Also, out of frustration with flaky atomizers we&#x27;ve been using for fragrance in the bathroom, we made our own spearmint water spray and we love it.  A little pricey but nice that it can be added to another order for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this Spearmint oi!!  I made some natural lip balm with it and it smelled soooo good and tasted even yummier with each lick of my lips!!</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING..out shining all the stars......great buy, smell lasts and lasts. Any one that likes spearmint, will LOVE this.  a smell you can&#x27;t resist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my front-loading washing machine because I heard it would help cut down on the smelly mildew that forms in the drum and gasket. It has helped a lot. Now my stinky washer smells like spearmint and the visible trouble areas appear a lot cleaner. This 1-ounce bottle has lasted four months (and counting).</li>
            <li> Without The Gum !... Brings Back The Childhood ! A Dab Will Do ! Upper Lip ! No Idea What It&#x27;s Good For ! Don&#x27;t Care ! Loved It Then ! Love It Even More Now ! How Many Sticks Of Gum To Equal ? Almost Want To Eat ! This Precious Goodie ! All Good ! Thanks Amazon ! More Info ? Like Needing More Targets ! Thanks Again Amazon ! Love It !</li>
            <li> Even though this is not an organic oil, NOW products are always high grade.  This spearmint oil is fresh and strong, and the one-ounce bottle means that it should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a plastic nib in the bottle opening, so you can dispense the oil one drop at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spearmint is supposedly the more gentle \\&quot;cousin\\&quot; of peppermint oil, and, as such and if I&#x27;m not feeling up to the strength of peppermint oil, I use a few small dabs of this on my temples to help with migraines or a bit around my nose to help with congestion.  (Even though my skin is sensitive, I can usually put it right on my skin without any adverse reaction, but I would spot-test it first or diffuse it with a carrier oil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has many other uses.  It helps with stress relief if you dab a bit around your temples, and you can also add a few drops to the bottom of your hot shower to help de-congest your sinuses.  It also acts as a natural mosquito repellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this help you find uses for this!</li>
            <li> Now products are always great. I ordered this because I never seen the spearmint scent before. I added this to my body wraps. Nice spearmint smell. Soothing.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I like it!</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend to use on his incredibly smelly feet. He didnt use it the way I told him but he did put some drops in boots. MAJOR improvement.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle...I was expecting a smaller bottle, but its a nice size amount.  Very Strong &amp; pure! I can smell it even with the bottle closed! Great product.</li>
            <li> smells soo good.  use it in my toothpaste recipe</li>
            <li> delivered as promised</li>
            <li> I used this to make sugar scrubs for Christmas presents.  It smells great!  Arrived on time and is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this as flavoring for water. 1 drop for 20 ounces works perfectly. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> This worked very well to keep mice away. Came quickly and in good order. Would recomend this to anyone who have mice problems.</li>
            <li> Great oil and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I mix this essential oil with eucalyptus oil in my body scrubs. Will definitely buy from Now Foods again! b</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a little stronger than it is. I use it in a mixture of oils I put on my face and body. I also drop a few drops of it in my bath with rosemary.  So far I do love it, but wish it was a little stronger I guess.</li>
            <li> I use this in making my toothpaste and mouthwash. Provides a very good level of flavoring.</li>
            <li> I expected it to taste like spearmint but it is bitter tasting. I wanted it to add to my water bottle. The package arrived quickly and well wrapped.</li>
            <li> I like the NOW brand of oils and the spearmint is very nice.  My favorite use for the oil is freezing it in ice cubes, then putting them down the garbage disposal.  Smells heavenly.  Also, I put a bunch (maybe 50) drops on a paper towel and put it in the bottom of my kitchen trash.  I have a lidded can and every time the lid is raised, it smells wonderful.  I also fill a spritzer bottle with water and add 20 or so drops of oil.  When I get a new article of clothing and want to remove the fold marks I spritz it with the oil water and put it in the dryer for 3 minutes.  Voila&#x27;</li>
            <li> Strong stuff. Good wrapping</li>
            <li> I use this along with other oils for a mouth freshener and to brush my teeth works great</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to make my own oraMD. However, I don&#x27;t know the exact liquid proportions used to make oraMD, so I was unsuccessful at it. Anyway, you can use this as as air freshener and for other uses that I can&#x27;t think of right now. The scent is very potent.</li>
            <li> I love working on aromatherapy products.  This spearmint product works great for my items.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of any essential oil and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  A) it smells like spearmint gum, which is delicious. B) I put it in a humidifier which helped soothe my wife&#x27;s bronchitis. And C) There are no ghosts in our house... come to think of it, we didn&#x27;t have ghosts before I used this oil either so, it may not be good for banishing spirits but it still smells good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is intense - two drops in a bottle of Root Bear is enough to give it a *STRONG* flavor (I recommend one drop * 2 liter for a nice minty taste - much like Birch Bear)</li>
            <li> I love spearmint and peppermint and look forward to using it in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> smells great! i use the oil on my wrists when i exercise. I read that it increases your exercise intensity and amps you up.</li>
            <li> received timely and intact</li>
            <li> Mild scent - mixes nicely with orange and cedarwood. I simmer water with a few drops of this on my stove after cooking to refresh the air. 3 cups vodka, 1 cup water, tablespoon of vinegar, your choice of essential oils - BAM. There&#x27;s your fabreeze!  No harmful chemicals to breath in.</li>
            <li> I thought the peppermint was awesome, but that&#x27;s before I got the spearmint.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Smells great!</li>
            <li> the product came fast and the size is good for the cost.  It smells really good have not been able to use yet.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it in a bee supplement but had to open it as I love the smell. It smells great! I dabbed a little on a diffuser and came home to a house smelling of spearmint!</li>
            <li> product smells fantastic..purchased to add to a DIY potion for cleaning tartar and freshening breath for my dog. along with the other ingredients it seems to be working..being highly concentrated it takes a very tiny bit. it is suggested to add with another oil rather than use straight because of its extreme concentration..i chose to add some coconut oil as it also works to clean teeth along with the rest of ingredients which included distilled water, grape seed extract &amp; grapefruit seed extract. Most of these ingredients can be found in commercial products, however the products in the marketplace also contain grain alcohol, an ingredient that is harmful for the dog so I opted to do my own mixture.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I use it on my sore muscles mixed with other essentials oils.  Also a few drops in a hot bath for invigoration.  Will purchase this brand again!</li>
            <li> My sons used this on tooth picks and they loved it. I also used this to help freshen rooms in my house very nice. Just a couple drops in a warmer and it was perfect. Used it to flavor candies great flavor.</li>
            <li> Sent me the wrong flavor oil but I will still use. Good oil to use in diffuser. I mix the spearmint with eucalyptus oil for stress relief.</li>
            <li> Smells good, great price.</li>
            <li> Item packaged well in protective bubble wrap so as not to leak.  Works well to discourage mice from entering RV and smells nice too!  Sure beats mothballs!!!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations, had the aroma of fresh spearmint and I would highly reccomend and buy again to use. A++</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of spearmint in general and used this in my diffuser to help with my first trimester nausea. It was one of the few smells I could even tolerate. Good value and quality.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase peppermint oil, but thought I would switch and try spearmint oil&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for my own preference the smell is very subtle and I prefer the now peppermint oil.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for a variety of purposes on myself and household cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It is still a good product, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my cologne before going to work and it gives me a really nice fresh smell most of the day on just a few drops to the wrist. I also put it in a homemade olive oil lotion I came up with and it leaves me smelling like a stick of gum. (that&#x27;s a good thing in case you&#x27;re wondering lol)</li>
            <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil sfor different things and these are great.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly what you think it smells like. I really love it. Like most NOW essential oils, the staying power is lacking a bit, but what&#x27;s there is good.</li>
            <li> This oil has such a refreshing scent. I have put a few drops on a cotton ball and set it in front of fan in the back bedroom and it sends the scent throughout the house (1200 sq ft).</li>
            <li> We use this with distilled water and some vodka to make a delicious air freshner. We put it in spray bottles that adjust to a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Our family loves NOW products.  We buy many of them and use or take (supplements) them daily.  Their essential oils are high quality at a great price.  We&#x27;ll definitely buy again and do highly recommend them.  NOW sells high quality products; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  A friend told us about this brand years ago and she&#x27;s very knowledgeable about natural living and supplement products.</li>
            <li> I use this to flavor my homemade toothpaste and it seems to work great. what more can I say, it&#x27;s really spearminty.</li>
            <li> another hit from the mint family.  Now food has the best quantity and quality.  I use their products to do cleaning and make insecticides.  In both cases they work well.  (bees, wasps, biting insects, and mice all hate MINT).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using these as a bug deterrent; Spearmint is from the MINT family; as is oregano, rosemary, lavender, sage, and thyme.  But  WINTERGREEN is NOT mint, and I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a deterrent.</li>
            <li> Great for homemade mouthwash and toothpaste. Its pure and the smell is good.</li>
            <li> I love this spearmint oil very much and would recommend it to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it to treat sore muscles when I have to be out in public (peppermint oil actually works better for sore muscles, but the strong scent is off-putting to people when I&#x27;m out and about, so I use the spearmint, which people find pleasant...</li>
            <li> I buy this and dilute with a neutral oil and use on my feet before going &amp;#34;sock less&amp;#34; in my shoes.  Keeps my feet and shoes fresh all day.  The oil kills bacteria that causes odor...and who doesn&#x27;t love the fresh smell of spearmint!  My shoes always smell great!</li>
            <li> Excellent oil.  I use it to make mouthwash and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. I appreciated the stopper.I am using this as part of a homeopathic solution to repel mice. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to chemical smells, doesn&#x27;t want to deal with mice, has kids. I can spray this on counters where food is and not worry about a toxic substance on the same surfaces as food/dishes.</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived in a timely fashion,.</li>
            <li> This makes a great rodent repellent.</li>
            <li> I love spearmint. I like this essential oil, too. I&#x27;ve used it in making chap stick and in cleaning. It&#x27;s very versatile and smells great!</li>
            <li> Smells great.works awesome for homemade chap stick and a mouth rinse.</li>
