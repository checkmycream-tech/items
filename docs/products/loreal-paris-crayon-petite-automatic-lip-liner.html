            <li>I&#x27;m truly pleased with this product-</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to order a supply to have on hand..</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the way the lip pencil kept my lipstick from feathering.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that works as well as this product.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t keep lipstick from running into the fine lines around my lips like I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 82 and the pencils made my lips look huge.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special...</li>
            <li>I have a favorite Loreal lipliner in soft pink that I&#x27;ve used for years (which they no longer make) and it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I was so very pleased to find it available and at a considerably lower price than I had paid for when it was available in local stores.</li>
            <li>I use it to tame my flyaway eyebrows and it works great.</li>
            <li>I use it outside my lip liner or lipstick, I have many wrinkles around my mouth although I&#x27;ve never been a smoker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when an item turns out to be exactly what you expected.</li>
            <li>This is the only place I have been able to buy this product and have been using it for about 5 or 6 years.  </li>
            <li>The lip liner worked for the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Perfect if you&#x27;re sick of buying even color lip liner, only one thing, it runs out so quick!</li>
            <li>If it is, I&#x27;ll order a few more before it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>This lipliner is much harder in texture than the previous Loreal liners I&#x27;ve had, which went on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy twist-up lip-liner feed without the hassle or mess of pencil sharpeners</li>
            <li>This was the exact product I had been looking for in the various department stores in my area to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I bought this clear pencil to use on the outside of my lips to keep long wearing lipstick from running into the fine lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I figured the clear one would serve my purpose.  </li>
            <li>This clear pencil lets me cover the cracks without looking like a freak.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is clear</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just old and has therefore solidified.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great product that I wonder why it is so difficult to find!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s such a great product that I wonder why it is so difficult to find!</li>
            <li> This product is so much creamier than the lip liners I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit waxy, like other liners, but it&#x27;s an entirely different animal.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick still bleeds and the wax is so fragile it broke off with little pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously been discontinued since it&#x27;s not available in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I haven&#x27;t had any complaints.</li>
            <li> Yet, the pencil did not contain a lot of product and I ran out sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The product itself was not worth it</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lid.  </li>
            <li> I wear lipstick every single day :/</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores...always sold out...</li>
            <li> This consistency makes it somewhat uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Wow..I was getting so frustrated with these lip pencils.  </li>

            <li> The product does not do what lip liners are suppose to do. The lipstick still bleeds and the wax is so fragile it broke off with little pressure. The product itself was not worth it and you couldn&#x27;t even anticipate on when it would be delivered to you</li>
            <li> I looked all over town and didn&#x27;t find any &#x27;anti-feathering&#x27; lip liners.  I finally found L&#x27;Oreal Lip Liners on Amazon.com.  This product is so much creamier than the lip liners I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  I&#x27;m truly pleased with this product- it glides on \\&quot;like butter\\&quot; and no feathering.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use it to tame my flyaway eyebrows and it works great.</li>
            <li> This actually stops lipstick from bleeding into wrinkles around the mouth.  I would recommend to friends and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it outside my lip liner or lipstick, I have many wrinkles around my mouth although I&#x27;ve never been a smoker. It helps fill in the wrinkles therefore my lip liner or lipstick does not run in the cracks.</li>
            <li> Nothing special... Meh.  No difference when I use or do not.</li>
            <li> Excellent no-hassle lip liner works great with all colors all year long. Easy twist-up lip-liner feed without the hassle or mess of pencil sharpeners</li>
            <li> I bought this clear pencil to use on the outside of my lips to keep long wearing lipstick from running into the fine lines around my mouth.  It&#x27;s obviously been discontinued since it&#x27;s not available in the stores.  I have a favorite Loreal lipliner in soft pink that I&#x27;ve used for years (which they no longer make) and it&#x27;s a great product.  I figured the clear one would serve my purpose.  If it doesn&#x27;t I will update this review.  It arrived in a timely fashion.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s a great product.  If it is, I&#x27;ll order a few more before it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This lipliner is much harder in texture than the previous Loreal liners I&#x27;ve had, which went on smoothly and easily.  This consistency makes it somewhat uncomfortable to use.  I expected it to be a bit waxy, like other liners, but it&#x27;s an entirely different animal.  I can&#x27;t tell if any of it actually makes it onto my lip line or not.  It didn&#x27;t keep lipstick from running into the fine lines around my lips like I&#x27;d hoped.  Maybe it&#x27;s just old and has therefore solidified.  It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve seen this pencil in the store so maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened.  Try it if you must.  As for me, I wish I&#x27;d saved my pennies so I&#x27;m changing my review to two stars instead of four.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  I&#x27;ll purchase again.  It&#x27;s nice when an item turns out to be exactly what you expected.</li>
            <li> This lip liner is a great way to prevent feathering. It&#x27;s such a great product that I wonder why it is so difficult to find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I haven&#x27;t had any complaints. Works well, like it&#x27;s supposed to. :D</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores...always sold out...that should tell them something...Glad to be able to order a supply to have on hand..</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the way the lip pencil kept my lipstick from feathering. Yet, the pencil did not contain a lot of product and I ran out sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I have been able to buy this product and have been using it for about 5 or 6 years.  Haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that works as well as this product.  My only complaint is the lid.  It eventually splits and won&#x27;t stay on till the product is finished.  There could be some improvement on that.</li>
            <li> This was the exact product I had been looking for in the various department stores in my area to no avail.  I was so very pleased to find it available and at a considerably lower price than I had paid for when it was available in local stores.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you&#x27;re sick of buying even color lip liner, only one thing, it runs out so quick! I wear lipstick every single day :/</li>
            <li> This lip liner is great for women who have vertical lines around their lips.  It helps fill them in so that colored lip liner does not bleed.</li>
            <li> The lip liner worked for the first couple of times.  The longer I used it the softer it became and the tip broke off several times.</li>
            <li> Wow..I was getting so frustrated with these lip pencils.  I&#x27;m 82 and the pencils made my lips look huge.  This clear pencil lets me cover the cracks without looking like a freak.  Mary Kay used to make something similar but discontinued it years ago.  Nice to control my lipstick again.</li>
            <li> These are the best lip liners....no sharpening required which is great.  These are the best cuz they can be used with any colour lipstick</li>
            <li> I like that this is clear but I was hoping for a product that would keep my lipstick on my lips and this is not it.</li>
