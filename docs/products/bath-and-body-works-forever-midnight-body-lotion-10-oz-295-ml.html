            <li> this lotion is amazing I love the smell an the feeling of it on my body...It&#x27;s a shame the good stuff is not selling in store anymore..</li>
            <li> I love Forever Midnight.  It&#x27;s my new favorite Bath &amp; Body Works lotion.  I&#x27;ve never really been much of a perfume person.  I like Bath &amp; Body works lotions because they moisture my skin (people comment on how soft and velvet like my skin is, people ask me and I always say Bath &amp; Body works)  and give me just a hint of a scent.  I used to be obsessed with juniper breeze and I always  people asking me what I was wearing and where they could buy it.  I&#x27;m never trying to attract attention with what I wear,  I just put it on,  if it&#x27;s pleasing to me.  I like anything that smells clean and fresh.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot either, it&#x27;s  thick and goes on your skin nicely.  A little goes a long way.  And the scent has literally stopped men in their tracks and they ask me, is that you?  You smell really good.  What is that?  Running low,  so gotta order more.  It&#x27;s one of those girly makes you feel beautiful kind of thing:)</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it stays on you</li>
            <li> Delivered well packaged and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> i recommend it,smell so good and the fragrance last all day.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and the recipient was delighted with it! She also received the parfum spray and lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this scent for a date night! When the hubby and I go out I make sure I put this on.. He loves it!</li>
            <li> Very good smells amazing!</li>

            <li> This lotion was a perfect gift for my wife,  and I also enjoy it. It&#x27;s a great product, with an exciting perfume, moisturizes the skin and leaves it soft and velvety, I recommend it to all women to use after bath ... and before going to bed ..</li>
