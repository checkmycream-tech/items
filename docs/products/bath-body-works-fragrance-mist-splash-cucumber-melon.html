            <li>My favorite sent since high school!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.:)</li>
            <li>I would like to recommend this fragrance to anyone looking for a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It was an easy fix, but this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased fragrances from Bath and Body Works with sprayers that don&#x27;t work. . .</li>
            <li>It sells out quickly in their stores.</li>
            <li>Overpriced, but exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I save my perfume for night wear, I wear Cucumber Melon  after my shower, it carries that fresh feeling for hours.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh when finished use.</li>
            <li>Although Bath and body Works no longer offers this after shower spray on their site, this product arrived with a strong and fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The Cucumber Melon smells crisp and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is much too sweet, not at all to my liking.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast, and it is as described.</li>
            <li>the summer fresh clean smell long lasting will definitely order more thanks amazon for making it possible ♥</li>
            <li>But they really made it worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>She loves this smell, and it was exactly as it should be</li>
            <li>and i really do like it!</li>
            <li>not a horrible amount was missing, but it wasn&#x27;t completely full.</li>
            <li>The product carries a light but lasting scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much.  </li>
            <li>It has a very refreshing and long lasting scent that carries me to my evening shower.  </li>
            <li>I give it to all my special female friends and family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, the product does look a little cheap, but I didn&#x27;t get this for  pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>Item half full top was not screwed on tightly, I only received half full bottle</li>
            <li>I was sent the old version, not the new BBW, as in the photo.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had an almost empty bottle of Cucumber Melon Splash with a sprayer that worked, so I simply swapped sprayers.</li>
            <li>so she was surprised when i gave her a bottle.  </li>
            <li>i thought I was buying a real Bath and Body Works cucumber melon body spray, but the product I got was the generic version.</li>
            <li>In Trinidad, this scent is not sold as it is considered an old scent so we have to order it online.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this particular Bath &amp; Body fragrance in local stores</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was so disappointed to learn that B&amp;BW no longer carried this product in stores, as I have loved it since I started using it about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s been wanting some for so long but B&amp;BW discontinued it!</li>
            <li> And the quality is above average.</li>
            <li> It was difficult finally getting what I ordered from the \\&quot;Pretty Stuff\\&quot; company.</li>
            <li> Just as I was to the last one half ounce I was told that I could order it online.  </li>
            <li> All items were delivered on time, the merchandise was as expected.</li>
            <li> It smells a little chemically</li>
            <li> It is the same fragrance I&#x27;d purchased from Victoria Secret&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with the sprayer.</li>
            <li> However, it could use less alcohol.!</li>
            <li> Not like what i expected, look like fake ....</li>
            <li> The sprayer is very difficult to push down.  </li>
            <li> Of course Bath&amp;Body Works stop carrying anything Cucumber Melon and came out with alot of new fragrances that all smell like crap!!</li>
            <li> Got it, kinda weird that it doesn&#x27;t have the name of the scent on it.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I have been missing my body spray for months!!!!!</li>
            <li> so when Bath &amp; Body Works quit carrying it, she was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Bottle came bent up. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an annoying oversight on the part of Bath and Body Works.</li>

            <li> Just as described. It is the Bath and Body Works Cucumber-Melon fragrance. I&#x27;ll admit, the product does look a little cheap, but I didn&#x27;t get this for  pretty packaging.</li>

            <li> I was so disappointed to learn that B&amp;BW no longer carried this product in stores, as I have loved it since I started using it about 15 years ago. So happy I could find it online, and it&#x27;s just as yummy as I remembered!</li>
            <li> Mom loves it, so I love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent in the Bath and Body Works products. It was difficult finally getting what I ordered from the \\&quot;Pretty Stuff\\&quot; company.But they really made it worth the wait. Amazon.com, handled this purchase in a timely manner. Thank you and I would order again through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My wife thought it was kind of fruity for a guy.  But she still liked the aroma.  Will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> went to buy this splash with a friend and was told it was discontinued and tis is where i could find it.  it was her birthday so she was surprised when i gave her a bottle.  we looked everywhere!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this happen for me this Christmas as Bath and Body Works no longer carry this item favored by my daughter!</li>
            <li> The store was out of the splash and was not getting any more and I found it on Amazon.  Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite scent. I give it to all my special female friends and family. It&#x27;s not too overpowering. One of those smells that you notice and want to surround yourself with. Everyone I gave it to wanted to know where they could get it. Yum... Birdie Gee</li>
            <li> Cucumber Melon is my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance so when Bath &amp; Body Works quit carrying it, she was sorely disappointed.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon so she can have her favorite for a while longer.</li>
            <li> I love the lotion so thought why not try the spray!  It is great too... Came to me quickly and in great condition!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift which she enjoys wearing all the time.</li>

            <li> Miss this smell im soo glad I can still order this love it love wearing it n the summer fresh clean smell long lasting will definitely order more thanks amazon for making it possible ♥</li>
            <li> It was as advertised. Delivered promptly. And the quality is above average.</li>
            <li> Every time I order my fav fragrance it arrives defective some how .  This time the bottle was cracked and last time the sprayer didn&#x27;t work.  Oh well</li>
            <li> it is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> It is the same fragrance I&#x27;d purchased from Victoria Secret&#x27;s. My favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells just like I remember it.  Packaging is a bit dodgy.</li>
            <li> Three out of the four sprayers in the four bottles I purchased did not work. I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of the  cucumber melon. It is not the same as what I was expecting. And the labeling is under par. Very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast, and it is as described. Very happy with this product, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I used it daily until the local Bath and Body Works no longer carried it.  Just as I was to the last one half ounce I was told that I could order it online.  I ordered two bottles that same day.  The product carries a light but lasting scent.  The Cucumber Melon smells crisp and fresh.  I save my perfume for night wear, I wear Cucumber Melon  after my shower, it carries that fresh feeling for hours.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, but exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful!  However, it could use less alcohol.! It tends to sting my skin.</li>
            <li> she loved it, don&#x27;t carry in our local store any more</li>
            <li> excellent and great customer service</li>
            <li> i thought I was buying a real Bath and Body Works cucumber melon body spray, but the product I got was the generic version. It doesn&#x27;t last long, only maybe for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom. She likes it. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Got it, kinda weird that it doesn&#x27;t have the name of the scent on it. But it&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Oh thank God !!! I have been missing my body spray for months!!!!! Of course Bath&amp;Body Works stop carrying anything Cucumber Melon and came out with alot of new fragrances that all smell like crap!! anyway thank you Amazon I&#x27;m order a couple bottles. :)</li>
            <li> It was for my mom.  She loves this scent.  Thanks much.  In Trinidad, this scent is not sold as it is considered an old scent so we have to order it online.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this particular Bath &amp; Body fragrance in local stores so I was so thrilled to find it here at a reasonable price.  So happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Bottle came bent up. :(</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Pick up a lot of dates and the ladies LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This product arrived well packaged without any problems.  Although Bath and body Works no longer offers this after shower spray on their site, this product arrived with a strong and fresh fragrance.  I would like to recommend this fragrance to anyone looking for a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> All items were delivered on time, the merchandise was as expected.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and was sorry when Bath and Body Works stopped carrying it in their stores.  I was thrilled to find that it&#x27;s still available through Amazon. When I received the fragrance in the mail today, I took it out of the box and tried to use it immediately. I say &amp;#34;tried to&amp;#34; because the sprayer wouldn&#x27;t work!  No spray came out of the bottle when the plunger was depressed.  Fortunately, I had an almost empty bottle of Cucumber Melon Splash with a sprayer that worked, so I simply swapped sprayers. It was an easy fix, but this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve purchased fragrances from Bath and Body Works with sprayers that don&#x27;t work. . . It&#x27;s an annoying oversight on the part of Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> My favorite sent since high school!!</li>
            <li> Smells good not a knock off</li>
            <li> Love this smell. Just finished my first bottle and i am going to purchase another. Feels fresh when finished use. Lovee</li>
            <li> This is much too sweet, not at all to my liking. I was sent the old version, not the new BBW, as in the photo. The new one is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The smell is spot on, but my bottle seemed to a little less full than it should have been. Almost as if it had been used as a tester or something before... not a horrible amount was missing, but it wasn&#x27;t completely full. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It smells a little chemically</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe B &amp; BW discontinued this -glad I can get it here though</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.:)</li>
            <li> Not like what i expected, look like fake .... sorry but thats the truth</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time.  The fragrance is nice.  Had trouble with the sprayer.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is very difficult to push down.  Also there is no label on the bottle as to where the product came from.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent but find it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Item half full top was not screwed on tightly, I only received half full bottle</li>
            <li> smells just like i remember</li>
            <li> She loves this smell, and it was exactly as it should be</li>
            <li> I look forward to Bath and Body Works coming out with this scent each summer.  It has a very refreshing and long lasting scent that carries me to my evening shower.  Sometimes I can only find it on Amazon.  It sells out quickly in their stores.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because i bought and i really do like it! I actually bought it for my mom she&#x27;s been wanting some for so long but B&amp;BW discontinued it! I would recommend this anybody who likes ii smell good!</li>
