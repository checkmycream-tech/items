            <li>This wash is great for my sensitive face</li>

            <li>I was excited to try this product as I use their body lotion and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Feels so smooth and soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t want something too strong or</li>
            <li>This amazing cleanser digs deep into your pores, penetrating it to effectively remove dirt and make up.</li>
            <li>The product is really smooth and does the work.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling smooth, but I do not like how it smells</li>
            <li>This is a double win face wash for</li>
            <li>It makes it feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>But I loved this product so much that I was willing to order it online.</li>

            <li>still use the body lotion with no reactions and for my extremely dry skin it has added moisture and feels great.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on any regular usage but as far as using it intermittently to clean my face in the shower it works perfectly...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it though Amazon every few months.</li>
            <li>it feeling nice and moisturized, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle on my skin; I love the smell</li>
            <li>This is a great product I have very sensitive skin and after using a certain product for certain amount of time my skin becomes use to it and starts to break out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I had mild scarring on my face from acne and heard that the Palmer line/brand was known for improving stretch mark/scars.</li>
            <li>, good cleanser keeps my skin moisturized, i use it when my skin is dry</li>
            <li>When i thought this product would of been the best one to clear all the dark spots and remove the bumps from my face it didn&#x27;t it actually added more to my face!</li>
            <li>Very light, does not dry my skin at all, but still manages to clean and take off my makeup.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is great, I wish it had a little more foaming action</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to lanolin and many soaps and lotions.</li>
            <li>My face started to not feel right.</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general.</li>
            <li>PERFECT for my super dry and sensitive red skin.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cleaner because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin but does get it clean.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and gentle but your face feels clean not greasy.</li>
            <li>When I started using this about three months ago i saw change in my skin from the first use.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing this at Walmart (where I first found it) and they either stopped selling it or has yet to restock</li>
            <li>I have tried Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Neutrogena, Proactiv, Yes to Cucumber, Avalon Organics, and the list goes on....</li>
            <li>I have tried many different facial cleansers over the years but found most broke my face out as I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its more for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion for a long&lt;br /&gt;time now and really like it, so I thought I would try all of their face products.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out a lot even at 28 and this really does improve the look of my skin after one wash.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and does remove all makeup when used.  </li>
            <li>Creamy and foamy at the same time, rinses clean and moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>I was having a lot of trouble finding a good all natural/organic daily cleanser</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cleaner is so gentle and soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>my face started feeling normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I am hooked on the Palmers line with the fresh white lily fragrance.</li>
            <li>It works very well, rinses off clearly, and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula gentle Daily Cleanser was exactly what I was looking for in a daily cleanser!</li>
            <li>I was also thinking I needed a cleanser that was more moisturizing than the California Baby Super Sensitive stuff I&#x27;ve been using, as I&#x27;ve been noticing a lot of dry patches and general dullness to my skin lately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young (22 years old)</li>
            <li>I love the delicate fragrance of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>And I love the delicate scent.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using it, and it feels clean.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of use I noticed that my dark marks were fading it helps fade the marks without bleaching you skin which is amazing.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as thick and 2)it has a strong floral-like fragrance but the smell does not linger after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li>My face is very dry and thought with cocoa butter and gentle in the description it would help</li>
            <li>It does not make my face feel unclean at all, it is the complete opposite!</li>
            <li>but it was a long time before my skin felt normal</li>
            <li>It worked Ok but was a little harsh and has an odor I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a great product, but overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>In combination with the other products, my skin is very soft and moisturized.</li>

            <li> In combination with the other products, my skin is very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Keeping age away as long as possible, it&#x27;s helping</li>
            <li> It was extremely thick coming out of the tube the first time, but it had also been sitting on my front porch in freezing weather all day.  </li>
            <li> Why not clean my face and try to clear up some of the scars at the same time?</li>
            <li> This product for some reason left my face feeling like sand paper and so dry I could feel crack lines.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as the cream is very thick and has a strong perfume smell</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for sets, and bought this to go with the eye cream, facial lotion, and night cream from the same line.  </li>
            <li> and after I use it I feel as if I did not really wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Will try other Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find locally</li>
            <li> The scent is a little off putting, if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sweeter scents, I would say choose something else.</li>
            <li> It dried my face out to the extent that I almost had to go to a doctor.  </li>
            <li> Thick and creamy,  I squeeze out a pea sized amount and dab on wet face, add water to spread.</li>
            <li> Not the least bit harsh.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid it would make my face feel like it had an oily residue left after using it</li>
            <li> Since then it has been easier to get out, but it is still quite thick.  </li>
            <li> I said, it is thick.</li>
            <li> and I hate having to use any other facial cleanser at this point.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> but alas did not.  </li>
            <li> I like how it works, but hate the scent.</li>

            <li> Very soothing. I get the cleanse and moisturizing at an affordable price.  Will try other Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>

            <li> I was excited to try this product as I use their body lotion and absolutely love it.  That being said I have to give this product just one star.  My face is very dry and thought with cocoa butter and gentle in the description it would help but alas did not.  It dried my face out to the extent that I almost had to go to a doctor.  Afer about 2 months my face started feeling normal.  This product for some reason left my face feeling like sand paper and so dry I could feel crack lines.  I stopped using it as soon as the symptoms appeared but it was a long time before my skin felt normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the body lotion with no reactions and for my extremely dry skin it has added moisture and feels great.  I use it daily but will never use the cleanser again.</li>
            <li> This wash is great for my sensitive face</li>
            <li> It smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy , washes off clean. Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry.  I am usually more than pleased with any Palmer product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its more for people with dry skin. My face started to not feel right. More break outs. Gave this product away.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula gentle Daily Cleanser was exactly what I was looking for in a daily cleanser! It is very moisturizing and gentle but your face feels clean not greasy. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I purchase the Oil of Olay spin face brush. I used the sample wash that came with it. It worked Ok but was a little harsh and has an odor I don&#x27;t care for. I have been using the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion for a long&lt;br /&gt;time now and really like it, so I thought I would try all of their face products. I love them!! They are mild, smell good and clean marvelously! I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish more stores carried the products.</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of trouble finding a good all natural/organic daily cleanser so I stopped looking for one and found this product instead. It&#x27;s not all natural but it does do a great job at cleansing my skin, removing makeup and improving the look of my skin. I tend to break out a lot even at 28 and this really does improve the look of my skin after one wash. I will say I don&#x27;t actually use it daily so I can&#x27;t comment on any regular usage but as far as using it intermittently to clean my face in the shower it works perfectly...</li>
            <li> Lovely product, very gentle on skin while still giving in good clean to face. As I have sensitive skin this is ideal</li>
            <li> very strong smell but smells good too me, good cleanser keeps my skin moisturized, i use it when my skin is dry</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for sets, and bought this to go with the eye cream, facial lotion, and night cream from the same line.  I was also thinking I needed a cleanser that was more moisturizing than the California Baby Super Sensitive stuff I&#x27;ve been using, as I&#x27;ve been noticing a lot of dry patches and general dullness to my skin lately.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days, but so far so good.  It was extremely thick coming out of the tube the first time, but it had also been sitting on my front porch in freezing weather all day.  Since then it has been easier to get out, but it is still quite thick.  I&#x27;m using it with the Clarisonic Mia.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using it, and it feels clean.  In combination with the other products, my skin is very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in stores by me.  Very creamy and does remove all makeup when used.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anybody to buy this product. It does not work at all.  When i thought this product would of been the best one to clear all the dark spots and remove the bumps from my face it didn&#x27;t it actually added more to my face! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling smooth, but I do not like how it smells and after I use it I feel as if I did not really wash my face.  It&#x27;s not a great product, but overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleaner because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin but does get it clean. It is comparable to much more expensive products. I can&#x27;t find it locally so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it though Amazon every few months.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS FOR MY SKIN DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER BUT NOT IN THE COLDER SEASONS!  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS!</li>
            <li> I love the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula line!!! This cleaner is so gentle and soft on the skin. This is by far the best I have ever tried.  Before I use to use Bobbi Brown&#x27;s, but this surpasses it and the price is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use their Face Scrub and nighttime cream.  They also have a moisture which I will be purchasing after I am done with my current Olay.</li>
            <li> love it  my faces feels so cleans after using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to lanolin and many soaps and lotions. Their hand lotion is the best for my body so i tried this for face. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  Not the least bit harsh.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Creamy and foamy at the same time, rinses clean and moisturizes.  Keeping age away as long as possible, it&#x27;s helping - I am subscribed to auto-ship to stay stocked at all times :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister before and she fell in love with it! Excellent for dry skin and also does not irritate.</li>
            <li> This formula is very nice. I use it daily and it cleans my face thoroughly but does&lt;br /&gt;leave it feeling nice and moisturized, soft and smooth. I use this formula and my husband&lt;br /&gt;uses the gel cleanser. Both equally excellent.</li>
            <li> It was too oily for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s skincare line and face line in general. I think it is extremely moisturizing and keeps my skin extremely hydrated!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I use it morning &amp; night. After I finish cleansing my skin, I use the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter SPF 15 face lotion to moisturize my skin. This amazing cleanser digs deep into your pores, penetrating it to effectively remove dirt and make up. I love the way my skin look and feel afterwards. I love the delicate fragrance of the cleanser. I will forever use this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. Can&#x27;t say it enough. I am hooked on the Palmers line with the fresh white lily fragrance. Feels so smooth and soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser! I love the way my face feels after I use this! It also smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist said these items are not good to use for acne, or to improve skin, I purchased a bunch of items that I threw out.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It works very well, rinses off clearly, and leaves my skin soft. And I love the delicate scent. I will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have very sensitive skin and after using a certain product for certain amount of time my skin becomes use to it and starts to break out. When I started using this about three months ago i saw change in my skin from the first use. It leaves the skin soft and not dry. After a few days of use I noticed that my dark marks were fading it helps fade the marks without bleaching you skin which is amazing. Breakouts are gone within a day or two. This product really is great.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleaner I have found.  It lathers nicely, rinses off easily (no greasy residue) and has a great clean fresh smell.  Use with the scrub beads and night renewal cream for peaches and cream complexion.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy,  I squeeze out a pea sized amount and dab on wet face, add water to spread. I use it in combination with the Night Renewal Cream and Eventone BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I like how it works, but hate the scent.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I use on my face. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle on my skin; I love the smell</li>
            <li> The cleanser is great, I wish it had a little more foaming action but it has been great for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stripped nor does it leave a residue. The scent is a little off putting, if you aren&#x27;t a fan of sweeter scents, I would say choose something else.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different facial cleansers over the years but found most broke my face out as I have VERY sensitive skin. I have tried Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, Neutrogena, Proactiv, Yes to Cucumber, Avalon Organics, and the list goes on....&lt;br /&gt;I had mild scarring on my face from acne and heard that the Palmer line/brand was known for improving stretch mark/scars. So when I saw they had a facial cleanser I thought I would give it a try. Why not clean my face and try to clear up some of the scars at the same time? I was skeptical at first as the cream is very thick and has a strong perfume smell so I was afraid it would make my face feel like it had an oily residue left after using it and it would break my face out. But, I gave it a shot and I am glad I did! It does not make my face feel unclean at all, it is the complete opposite! It makes it feel smooth and clean. No residue, no build up, no redness. It has helped improve the scars on my face as well. This is a double win face wash for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall to this product is 1)like I said, it is thick. I have found if I put it in the shower with me that the heat from the shower/water tends to soften it up so it&#x27;s not as thick and 2)it has a strong floral-like fragrance but the smell does not linger after it is rinsed off. It is also hard to find in stores. I was purchasing this at Walmart (where I first found it) and they either stopped selling it or has yet to restock but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it elsewhere. But I loved this product so much that I was willing to order it online. I even bought two so I could have a backup since I know it&#x27;s hard to find locally and I hate having to use any other facial cleanser at this point.</li>
