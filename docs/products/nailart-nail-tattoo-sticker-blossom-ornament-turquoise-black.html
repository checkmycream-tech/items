            <li>I bought her a bunch from the same company and she&#x27;s loved them all so far.</li>
            <li>At the time I ordered, I didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from Germany, but received them in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>the products looks exactly as the picture.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting and description was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in future</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in the next time!</li>
            <li>design to large.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out how to get the stickers off because I thought the flowers comes of by themselves and not with the whole paper.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vidid.</li>

            <li>you need to cut, you can not come off, immediately breaks down most of the stickers</li>
            <li>These stickers are nice looking, but hard to use.  </li>
            <li>they are so thin and after applying a gel top coat as suggested you cant even tell its a tattoo sticker!</li>
            <li>i was shocked to get them way earlier then quoted since they came to the USA from Germany and the packing was great too!</li>
            <li>It does not look like the picture, particularly on nail polish that is not white.</li>
            <li>I only use one design so far</li>
            <li>These stickers are smaller than expected, even though you read the description, you really don&#x27;t pay attention.</li>
            <li>the application was easy and they are so thin they do not leave outlines of the design at all.</li>
            <li>The nail tattoo sticker requires to much time to remove from the paper; also, accurate cutting is required.</li>

            <li> i ordered these for a quick way to add nail art to my clients nails and figured if they weren&#x27;t that great it would be a good stocking stuffer for my daughter....i am happy to say they work amazing! they are so thin and after applying a gel top coat as suggested you cant even tell its a tattoo sticker! the application was easy and they are so thin they do not leave outlines of the design at all. the shipping was awesome also...i was shocked to get them way earlier then quoted since they came to the USA from Germany and the packing was great too! i will definitely be ordering from this seller again for all my business needs.</li>
            <li> These nail tattoo&#x27;s are super cute and after a top coat look like they have been hand painted on. Its a litte tricky getting them off the backing, but I found that tweezers help! Love them!!</li>
            <li> The nail tattoo sticker requires to much time to remove from the paper; also, accurate cutting is required. It does not look like the picture, particularly on nail polish that is not white.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these stickers. I bought her a bunch from the same company and she&#x27;s loved them all so far.</li>
            <li> The flower stickers don&#x27;t just come off the protective sheet by themselves. There are a see through sheets look like a thin wax paper that come with the flowers and when I put them on my nails, the paper show. You have to literally cut out the flowers as close as possible to eliminate the extra wax paper.  I will have to post some picture so you all see. I been doing my own nails forever and I have bought many Nail stickers before but nothing like this. It took me a while to figure out how to get the stickers off because I thought the flowers comes of by themselves and not with the whole paper.  I bought a bunch of same type with different designs. I only use one design so far and I am going to return all back to seller.</li>
            <li> These are very different from the basic peel off stickers. I like the sturdiness of them. You have to cut and peel and it seems to help the polish last longer.  Thank you for the extra set I will order from you again. I love this product. FYI the products looks exactly as the picture. You get what you pay for and more!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting and description was exactly as described. Will buy more in future</li>
            <li> didnt go on like it said on package. couldnt get them off paper</li>
            <li> no matter how much top coat it never looks shiny. only works with gel nails</li>
            <li> hard to use and paper dosent slide off easy</li>
            <li> These were difficult to apply and the instructions didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> Garbage it does not work it won&#x27;t come off the paper if you put water on it then it just desolves, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> These were very hard to get off the paper and onto nails without ripping them. I ended up only trying twice and never used them again.</li>
            <li> stickers tragedy&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend&lt;br /&gt;stickers you need to cut, you can not come off, immediately breaks down most of the stickers</li>
            <li> What a FUN Way to add character to your finger nail beds!  And they&#x27;re easy to use, too!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These stickers are smaller than expected, even though you read the description, you really don&#x27;t pay attention. Purchase these for Christmas for my Daughter, as they are on her wish list. At the time I ordered, I didn&#x27;t realize they were coming from Germany, but received them in a very reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> design to large. the tattoos are  not as pretty as pictured and they are hard to apply. the instructions are not clear</li>
            <li> This sticker is cute with even clear polish. The colors are very vidid. Dark polish works too. Nice smooth look.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS DESIGN ALOT BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM PAPER.  OTHER THAN THAT IT WOULD OF BEEN GREAT CAUSE THEY ARE SO PRETTY.</li>
            <li> very very diffciult to peel from original paper &amp; sticker falls apart when pulled.</li>
            <li> These tattoo stickers do not work well with acrylics.  Very light in color and don&#x27;t show up well if you have any sort of color on your nails.</li>
            <li> This really wasn&#x27;t a good product to me. Wasn&#x27;t too sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> these are very pretty and easy to use, thank you.</li>
            <li> These stickers are nice looking, but hard to use.  You have to cut out the shape and then try to peel it off the backing.  Not easy at all!  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this style again.</li>
            <li> I receive the item very fast! and it is great! I like it. I will buy more in the next time!</li>
