            <li>Just love it!</li>
            <li>I love tweezers when they work!  </li>
            <li>Again it is the kind of tweezers I wanted and not what they wanted to send me.</li>
            <li>You can pay more for some high-end, brand-name tweezers, but I doubt they would be as good as these.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the leathery case before and wished they would have told me it wouldn&#x27;t come with</li>
            <li>This model has a nice compact size and comes with a brilliantly handy protective leatherette (even the leatherette is fantastically well made).</li>
            <li>You will own them for life.  </li>

            <li>They do not have a very good grip, which causes much of what is being tweezed to slip out.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best tweezers I have found.</li>
            <li>My wife says these are not as useful to her as the point tip tweezers, but for me these are great for pulling out splinters, cactus needles, etc.</li>
            <li>Good fit.</li>
            <li>If you lose them like me you will be thankful at how easy it is to get another pair for $3.99 on Amazon !</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and most tweezers don&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine eyebrow hairs and these tweezers have no problem getting rid of them!</li>
            <li>best tweezers I have so far - gets the smallest fine hairs out with no problems - will buy again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>LOVE these tweezers.</li>
            <li>glad i found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I received this item in a reasonable amount of time and it works absolutely great.</li>
            <li>I have about 5 different tweezers, and this is the one which works best.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love the size, they&#x27;re mini</li>
            <li>and it served me well - nice and compact and precise.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found them again.</li>
            <li>I tried many tweezers before I happened&lt;br /&gt;across</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found many sites selling these most&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;price, but the shipping was more than the price of the tweezers.</li>
            <li>I read many a review on tweezers before settling on this brand.</li>
            <li>, it has some flaws; It has scratches and scuffs on it as well as being having differently-shaped tips (one being pointy and one being more square).</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Man they were cheap, but MOST importantly they WORKED!!!&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers easily grabbed even the finest hairs!!</li>
            <li>all the reviews on it were good ones and they were right.</li>
            <li>Great price, high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I had no complaints about my previous set, they were perfect and did amazingly.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works best for picking grey hairs or scabs...</li>
            <li>So now I have a great pair of tweezers that should last me many more years to come.</li>
            <li>Great action and size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its been posted in the comments before mine that said they do such a great job on the stray hairs, but its so true!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t  remove hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li>They are strong and the contact points have no gaps so you can pull hairs or splinters with ease.</li>
            <li>It is the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, it doesn&#x27;t snap the hair in half leaving the root still embedded.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty short, but that makes them perfect for an already crowded cosmetic drawer.</li>
            <li>I&lt;br /&gt;ordered a half dozen of this excellent tweezer.</li>
            <li>But for less than f 1 v e  d 011 ars, these are the perfect brand of compact throw-in-your-bag tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the size and work great plus a nice little pouch!</li>
            <li>This little tweezers work perfectly.</li>
            <li>but they are the best hands down!</li>
            <li>You want accurate surgical tweezers, this is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>Accurate description.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel is nicely polished.</li>
            <li>The reviews from others made me think this was going to be a fantastic tweezer</li>
            <li>But in my opinion, not as precise as the longer all-black ones that LaCross used to offer.</li>
            <li>They are durable &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>that not only do La Cross tweezers work, they also feel of luxury: they are very easy to use, with a perfect chisel-edge tip.</li>
            <li>Small and with the carrying pouch they are perfect for the purse.</li>
            <li>They are a nice small size, are sturdy and do their job well...would recommend to anyone who just needs effective tweezers for light duty:)</li>
            <li>I saw these and was hoping for a pair that would easily fit into my make-up bag that would still have good quality and these fell short of that.</li>
            <li>So I found these on Amazon hoping they were the right ones and thankfully they were!</li>
            <li>sure there are other luxury brands: I know some that offer lifetime warrantees and free sharpening, which I&#x27;m sure are a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>I wonder why they are so hard to find, because they are the BEST tweezers.</li>
            <li>Slant tip has always been my favorite as well because it really lets you get in there.  </li>
            <li>I settled for these as they were mostly inexpensive but have the handle that I like: they are super great for tiny, hard to grasp hairs and overall, good quality! :-)</li>
            <li>These are not bad, but if you have fine hairs that you need to pluck they won&#x27;t grasp them very well.</li>
            <li>Tini Tweeze Tweezers really do grab even the smallest hairs easily and once again make quick work of tweezing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, this review isn&#x27;t about the tweezers so much, but about the seller edrugstore - I would strongly advise you choose another seller so you receive the product advertised.</li>
            <li>Great quality I like the mini size easier to use for me,  and la cross also stands behind their products with lifetime warranty and great price.</li>
            <li>What a fun story with plenty of twist and a romance that delights from beginning to end.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are cheaper than most and better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>Right brand,</li>
            <li>None of the others is doing the job right.</li>
            <li>They had both La Cross and Sally Hansen names on the packaging and (like these) were very inexpensive; however, they were the great original La Cross quality.</li>
            <li>It even takes out the most tiny and stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>They never lose sharpness, I can get the smallest, closest of hairs on the first try without grabbing skin.  </li>
            <li>Quite a small pair of tweazers perfect for traveling or just as a spare to have in your make-up bag or for whenever necessary.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed after losing my first pair of minis.</li>
            <li>Broke the first week I had them.</li>
            <li>First of I gotta tell you</li>
            <li>I love these - can no longer find them in my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s more is that these only cost a couple dollars WITH shipping!</li>
            <li>First and foremost: tweezers have to WORK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incredibly sharp edged, very well manufactured, good grip, nice little leatherette case.  </li>
            <li>I just wonder why the best products have such a hard time to make it on the market.</li>
            <li>These are just too short for my taste, not as easy to grab.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and fantastic - they even come with a little case.  </li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>but this one works really well for me (eyebrow grooming).</li>
            <li>It really makes me wonder why this product didn&#x27;t catch up with the ladies.</li>
            <li>I ordered based on the picture and would not have purchased if I knew they weren&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>I was heart broken when my favorite pair of tweezers lost their gripping.</li>
            <li>They pluck the tiniest hairs and if you are very particular about your hairs over, under and between your eyebrows, you will understand my high rating .</li>
            <li>Small, fits my hands  which allows for a nice grip.  </li>
            <li>My biggest gripe is that they did not have a case as pictured - the main reason I ordered.</li>
            <li>that will perform as well as these do, but you&#x27;ll pay a high price for</li>
            <li>I love this little tweezers.  </li>
            <li>For me they are not as easy to use due to the length.  </li>
            <li>The slant gives them a good angle and they are small enough for your purse</li>
            <li>Gave them to a friend &amp; ordered right type of La Cross tweezers for me.</li>
            <li>The new pair I have</li>
            <li>It made tweezing a true drag.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a new pair because my old ones got bent somehow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these tweezers before, for many years, but they became dull</li>
            <li>They absolutely grab any hair, short and stubby or tin and soft, with ease.</li>
            <li>I had a pair of these for years until I lost it recently which made me so very depressed.</li>
            <li>It pulls out the hair completely.</li>
            <li>It does not cut the hair which was the reason that made me reject my old tweezer.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t any different from the one I already had and didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>Man alive</li>
            <li>The metal is thinner than my old ones and they have a softer &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; to them than the originals.  .  </li>
            <li>I was beginning to struggle with my old tweezer that just didn&#x27;t hold onto the hair anymore.</li>
            <li>This is our third pair of these tweezers, the first two purchased at local stores.</li>
            <li>Also, the edges are thicker than you average tweezers which makes them not as good with delicate hairs.  </li>
            <li>For the price, we will live without it, but the picture listed should be updated for proper representation.</li>
            <li>They were the same size however the old ones were very narrow and had a fine point.  </li>
            <li>I got this primarily to replace a pair of flat tweezers that no longer gave that firm hold.</li>
            <li>So my next course of action was to look here.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried that passes that criterion.</li>
            <li>Drug store brands of tweezers simply don&#x27;t grip anything, making them completely useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it handles really nice too, or maybe I just hold it weird.</li>
            <li>not nearly as great as so many reviews claim.</li>
            <li>Long after I finished the story I kept thinking about the vivid characters.</li>
            <li>After a few days they broke and I am not sure I want to  replace them with the same kind.</li>
            <li>Since I still can&#x27;t find my first pair, I&#x27;m not sure of this, but I think they were made of one piece of metal while these new ones have been fused together and don&#x27;t even line up properly at the tip.</li>
            <li>Note that they wll come in different packaging from what is shown - no case and primary branded Sally Hanson, with the LaCross brand as secondary labeling  </li>
            <li>Not only does this take a hard grip on even the most stubborn hairs, but it can take on several at once without losing pressure on a single one.</li>
            <li>These little tweezers are much sharper than revlon or tweezerman.</li>
            <li>So hard to find but so worth it when you do.  </li>

            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I have found.</li>
            <li> My wife says these are not as useful to her as the point tip tweezers, but for me these are great for pulling out splinters, cactus needles, etc.</li>
            <li> Good fit.</li>
            <li> If you lose them like me you will be thankful at how easy it is to get another pair for $3.99 on Amazon !</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and most tweezers don&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li> I have really fine eyebrow hairs and these tweezers have no problem getting rid of them!</li>
            <li> best tweezers I have so far - gets the smallest fine hairs out with no problems - will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> LOVE these tweezers.</li>
            <li> glad i found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I received this item in a reasonable amount of time and it works absolutely great.</li>
            <li> I have about 5 different tweezers, and this is the one which works best.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love the size, they&#x27;re mini</li>
            <li> and it served me well - nice and compact and precise.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found them again.</li>
            <li> I tried many tweezers before I happened&lt;br /&gt;across</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found many sites selling these most&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;price, but the shipping was more than the price of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I read many a review on tweezers before settling on this brand.</li>
            <li> , it has some flaws; It has scratches and scuffs on it as well as being having differently-shaped tips (one being pointy and one being more square).</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Man they were cheap, but MOST importantly they WORKED!!!&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers easily grabbed even the finest hairs!!</li>
            <li> all the reviews on it were good ones and they were right.</li>
            <li> Great price, high quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I had no complaints about my previous set, they were perfect and did amazingly.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works best for picking grey hairs or scabs...</li>
            <li> So now I have a great pair of tweezers that should last me many more years to come.</li>
            <li> Great action and size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its been posted in the comments before mine that said they do such a great job on the stray hairs, but its so true!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  remove hair easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> They are strong and the contact points have no gaps so you can pull hairs or splinters with ease.</li>
            <li> It is the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, it doesn&#x27;t snap the hair in half leaving the root still embedded.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty short, but that makes them perfect for an already crowded cosmetic drawer.</li>
            <li> I&lt;br /&gt;ordered a half dozen of this excellent tweezer.</li>
            <li> But for less than f 1 v e  d 011 ars, these are the perfect brand of compact throw-in-your-bag tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the size and work great plus a nice little pouch!</li>
            <li> This little tweezers work perfectly.</li>
            <li> but they are the best hands down!</li>
            <li> You want accurate surgical tweezers, this is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> Accurate description.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is nicely polished.</li>
            <li> The reviews from others made me think this was going to be a fantastic tweezer</li>
            <li> But in my opinion, not as precise as the longer all-black ones that LaCross used to offer.</li>
            <li> They are durable &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li> that not only do La Cross tweezers work, they also feel of luxury: they are very easy to use, with a perfect chisel-edge tip.</li>
            <li> Small and with the carrying pouch they are perfect for the purse.</li>
            <li> They are a nice small size, are sturdy and do their job well...would recommend to anyone who just needs effective tweezers for light duty:)</li>
            <li> I saw these and was hoping for a pair that would easily fit into my make-up bag that would still have good quality and these fell short of that.</li>
            <li> So I found these on Amazon hoping they were the right ones and thankfully they were!</li>
            <li> sure there are other luxury brands: I know some that offer lifetime warrantees and free sharpening, which I&#x27;m sure are a worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> I wonder why they are so hard to find, because they are the BEST tweezers.</li>
            <li> Slant tip has always been my favorite as well because it really lets you get in there.  </li>
            <li> I settled for these as they were mostly inexpensive but have the handle that I like: they are super great for tiny, hard to grasp hairs and overall, good quality! :-)</li>
            <li> These are not bad, but if you have fine hairs that you need to pluck they won&#x27;t grasp them very well.</li>
            <li> Tini Tweeze Tweezers really do grab even the smallest hairs easily and once again make quick work of tweezing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, this review isn&#x27;t about the tweezers so much, but about the seller edrugstore - I would strongly advise you choose another seller so you receive the product advertised.</li>
            <li> Great quality I like the mini size easier to use for me,  and la cross also stands behind their products with lifetime warranty and great price.</li>
            <li> What a fun story with plenty of twist and a romance that delights from beginning to end.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are cheaper than most and better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Right brand,</li>
            <li> None of the others is doing the job right.</li>
            <li> They had both La Cross and Sally Hansen names on the packaging and (like these) were very inexpensive; however, they were the great original La Cross quality.</li>
            <li> It even takes out the most tiny and stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> They never lose sharpness, I can get the smallest, closest of hairs on the first try without grabbing skin.  </li>
            <li> Quite a small pair of tweazers perfect for traveling or just as a spare to have in your make-up bag or for whenever necessary.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed after losing my first pair of minis.</li>
            <li> Broke the first week I had them.</li>
            <li> First of I gotta tell you</li>
            <li> I love these - can no longer find them in my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s more is that these only cost a couple dollars WITH shipping!</li>
            <li> First and foremost: tweezers have to WORK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incredibly sharp edged, very well manufactured, good grip, nice little leatherette case.  </li>
            <li> I just wonder why the best products have such a hard time to make it on the market.</li>
            <li> These are just too short for my taste, not as easy to grab.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and fantastic - they even come with a little case.  </li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> but this one works really well for me (eyebrow grooming).</li>
            <li> It really makes me wonder why this product didn&#x27;t catch up with the ladies.</li>
            <li> I ordered based on the picture and would not have purchased if I knew they weren&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> I was heart broken when my favorite pair of tweezers lost their gripping.</li>
            <li> They pluck the tiniest hairs and if you are very particular about your hairs over, under and between your eyebrows, you will understand my high rating .</li>
            <li> Small, fits my hands  which allows for a nice grip.  </li>
            <li> My biggest gripe is that they did not have a case as pictured - the main reason I ordered.</li>
            <li> that will perform as well as these do, but you&#x27;ll pay a high price for</li>
            <li> I love this little tweezers.  </li>
            <li> For me they are not as easy to use due to the length.  </li>
            <li> The slant gives them a good angle and they are small enough for your purse</li>
            <li> Gave them to a friend &amp; ordered right type of La Cross tweezers for me.</li>
            <li> The new pair I have</li>
            <li> It made tweezing a true drag.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a new pair because my old ones got bent somehow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these tweezers before, for many years, but they became dull</li>
            <li> They absolutely grab any hair, short and stubby or tin and soft, with ease.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these for years until I lost it recently which made me so very depressed.</li>
            <li> It pulls out the hair completely.</li>
            <li> It does not cut the hair which was the reason that made me reject my old tweezer.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t any different from the one I already had and didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> Man alive</li>
            <li> The metal is thinner than my old ones and they have a softer &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; to them than the originals.  .  </li>
            <li> I was beginning to struggle with my old tweezer that just didn&#x27;t hold onto the hair anymore.</li>
            <li> This is our third pair of these tweezers, the first two purchased at local stores.</li>
            <li> Also, the edges are thicker than you average tweezers which makes them not as good with delicate hairs.  </li>
            <li> For the price, we will live without it, but the picture listed should be updated for proper representation.</li>
            <li> They were the same size however the old ones were very narrow and had a fine point.  </li>
            <li> I got this primarily to replace a pair of flat tweezers that no longer gave that firm hold.</li>
            <li> So my next course of action was to look here.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried that passes that criterion.</li>
            <li> Drug store brands of tweezers simply don&#x27;t grip anything, making them completely useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it handles really nice too, or maybe I just hold it weird.</li>
            <li> not nearly as great as so many reviews claim.</li>
            <li> Long after I finished the story I kept thinking about the vivid characters.</li>
            <li> After a few days they broke and I am not sure I want to  replace them with the same kind.</li>
            <li> Since I still can&#x27;t find my first pair, I&#x27;m not sure of this, but I think they were made of one piece of metal while these new ones have been fused together and don&#x27;t even line up properly at the tip.</li>
            <li> Note that they wll come in different packaging from what is shown - no case and primary branded Sally Hanson, with the LaCross brand as secondary labeling  </li>
            <li> Not only does this take a hard grip on even the most stubborn hairs, but it can take on several at once without losing pressure on a single one.</li>
            <li> These little tweezers are much sharper than revlon or tweezerman.</li>
            <li> So hard to find but so worth it when you do.  </li>
            <li> No black case (I think that that helps keep them sharp), and the packaging is very different and doesn&#x27;t have any product number listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it comes with a little tiny plastic tube that goes around the ends to protect them, so I don&#x27;t have to use the black case included (which it fits in well too, by the way).I really like them.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of Sally Hansen Mini Traveler tweezers and if I hold them for too long my fingers would start to hurt.   </li>
            <li> Tweezers are a little larger than I expected and not nearly as sharp.</li>
            <li> very small hahaha</li>
            <li> These were to be an extra to keep in my travel bag, other bathroom, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I contacted the seller through amazon and got a new pair right away, and they didnt even want the bad pair back.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with what I thought were the exact same tweezers.</li>
            <li> Do not need to squeeze real hard as they do grip pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Thinking these would be the same I ordered quite a few</li>
            <li> A total waste at any price.</li>
            <li> that can get kind of annoying sometimes, but can&#x27;t complain).</li>
            <li> Even though they are marketed the same as my previous pair, these come in a cheaper holder and are way less sharp.</li>
            <li> They last longer than any other ones I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!</li>
            <li> These do the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> Walmarts, Target, CVS, Walgreens, and other stores.</li>
            <li> You can get other</li>
            <li> Because I couldn&#x27;t find them, I bought some other brands.</li>
            <li> Too sharp.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are wide and it&#x27;s not very precise for my purposes.</li>
            <li> The low rating is not meant to be mean or to dis the seller; it just represents my opinion on the tweezers usefulness for my intended purposes.</li>
            <li> Wish I could still get the longer, black ones.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in stores previously.</li>
            <li> Paid less than $1 for the product...figured all it needed to do was tweeze hairs.  </li>
            <li> The style of these tweezers look the same as the one I had before, but it might be different, so I really hope it&#x27;s the same make as the one I had and not some phony fake crap that&#x27;s made by child laborers.</li>
            <li> I bought one pair that had a little piece of metal or something at the tip</li>
            <li> durable and came with a little quality case too..</li>
            <li> that 5h!t grips those damm little pesky hairs</li>
            <li> little carrying case.</li>
            <li> Like the little holding pouch so they don&#x27;t get lost in the drawer.</li>
            <li> The length and shape of the item allows for control and a firm grip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I have owned a pair of these for years and just misplaced them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> I like the small size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Tweezerman so not sure how they compare</li>
            <li> Even with the excessive shipping&lt;</li>
            <li> they were too small and did not grip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding them in stores now.</li>
            <li> But these things are so dull.</li>
            <li> had mine for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and tend to hang onto things like tweezers waaay past their usefulness, stop doing that!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no better advertisement!!  </li>
            <li> Remove hair thin metal shards that get stuck through my gloves at work.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with these tweezers...</li>
            <li> We were disappointed that this order DID NOT include the black sleeve/case for the tweezers, as seen in the picture.</li>
            <li> Too bad they&#x27;re so darn hard to find.</li>
            <li> It unfortunately didnt come wit a case for it</li>
            <li> All useless.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to grasp the hair</li>
            <li> The slant edge makes it difficult to grab the hair</li>
            <li> Sadly it couldn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been unable to find them again on Amazon or anywhere else for that matter.</li>
            <li> Awkward usage.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to tell online that they were so inferior.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I hate to think of them not carrying them......  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Outrageous!!!</li>
            <li> Which is absolutely outrageous.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> They get slivers out nicely!</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these for years until I lost it recently which made me so very depressed. I tried out several different pairs of tweezers that I bought at Walmart and Target, but none of those \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands can compare. Sadly, I checked practically every store out there, and none of those stores carry this any more. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon. I&#x27;m definitely buying several pairs just in case I lose one again. It is the best pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used, it doesn&#x27;t snap the hair in half leaving the root still embedded. It pulls out the hair completely. And it handles really nice too, or maybe I just hold it weird. I have a pair of Sally Hansen Mini Traveler tweezers and if I hold them for too long my fingers would start to hurt.   The style of these tweezers look the same as the one I had before, but it might be different, so I really hope it&#x27;s the same make as the one I had and not some phony fake crap that&#x27;s made by child laborers.</li>
            <li> the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I let my mother borrow these and she in turn let my sister borrow them.  There&#x27;s no better advertisement!!  Everyone LOVES these.  Great product.  Too bad they&#x27;re so darn hard to find.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty short, but that makes them perfect for an already crowded cosmetic drawer. I got this primarily to replace a pair of flat tweezers that no longer gave that firm hold. Not only does this take a hard grip on even the most stubborn hairs, but it can take on several at once without losing pressure on a single one. I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> LOVE these tweezers. I lost mine awhile back haven&#x27;t found another pair that work as well as these! glad i found them here on Amazon. i ordered 2!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these tweezers before, for many years, but they became dull and I had to get another one. I searched everywhere for them and even tried others in the meantime. None of them worked.  So I found these on Amazon hoping they were the right ones and thankfully they were! They are the best inexpensive tweezers I&#x27;ve found that can get even the tiniest hairs.</li>
            <li> This little tweezers work perfectly. It even takes out the most tiny and stubborn hair. Just love it!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tweezer I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are strong and the contact points have no gaps so you can pull hairs or splinters with ease.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers ever.  Very easy to handle and they grab the hairs perfectly.  I intend to order another pair - just in case.</li>
            <li> I hope La Cross NEVER goes out of business.  If they do, I&#x27;m going to buy out all of these tweezers!  They never lose sharpness, I can get the smallest, closest of hairs on the first try without grabbing skin.  Fantastic!  Slant tip has always been my favorite as well because it really lets you get in there.  I don&#x27;t think I can express how great these are much more.. so buy them NOW! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Small, fits my hands  which allows for a nice grip.  The slant ends do a good job and fit nicely in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Quite a small pair of tweazers perfect for traveling or just as a spare to have in your make-up bag or for whenever necessary. Work very well.</li>
            <li> What a fun story with plenty of twist and a romance that delights from beginning to end. Long after I finished the story I kept thinking about the vivid characters.</li>
            <li> Right brand, but I need point tip not slant. Gave them to a friend &amp; ordered right type of La Cross tweezers for me.</li>
            <li> I like the small size.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of La Cross tweezers that were lost.  They were the same size however the old ones were very narrow and had a fine point.  I&#x27;m just not used to them yet but they seem made well.</li>
            <li> Again it is the kind of tweezers I wanted and not what they wanted to send me. I have bought from others and they send everything else but what I wanted. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> They are a nice small size, are sturdy and do their job well...would recommend to anyone who just needs effective tweezers for light duty:)</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I can find these and I hate to think of them not carrying them......  I bought one pair that had a little piece of metal or something at the tip so it wouldnt close properly and I contacted the seller through amazon and got a new pair right away, and they didnt even want the bad pair back.  Good Customer Service, great product!</li>
            <li> I received this item in a reasonable amount of time and it works absolutely great. The stainless steel is nicely polished. It does not cut the hair which was the reason that made me reject my old tweezer. The length and shape of the item allows for control and a firm grip. Additionally, the price is awesome! Don&#x27;t waste your money with tweezerman. Just go with this.</li>
            <li> great product. durable and came with a little quality case too..great for yout purse..i would recoment this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed after losing my first pair of minis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its been posted in the comments before mine that said they do such a great job on the stray hairs, but its so true! It unfortunately didnt come wit a case for it but they are the best hands down!</li>
            <li> THE IS THE BEST TWEEZER EVER MADE !!! It catches even the tiniest hairs. Buy it! You will be glad you did!!!</li>
            <li> Did not grip the hair.They do not have a very good grip which causes much of what is being twee zed to slip  out. I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing tiny about the quality of these tweezers.  They pluck the tiniest hairs and if you are very particular about your hairs over, under and between your eyebrows, you will understand my high rating .</li>
            <li> It works when others do not.  I have about 5 different tweezers, and this is the one which works best.</li>
            <li> not nearly as great as so many reviews claim. have to hold at a specific angle and pinch at one side of the slant to get em to work.</li>
            <li> best tweezers I have so far - gets the smallest fine hairs out with no problems - will buy again</li>
            <li> You can pay more for some high-end, brand-name tweezers, but I doubt they would be as good as these.  I love them.  Hard to find in stores, so I have to get them from Amazon (I always turn to Amazon when I can&#x27;t find things).  They are cheap and fantastic - they even come with a little case.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I love the size, they&#x27;re mini while still being big enough to work well. They fit perfectly in the miniature manicure kit I got http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HK2H1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_27 and it comes with a little tiny plastic tube that goes around the ends to protect them, so I don&#x27;t have to use the black case included (which it fits in well too, by the way).I really like them.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers!!!!  Work great on those stubborn face hairs!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the size and work great plus a nice little pouch! These little tweezers are much sharper than revlon or tweezerman.</li>
            <li> This brand is the only one I&#x27;ve found that can actually grab any and every hair I have. Only problem I had my I didn&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;tini&amp;#34; part.... very small hahaha</li>
            <li> I love tweezers when they work!  These do the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers. Remove hair thin metal shards that get stuck through my gloves at work.</li>
            <li> I ordered the tweezers pictured a couple years back and it served me well - nice and compact and precise. But then I lost them! I ordered them again, through edrugstore, but received a very different product. No black case (I think that that helps keep them sharp), and the packaging is very different and doesn&#x27;t have any product number listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this review isn&#x27;t about the tweezers so much, but about the seller edrugstore - I would strongly advise you choose another seller so you receive the product advertised.</li>
            <li> The reviews from others made me think this was going to be a fantastic tweezer and it isn&#x27;t any different from the one I already had and didn&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are a little larger than I expected and not nearly as sharp. My biggest gripe is that they did not have a case as pictured - the main reason I ordered. I have a pair I bought several years ago and I still use the case. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Broke the first week I had them. I was very disappointed with this product. Will not buy from this manufacturer again.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are wide and it&#x27;s not very precise for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Great price, high quality. Everything I wanted in a pair of tweezers. ear hairs, you have no where to run!</li>
            <li> These were a gift. but I&#x27;m sure they like them.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great. Small and with the carrying pouch they are perfect for the purse. I have another pair for over two years and they are still great. This pair will travel with me.</li>
            <li> I have owned a pair of these for years and just misplaced them. They have been wonderful and I thought I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with what I thought were the exact same tweezers. Even though they are marketed the same as my previous pair, these come in a cheaper holder and are way less sharp. Since I still can&#x27;t find my first pair, I&#x27;m not sure of this, but I think they were made of one piece of metal while these new ones have been fused together and don&#x27;t even line up properly at the tip. Time for me to switch to Tweezerman...</li>
            <li> These are a good size for me and they work great!  I have used them before and I really like them.</li>
            <li> These are great! I was heart broken when my favorite pair of tweezers lost their gripping. I settled for these as they were mostly inexpensive but have the handle that I like: they are super great for tiny, hard to grasp hairs and overall, good quality! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Tweezerman so not sure how they compare but this one works really well for me (eyebrow grooming). It was delivered within 5 business day.</li>
            <li> These are not bad, but if you have fine hairs that you need to pluck they won&#x27;t grasp them very well.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers, with the surest grip.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers. They grip well and are sleek. I am a definite fan for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used them on my brows a couple times.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than expected. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and most tweezers don&#x27;t grab.  Theses are the best I have ever had. This purchase was a replacement for my lost pair. I&#x27;m so glad I found them again.</li>
            <li> But in my opinion, not as precise as the longer all-black ones that LaCross used to offer. These are just too short for my taste, not as easy to grab. Wish I could still get the longer, black ones.</li>
            <li> First of I gotta tell you I&#x27;m a guy. I tried many tweezers before I happened&lt;br /&gt;across these at Walmart. Man they were cheap, but MOST importantly they WORKED!!!&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers easily grabbed even the finest hairs!! I love these tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;I had mine for at least 5 years. Recently I lost them. No problem, I&#x27;d just get&lt;br /&gt;another pair at Walmart. Problem, Walmart doesn&#x27;t carry them anymore. I searched&lt;br /&gt;various Walmarts, Target, CVS, Walgreens, and other stores. Can&#x27;t find them any&lt;br /&gt;where. I resorted to the net. Man alive I found many sites selling these most&lt;br /&gt;excellent tweezers for $6 to $12. Outrageous!!! I paid $1.69 for them originally&lt;br /&gt;at Walmart. I found that Amazon was selling them thru a vendor for $1.42. Great&lt;br /&gt;price, but the shipping was more than the price of the tweezers. End result, I&lt;br /&gt;ordered a half dozen of this excellent tweezer. Even with the excessive shipping&lt;br /&gt;cost, it worked out to just over $3 per tweezer. That said I am happy and feel&lt;br /&gt;lucky to get these tweezers at this price!! I figure they will last me my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize just how excellent these tweezers are. They grab the FINEST&lt;br /&gt;hairs, some of which I can only see with a magnifying glass. You can get other&lt;br /&gt;tweezers that will perform as well as these do, but you&#x27;ll pay a high price for&lt;br /&gt;them. You want accurate surgical tweezers, this is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;in stores anymore, get them online while you can.</li>
            <li> Great quality I like the mini size easier to use for me,  and la cross also stands behind their products with lifetime warranty and great price.</li>
            <li> It can pic the tiniest of hairs and will even cut some because it is so sharp(although that can get kind of annoying sometimes, but can&#x27;t complain).</li>
            <li> I read many a review on tweezers before settling on this brand. Why? all the reviews on it were good ones and they were right. These are by far the best tweezers I have found. They grab the smallest hairs and out they come.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with these tweezers!  Granted, I&#x27;ve only used them once because I just got them three days ago.  I have really fine eyebrow hairs and these tweezers have no problem getting rid of them!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers! They last longer than any other ones I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding them in stores now. I wonder why they are so hard to find, because they are the BEST tweezers. They absolutely grab any hair, short and stubby or tin and soft, with ease. Because I couldn&#x27;t find them, I bought some other brands. All useless. None of the others is doing the job right. So now I am ordering a stack of La Cross here on Amazon. I just wonder why the best products have such a hard time to make it on the market. These tweezers are cheaper than most and better than any other I have tried. It really makes me wonder why this product didn&#x27;t catch up with the ladies.</li>
            <li> Great for travel size and all. But these things are so dull. Not meant for plucking short stubborn eyebrow hairs. Maybe it works best for picking grey hairs or scabs... I&#x27;ll make use of it somehow... But&lt;br /&gt;I could&#x27;ve gotten a premium Mcwrap at mcdonalds instead for the $4 bucks I spenton this.</li>
            <li> My wife says these are not as useful to her as the point tip tweezers, but for me these are great for pulling out splinters, cactus needles, etc.</li>
            <li> These are the tweezers to use should you ever find yourself required to do surgical operations... with tweezers, for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredibly sharp edged, very well manufactured, good grip, nice little leatherette case.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with these tweezers...they were too small and did not grip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I saw these and was hoping for a pair that would easily fit into my make-up bag that would still have good quality and these fell short of that. They do not have a very good grip, which causes much of what is being tweezed to slip out.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product in stores previously. I lost it and looked for a replacement of it and found it online. I bought it from edrugstore and it didn&#x27;t come with a case. I really liked the leathery case before and wished they would have told me it wouldn&#x27;t come with it.&lt;br /&gt;I had no complaints about my previous set, they were perfect and did amazingly. The new pair I have, it has some flaws; It has scratches and scuffs on it as well as being having differently-shaped tips (one being pointy and one being more square). in a way, I feel like the pair I got isn&#x27;t finished or should have been taken out during quality control.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for you to ask the seller if the product comes with the case and if it looks like the picture before buying it.</li>
            <li> I love these - can no longer find them in my local drugstore. They&#x27;re the perfect length, perfect sharpness (many others are too sharp and hurt my face), Best mini-tweezers out there.</li>
            <li> Love these. Carry one  in my purse, one in my travel bag and one by my magnifying mirror. Best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These were to be an extra to keep in my travel bag, other bathroom, etc.  The metal is thinner than my old ones and they have a softer &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; to them than the originals.  .  Note that they wll come in different packaging from what is shown - no case and primary branded Sally Hanson, with the LaCross brand as secondary labeling  I ordered based on the picture and would not have purchased if I knew they weren&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> Item meets expectations. Good fit. Accurate description. Arrived timely.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are perfect! They grab the tiniest hairs. I had been searching for a new pair because my old ones got bent somehow. I looked at Sephora since that&#x27;s where I do my make-up shopping but all their tweezers cost $20!!! Which is absolutely outrageous. So my next course of action was to look here. I happened across this brand and saw all the great reviews and what&#x27;s more is that these only cost a couple dollars WITH shipping! So now I have a great pair of tweezers that should last me many more years to come. Final verdict, these are a MUST buy if you are diy tweezer!!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are a great brand to buy. I love them. Very good. price too. Great action and size. Happy me</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter as she had used them before. After a few days they broke and I am not sure I want to  replace them with the same kind.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to grasp the hair therfore it is time consuming. The slant edge makes it difficult to grab the hair</li>
            <li> This is our third pair of these tweezers, the first two purchased at local stores. Precision is excellent &amp; size is ideal. They are durable &amp; easy to clean. We were disappointed that this order DID NOT include the black sleeve/case for the tweezers, as seen in the picture. For the price, we will live without it, but the picture listed should be updated for proper representation.</li>
            <li> Awful. Too sharp. Just break hair off. Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> So hard to find but so worth it when you do.  I love this little tweezers.  I actually have two - one is in my travel bag at all times!</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers made. The slant gives them a good angle and they are small enough for your purse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and if this thing works with me, it works with you, that 5h!t grips those damm little pesky hairs</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  remove hair easily.  Awkward usage.</li>
            <li> Paid less than $1 for the product...figured all it needed to do was tweeze hairs.  Sadly it couldn&#x27;t do that. The tips do not meet close enough to actually grab and hold the hair.  Am sure there are lots and lots of things that these tweezers can be used for; unfortunately, it can&#x27;t do what I needed them for.  The low rating is not meant to be mean or to dis the seller; it just represents my opinion on the tweezers usefulness for my intended purposes.</li>
            <li> For me they are not as easy to use due to the length.  Also, the edges are thicker than you average tweezers which makes them not as good with delicate hairs.  Do not need to squeeze real hard as they do grip pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice little carrying case.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel - bought 3 - one for each toiletries bag!</li>
            <li> First and foremost: tweezers have to WORK. So far this is the only brand I&#x27;ve tried that passes that criterion. Drug store brands of tweezers simply don&#x27;t grip anything, making them completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasant thing then that not only do La Cross tweezers work, they also feel of luxury: they are very easy to use, with a perfect chisel-edge tip. This model has a nice compact size and comes with a brilliantly handy protective leatherette (even the leatherette is fantastically well made). The leatherette is essential: a pair of tweezers can be ruined if their tip is banged around. Quality all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are other luxury brands: I know some that offer lifetime warrantees and free sharpening, which I&#x27;m sure are a worthwhile investment. But for less than f 1 v e  d 011 ars, these are the perfect brand of compact throw-in-your-bag tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a pair of scissor-grip La Cross tweezers but I&#x27;ve been unable to find them again on Amazon or anywhere else for that matter.</li>
            <li> Best tweezer EVER. You will own them for life.  If you lose them like me you will be thankful at how easy it is to get another pair for $3.99 on Amazon !</li>
            <li> If you are like me and tend to hang onto things like tweezers waaay past their usefulness, stop doing that! I was beginning to struggle with my old tweezer that just didn&#x27;t hold onto the hair anymore. It made tweezing a true drag. The newer design of the LaCross Tini Tweeze Tweezers really do grab even the smallest hairs easily and once again make quick work of tweezing. Really. Get these.</li>
            <li> I purchased some locally that were being discontinued. They had both La Cross and Sally Hansen names on the packaging and (like these) were very inexpensive; however, they were the great original La Cross quality. Thinking these would be the same I ordered quite a few but these are definitely not made to the same specifications. The packaging is the only thing that is the same. It was impossible to tell online that they were so inferior. A total waste at any price.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers. Easy to hold on to. Grip hairs nicely. Well made. Like the little holding pouch so they don&#x27;t get lost in the drawer.</li>
