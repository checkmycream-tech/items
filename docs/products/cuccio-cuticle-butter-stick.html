            <li>and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>One problem I have with this sort of thing, is I buy them and think it&#x27;s going to be awesome, and then it&#x27;s basically a stick of unflavored chapstick.</li>
            <li>As good as the oil, smells wonderful and keeps cuticles looking perfect...</li>
            <li>They are incredibly inexpensive as is the shipping</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>stars because I think a nail oil works better, but this is great to take on the go.</li>
            <li>It also lasted hours after application...and the smell is great :)</li>
            <li>Love the portably, ease of use, and the smell is great - smells like a tropical vacay.</li>
            <li>This smells great, goes on nicely, fits easily in my purse, and works well!</li>
            <li>Works great and convenient easy to use stick form.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I used a cuticle conditioning stick many years ago and loved the ease of how they go on.</li>
            <li>excellent and fast service.</li>
            <li>Howeer, the scent is suuuuuuper strong (and I like scented products!)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost more perfume than product.</li>
            <li>LOVE these..</li>
            <li>I handle so many papers and</li>
            <li>Love these cuticle sticks.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to just keep in your purse and use it whenever. :)</li>
            <li>easy to carry with you</li>
            <li>If you have ANY aversion to strong scents, you do not want to buy this.</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; type of sticks go on neatly and smoothly and there is no need to wash after using it.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant but this is very personal.</li>
            <li>However, this works a treat, smells nice (not overly girly or masculine) and is easy-peasy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it goes quick.</li>
            <li>Very convenient, easy to use.</li>
            <li>and they get to you fast!</li>
            <li>Smells good, not sure if I see any improvements yet though after about a month of using it</li>
            <li>Softening and caring and cuticle looks very cared when treated with this product.</li>
            <li>Very moisturising</li>
            <li>i liked this product because it wasnt messy like cuticle oils can be.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase these from this supplier for as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li>However, the aroma of this thing isn&#x27;t remotely &#x27;milk and honey&#x27; and it is also incredibly strong and off-putting.</li>
            <li>Very soft cuticle cream that works well</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll go back to an oil pen made with natural oils like avocado that don&#x27;t smell so much.</li>
            <li>If I hold my arms out as far away from me as I can, I can still smell this product.</li>
            <li>They absorb naturally into your cuticle and leaves them soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>It is handy to keep in my purse and is less messy than lotions.</li>
            <li>exact same color and texture as coconut butter, just in more convenient, less messy stick, i guess?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with dry cuticles!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the twist up oil based cuticle sticks, and was interested in trying this one thinking it might be a little cleaner to apply.</li>

            <li> It is fairly easy to apply, but I still end up having to rub the butter in, so it&#x27;s not really better or worse than my old way.</li>
            <li> This is super slippery and thin on the cuticle, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Has worked so well on my cuticles, nails, and even dry fingertips.</li>
            <li> The other balms or creams that now come in pots are a mess and get under the nails of the hand I use to apply them.</li>
            <li> They have been IMPOSSIBLE to find in the last several years</li>
            <li> It seems to help some but no more than just lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is a little difficult putting on cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I was sick of thick and greasy treatments since I like to use them at work.</li>

Howeer, the scent is suuuuuuper strong (and I like scented products!) and it&#x27;s almost more perfume than product. Not convinced it did a damn thing.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not sure if I see any improvements yet though after about a month of using it</li>
            <li> emollient....easy to carry with you</li>
            <li> This smells great, goes on nicely, fits easily in my purse, and works well! I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because I think a nail oil works better, but this is great to take on the go.</li>
            <li> As good as the oil, smells wonderful and keeps cuticles looking perfect...I keep one at my desk, one in my car and one in my nightstand...LOVE these..</li>
            <li> Good thing but didnt try it in colder weather. Smell is pleasant but this is very personal. Softening and caring and cuticle looks very cared when treated with this product. Would recommend</li>
            <li> it has an overpowering faux tropical fragrance. ick. i&#x27;ll go back to an oil pen made with natural oils like avocado that don&#x27;t smell so much.</li>
            <li> exact same color and texture as coconut butter, just in more convenient, less messy stick, i guess?</li>
            <li> I adore this! Very moisturising and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like the smell.  It is a little difficult putting on cuticles.  It seems to help some but no more than just lotion.  It is handy to keep in my purse and is less messy than lotions.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my desk drawer at school. I handle so many papers and this keeps my cuticles hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love these cuticle sticks.  Works great and convenient easy to use stick form.  Highly recommend for anyone with dry cuticles!</li>
            <li> i liked this product because it wasnt messy like cuticle oils can be.  It also lasted hours after application...and the smell is great :)</li>
            <li> Love the portably, ease of use, and the smell is great - smells like a tropical vacay. The penetration of the butter is somewhat lacking and I have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Has worked so well on my cuticles, nails, and even dry fingertips. With how it is in a &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34; style tube it&#x27;s so easy to just keep in your purse and use it whenever. :)</li>
            <li> I used a cuticle conditioning stick many years ago and loved the ease of how they go on.They have been IMPOSSIBLE to find in the last several years so I was elated to come across these by Cuccio. Unlike the oils you find today, they do not get all over you and everything else. These &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; type of sticks go on neatly and smoothly and there is no need to wash after using it. They absorb naturally into your cuticle and leaves them soft and conditioned. The other balms or creams that now come in pots are a mess and get under the nails of the hand I use to apply them. I hope they make these forever! I will continue to purchase these from this supplier for as long as they remain available. They are incredibly inexpensive as is the shipping and they get to you fast!</li>
            <li> One problem I have with this sort of thing, is I buy them and think it&#x27;s going to be awesome, and then it&#x27;s basically a stick of unflavored chapstick. However, this works a treat, smells nice (not overly girly or masculine) and is easy-peasy to apply.</li>
            <li> excellent and fast service. my wife likes the quality and the color and there is fight between her and my girls as whose it belongs to!</li>
            <li> Bought these on a recommendation of a friend. I am hooked! They are conveinent to carry with me and Can be applied any time.</li>
            <li> Very soft cuticle cream that works well but it goes quick. I apply at night and this lasted around two weeks.</li>
