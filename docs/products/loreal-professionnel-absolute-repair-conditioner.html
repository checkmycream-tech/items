            <li>This has repaired the damage caused and is easy on the pocket book.</li>

            <li>It arrives quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still healthy hair, but I wanted to see if this would make the texture more like it was before all of the above.  </li>
            <li>They always get it to me quickly.</li>

            <li>I cannot say enough about this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>(Only point for this is that if you&#x27;re travelling, this is a much more convenient bottle to lug around than a huge jar.)</li>
            <li>With L&#x27;Oreal Professional, it restores my hair to become healthy again.</li>
            <li>I am switching to more natural solutions.</li>
            <li>May also be good for a deep conditioning of normal hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want to hydrate your hair more, you should try the LOreal Professional Intense Repair.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week.</li>
            <li>It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my 4A hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say bad things about this product because it did work better than most conditioners and had good results for my dry-dyed-damaged hair.</li>
            <li>But I found I only had to use a fraction of the amount I had been using with my old conditioner to get amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I had the spray previously and really liked it.</li>
            <li>After coloring and aging in general, my hair had become kind of coarse.  </li>
            <li>I blonde my hair and into the bargain have fine, straight hair and also I am on a lot of medication.</li>
            <li>and I have found the two work very well together.  </li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Absolut repair after my hair was damaged by highlights after a straight perm.</li>
            <li>It really made my hair smoothe and shiny</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>This product used to work on my hair when my hair was in a healthier condition and there wasn&#x27;t much to \\&quot;Repair\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love the entire l&#x27;oreal professional series absolut repair line.</li>
            <li>My hair was totally destroyed, I swear, but after use the shampoo, hair treatment and the conditioner, and my hair really changes for good.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend it for my fine hair and for his grey.</li>
            <li>before I used L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>My hair is problematic, with hypothyrodism and a very dry climate, my hair breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived with only French on the bottle...had to look up to make sure</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And amazon&#x27;s price is a little better than the salon price.</li>
            <li>and I just used the salon products I normally use, my hair looked and felt just like it did before using the L&#x27;Oreal product.  </li>
            <li>(once a week is my normal time)</li>
            <li>a few more times before I decide to use the straightener.</li>
            <li>I was a long time pureology user and that actually did more damage than helped.  </li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many hair remedies that would help give the luster and shine back to my hair as well as the softness even while I continue to color it and this product hands down wins bar far.</li>
            <li>It did leave my fine hair feeling much restored from being dry, and some of the curl coming back.  </li>
            <li>I use the masque like a 2 min conditioner every other day when I wash my hair, and the results are better and I use a lot less product because the masque is super thick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my hair and makes it very soft.</li>
            <li>For a professional product, the cost is very reasonable and the product performs at the same level as those costly items.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was surprised at how thin it was, and I felt like I had to add more to my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with it.</li>
            <li>You can only buy it in certain salons and online.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Shampoo, 8.45-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li>and it really helped get my hair back in shape.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be soft as silk.  </li>
            <li>It makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot professional products.</li>
            <li>So far it has done the job</li>
            <li>If it had worked wonders on my frazzled hair, I wouldn&#x27;t mind investing in something like this regularly, but it just didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, that I can tell.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s really quite pricey given the tiny size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Since my sister and my girl friend are very sensitive to their hair condition, they always wanted to try many products then gave THAT many leftovers to me :( .</li>
            <li>but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal,</li>
            <li>It comes in a yellow bottle and it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair so this is highly unusual for me.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommend the Absolut Repair products after my hair was extremely damaged from coloring and hot styling.  </li>
            <li>My husband brought home the conditioner and he barely uses any product, so that is a vote in itself.</li>
            <li>I have my young hair back!  </li>
            <li>Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>Only a small amount each time I wash my hair, which is every day, is necessary to smooth my hair and give it body.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks the condition of my hair was already improving and within a few months, along with regular trims, my hair was back to its healthy state.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone with extemely damaged hair due to styling or coloring.</li>
            <li>My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos.</li>

            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Shampoo, 8.45-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> and it really helped get my hair back in shape.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be soft as silk.  </li>
            <li> It makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot professional products.</li>
            <li> So far it has done the job</li>
            <li> If it had worked wonders on my frazzled hair, I wouldn&#x27;t mind investing in something like this regularly, but it just didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, that I can tell.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s really quite pricey given the tiny size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Since my sister and my girl friend are very sensitive to their hair condition, they always wanted to try many products then gave THAT many leftovers to me :( .</li>
            <li> but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal,</li>
            <li> It comes in a yellow bottle and it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair so this is highly unusual for me.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommend the Absolut Repair products after my hair was extremely damaged from coloring and hot styling.  </li>
            <li> My husband brought home the conditioner and he barely uses any product, so that is a vote in itself.</li>
            <li> I have my young hair back!  </li>
            <li> Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount each time I wash my hair, which is every day, is necessary to smooth my hair and give it body.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks the condition of my hair was already improving and within a few months, along with regular trims, my hair was back to its healthy state.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone with extemely damaged hair due to styling or coloring.</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I do usually use salon products, and as far as a professional repairing conditioner, it didn&#x27;t blow me away at all.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser initially suggested this product because my hair is very dry, especially on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair that damages easily and looks like straw even with other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because my hair was starting to feel dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I blow dry, flat iron, color my hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and just works it into the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> So that you understand how dry, I didn&#x27;t wash it for two weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like using nothing, doesn&#x27;t soften my hair, my hair is tangled and unmanageable, my scalp is really dry</li>
            <li> Definatly try L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series because it&#x27;s not like the usual over the counter L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> (I am naturaly dark brown )and you need instant repair</li>
            <li> It was finally controllable after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on very dry and/or damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly, thick, and dry hair</li>
            <li> I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was recommended to me by my stylist due to dry ends.  </li>
            <li> A small amount will go a long way for my over colored dry hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is not profitable to order in such a small size.</li>
            <li> I knew it was a smaller bottle, but I didnt expect it to be THAT small.</li>
            <li> When I first received my 5 oz bottle, I was disappointed and thinking this stuff will last me about a week!  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that I usually wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> But when this little bottle is finished, I will repurchase.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks, my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty.</li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I regretfully got a straightener a few years ago that burned my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped to my place in a few days and have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I take a small amount (less than the size of a dime) and work it into ALL my hair and LEAVE IT IN.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small but you have to use just a little.</li>
            <li> My hairdressers had been complaining about my hair feeling thin and dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely sucks that it&#x27;s so expensive, but I have found that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this conditioner, which is perhaps why I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny and very expensive</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties, and my hair started getting extra dry and awful...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive compared to my usual conditioners, so I use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels weighed down and dirty.</li>
            <li> my hair, very expensive (small bottle), had to apply a LOT of it to cover hair    </li>
            <li> I had some damaged hair from a bad product and I saw immediate results with the repair shampoo and conditioner.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my default conditioner and I keep buying it from the same seller. I have natural curly, thick, and dry hair so this stuff works wonders as it deep conditions without taking away my bounce and body. It arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> Loved it. I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with [[ASIN:B000KQ7U84 L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Shampoo, 8.45-Ounce Bottle]] for over one year and I&#x27;m very satisfied with them. Since my sister and my girl friend are very sensitive to their hair condition, they always wanted to try many products then gave THAT many leftovers to me :( . For more than three years, this situation make me try most of hair products which you can find easily in the market. Of them, this product was the best for hydrating my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner and shampoo the best</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous brands of conditioners trying to get the \\&quot;just-left-the-salon\\&quot; feel and this does it! I love the entire l&#x27;oreal professional series absolut repair line.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Cellular Conditioner seems to be a good product. I had some damaged hair from a bad product and I saw immediate results with the repair shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Third time to order this product!  I regretfully got a straightener a few years ago that burned my hair.  I started using this and it really helped get my hair back in shape.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It hydrates my hair and makes it very soft. I have damaged hair from highlighting and hairspray. With L&#x27;Oreal Professional, it restores my hair to become healthy again. I&#x27;ve tried Matrix, Redken, and other great products, but this one is the best. If you want to hydrate your hair more, you should try the LOreal Professional Intense Repair. It comes in a yellow bottle and it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it. The L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series are the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried. Definatly try L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series because it&#x27;s not like the usual over the counter L&#x27;Oreal products. You can only buy it in certain salons and online. It&#x27;s made my hair shiny and smooth and I&#x27;ll never switch hair products again.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutly the BEST shampoo and conditioner for damaged, overtreated hair! I have tried sooooo many hair remedies that would help give the luster and shine back to my hair as well as the softness even while I continue to color it and this product hands down wins bar far.</li>
            <li> PROS: good conditioner, excellent fragrance  CONS: did not \\&quot;repair\\&quot; my hair, very expensive (small bottle), had to apply a LOT of it to cover hair    I blow dry, flat iron, color my hair.  My hair used to be soft as silk.  It&#x27;s still healthy hair, but I wanted to see if this would make the texture more like it was before all of the above.  It lasted ~12/13  shampoos.  GREAT fragrance, and while I noticed improvement in shine, hair health, and moisture when I used it, when it ran out and I just used the salon products I normally use, my hair looked and felt just like it did before using the L&#x27;Oreal product.  So it&#x27;s a great conditioner, but definitely didn&#x27;t \\&quot;repair\\&quot; any processing damage to my hair.    Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner (along with the shampoo) for about a week now. I bought it because my hair was starting to feel dry and frizzy. The first time I used it, I was surprised at how thin it was, and I felt like I had to add more to my shoulder-length hair. It&#x27;s definitely better than drugstore brands, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> My hairdressers had been complaining about my hair feeling thin and dry. I blonde my hair and into the bargain have fine, straight hair and also I am on a lot of medication. After using this product once a week for four weeks, I went back to my hairdressers and they couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair.   My hairdressers did not know that I had been using this product as in their salon they use a different brand of hair products. My hair feels so much more hydrated and thicker. I thoroughly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the last woman that cut my hair recommended it for me.  I&#x27;m so glad she did because my hair is smoother and healthier than it&#x27;s ever been.  It definitely sucks that it&#x27;s so expensive, but I have found that a little goes a long way.  I have medium length hair that I usually wash every other day.  The same hairdresser told me to use a regular drug-store clarifying shampoon (I use neutrogena) and I have found the two work very well together.  I alternate between the clarifying shampoo and just a regular store bought moisturizing shampoo.  Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> When I first received my 5 oz bottle, I was disappointed and thinking this stuff will last me about a week!  But I found I only had to use a fraction of the amount I had been using with my old conditioner to get amazing results.  A small amount will go a long way for my over colored dry hair.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. Only a small amount each time I wash my hair, which is every day, is necessary to smooth my hair and give it body. After I shampoo,  I apply about a dime size amount, working it into my hair for about 60 seconds.. Hope they keep making this product. I love it.  My hairdresser does not carry this brand, so I rely on amazon. They always get it to me quickly. My hair is shoulder length or longer. 5 oz lasts me about  2 months.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner. I had the spray previously and really liked it. My husband brought home the conditioner and he barely uses any product, so that is a vote in itself. I recommend it for my fine hair and for his grey.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser initially suggested this product because my hair is very dry, especially on the ends.  I love it.  It really works well.  And amazon&#x27;s price is a little better than the salon price.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was shipped to my place in a few days and have been using it for a few weeks. I saw results within the first week. My hair has life again and all of my friends have been complimenting on my \\&quot;new\\&quot; hairdo...</li>
            <li> This works wonders on very dry and/or damaged hair.  May also be good for a deep conditioning of normal hair.  One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used.  It smells great too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have ever used.  It does not weigh my hair down...nor make it break off.  It makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I tried the Absolut repair after my hair was damaged by highlights after a straight perm. It felt like it stripped my hair more, and my impression was that it wasn&#x27;t much better than most drugstore brands. I do usually use salon products, and as far as a professional repairing conditioner, it didn&#x27;t blow me away at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  It smells nice and it is moisturizing.  However, I do not feel like it&#x27;s anything out of the ordinatry and I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The product leaves a film on my hair. My hair feels weighed down and dirty. I have dry hair so this is highly unusual for me.</li>
            <li> I have my young hair back!  After coloring and aging in general, my hair had become kind of coarse.  This whole line is excellent and brought back the silkiness to my hair!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful stuff! I have extremely dry and frizzy hair. So that you understand how dry, I didn&#x27;t wash it for two weeks (once a week is my normal time) before I used L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Neofibrine Repairing Shampoo for Very Damaged Hair for the first time. After two weeks, my hair was starting to get some oil in it but not enough that it looked or felt dirty. It was finally controllable after about a week and a half. When I used the shampoo, I immediately felt a difference. My hair felt softer than it normally does with other shampoos. It felt like I was conditioning it. I washed my hair twice and used the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Conditioner, rinsing it out immediately. Then I put on the L&#x27;Oreal Professional Series Expert Absolut Repair Masque and left it on while I finished showering about 10 minutes or so. I did put in a little leave-in conditioner I regularly use as well. I was going to put a chemical straightener on it after I used this shampoo but it was so soft and shiny, especially compared to normal, that I changed my mind and will use this shampoo and conditioners a few more times before I decide to use the straightener. A chemical straightener will take the frizz out and comes with such rich conditioners that your hair is soft and manageable and you don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron with it. But, this shampoo and the conditioners are almost as good as a straightener without the chemicals. The new girl at work today said, \\&quot;Your hair looks different. What did you do to it?\\&quot;. It was these products that I used for the first time yesterday.  This is a real review by a real individual who has absolutely nothing to do with Loreal. I plan to post this same review for all three products. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and what works for me may not be the thing for you but you will not know unless you try it.</li>
            <li> This product works great but don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner, it works great on my damaged colored hair. but it is not profitable to order in such a small size.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommend the Absolut Repair products after my hair was extremely damaged from coloring and hot styling.  Within a few weeks the condition of my hair was already improving and within a few months, along with regular trims, my hair was back to its healthy state.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone with extemely damaged hair due to styling or coloring.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the winner.Probably the best conditioner I ever tried for colored damaged hair and I have tried a lot professional products.It smells devine and my hair feels so healthy after using it and is frizz free.I have used  both, the shampoo and the conditioner, and I&#x27;ll keep using it.The bottle is small but you have to use just a little.Ladies buy it and your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> Not all that. I will finish this bottle and not buy it anymore</li>
            <li> I used this and it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair this bottle is overpriced It&#x27;s tiny and very expensive</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results of using the Absolut Repair Conditioner paired with the Shampoo. Was recommended to me by a stylist - my hair feels softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve had (definitely top 5), but it&#x27;s my number 1 when it comes to smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was recommended to me by my stylist due to dry ends.  So far it has done the job well and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, my hair feels very soft, light and healthy. I always love  quality of L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever found.  I recommend it to all my family and friends.  I have thin hair that damages easily and looks like straw even with other conditioners.  THIS product is amazing.  I take a small amount (less than the size of a dime) and work it into ALL my hair and LEAVE IT IN.  My daughter has long hair and just works it into the ends.  I cannot say enough about this amazing product.  My hair is shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> My hair is problematic, with hypothyrodism and a very dry climate, my hair breaks easily.  Using the Absolut Repair system helps maintain healthier hair.</li>
            <li> It really made my hair smoothe and shiny&lt;br /&gt;And I loved it. I&#x27;m looking forward to purchase this item again</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this conditioner, which is perhaps why I was disappointed. I knew it was a smaller bottle, but I didnt expect it to be THAT small. If it had worked wonders on my frazzled hair, I wouldn&#x27;t mind investing in something like this regularly, but it just didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, that I can tell.</li>
            <li> if you have blonde hair that you bleach every month (I am naturaly dark brown )and you need instant repair this is good product for every day conditioning ...</li>
            <li> I love it . It works very well. And It smells so good. I will buy it again when it gone</li>
            <li> For a professional product, the cost is very reasonable and the product performs at the same level as those costly items.  I was a long time pureology user and that actually did more damage than helped.  This has repaired the damage caused and is easy on the pocket book.</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The most wonderful product I ever use. My hair was totally destroyed, I swear, but after use the shampoo, hair treatment and the conditioner, and my hair really changes for good.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recomended!!!</li>
            <li> This product used to work on my hair when my hair was in a healthier condition and there wasn&#x27;t much to \\&quot;Repair\\&quot;. Even since I have gotten highlights this product doesn&#x27;t do anything for me anymore.  It&#x27;s almost like using nothing, doesn&#x27;t soften my hair, my hair is tangled and unmanageable, my scalp is really dry and L&#x27;Oreal is not \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; at all.  Have also tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Kerastase, and I think it&#x27;s just an overpriced myth.  I am switching to more natural solutions.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Rinse-out conditioner that helps keep frizzies and fly-away hair under control.&lt;br /&gt;Rub on split ends, leave in for better control</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say bad things about this product because it did work better than most conditioners and had good results for my dry-dyed-damaged hair. That being said, it&#x27;s really quite pricey given the tiny size of the bottle. Instead, I highly recommend paying 2x more and getting the 16oz jar of the Absolut Repair Masque. I use the masque like a 2 min conditioner every other day when I wash my hair, and the results are better and I use a lot less product because the masque is super thick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, in absolute terms, this is not a bad product, but compared to the masque, the value there is much better. (Only point for this is that if you&#x27;re travelling, this is a much more convenient bottle to lug around than a huge jar.)</li>
            <li> I got this to go with the shampoo. They work well together and it smells great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great!  It leaves my 4A hair soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s expensive compared to my usual conditioners, so I use it sparingly.  But when this little bottle is finished, I will repurchase.  Next time, a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This product arrived with only French on the bottle...had to look up to make sure if it was something I could leave in or use as conditioner between showers (nope by the way).  It did leave my fine hair feeling much restored from being dry, and some of the curl coming back.  I am in my sixties, and my hair started getting extra dry and awful...like the L&#x27;Oreal conditioner for coloring a LOT and this is close without the smell.</li>
            <li> Incredibly rich and beautiful hair conditioner. Works on all types of hair and hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;Also used as a deep conditioner.</li>
    </ol>
