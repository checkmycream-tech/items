            <li>There are many products out there for this issue, but none have worked for me like this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ran across them on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>These things fit fine, inside any shoes, very comfortable and eliminates all pain!!!  </li>
            <li>Customer service is amazing if you need any help from them.</li>
            <li>The bunion protector is amazing under a sock and running shoes/tennis shoes.</li>
            <li>I have used this bunion relief cushion for some time now and had amazing results.</li>
            <li>Worked AMAZING and immediately.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled that this time I purchased these.  </li>
            <li>The set is made of nice, flexible plastic and work well in separating the toes.  </li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a one size fits all kind of a thing.</li>
            <li>Probably not so effective for those who have severe bunion.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m kind of self-medicating.</li>
            <li>the space is nice for when I am walking around barefoot in my house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li>They have great customer service also, contacting me to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve found as a toe straightener.  </li>
            <li>Effective.  </li>
            <li>but I think it has to be made with some kind of cloth material instead.</li>
            <li>I still use both though its nice this comes in a four pack</li>
            <li>So comfy, so painless, and so effective.</li>
            <li>This is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>They certainly don&#x27;t cure the issue, but they sure make my feet happy!!!</li>
            <li>I love these they are so comfortable and all products work great</li>
            <li>I love them and honestly can&#x27;t imagine life with out them now</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kinda nice although I wish it had more volume than needed.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this product &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; better than any others that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Finding a suitable footwear to exercise was an exercise in futility.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and a surprising but incredible benefit, relief of back pain.</li>
            <li>I have tried quite many bunion cushions and toe spacers and these are the best so far.</li>
            <li>Both toe protectors and spacers were very comfortable and easy to wear!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product, and new feel more confident to try some of the cute boot choices out there this season.  </li>
            <li>At first these we&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li>all day, they are very comfortable and lightweight and I forget that I even have them on.</li>
            <li>The bunion regulator is very comfortable to wear in your shoe and relieves the pain and pressure the bunion causes.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and they ease the rubbing that causes bunion pain.</li>
            <li>and it was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Said they are very comfortable</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to wear with shoes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very comfortable for about 4 or 5 hours, then it starts to feel as if it is rubbing.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and my foot feels stable.</li>
            <li>Its very comfortable and fits in all my shoes.</li>
            <li>These are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>, they are very comfortable and can be worn in my shoes also.  </li>
            <li>The bunion spacers are very comfortable in all my shoes.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and cushiony.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, the bunion feels better every day.  </li>
            <li>I walk for exercise, and they are so comfortable!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My foot feels better now even if I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>but most of the time I do.</li>
            <li>have been able to do more work on my feet since using this product.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully somehow it will straighten out over time, but i guess I might have to go to the doctor to make sure of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>These work better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many things to relieve my bunions.</li>
            <li>I wore the bunion protector under my shoes and was able to wear it all day.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The toe spacer is my favorite.</li>
            <li>They are too bulky to wear with most shoes I have for work  </li>
            <li>( I am a nurse and on my feet many hours a day ).</li>
            <li>I am able to wear both the spacer and the protector inside my sneakers  </li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t work in some of my tighter fitting shoes.</li>
            <li>The toe spacer made my toe hurt even more.</li>
            <li>My feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I did love the toe separators though.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable!</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li>I love the DenadaDance® Bunion Pain Relief Kit.</li>
            <li>I may have to purchase two more sets one for my mother and a spare set for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use the bunion protector the most, I can wear my shoe&#x27;s with it</li>
            <li>and these fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I hope this love affair lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping over time it will get better and go away.</li>
            <li>I have bunion problem so happy I found these gels because it really releases the pressure in my feet.</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>so I could truly test the product more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample product to evaluate and test, and I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>Unless they were slippers, I hadn&#x27;t been able to wear shoes for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not terribly out of alignment, but the protector does shield the area quite well.  </li>
            <li>Could not feel a difference, felt like it was more in the way and going to slip around more than anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, these are very squishy, which is a great thing when you&#x27;re wearing them in your shoes.</li>
            <li>The pain and swelling got better each day.  </li>
            <li>I was able to wear either of these 24/7 immediately.</li>
            <li>I have been able to wear the bunion shield all day in my shoes and it gives me a LOT of relief.</li>
            <li>Love this product and its durability.  </li>
            <li>great product, thanks</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of these.</li>
            <li>The foot my Bunyon is on feels so much better</li>
            <li>I kept it on hoping that my foot will feel better -</li>
            <li>I will continue to watch if they come out with something else that may better meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does serve the function of making the &#x27;wedge easier to find and held in-place better.</li>
            <li>I have been able to wear the spacers for hours at a time without any discomfort, probably about 6-8 hours when Im sleeping.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I very much enjoyed the seller emailing me about the product I had bought with some more information.</li>
            <li>But you have to use them creatively, i.e. not just follow the instructions,</li>
            <li>I am happy with the shield and it is bringing me much relief.</li>
            <li>Okay I now have an update.</li>
            <li>So comfortable!</li>
            <li>As you can tell by my name, I love shoes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered these.  </li>
            <li>glad i did..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love to run</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to for a while because of the pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to run again and that alone deserves the 5 stars</li>
            <li>When I dont wear the sneakers its okay.</li>
            <li>I tried these and within an hour my foot felt much better.  </li>
            <li>Much better than suffering the pain.</li>
            <li>These are so simple but so very effective!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to wash.  </li>
            <li>You want to take good care of these items because THEY REALLY WORK!  </li>
            <li>Best investment in a long time</li>
            <li>it feels nice and cool on my starter bunion</li>
            <li>Excited to have my daughter get a lot of use out of these!  </li>
            <li>While my bunions are huge most of my pain has been on the instep and top of the foot.</li>
            <li>love your product, easy to sleep with.</li>
            <li>then I would by a more rigid detailed contraption that focused more on correction than comfort.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and most importantly, they help his bunions!</li>
            <li>I will say that I have been able to wear these very comfortable with my work shoes and the bunions that were forming on both of my feet have subsided significantly since using them.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The spacers are great for all day use and the toe protector work great in stiff shoes</li>
            <li>I have been able to wear the protectors, socks, and my shoes comfortably.</li>
            <li>I have pair of indoor workout shoes that i do not put arch supports in and they feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>They make wearing my shoes more comfortable for awhile, however, they do not work in my case for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>This product is great because it is made of a soft gel.  </li>
            <li>They may help make it more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>but so far I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it helps with my insecurities.</li>
            <li>I find the shields more comfortable however.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care; they make such an incredible difference.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and I was able to wear it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I bought these on a lark (good upsell Amazon) and didn&#x27;t have much for expectations.</li>
            <li>I think that they really do intend to produce a good product.  </li>
            <li>I can wear these products all day without discomfort (and I like that they are so easy to clean!)</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is especially great, because I had to give up walking for exercise years ago due to having bunions on both feet.</li>
            <li>Easy walking I gain.</li>
            <li>Easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>They rinse off easily when cleaning, too.  </li>
            <li>And I can rinse them off easy to get the lint off of them</li>
            <li>The spacer is easy to put on and it stays in place.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>you can easily forget you are wearing them.</li>
            <li>Provides good support and comfort - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The toe separators are helpful, but the sleeve that goes on makes a barrier between your foot and the shoe is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty comfortable until I wake up because my feet are to warm in my socks, that&#x27;s when I take them off.  </li>
            <li>The bunion spacers work fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wear and comfortable depending on which shoes i wear.</li>
            <li>fits fine without shoes, but once worn with shoes toes begin to hurt.</li>
            <li>(I had to give up running because of the effects on my bunions and making them progress more quickly).  </li>
            <li>product is very soft and feels good on the toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE this product so much!!</li>
            <li>Combination of Amazon and Denada Dance was very nice to help make the return as easy as possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing them when I work out and in my shoes at work and they&#x27;ve made a huge difference when I&#x27;m not wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know it will take some time and will update the review to 5 starts if I see a huge differenct or lower the rating if nothing happens.</li>
            <li>enjoy both the bunion protector and the toe separator.  </li>
            <li>Both ways fit my toes.</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable you can wear it with shoes, boots, sneakers.  </li>
            <li>They fit even when wearing shoes.  </li>
            <li>These fit my purpose for a workout aid</li>
            <li>Both the big toe protector and the toe separator work great.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget they are there and go to bed with them on.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheaply made.</li>
            <li>After almost a week of wearing them, I am pain free.  </li>
            <li>To alleviate any irritation around my toes, I lightly coat it with some baby powder before putting it on.  </li>
            <li>She says the toe spacer is so comfortable, she wears it all day and night.</li>
            <li>So comfortable</li>
            <li>Comfortable and works well</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for people who have a light bunion problem.</li>
            <li>I have found it to be remarkably comfortable both barefoot and also inside my sneaker.</li>
            <li>They are so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them.</li>
            <li>these keep your toes separated and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wore the bunion shield with tennis shoes, and they fit in comfortably.</li>
            <li>Both the toe spacers and the shield protector are comfortable when worn with shoes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>hahaha, my spouse  really liked that part.  </li>
            <li>These are nice and comfy, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing a whole lot.</li>
            <li>and it is comfortable while running.  </li>
            <li>I play golf and walk when I play and the device is so comfortable</li>
            <li>Its a really great product overall</li>
            <li>the big toe protector/spacer works great</li>
            <li>My constant pain has diminished greatly.</li>
            <li>COMFORTABLE BUT</li>
            <li>company has fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li>are a comfortable gel, which questions their longevity.</li>
            <li>It was so comfortable,</li>
            <li>The toe spacer is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the spacers much however, the shield has been wonderful in relieving my daily bunion pain.</li>
            <li>I love the bunion protector/shield most of all, because it cushions my bunion, protecting it from rubbing too much against my shoes.</li>
            <li>This is the third product I have tried for bunion relief and absolutely the best one.  </li>
            <li>Still they do a good job in separating the toes and protecting the sensitive bunion skin.</li>
            <li>The skin on my second toe was really getting irritated, so I was looking online for the best product to separate the two toes...</li>
            <li>good, soft quality, very kind to my skin, and just feel great inside my shoe on my poor bunion.  </li>
            <li>The spacers are amazingly flexible, gel-like and very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I am so excited.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to get to try this</li>
            <li>After wearing for about a week the pain and throbbing from my bunion was significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find any exercise footwear that was bunion friendly.  </li>
            <li>I was able to wear it all day the first time.</li>
            <li>They are so much more comfortable and gentle with my toes.  </li>
            <li>The ones that go over the bunion might be visible if your shoes don&#x27;t cover the whole area, but otherwise your safe and they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is now much more comfortable to wear my sneakers and whole shoes.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft and flexible!</li>
            <li>Use the Bunion Protector right after dancing in high-heeled shoes and experience the desired pain relief in your bunions!</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and I could really tell they were working after wearing them for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>but it is overall a good quality product.</li>
            <li>They seem to be made of a soft rubbery silicone type material They are flexible and stretchy and provide a nice bit of cushioning between the toes.</li>
            <li>It was too much, even in the shoes I bought with more space in the toe box.</li>
            <li>Useful and comfortable</li>
            <li>I do wish they came in a more flesh tone though since I wear sandals so much of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also received a full refund.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...and believe me</li>
            <li>it fitted easily in my sneahers, was not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in any type of shoe I have worn, and has alleviated bunion pain especially when I am on my feet for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I have upgraded the rating to 3 stars due to the great customer service.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the bunion shield includes a toe spacer, which really does a great job in straightening my big toe while I’m wearing my shoes.</li>
            <li>This has helped me tremendously</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found these on Amazon, figured I would give them a try (I needed to do something) and ordered them.</li>
            <li>I just wash them out quickly with antiseptic soap every evening.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a super squishy silicone feeling</li>
            <li>Oh--and did I mention that the material is so very soft...and easy to clean?  </li>
            <li>All of the positive feedback I read on here made my decision to purchase this item over the others easy.  </li>
            <li>This is the right concept but is very stick &amp; not THICK ENOUGH to supply great comfort while wearing shoes!</li>
            <li>So comfortable and really has helped eliminate the pain!  </li>
            <li>I got some kind of arthritis causing virus this summer resulting in bunion like pain among many other joints in pain.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t help that the pictures show these on a normal healthy foot with NO &amp;#34;bunions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>These are pretty comfortable, with and without shoes.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with the product and can definitely recommended it.</li>
            <li>The bunion shields and the toe spacers are very comfortable to wear as they are very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wear inside shoes and is very helpful toward pain relief.</li>
            <li>for myself, I put first two toes together so that make the thumb correct to more straight</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and helps more than I thought it could.</li>
            <li>Just started using but very comfortable thus far.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and really helps the callus problem (and helps with absorbing pressure).</li>
            <li>They are very well designed and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Fit well, but don&#x27;t provide much support because they&#x27;re so squishy.</li>
            <li>I think these are well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>So far, I love the comfort</li>
            <li>and im glad they are soft</li>
            <li>The shield protector made shoes more comfortable, even though I only wear shoes 2-3 hours per day.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I wear it all day with socks.</li>
            <li>So far I have yet to feel the pain I experienced prior to using</li>
            <li>These are so incredibly soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li>doctor did not instruct me to use any kind of products for the pain in my big toe</li>
            <li>Seller was kind enough to provide additional information.</li>
            <li>My bunion pain rarely wakes me up at night anymore.</li>
            <li>rarely write reviews.</li>
            <li>but this product was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of useful items which you cannot find in the local drug store.</li>
            <li>read all of the reviews, and this was the product that received the most positive reviews, including the Footsmart site, which didn&#x27;t have any product with high reviews for bunion pain relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The protector is very useful in absorbing pressure and eliminating the pain from shoes rubbing against the bunion.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how the bunion protector was relief right away.  </li>
            <li>Wearing right now.</li>
            <li>Right away, I started wearing them all day.</li>
            <li>I got pain relief using the toe spacers right away.</li>
            <li>Although I would highly recommend this item for usage without shoes, I have yet to find a pair of my shoes that I can comfortably wear the spacers or protectors with.  </li>
            <li>I overnighted the item and was completely convinced that this would help remedy what is becoming a bunion issue.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bulky to wear with regular width shoe, but perfect with a wider shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These little gems have given me a great deal of relief, so much so that I&#x27;ve started walking longer, farther and faster.</li>
            <li>Idk how it holds up during a work day, inside a shoe liner and flats, I will update my review, but so far it&#x27;s kinda cool!</li>
            <li>At first, I was upset that DenadaDance company contacted me to give instructions on how to care for the products, however, now that I&#x27;ve received/used the product, the company is right.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on, and soft and stretchy.  </li>
            <li>but this product gave me great relief as it keeps my big toe separate from the next toe...</li>
            <li>They stretch and have enough give that they fit comfortable on the toes.</li>
            <li>I think that this idea is great - but requires several different size configurations.  </li>
            <li>It works fast and quickly alleviates pain.</li>
            <li>Both the big toe protector and the toe spacer fit comfortably when wore with shoes.</li>
            <li>The bunion shield initially created soreness between the great toe and the 2nd.</li>
            <li>The material is very comfortable and realigns my big toe and eases the pain from my bunion.</li>
            <li>My husband is using this on his toe and it is very very helpful.  </li>
            <li>After just 2 days I like it very much already.</li>
            <li>I felt some discomfort the first day I used it, but it was very comfortable on the second day on, and I can used it all day without any problem.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s working, too soon to tell, but very comfortable and truly don&#x27;t understand why anyone would ever not be able to figure out how to put it on.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>and I love that when I take my shoes off it actually looks like my bunion is being reduced; of course, then it changes and looks like it always does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really soft and comfortable to wear with shoes</li>
            <li>The gel material is so soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Relieved my paid after the first use.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;bunion relief set&#x27; does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>They actually look more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; in socks, too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>But I do believe that returning the toe to its natural alignment is important</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was imagining inventing myself before I began researching for a product</li>
            <li>overwhelmed by so many different gizmos and gadgets.  </li>
            <li>I like these &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; toe spacers as far as being a comfortable way to help with bunion problems</li>
            <li>Those things are soft, comfortable, wearable in shoes, and they relieved my feet pain immediately.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Hurt at first.</li>
            <li>it was too short and did not extend sufficiently over the top of my foot to fully cover the bunion area.  </li>
            <li>Who knows, maybe these will actually help most people.  </li>
            <li>This has been my first one.  </li>
            <li>These things really work for me!  </li>
            <li>My mom said her pain got reduced the first time she wore</li>
            <li>Had surgery on first toe</li>
            <li>The spacers and the protectors are soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>I did receive some pain relief from using the bunion protectors from the first day.  </li>
            <li>I have already noticed that my big toe has become more aligned.</li>
            <li>Obviously they work better with a sneaker or boot.</li>
            <li>Pain relief was noticed almost immediately from the first week.</li>
            <li>I was just searching for inexpensive ways to help my bunions, and I&#x27;m really glad I chose it because it definitely helps!</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s different for everyone though.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with bunion relief and strengthening muscles in toes!</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and they even fit well in my shoes with relaxing the laces a little.</li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like much when it arrives but these little gems are very comfortable, easy to use and seem to perform as promised.</li>
            <li>Gave it 4 stars because it is too large to wear with shoes, so it actually causes more pressure with shoes.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;d much rather not having to wear any device on my foot, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d still be in a lot of pain without wearing your &amp;#34;bunion protector&amp;#34;, and plan on using it well into the future, if not forever.  </li>
            <li>The spacer that goes on the second toe and between the big toe is also cushioned and feels good - relieves some pain.</li>
            <li>Both items fit well, are soft, and really relieve pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put them on right away, and have been comfortable wearing them night and day for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li>Love the product - depending on the shoes I have on, I can wear it all day long.  </li>
            <li>I am able to wear it all day long.  </li>
            <li>The protector broke the first time I wore it for a whole day.</li>
            <li>My bunion pain went away after about 2 weeks of consistent use, and can wear them all day without much discomfort.</li>
            <li>This is something that I really just started to notice after adding more intense workouts to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>These little rubber doodads are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Provides better alignment of toes and as a result some pain relief, especially with high heeled shoes.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this, but this product truly is amazing!!</li>
            <li>My feet feel better than they have in a long time!</li>
            <li>some shoes a bit more tight, but not impossible to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been wearing them all day long and then at night I wear a more intense brace that maximally separates my toes while I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is my experience that the Toe Protector can be worn easily in an athletic shoe or boot or simply with socks around the house.</li>
            <li>The bunion protectors gave me pain relief while wearing certain shoes.  </li>
            <li>Also, the protectors are fairly large and peak out the sides of the flats I&#x27;ve tried to wear them with.</li>
            <li>Have been wearing the large piece with shoes on occasion.  </li>
            <li>I have large bunions on my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine wearing during the day with that large spacer.</li>
            <li>And since I only have a bunion on my right foot, I realized I could reverse these and use them all on my right foot!</li>
            <li>These are made of such soft silicon, they don&#x27;t provide any support, and at best, provide a small amount of &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; from friction against your skin.</li>
            <li>The only problem is if wearing them all the time, even taking them off to clean, they can or may cause your skin between your toes where it touches to become irritated and tender, kind of like athletes feet, due to the moisture.</li>
            <li>The things actually feel very soft, and you wouldn&#x27;t think they could cute off the circulation like that</li>
            <li>I am willing to go back to my original rating of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>That portion was too large and really pushed my toe apart.</li>
            <li>Seems to help, but it doesn&#x27;t provide much padding on the sore spot.</li>
            <li>I am just uncertain to how much of the healing has to do with the product.</li>
            <li>They seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>They give me so much relief because my bunion screams.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The toe spacer is very helpful; I wear it all the time when I am at home and it provides relief.  </li>
            <li>It is has helped to ameliorate much of the pain and discomfort</li>
            <li>This really does help to keep the friction off of the bunion.</li>
            <li>I also believe that over time it could really help prevent the condition from worsening.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was wider</li>
            <li>kit is something that really does work.  </li>
            <li>they have really helped my feet.</li>
            <li>The toe spacer worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for spacing toes and easing bunion discomfort.better than others I have used.good guality.</li>
            <li>and I think that the bunion reliever with the side bunion protection ended up getting pulled too much in the wash.</li>
            <li>Also, have held up very well.  </li>
            <li>But really these are overpriced, they are just toe spacers.</li>
            <li>He really likes them.</li>
            <li>The silicone is nice and smooth, and they seem durable, although I&#x27;ve only had them a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>(Thanks, Mom!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find that they aren&#x27;t very durable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Got these for my mom, who says they work very well and have reduced her pain.</li>
            <li>However, I am very athletic, and would get calluses on the bunion foot from my athletic shoes.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need the one with the bunion sleeve.  </li>
            <li>Really did not help much</li>
            <li>Really helped my bunion pain.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple days of use, she had one simple word to describe them, fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t miracle workers, but they&#x27;ve really helped me.  </li>
            <li>The toe spacer is actually quite comfortable</li>
            <li>I expected a device that used the ball of the foot with a more forceful pull on the lg toe, That&#x27;s not how this works</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bunion doesn&#x27;t hurt that much</li>
            <li>your products again and thanks for the email.</li>
            <li>Really has helped with the discomfort.</li>
            <li>Bunion shield is helpful in absorbing the pressure in my shoes.</li>
            <li>They worked very well until one of them broke after around one month of use...</li>
            <li>No product will work miracles, but this set has helped relieve much of the pain caused by my bunions and hammertoes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing a chiropractor who couldn&#x27;t really determine the source of the pain.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Anyway I advise trying this for your bunion, I am a nurse and very athletic and don&#x27;t want surgery, this may prevent it.</li>
            <li>I am finding this product very helpful.  </li>
            <li>These gel toe protectors really do work.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful to align toes and relieve bunion pain.</li>
            <li>I dont worry too much about it</li>
            <li>I am sold, this thing really works.</li>
            <li>Still wearing it daily, comfortable inside your shoe, you forget you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li>Kind of a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing these off and on for the past two months or so, and must say I&#x27;ve been quite surprised with how effective they are!</li>
            <li>Although I technically cant see anything there, I believe its the first phase of developing and the pain, though mild, was worying me.</li>
            <li>Both the Toe Spacer and the Bunion Protestor are easy to wear in walking shoes during a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many toe separators and other bunion relief options,  but nothing worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Soft, soft material that&#x27;s eay to clean.  </li>
            <li>I just rinse them off every night and use them again the next day -- great little product!</li>
            <li>The big toe separator may cause some discomfort when worn in a shoe for long periods of time, but ultimately this seems to be a great help.</li>
            <li>Love the product and passing the word around to other people with Bunion pain.</li>
            <li>They can thus provide a gentle stretch in your daily life without special time-consuming exercisers.</li>
            <li>as my toe pain is most prevalent when I&#x27;m in my bare feet, the toe spacer definitely lessens the pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m consistently amazed by how useful this simple tool has been for my comfort.</li>
            <li>The material is very soft and the toe separators fit perfectly to my second toe.</li>
            <li>After I placed my order, I received a detailed email letting me know how to use the items and how to care for them to assure long use.  </li>
            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t worn them too long, I can&#x27;t really comment how effective they would be in the long term.</li>
            <li>Soft and pliable, not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>As for the cushion that has the side piece that goes down over the bunion...their photo shows it fitting flush with the side of the foot.</li>
            <li>The toe spacers I use when I&#x27;m wear my flip flops, which is a lot, since I live in Florida!  </li>
            <li>My bunions are moderate and starting to come in more.</li>
            <li>These may seem like a simple fix, but they have done wonders to help me stop a quickly developing bunion issue.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fix the problem, but it relieves pain while walking and running which was my main concern.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, it adds space between my big toe and my next toe.</li>
            <li>I believe the main reason they work</li>
            <li>I use the larger version that goes over the big toe most often.</li>
            <li>They relieve the pain under my second toe by keeping it from laying on top of my big toe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and have already told friends about it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you want immediate relief.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but she cut a little off the&lt;br /&gt;bottom to customize for wearing with her shoes to make them even better -&lt;br /&gt;said</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are worth the money, they are high quality and work especially when if you wear socks or house slippers, or any shoe (that covers the plastic.</li>
            <li>Not only does the spacer feel good between the big toe and the second toe, but the pad covers and protects the bunion from pain of pressure and rubbing (although I wish the pad was just a touch bigger to cover a large bunion).  </li>
            <li>So far working very well</li>
            <li>really like this soft and supple spacer.  </li>
            <li>I must say, so far I am really liking your product.</li>
            <li>My feet are 61 years old and have suffered much abuse over the decades - ballet, pregnancy, etc.</li>
            <li>Only needed to use one of them so far but glad I have the left foot one as well.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone</li>
            <li>so think it is fairly normal in size.  </li>
            <li>I was wearing some cute boots, and they were already beginning to aggravate my bunion a bit after a few hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>Gel separators are nice &amp; thick and hold their shape.</li>
            <li>I am only using the bunion spacers and shields on my right foot.</li>
            <li>One was as comfortable as the other.</li>
            <li>These little tools are effective and sturdy providing help with proper alignment, reducing pain and increasing comfort.</li>
            <li>I live in NYC and depend on my feet as transportation.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of getting used to, but very comfortable and now wear everyday with socks and shoes and tend to forget they&#x27;re there!  </li>
            <li>The toe separators works better than bunion shield because my dance shoes are very tight.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and are helping from big toe going further &#x27;south&#x27;,</li>
            <li>I wear them as much as I can, around the house, when I go out...as much as possible, and they pain is absolutely relieved.</li>
            <li>Very soft and skin like feeling.</li>
            <li>Very soft and I could feel a difference when wearing the spacers.</li>
            <li>These protectors are very soft and hold the fingers well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to wear with shoes, and even comfortable enough to leave on when I am in my running shoes most days.  </li>
            <li>The other product I&#x27;ve found that significantly helps is Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li>First week, I could only wear them a couple of hours a day.  </li>
            <li>Instant relief and results within the first two days of use.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I just passed the 15 weeks post op mark on my left foot so my right foot is really to help me delay another surgery until my left foot is fully healed.</li>
            <li>They feel a little strange when you first use them, but they&#x27;re really soft and comfortable, and if your feet are as crummy as mine are, they really do help keep toes from mashing into one another.  </li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s able to stretch a little more than before, doesn&#x27;t curve inward so much towards the second toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My right foot is a tiny bit smaller than my left-my left big toe is fine and not turning in.</li>
            <li>Extremely helpful, specially when I workout.</li>
            <li>I guess it will just cost more money down the road when she is enough pain that she will see a DR.</li>
            <li>These spacers and protectors are very easy to wear in shoes and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would wear a spacer on my second toe at night with a sock to keep it from moving and could go most of the night before it became painful from the toe not wanting to be aligned.</li>
            <li>They are actually pretty comfortable to wear in shoes, as I have already worn them in a few different pairs, including flats.</li>
            <li>I only have a mild to moderate bunion on one foot, and do not have pain.</li>
            <li>Clearly this should be available in different sizes, or the toe divider should just be smaller in general.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my toes feel better yet, but the toe has straightened back out a little.</li>
            <li>The bunion protectors provided significant relief during running as I&#x27;m training for a half marathon.</li>
            <li>My foot is in such bad shape that eventually it will need surgery; however, in the meantime your product works wonderful.</li>
            <li>The material is too soft to be functional.</li>
            <li>The pain was starting to become intense regardless what type of shoe I wore or what activity I did.  </li>
            <li>The soft material allows you to wear them for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>very comfortablet to wear - finally toes are where they are supposed to be in my shoes.</li>
            <li>When my order didn&#x27;t come in complete, they promptly replace the order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s early days yet</li>
            <li>My feet were killing me today, and after only a trip to the store I decided to try these, I&#x27;ve had them for a while but didn&#x27;t hold much hope.</li>
            <li>Its so soft and squishy</li>
            <li>Touch softly and no smell.</li>
            <li>Save your money and go buy soft bed Birkenstocks.</li>
            <li>Really helps to keep my big toe in line.</li>
            <li>The toe spacer completely prevents this from happening.</li>
            <li>have been a life saver thus far.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t say it has helped too much-</li>
            <li>I have a bunion on each foot, but the left one is much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fixed my overlapping toes.</li>
            <li>Relief far beyond expectations.</li>
            <li>Granted, they&#x27;re not going to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my big honking bunions, but they have given me so much pain relief</li>
            <li>I wear them in every conceivable type of enclosed shoe, sometimes they show, but</li>
            <li>I got these for my old woman.</li>
            <li>This really helps my bunion, I gave one to someone else that had a bunion, leaving me with only one toe separator</li>
            <li>so well is the soft rubber material.  </li>
            <li>the one with the cover is soft too, but it peaks out of my flats.</li>
            <li>So far they are working.</li>
            <li>but so far they have lasted so well that I&#x27;ve not needed to replace them.</li>
            <li>And at night, as soft as they are, they were &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; and came off.</li>
            <li>These are soooo soft and squishy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I actually have bunions or not, but I definitely experience frequent pain and tenderness on the top of my foot at the ball connecting my big toe, and wearing these in the evenings or to sleep in reduces the pain tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Finding the right product and managing the condition as early as possible is key.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s only been two weeks since I started wearing it, I&#x27;m planning to play tennis this weekend while wearing the &amp;#34;bunion protector&amp;#34; (of course!), which I haven&#x27;t been able to do in the last month due to pain.</li>
            <li>have a bunion on one foot, and recently wore a new pair of shoes for too long and a blister formed right on the bunion.</li>
            <li>Small separators seem to get easily misplaced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, perhaps my feet are too small (I wear a women&#x27;s size 6 shoe), but it slipped on/off too easily and didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.  </li>
            <li>Also, I power walked for an hour and a half then put in a full day of work as a hairstylist.</li>
            <li>So I bought these little relief thingies;) thats what I call them, after reading that its best to start relieving toe pain as soon as possible to avoid crazy deformities and major pain.</li>
            <li>The soft, cushy protector provided immediate relief of the sharp stabbing pain that I normally feel when I put on my shoes.  </li>
            <li>The main purpose I got these for was so I could do my Barr Amp bootcamp workout (which has a lot of toe raised squat positioning) and not have my big toes start to ache...</li>
            <li>but I do have a toe that is starting to grow inward, so I&#x27;m mainly using them to try to treat that.</li>
            <li>I was left limping more than my usual amount.</li>
            <li>she was only able to use the small toe piece.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing the toe spacer daily for a couple of weeks, and the protector a bit less, but the pain in my left foot, which prior to this was hurting most of the day (and especially at night, an intense burning), is almost completely gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bunions are fairly new to me, so it is difficult for me to give an honest account of the results.</li>
            <li>and I can wear them while sleeping which is a major plus!</li>
            <li>, the hole in the other spacer is on the smaller side not as comfortable as the bigger one.</li>
            <li>Gel is comfortable, but firm enough so it doesn&#x27;t pick up dirt if you go barefoot.</li>
            <li>For several years I wore a plastic/velcro splint at night that offered relief, but lately the top of the splints irritated my feet.  </li>
            <li>it does space my big toe to be straight, but idk that it would correct anything over time (will report back).</li>
            <li>I purchased these to keep my big toe and second toe separated, not so much to relieve bunion pain.</li>
            <li>I was spectacle at first thinking that all the other post were &amp;#34;inflated&amp;#34;, but boy was I mistaken.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it&#x27;s my feet!</li>
            <li>Personally, I would use them more for toe separation, however I knew a friend who has serious bunion issues and gave them to her to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Big toe protector works good, but a little hard to conceal with a pair of flats.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of constant use, I am very much aware that my right foot big toe, which previously crossed over the 2nd toe without a separator, tends to keep its distance!  </li>
            <li>I am extremely thankful that I purchased your product, based on the extremely positive reviews for your product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>These things hurt when you wear them with any other foot wear other than light slippers.</li>
            <li>These protectors are incredibly soft, just stretch over your big toe in order to protect a bunion, or</li>
            <li>Because they are silicone, they stay in place while I dance and are soft enough to allow my toes to move where they need to move.</li>
            <li>protectors are incredibly soft, just stretch over your big toe in order to protect a bunion, or</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only worn them with Teva&#x27;s so far</li>
            <li>It seems you currently need to contact this company through Amazon to get action for customer service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days I did notice that I was wearing them, but after the 3rd day I could barely notice I had them on with my closed toe shoes.  </li>
            <li>The material is soft, yet thick enough, and comfortable.    </li>
            <li>I encourage anyone who suffers from bunion pain to give this product a good look.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have bunions, using for helping move big toe possibly straight and to open space between big and second toe.  </li>
            <li>I only use the spacers and you have to hook it on your toe next to big toe as the hold isnt large enough to go on your big toe.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell after several months of daily usage, this product will not correct your bunions... but will help prevent further progression.  </li>
            <li>However, one barely notices/feels them on the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>but first few times they were distracting.</li>
            <li>But, I thought I would not get to wearing them all day without discomfort the first few days...</li>
            <li>least you have feet, mom!&amp;#34;  So true...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a long term thing, wear them a little at the beginning and increase wear-time gradually until you notice a distinct improvement when not wearing them.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them over any other protector I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve worn it for about an hour and a half each time while working out (fast walking).</li>
            <li>As soon as I put this over my bunion so the divider was between my big toe and the next one, and after I put my shoe on, I could barely walk because of the pain.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have found it very helpful to tape down the rising second toe in a crisscross fashion under the foot.</li>
            <li>Using the Big Toe Protector during the day in combination with Foot Smart&#x27;s Bunion Regulator at night helps to decrease discomfort of, and straighten, a big and second toe wanting to cross under and over each other, respectively.</li>
            <li>they pushed her second toe a little too much -</li>

            <li> There are many products out there for this issue, but none have worked for me like this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ran across them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love these!  </li>
            <li> These things fit fine, inside any shoes, very comfortable and eliminates all pain!!!  </li>
            <li> Customer service is amazing if you need any help from them.</li>
            <li> The bunion protector is amazing under a sock and running shoes/tennis shoes.</li>
            <li> I have used this bunion relief cushion for some time now and had amazing results.</li>
            <li> Worked AMAZING and immediately.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that this time I purchased these.  </li>
            <li> The set is made of nice, flexible plastic and work well in separating the toes.  </li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a one size fits all kind of a thing.</li>
            <li> Probably not so effective for those who have severe bunion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m kind of self-medicating.</li>
            <li> the space is nice for when I am walking around barefoot in my house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> They have great customer service also, contacting me to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve found as a toe straightener.  </li>
            <li> Effective.  </li>
            <li> but I think it has to be made with some kind of cloth material instead.</li>
            <li> I still use both though its nice this comes in a four pack</li>
            <li> So comfy, so painless, and so effective.</li>
            <li> This is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> They certainly don&#x27;t cure the issue, but they sure make my feet happy!!!</li>
            <li> I love these they are so comfortable and all products work great</li>
            <li> I love them and honestly can&#x27;t imagine life with out them now</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kinda nice although I wish it had more volume than needed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this product &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; better than any others that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Finding a suitable footwear to exercise was an exercise in futility.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and a surprising but incredible benefit, relief of back pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite many bunion cushions and toe spacers and these are the best so far.</li>
            <li> Both toe protectors and spacers were very comfortable and easy to wear!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product, and new feel more confident to try some of the cute boot choices out there this season.  </li>
            <li> At first these we&#x27;re great.  </li>
            <li> all day, they are very comfortable and lightweight and I forget that I even have them on.</li>
            <li> The bunion regulator is very comfortable to wear in your shoe and relieves the pain and pressure the bunion causes.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and they ease the rubbing that causes bunion pain.</li>
            <li> and it was very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Said they are very comfortable</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear with shoes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very comfortable for about 4 or 5 hours, then it starts to feel as if it is rubbing.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and my foot feels stable.</li>
            <li> Its very comfortable and fits in all my shoes.</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> , they are very comfortable and can be worn in my shoes also.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My foot feels better now even if I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> but most of the time I do.</li>
            <li> have been able to do more work on my feet since using this product.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully somehow it will straighten out over time, but i guess I might have to go to the doctor to make sure of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These work better than anything I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many things to relieve my bunions.</li>
            <li> I wore the bunion protector under my shoes and was able to wear it all day.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The toe spacer is my favorite.</li>
            <li> They are too bulky to wear with most shoes I have for work  </li>
            <li> ( I am a nurse and on my feet many hours a day ).</li>
            <li> I am able to wear both the spacer and the protector inside my sneakers  </li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t work in some of my tighter fitting shoes.</li>
            <li> The toe spacer made my toe hurt even more.</li>
            <li> My feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I did love the toe separators though.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I love the DenadaDance® Bunion Pain Relief Kit.</li>
            <li> I may have to purchase two more sets one for my mother and a spare set for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use the bunion protector the most, I can wear my shoe&#x27;s with it</li>
            <li> and these fit nicely.</li>
            <li> I hope this love affair lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping over time it will get better and go away.</li>
            <li> I have bunion problem so happy I found these gels because it really releases the pressure in my feet.</li>
            <li> Love em.</li>
            <li> so I could truly test the product more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample product to evaluate and test, and I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> Unless they were slippers, I hadn&#x27;t been able to wear shoes for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not terribly out of alignment, but the protector does shield the area quite well.  </li>
            <li> Could not feel a difference, felt like it was more in the way and going to slip around more than anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, these are very squishy, which is a great thing when you&#x27;re wearing them in your shoes.</li>
            <li> The pain and swelling got better each day.  </li>
            <li> I was able to wear either of these 24/7 immediately.</li>
            <li> I have been able to wear the bunion shield all day in my shoes and it gives me a LOT of relief.</li>
            <li> Love this product and its durability.  </li>
            <li> great product, thanks</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of these.</li>
            <li> The foot my Bunyon is on feels so much better</li>
            <li> I kept it on hoping that my foot will feel better -</li>
            <li> I will continue to watch if they come out with something else that may better meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does serve the function of making the &#x27;wedge easier to find and held in-place better.</li>
            <li> I have been able to wear the spacers for hours at a time without any discomfort, probably about 6-8 hours when Im sleeping.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I very much enjoyed the seller emailing me about the product I had bought with some more information.</li>
            <li> But you have to use them creatively, i.e. not just follow the instructions,</li>
            <li> I am happy with the shield and it is bringing me much relief.</li>
            <li> Okay I now have an update.</li>
            <li> So comfortable!</li>
            <li> As you can tell by my name, I love shoes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered these.  </li>
            <li> glad i did..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love to run</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to for a while because of the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to run again and that alone deserves the 5 stars</li>
            <li> When I dont wear the sneakers its okay.</li>
            <li> I tried these and within an hour my foot felt much better.  </li>
            <li> Much better than suffering the pain.</li>
            <li> These are so simple but so very effective!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to wash.  </li>
            <li> You want to take good care of these items because THEY REALLY WORK!  </li>
            <li> Best investment in a long time</li>
            <li> it feels nice and cool on my starter bunion</li>
            <li> Excited to have my daughter get a lot of use out of these!  </li>
            <li> While my bunions are huge most of my pain has been on the instep and top of the foot.</li>
            <li> love your product, easy to sleep with.</li>
            <li> then I would by a more rigid detailed contraption that focused more on correction than comfort.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and most importantly, they help his bunions!</li>
            <li> I will say that I have been able to wear these very comfortable with my work shoes and the bunions that were forming on both of my feet have subsided significantly since using them.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The spacers are great for all day use and the toe protector work great in stiff shoes</li>
            <li> I have been able to wear the protectors, socks, and my shoes comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have pair of indoor workout shoes that i do not put arch supports in and they feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li> They make wearing my shoes more comfortable for awhile, however, they do not work in my case for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> This product is great because it is made of a soft gel.  </li>
            <li> They may help make it more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> but so far I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it helps with my insecurities.</li>
            <li> I find the shields more comfortable however.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care; they make such an incredible difference.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and I was able to wear it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a lark (good upsell Amazon) and didn&#x27;t have much for expectations.</li>
            <li> I think that they really do intend to produce a good product.  </li>
            <li> I can wear these products all day without discomfort (and I like that they are so easy to clean!)</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is especially great, because I had to give up walking for exercise years ago due to having bunions on both feet.</li>
            <li> Easy walking I gain.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> They rinse off easily when cleaning, too.  </li>
            <li> And I can rinse them off easy to get the lint off of them</li>
            <li> The spacer is easy to put on and it stays in place.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> you can easily forget you are wearing them.</li>
            <li> Provides good support and comfort - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The toe separators are helpful, but the sleeve that goes on makes a barrier between your foot and the shoe is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty comfortable until I wake up because my feet are to warm in my socks, that&#x27;s when I take them off.  </li>
            <li> The bunion spacers work fine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wear and comfortable depending on which shoes i wear.</li>
            <li> fits fine without shoes, but once worn with shoes toes begin to hurt.</li>
            <li> (I had to give up running because of the effects on my bunions and making them progress more quickly).  </li>
            <li> product is very soft and feels good on the toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE this product so much!!</li>
            <li> Combination of Amazon and Denada Dance was very nice to help make the return as easy as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing them when I work out and in my shoes at work and they&#x27;ve made a huge difference when I&#x27;m not wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it will take some time and will update the review to 5 starts if I see a huge differenct or lower the rating if nothing happens.</li>
            <li> enjoy both the bunion protector and the toe separator.  </li>
            <li> Both ways fit my toes.</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable you can wear it with shoes, boots, sneakers.  </li>
            <li> They fit even when wearing shoes.  </li>
            <li> These fit my purpose for a workout aid</li>
            <li> Both the big toe protector and the toe separator work great.  </li>
            <li> They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget they are there and go to bed with them on.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheaply made.</li>
            <li> After almost a week of wearing them, I am pain free.  </li>
            <li> To alleviate any irritation around my toes, I lightly coat it with some baby powder before putting it on.  </li>
            <li> She says the toe spacer is so comfortable, she wears it all day and night.</li>
            <li> So comfortable</li>
            <li> Comfortable and works well</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for people who have a light bunion problem.</li>
            <li> I have found it to be remarkably comfortable both barefoot and also inside my sneaker.</li>
            <li> They are so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them.</li>
            <li> these keep your toes separated and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wore the bunion shield with tennis shoes, and they fit in comfortably.</li>
            <li> Both the toe spacers and the shield protector are comfortable when worn with shoes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> hahaha, my spouse  really liked that part.  </li>
            <li> These are nice and comfy, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing a whole lot.</li>
            <li> and it is comfortable while running.  </li>
            <li> I play golf and walk when I play and the device is so comfortable</li>
            <li> Its a really great product overall</li>
            <li> the big toe protector/spacer works great</li>
            <li> My constant pain has diminished greatly.</li>
            <li> COMFORTABLE BUT</li>
            <li> company has fantastic customer service.</li>
            <li> are a comfortable gel, which questions their longevity.</li>
            <li> It was so comfortable,</li>
            <li> The toe spacer is comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the spacers much however, the shield has been wonderful in relieving my daily bunion pain.</li>
            <li> I love the bunion protector/shield most of all, because it cushions my bunion, protecting it from rubbing too much against my shoes.</li>
            <li> This is the third product I have tried for bunion relief and absolutely the best one.  </li>
            <li> Still they do a good job in separating the toes and protecting the sensitive bunion skin.</li>
            <li> The skin on my second toe was really getting irritated, so I was looking online for the best product to separate the two toes...</li>
            <li> good, soft quality, very kind to my skin, and just feel great inside my shoe on my poor bunion.  </li>
            <li> The spacers are amazingly flexible, gel-like and very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I am so excited.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to get to try this</li>
            <li> After wearing for about a week the pain and throbbing from my bunion was significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any exercise footwear that was bunion friendly.  </li>
            <li> I was able to wear it all day the first time.</li>
            <li> They are so much more comfortable and gentle with my toes.  </li>
            <li> The ones that go over the bunion might be visible if your shoes don&#x27;t cover the whole area, but otherwise your safe and they&#x27;re comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is now much more comfortable to wear my sneakers and whole shoes.  </li>
            <li> Nice soft and flexible!</li>
            <li> Use the Bunion Protector right after dancing in high-heeled shoes and experience the desired pain relief in your bunions!</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and I could really tell they were working after wearing them for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> but it is overall a good quality product.</li>
            <li> They seem to be made of a soft rubbery silicone type material They are flexible and stretchy and provide a nice bit of cushioning between the toes.</li>
            <li> It was too much, even in the shoes I bought with more space in the toe box.</li>
            <li> Useful and comfortable</li>
            <li> I do wish they came in a more flesh tone though since I wear sandals so much of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also received a full refund.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...and believe me</li>
            <li> it fitted easily in my sneahers, was not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable in any type of shoe I have worn, and has alleviated bunion pain especially when I am on my feet for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I have upgraded the rating to 3 stars due to the great customer service.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the bunion shield includes a toe spacer, which really does a great job in straightening my big toe while I’m wearing my shoes.</li>
            <li> This has helped me tremendously</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found these on Amazon, figured I would give them a try (I needed to do something) and ordered them.</li>
            <li> I just wash them out quickly with antiseptic soap every evening.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a super squishy silicone feeling</li>
            <li> Oh--and did I mention that the material is so very soft...and easy to clean?  </li>
            <li> All of the positive feedback I read on here made my decision to purchase this item over the others easy.  </li>
            <li> This is the right concept but is very stick &amp; not THICK ENOUGH to supply great comfort while wearing shoes!</li>
            <li> So comfortable and really has helped eliminate the pain!  </li>
            <li> I got some kind of arthritis causing virus this summer resulting in bunion like pain among many other joints in pain.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t help that the pictures show these on a normal healthy foot with NO &amp;#34;bunions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are pretty comfortable, with and without shoes.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with the product and can definitely recommended it.</li>
            <li> The bunion shields and the toe spacers are very comfortable to wear as they are very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wear inside shoes and is very helpful toward pain relief.</li>
            <li> for myself, I put first two toes together so that make the thumb correct to more straight</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and helps more than I thought it could.</li>
            <li> Just started using but very comfortable thus far.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and really helps the callus problem (and helps with absorbing pressure).</li>
            <li> They are very well designed and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Fit well, but don&#x27;t provide much support because they&#x27;re so squishy.</li>
            <li> I think these are well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> So far, I love the comfort</li>
            <li> and im glad they are soft</li>
            <li> The shield protector made shoes more comfortable, even though I only wear shoes 2-3 hours per day.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I wear it all day with socks.</li>
            <li> So far I have yet to feel the pain I experienced prior to using</li>
            <li> These are so incredibly soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li> doctor did not instruct me to use any kind of products for the pain in my big toe</li>
            <li> Seller was kind enough to provide additional information.</li>
            <li> My bunion pain rarely wakes me up at night anymore.</li>
            <li> rarely write reviews.</li>
            <li> but this product was worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of useful items which you cannot find in the local drug store.</li>
            <li> read all of the reviews, and this was the product that received the most positive reviews, including the Footsmart site, which didn&#x27;t have any product with high reviews for bunion pain relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The protector is very useful in absorbing pressure and eliminating the pain from shoes rubbing against the bunion.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how the bunion protector was relief right away.  </li>
            <li> Wearing right now.</li>
            <li> Right away, I started wearing them all day.</li>
            <li> I got pain relief using the toe spacers right away.</li>
            <li> Although I would highly recommend this item for usage without shoes, I have yet to find a pair of my shoes that I can comfortably wear the spacers or protectors with.  </li>
            <li> I overnighted the item and was completely convinced that this would help remedy what is becoming a bunion issue.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bulky to wear with regular width shoe, but perfect with a wider shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These little gems have given me a great deal of relief, so much so that I&#x27;ve started walking longer, farther and faster.</li>
            <li> Idk how it holds up during a work day, inside a shoe liner and flats, I will update my review, but so far it&#x27;s kinda cool!</li>
            <li> At first, I was upset that DenadaDance company contacted me to give instructions on how to care for the products, however, now that I&#x27;ve received/used the product, the company is right.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on, and soft and stretchy.  </li>
            <li> but this product gave me great relief as it keeps my big toe separate from the next toe...</li>
            <li> They stretch and have enough give that they fit comfortable on the toes.</li>
            <li> I think that this idea is great - but requires several different size configurations.  </li>
            <li> It works fast and quickly alleviates pain.</li>
            <li> Both the big toe protector and the toe spacer fit comfortably when wore with shoes.</li>
            <li> The bunion shield initially created soreness between the great toe and the 2nd.</li>
            <li> The material is very comfortable and realigns my big toe and eases the pain from my bunion.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this on his toe and it is very very helpful.  </li>
            <li> After just 2 days I like it very much already.</li>
            <li> I felt some discomfort the first day I used it, but it was very comfortable on the second day on, and I can used it all day without any problem.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working, too soon to tell, but very comfortable and truly don&#x27;t understand why anyone would ever not be able to figure out how to put it on.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> and I love that when I take my shoes off it actually looks like my bunion is being reduced; of course, then it changes and looks like it always does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really soft and comfortable to wear with shoes</li>
            <li> The gel material is so soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Relieved my paid after the first use.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;bunion relief set&#x27; does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> They actually look more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; in socks, too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> But I do believe that returning the toe to its natural alignment is important</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was imagining inventing myself before I began researching for a product</li>
            <li> overwhelmed by so many different gizmos and gadgets.  </li>
            <li> I like these &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; toe spacers as far as being a comfortable way to help with bunion problems</li>
            <li> Those things are soft, comfortable, wearable in shoes, and they relieved my feet pain immediately.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Hurt at first.</li>
            <li> it was too short and did not extend sufficiently over the top of my foot to fully cover the bunion area.  </li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe these will actually help most people.  </li>
            <li> This has been my first one.  </li>
            <li> These things really work for me!  </li>
            <li> My mom said her pain got reduced the first time she wore</li>
            <li> Had surgery on first toe</li>
            <li> The spacers and the protectors are soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> I did receive some pain relief from using the bunion protectors from the first day.  </li>
            <li> I have already noticed that my big toe has become more aligned.</li>
            <li> Obviously they work better with a sneaker or boot.</li>
            <li> Pain relief was noticed almost immediately from the first week.</li>
            <li> I was just searching for inexpensive ways to help my bunions, and I&#x27;m really glad I chose it because it definitely helps!</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s different for everyone though.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with bunion relief and strengthening muscles in toes!</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable and they even fit well in my shoes with relaxing the laces a little.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like much when it arrives but these little gems are very comfortable, easy to use and seem to perform as promised.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because it is too large to wear with shoes, so it actually causes more pressure with shoes.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;d much rather not having to wear any device on my foot, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d still be in a lot of pain without wearing your &amp;#34;bunion protector&amp;#34;, and plan on using it well into the future, if not forever.  </li>
            <li> The spacer that goes on the second toe and between the big toe is also cushioned and feels good - relieves some pain.</li>
            <li> Both items fit well, are soft, and really relieve pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put them on right away, and have been comfortable wearing them night and day for several weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Love the product - depending on the shoes I have on, I can wear it all day long.  </li>
            <li> I am able to wear it all day long.  </li>
            <li> The protector broke the first time I wore it for a whole day.</li>
            <li> My bunion pain went away after about 2 weeks of consistent use, and can wear them all day without much discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is something that I really just started to notice after adding more intense workouts to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> These little rubber doodads are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Provides better alignment of toes and as a result some pain relief, especially with high heeled shoes.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this, but this product truly is amazing!!</li>
            <li> My feet feel better than they have in a long time!</li>
            <li> some shoes a bit more tight, but not impossible to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been wearing them all day long and then at night I wear a more intense brace that maximally separates my toes while I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is my experience that the Toe Protector can be worn easily in an athletic shoe or boot or simply with socks around the house.</li>
            <li> The bunion protectors gave me pain relief while wearing certain shoes.  </li>
            <li> Also, the protectors are fairly large and peak out the sides of the flats I&#x27;ve tried to wear them with.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing the large piece with shoes on occasion.  </li>
            <li> I have large bunions on my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine wearing during the day with that large spacer.</li>
            <li> And since I only have a bunion on my right foot, I realized I could reverse these and use them all on my right foot!</li>
            <li> These are made of such soft silicon, they don&#x27;t provide any support, and at best, provide a small amount of &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; from friction against your skin.</li>
            <li> The only problem is if wearing them all the time, even taking them off to clean, they can or may cause your skin between your toes where it touches to become irritated and tender, kind of like athletes feet, due to the moisture.</li>
            <li> The things actually feel very soft, and you wouldn&#x27;t think they could cute off the circulation like that</li>
            <li> I am willing to go back to my original rating of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> That portion was too large and really pushed my toe apart.</li>
            <li> Seems to help, but it doesn&#x27;t provide much padding on the sore spot.</li>
            <li> I am just uncertain to how much of the healing has to do with the product.</li>
            <li> They seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> They give me so much relief because my bunion screams.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The toe spacer is very helpful; I wear it all the time when I am at home and it provides relief.  </li>
            <li> It is has helped to ameliorate much of the pain and discomfort</li>
            <li> This really does help to keep the friction off of the bunion.</li>
            <li> I also believe that over time it could really help prevent the condition from worsening.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was wider</li>
            <li> kit is something that really does work.  </li>
            <li> they have really helped my feet.</li>
            <li> The toe spacer worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for spacing toes and easing bunion discomfort.better than others I have used.good guality.</li>
            <li> and I think that the bunion reliever with the side bunion protection ended up getting pulled too much in the wash.</li>
            <li> Also, have held up very well.  </li>
            <li> But really these are overpriced, they are just toe spacers.</li>
            <li> He really likes them.</li>
            <li> The silicone is nice and smooth, and they seem durable, although I&#x27;ve only had them a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> (Thanks, Mom!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find that they aren&#x27;t very durable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom, who says they work very well and have reduced her pain.</li>
            <li> However, I am very athletic, and would get calluses on the bunion foot from my athletic shoes.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need the one with the bunion sleeve.  </li>
            <li> Really did not help much</li>
            <li> Really helped my bunion pain.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple days of use, she had one simple word to describe them, fantastic.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t miracle workers, but they&#x27;ve really helped me.  </li>
            <li> The toe spacer is actually quite comfortable</li>
            <li> I expected a device that used the ball of the foot with a more forceful pull on the lg toe, That&#x27;s not how this works</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bunion doesn&#x27;t hurt that much</li>
            <li> your products again and thanks for the email.</li>
            <li> Really has helped with the discomfort.</li>
            <li> Bunion shield is helpful in absorbing the pressure in my shoes.</li>
            <li> They worked very well until one of them broke after around one month of use...</li>
            <li> No product will work miracles, but this set has helped relieve much of the pain caused by my bunions and hammertoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing a chiropractor who couldn&#x27;t really determine the source of the pain.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Anyway I advise trying this for your bunion, I am a nurse and very athletic and don&#x27;t want surgery, this may prevent it.</li>
            <li> I am finding this product very helpful.  </li>
            <li> These gel toe protectors really do work.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful to align toes and relieve bunion pain.</li>
            <li> I dont worry too much about it</li>
            <li> I am sold, this thing really works.</li>
            <li> Still wearing it daily, comfortable inside your shoe, you forget you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing these off and on for the past two months or so, and must say I&#x27;ve been quite surprised with how effective they are!</li>
            <li> Although I technically cant see anything there, I believe its the first phase of developing and the pain, though mild, was worying me.</li>
            <li> Both the Toe Spacer and the Bunion Protestor are easy to wear in walking shoes during a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many toe separators and other bunion relief options,  but nothing worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Soft, soft material that&#x27;s eay to clean.  </li>
            <li> I just rinse them off every night and use them again the next day -- great little product!</li>
            <li> The big toe separator may cause some discomfort when worn in a shoe for long periods of time, but ultimately this seems to be a great help.</li>
            <li> Love the product and passing the word around to other people with Bunion pain.</li>
            <li> They can thus provide a gentle stretch in your daily life without special time-consuming exercisers.</li>
            <li> as my toe pain is most prevalent when I&#x27;m in my bare feet, the toe spacer definitely lessens the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m consistently amazed by how useful this simple tool has been for my comfort.</li>
            <li> The material is very soft and the toe separators fit perfectly to my second toe.</li>
            <li> After I placed my order, I received a detailed email letting me know how to use the items and how to care for them to assure long use.  </li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t worn them too long, I can&#x27;t really comment how effective they would be in the long term.</li>
            <li> Soft and pliable, not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As for the cushion that has the side piece that goes down over the bunion...their photo shows it fitting flush with the side of the foot.</li>
            <li> The toe spacers I use when I&#x27;m wear my flip flops, which is a lot, since I live in Florida!  </li>
            <li> My bunions are moderate and starting to come in more.</li>
            <li> These may seem like a simple fix, but they have done wonders to help me stop a quickly developing bunion issue.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fix the problem, but it relieves pain while walking and running which was my main concern.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it adds space between my big toe and my next toe.</li>
            <li> I believe the main reason they work</li>
            <li> I use the larger version that goes over the big toe most often.</li>
            <li> They relieve the pain under my second toe by keeping it from laying on top of my big toe.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and have already told friends about it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you want immediate relief.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but she cut a little off the&lt;br /&gt;bottom to customize for wearing with her shoes to make them even better -&lt;br /&gt;said</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are worth the money, they are high quality and work especially when if you wear socks or house slippers, or any shoe (that covers the plastic.</li>
            <li> Not only does the spacer feel good between the big toe and the second toe, but the pad covers and protects the bunion from pain of pressure and rubbing (although I wish the pad was just a touch bigger to cover a large bunion).  </li>
            <li> So far working very well</li>
            <li> really like this soft and supple spacer.  </li>
            <li> I must say, so far I am really liking your product.</li>
            <li> My feet are 61 years old and have suffered much abuse over the decades - ballet, pregnancy, etc.</li>
            <li> Only needed to use one of them so far but glad I have the left foot one as well.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone</li>
            <li> so think it is fairly normal in size.  </li>
            <li> I was wearing some cute boots, and they were already beginning to aggravate my bunion a bit after a few hours of wear.  </li>
            <li> Gel separators are nice &amp; thick and hold their shape.</li>
            <li> I am only using the bunion spacers and shields on my right foot.</li>
            <li> One was as comfortable as the other.</li>
            <li> These little tools are effective and sturdy providing help with proper alignment, reducing pain and increasing comfort.</li>
            <li> I live in NYC and depend on my feet as transportation.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to, but very comfortable and now wear everyday with socks and shoes and tend to forget they&#x27;re there!  </li>
            <li> The toe separators works better than bunion shield because my dance shoes are very tight.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and are helping from big toe going further &#x27;south&#x27;,</li>
            <li> I wear them as much as I can, around the house, when I go out...as much as possible, and they pain is absolutely relieved.</li>
            <li> Very soft and skin like feeling.</li>
            <li> Very soft and I could feel a difference when wearing the spacers.</li>
            <li> These protectors are very soft and hold the fingers well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to wear with shoes, and even comfortable enough to leave on when I am in my running shoes most days.  </li>
            <li> The other product I&#x27;ve found that significantly helps is Yoga Toes.</li>
            <li> First week, I could only wear them a couple of hours a day.  </li>
            <li> Instant relief and results within the first two days of use.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I just passed the 15 weeks post op mark on my left foot so my right foot is really to help me delay another surgery until my left foot is fully healed.</li>
            <li> They feel a little strange when you first use them, but they&#x27;re really soft and comfortable, and if your feet are as crummy as mine are, they really do help keep toes from mashing into one another.  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s able to stretch a little more than before, doesn&#x27;t curve inward so much towards the second toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My right foot is a tiny bit smaller than my left-my left big toe is fine and not turning in.</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful, specially when I workout.</li>
            <li> I guess it will just cost more money down the road when she is enough pain that she will see a DR.</li>
            <li> These spacers and protectors are very easy to wear in shoes and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would wear a spacer on my second toe at night with a sock to keep it from moving and could go most of the night before it became painful from the toe not wanting to be aligned.</li>
            <li> They are actually pretty comfortable to wear in shoes, as I have already worn them in a few different pairs, including flats.</li>
            <li> I only have a mild to moderate bunion on one foot, and do not have pain.</li>
            <li> Clearly this should be available in different sizes, or the toe divider should just be smaller in general.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say my toes feel better yet, but the toe has straightened back out a little.</li>
            <li> The bunion protectors provided significant relief during running as I&#x27;m training for a half marathon.</li>
            <li> My foot is in such bad shape that eventually it will need surgery; however, in the meantime your product works wonderful.</li>
            <li> The material is too soft to be functional.</li>
            <li> The pain was starting to become intense regardless what type of shoe I wore or what activity I did.  </li>
            <li> The soft material allows you to wear them for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> very comfortablet to wear - finally toes are where they are supposed to be in my shoes.</li>
            <li> When my order didn&#x27;t come in complete, they promptly replace the order.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s early days yet</li>
            <li> My feet were killing me today, and after only a trip to the store I decided to try these, I&#x27;ve had them for a while but didn&#x27;t hold much hope.</li>
            <li> Its so soft and squishy</li>
            <li> Touch softly and no smell.</li>
            <li> Save your money and go buy soft bed Birkenstocks.</li>
            <li> Really helps to keep my big toe in line.</li>
            <li> The toe spacer completely prevents this from happening.</li>
            <li> have been a life saver thus far.</li>
            <li> Overall, I can&#x27;t say it has helped too much-</li>
            <li> I have a bunion on each foot, but the left one is much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fixed my overlapping toes.</li>
            <li> Relief far beyond expectations.</li>
            <li> Granted, they&#x27;re not going to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my big honking bunions, but they have given me so much pain relief</li>
            <li> I wear them in every conceivable type of enclosed shoe, sometimes they show, but</li>
            <li> I got these for my old woman.</li>
            <li> This really helps my bunion, I gave one to someone else that had a bunion, leaving me with only one toe separator</li>
            <li> so well is the soft rubber material.  </li>
            <li> the one with the cover is soft too, but it peaks out of my flats.</li>
            <li> So far they are working.</li>
            <li> but so far they have lasted so well that I&#x27;ve not needed to replace them.</li>
            <li> And at night, as soft as they are, they were &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; and came off.</li>
            <li> These are soooo soft and squishy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I actually have bunions or not, but I definitely experience frequent pain and tenderness on the top of my foot at the ball connecting my big toe, and wearing these in the evenings or to sleep in reduces the pain tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Finding the right product and managing the condition as early as possible is key.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s only been two weeks since I started wearing it, I&#x27;m planning to play tennis this weekend while wearing the &amp;#34;bunion protector&amp;#34; (of course!), which I haven&#x27;t been able to do in the last month due to pain.</li>
            <li> have a bunion on one foot, and recently wore a new pair of shoes for too long and a blister formed right on the bunion.</li>
            <li> Small separators seem to get easily misplaced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, perhaps my feet are too small (I wear a women&#x27;s size 6 shoe), but it slipped on/off too easily and didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.  </li>
            <li> Also, I power walked for an hour and a half then put in a full day of work as a hairstylist.</li>
            <li> So I bought these little relief thingies;) thats what I call them, after reading that its best to start relieving toe pain as soon as possible to avoid crazy deformities and major pain.</li>
            <li> The soft, cushy protector provided immediate relief of the sharp stabbing pain that I normally feel when I put on my shoes.  </li>
            <li> The main purpose I got these for was so I could do my Barr Amp bootcamp workout (which has a lot of toe raised squat positioning) and not have my big toes start to ache...</li>
            <li> but I do have a toe that is starting to grow inward, so I&#x27;m mainly using them to try to treat that.</li>
            <li> I was left limping more than my usual amount.</li>
            <li> she was only able to use the small toe piece.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing the toe spacer daily for a couple of weeks, and the protector a bit less, but the pain in my left foot, which prior to this was hurting most of the day (and especially at night, an intense burning), is almost completely gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bunions are fairly new to me, so it is difficult for me to give an honest account of the results.</li>
            <li> and I can wear them while sleeping which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> , the hole in the other spacer is on the smaller side not as comfortable as the bigger one.</li>
            <li> Gel is comfortable, but firm enough so it doesn&#x27;t pick up dirt if you go barefoot.</li>
            <li> For several years I wore a plastic/velcro splint at night that offered relief, but lately the top of the splints irritated my feet.  </li>
            <li> it does space my big toe to be straight, but idk that it would correct anything over time (will report back).</li>
            <li> I purchased these to keep my big toe and second toe separated, not so much to relieve bunion pain.</li>
            <li> I was spectacle at first thinking that all the other post were &amp;#34;inflated&amp;#34;, but boy was I mistaken.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s my feet!</li>
            <li> Personally, I would use them more for toe separation, however I knew a friend who has serious bunion issues and gave them to her to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Big toe protector works good, but a little hard to conceal with a pair of flats.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of constant use, I am very much aware that my right foot big toe, which previously crossed over the 2nd toe without a separator, tends to keep its distance!  </li>
            <li> I am extremely thankful that I purchased your product, based on the extremely positive reviews for your product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> These things hurt when you wear them with any other foot wear other than light slippers.</li>
            <li> These protectors are incredibly soft, just stretch over your big toe in order to protect a bunion, or</li>
            <li> Because they are silicone, they stay in place while I dance and are soft enough to allow my toes to move where they need to move.</li>
            <li> protectors are incredibly soft, just stretch over your big toe in order to protect a bunion, or</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only worn them with Teva&#x27;s so far</li>
            <li> It seems you currently need to contact this company through Amazon to get action for customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days I did notice that I was wearing them, but after the 3rd day I could barely notice I had them on with my closed toe shoes.  </li>
            <li> The material is soft, yet thick enough, and comfortable.    </li>
            <li> I encourage anyone who suffers from bunion pain to give this product a good look.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have bunions, using for helping move big toe possibly straight and to open space between big and second toe.  </li>
            <li> I only use the spacers and you have to hook it on your toe next to big toe as the hold isnt large enough to go on your big toe.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell after several months of daily usage, this product will not correct your bunions... but will help prevent further progression.  </li>
            <li> However, one barely notices/feels them on the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but first few times they were distracting.</li>
            <li> But, I thought I would not get to wearing them all day without discomfort the first few days...</li>
            <li> least you have feet, mom!&amp;#34;  So true...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a long term thing, wear them a little at the beginning and increase wear-time gradually until you notice a distinct improvement when not wearing them.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them over any other protector I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve worn it for about an hour and a half each time while working out (fast walking).</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this over my bunion so the divider was between my big toe and the next one, and after I put my shoe on, I could barely walk because of the pain.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have found it very helpful to tape down the rising second toe in a crisscross fashion under the foot.</li>
            <li> Using the Big Toe Protector during the day in combination with Foot Smart&#x27;s Bunion Regulator at night helps to decrease discomfort of, and straighten, a big and second toe wanting to cross under and over each other, respectively.</li>
            <li> they pushed her second toe a little too much -</li>
            <li> But the swelling and crease line did go down overnight and feels normal now.  </li>
            <li> I noticed lately that my right big toe is starting to turn in a bit I believe from wearing ballet flats.</li>
            <li> My toes no longer lean so far over the other toes that they almost overlap them.  </li>
            <li> Walking in toe spacers is not very comfortable for me, there not bad at first, but after about an hour or so my toes become slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have to wear compression socks and the larger bunion separators are difficult to get placed properly when you have compression socks, but the smaller pieces work just fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 25, but I&#x27;ve just started to really see the signs of bunions the past 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using these products long enough to know if there will be any long-term correction to my big toe turning in</li>
            <li> like using the small one at night, large during the day.  </li>
            <li> I know it will take time undo years of wearing high heals and narrow toed shoes.  </li>
            <li> I wear flat pumps even though I shouldn&#x27;t because of my bunion</li>
            <li> so I cant vouch for the long term benefits but product does provide instant temporary relief.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t lie flat on it-</li>
            <li> These are soft rubber and not strong enough to actually &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; a bunion issue in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I can also feel soreness in my bunion after a couple hours of wearing it but no major pain.</li>
            <li> - -- save the larger ones for loose socks.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was starting to have a significant amount of pain to the point where my feet hurt in flats and I was getting shooting pains by just stepping on the gas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish that the spacer was a little bit wider because on me the gap between the big toe and the second toe is rather big.</li>
            <li> wear it all day long</li>
            <li> I can wear it all day long, it is comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it takes time for the tendons in your foot to adjust and become stretched without discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to find shoes that are wide enough for me to wear the protectors during the day.  </li>
            <li> I can wear them for long periods of time, and forget I even have them on.</li>
            <li> can now go for long walks without pain in my feet or bunions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The part that goes between the toes is larger than what I expected from the picture.</li>
            <li> A long session icing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rubber stretched over toes with ease.</li>
            <li> Both products absorb the pressure on the bunion and the spacers help to keep the pressure off of some fragile bones toward the center toes on my foot.</li>
            <li> My pumps and sandals aren&#x27;t wide enough to wear the spacers or protectors.  </li>
            <li> It is strange to say, but this cushion has even increased my self confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn them at home without shoes, and all day long at work with sneakers and sandals.</li>
            <li> I now notice the difference when I do not where it for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> The cushion helps me to do long walks without any pain and it keeps the toes well separated.</li>
            <li> The material is extremely soft,  but firmly stays in place throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn them for long walks and all day at work.</li>
            <li> Please excuse the lack of correct anatomical terms.</li>
            <li> They sank down to the bottom of the toe.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the upper part of the toe that is overlapping the next toe.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a different brand previously that didn&#x27;t come with the smaller &amp;#34;over</li>
            <li> I have bunions on both feet, the one on my right foot is worse.  </li>
            <li> I typically wear the spacer with bare feet or with socks/work shoes, and even to bed.</li>
            <li> However the thing was too tight on the toe and cut of the circulation to the big toe worse on the right than the left.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to (I mean, you are wedging some foreign object between your toes, after all); however, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my toe/foot positioning already, even when I take it off for a bit.  </li>
            <li> So tight that it cuts off circulation and the ones that do not wrap around the toe are not solid enough to separate the toes.</li>
            <li> It states very clearly in the product title that there is a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and if you are not satisfied, there is a no-hassle return policy.</li>
            <li> I like it around my big toe because it seems like it is not pushing my second toe toward my little toe.  </li>
            <li> They do relieve the pressure and make it possible to wear something other than sneakers when I go out.  </li>
            <li> The corrector does not straighten my big toe, puts pressure on my other toes--</li>
            <li> big toes change their direction and move toward the other toes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wear the device all day long in comfort!</li>
            <li> This does give you instant relief, but cannot wear for a long period of time, only a few hours</li>
            <li> The other enclosed spacer can be used to isolate an ingrown toenail from the next toe and thereby relieve pain from that problem too.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I could only presume they were not new.</li>
            <li> I work as a nurse and my shifts are very long.</li>
            <li> The protectors that didn&#x27;t work for me--well, I clipped off the bunion portion..and now wear them at night while the spacers dry.</li>
            <li> I initially likes these bunion pain relievers but they ended up breaking up only after a few months.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t loose their shape either.  </li>
            <li> My feet are less sore and my toes seem to be moving back into place.</li>
            <li> It makes my toe hurt after wearing it for only half an hour.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I hav big toes, but I am a size 8 and a half with be width</li>
            <li> I can only tolerate that for less than an hour at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have had less bunion pain over the last week using it.</li>
            <li> My feet hurt less, and my heels are back on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is key for me, since my mother&#x27;s feet and grandmother&#x27;s feet have severe bunions (all toes overlap and feet on their feet and finding shoes to wear comfortably is almost impossible).  </li>
            <li> but i doubt they would hold up long with everyday use as the hole for the toe to fit is very thin feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the spacers and protectors for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that this product has received anything less than 5 stars!  </li>
            <li> A newcomer to the whole bunion situation and very concerned, frustrated,</li>
            <li> Made from really soft elastomer that can&#x27;t in any way keep toes from going where they want to go if you&#x27;ve got what&#x27;s commonly referred to as &amp;#34;bunions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I can wear them with all closed toe shoes.</li>
            <li> The larger is harder to deal with when putting on socks, but that can be the only complaint by this wearer.</li>
            <li> These have already helped, within a few days, to relieve the bunion pain and seem to be helping realign my big toe.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Kept on for a few hours - and actually seemed to help a</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to wear wider shoes when using the bunion shields.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I can already tell a difference in only a few days.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes I can spent 6-8 hours on my feet.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the divider is too wide and too tall.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to perhaps have different sizes for the toe spacer, as I think mine is a tad too thick.</li>
            <li> is really a &#x27;wedge&#x27; between the toes with the thin, &#x27;ball-of-the foot pad not able to exert any force on the big toe.  </li>
            <li> When I removed it, the device left a raw mark over the part of the foot that it was on.</li>
            <li> that I hardly know I have them on when I&#x27;m bare foot or wearing athletic shoes.  </li>
            <li> I wear one set at night and the other set with the side protection with my shoes at work.</li>
            <li> No real complaints, tho!</li>
            <li> Pretty well useless for my mother&#x27;s application.</li>
            <li> The big one is to protect the big toe and the small one is to keep the small finer away from the toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear the other one all the time.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve not used the bunion cushion yet, however when my toe starts to shift toward my other toes my foot goes into spasm</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll feel with regular shoes</li>
            <li> gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a male with relatively small feet.  </li>
            <li> Again, a complete waste of money, plastic too soft to have any affect, no pain relief no joy, just another con...as a bunion sufferer (and you guys reading this will relate) one seeks relief!</li>
            <li> Since I wear those spacers every single day from morning til night, I usually wash them and let them dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> I am an active dancer and wearing the spacer in my ballet slipper has helped to get rid of the pain I used to get while dancing.</li>
            <li> Shame - was really hoping it work live up to the hype:(</li>
            <li> My bunion on my right foot is really bad, so the big toe protector helped somewhat in protecting my bunion</li>
            <li> Bought these after trying CorrectToes,which didn&#x27;t work for me at all, due to the shape and hard material (even after modification, so I sent it back).</li>
            <li> After having a bad result from bunion surgery on my left foot several years ago, I swore I would never let another surgeon near my feet.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price at all.  </li>
            <li> Use these while I&#x27;m not super active and having both options of over the gig toe/between toes is helpful.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t walk until I pull my toes apart and my foot calms down...</li>
            <li> However, they can be a bit uncomfortable after prolonged use with tight shoes or socks, but I highly recommend them if you&#x27;ve got bunions!</li>
            <li> The side-padded pair ripped in half after wearing them for less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Less stress and achey.  </li>
            <li> It protects the outer area of the big toe from the painful rubbing of shoes while gently separating and realigning the toe.</li>
            <li> With this separator, my toe turns in less which helps with pain.</li>
            <li> Do believe I have less end of the day pain when wearing.</li>
            <li> bunions are protected from the shoe pressure and they are less inflamed when I wear the bunion</li>
            <li> Helped me run a half marathon, thought I wasn&#x27;t going to do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young, active, and unfortunately, have a medium sized bunion on one foot.  </li>
            <li> You will still need a shoe with a roomy toe; pointy toes would be too tight.  </li>
            <li> Too tight on toes.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, the products arrived a clear, small zip lock bag, with only a barcode on the outside.</li>
            <li> I do like the little toe separator.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I am an ER nurse and on my feet for 12 hour shifts and with a small but painful bunion on my right foot it gets rough.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after a few days of wearing the joint felt a little achey</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the toe spacers for a few weeks and have noticed an improvement already.</li>
            <li> work at a gym and wear gym shoes everyday.</li>
            <li> She wears them everyday.</li>
            <li> If you treat them as a gift probably not buy it because the product only covered with a thin plastic beg.</li>
            <li> The bunion shield protector did not help, and I quit using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> That was after a few days of continuous use.</li>
            <li> My goal was to prevent the bunion from getting worse, and to help prevent further calluses.</li>
            <li> Even so, these did not fit or cushion my bunion</li>
            <li> One size does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it for my and could not use the thumb because did not fit her well.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, using these cushions will ward off bunion surgery for a few years.</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to them, but then the pain is gone, even in heels.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not comfortable to wear with shoes.</li>
            <li> I have bunions and I use these everyday, all day.</li>
            <li> I do not know if these work because my wife is stubborn and refused to wear these after a few days.</li>
            <li> Bunions can be very painful and this sure does help.</li>
            <li> Other spacers have been way too hard for my tender feet.  </li>
            <li> As time were on, my other foot got worse and worse and the big toe was turning inward and causing problems with my other toes.</li>
            <li> But all these wearing is under slipper not the normal shoes because the room in the head of the shoes is small, if you wearing like this, you will feel uncomfortable, at least for me.</li>
            <li> My feet are size 7.5 &amp; narrow and my bunions are small.</li>
            <li> The most uncomfortable and painful is a toe splint I purchased separately that straps on the foot.</li>
            <li> me it was not a pain issue, but a numbness sensation in the area beneath the big toe, near the ball of the foot, where the base of the toe bone is adjacent to the longer foot/big toe bone.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the spacers will actually last before the tears make them impossible to wear.</li>
            <li> I used to get sharp stabbing pain through my big toe up through my foot but that hasn&#x27;t happened once since using this product.  </li>
            <li> It really helped my painful bunions.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my skin is reacting against it or if the design is the issue.</li>
            <li> Usually I wear Crocs with CorrectToes: https://nwfootankle.com/products/11-correct-toes-medium</li>
            <li> I was not pleased and do not wear them.</li>
            <li> sorry maybe too graphic.</li>
            <li> No more pain.</li>
            <li> However, it seems overpriced for 4 small pieces of foam.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the protector about 10 hours a day.  </li>
            <li> Not much more I can say</li>
            <li> The pain usually starts when I go to bed and its excruciating.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear them after the work day.</li>
            <li> I have broken one foot twice in two separate places and the other once - all within the past 18 months.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as was really looking forward to trying both.</li>
            <li> I would not want the plastic pieces to be hard</li>
            <li> and I can hardly feel it.</li>
            <li> walked a averaging at least 40 milers per week.  </li>
            <li> My shoes are no problem now.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that addresses a common foot problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Not overly thick, I can still wear these with shoes or just around the house.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt about it- bunions suck, but it doesn&#x27;t have to mean foot pain forever.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t pull the shield all the way to touch the webbed skin between the toes (you know what I mean).</li>
            <li> The soft gel protectors have made wearing shoes much less painful!</li>
            <li> I do not have serious bunion issues....</li>
            <li> My bunions, especially one of them have been so painful lately that I have been at my wits</li>
            <li> I almost feel a little guilty.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t do what surgery will do, obviously, but it will help you hang in there until you can&#x27;t wait any longer for surgery, if your bunion is that bad, like mine.</li>
            <li> I do not actually have painful bunions</li>
            <li> He went with out it one night and the next morning his toe was painful.  </li>
            <li> Then it will likely be too late for a product like this to work :(</li>
            <li> I am trying different products and these spacers are the least painful or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> toe spacer is uncomfortable, I can hardly wear it.</li>
            <li> I had been having increased pain and my bunions are getting worse with age and activity</li>
            <li> I know this is not going to fix the problem, but I believe it is helping my toe not get worse.</li>
            <li> I can say that my feet aren&#x27;t so tired</li>
            <li> She said they made her foot hurt worse.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If bunions worsen they can end up forming blisters or corn which can be very painful and make it hard to wear proper shoes and walk.</li>
            <li> If you have painful abnormalities in your toes that can be ameliorated by separating one from the other then this is for you.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t even know if that is possible) but they have given me a lot of relief from a very painful condition and helped me avoid the dreaded ortho surgeon.</li>
            <li> Stupid little sponges.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit uncomfortable but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they do tend to fall off as I change positions.  </li>
            <li> but it feels weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t wear them because of this.</li>
            <li> What is uncomfortable is trying to get your toe where it does not want to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toe protector is uncomfortable to wear in shoes, but I wear it around the house.  </li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable and HURT - and did not stop hurting.  </li>
            <li> and then it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am taking all measures necessary to avoid getting an ugly bunion!!!</li>
            <li> They are really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Its weird..</li>
            <li> I use it when I am chilling at home.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought it</li>
            <li> These are very irritating.  </li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to alleviating any pain since my bunion is not as bad as others.</li>
            <li> The bad part about this product is that it didn&#x27;t become with directions.</li>
            <li> My bunion pain got so bad that it even hurt to walk in sneakers.</li>
            <li> It was just too painful.</li>
            <li> rubbing against the inside of my shoes so it wouldn&#x27;t be too painful, but after a while it began to feel too&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a painful bunion</li>
            <li> Relatively worthless.</li>
            <li> My foot was very painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> with foot conditions knows how miserable they can be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to prevent my bunion from getting worst and it helps.</li>
            <li> and it is horrible.  </li>
            <li> If you have painful bunions,  get some!!  </li>

            <li> Smaller toe spacers broke after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> So comfortable and really has helped eliminate the pain!  I highly recommend and have already told friends about it.</li>
            <li> Love the product - depending on the shoes I have on, I can wear it all day long.  My foot is in such bad shape that eventually it will need surgery; however, in the meantime your product works wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am extremely thankful that I purchased your product, based on the extremely positive reviews for your product on Amazon.  Although I&#x27;d much rather not having to wear any device on my foot, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d still be in a lot of pain without wearing your &amp;#34;bunion protector&amp;#34;, and plan on using it well into the future, if not forever.  Although it&#x27;s only been two weeks since I started wearing it, I&#x27;m planning to play tennis this weekend while wearing the &amp;#34;bunion protector&amp;#34; (of course!), which I haven&#x27;t been able to do in the last month due to pain.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I walk for exercise, and they are so comfortable!  I can walk without pain!  They are easy to put on, and soft and stretchy.  The toe spacers I use when I&#x27;m wear my flip flops, which is a lot, since I live in Florida!  I think these are well worth the purchase.  It sure has helped me!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say. I wear them every day. Feel no pain. Easy walking I gain.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the toe spacers for a few weeks and have noticed an improvement already. My feet are less sore and my toes seem to be moving back into place. I have not worn the toe protectors yet as the spacers seem to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li> So far, I love the comfort and I love that when I take my shoes off it actually looks like my bunion is being reduced; of course, then it changes and looks like it always does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy both the bunion protector and the toe separator.  I switch from having it on my big toe and then my second toe.  I like it around my big toe because it seems like it is not pushing my second toe toward my little toe.  Both ways fit my toes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is so comfortable you can wear it with shoes, boots, sneakers.  I will definitely purchase another set to have on hand.  If your bunions hurt try this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to help, but it doesn&#x27;t provide much padding on the sore spot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference at the end of the day in comfort and pain. If you have painful abnormalities in your toes that can be ameliorated by separating one from the other then this is for you. I have just had surgery to eleviate the pain that these helped to make tolerable. Until you have surgery or if you don&#x27;t plan on having surgery then I recommend this set as an inexpensive way to manage the pain that arthritis causes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my skin is reacting against it or if the design is the issue. Either way, I can&#x27;t use these anymore because I have rashes between/around my big toes</li>
            <li> Such a pricy item. It makes my toe hurt after wearing it for only half an hour.  I want to return it but it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the spacers much however, the shield has been wonderful in relieving my daily bunion pain. My bunions are moderate and starting to come in more. They are not severe but they still cause me a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;I work at a gym and wear gym shoes everyday. I have been able to wear the protectors, socks, and my shoes comfortably. I have been wearing them all day long and then at night I wear a more intense brace that maximally separates my toes while I sleep.&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t had any discomfort wearing the protectors  all day, they are very comfortable and lightweight and I forget that I even have them on.</li>
            <li> I might eventually give this product five stars. Bunions are fairly new to me, so it is difficult for me to give an honest account of the results. I will say that I have been able to wear these very comfortable with my work shoes and the bunions that were forming on both of my feet have subsided significantly since using them. I am just uncertain to how much of the healing has to do with the product. I wear one set at night and the other set with the side protection with my shoes at work. They seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> These work great!  They fit even when wearing shoes.  Started to fix my bunion within a week.</li>
            <li> The bunion regulator is very comfortable to wear in your shoe and relieves the pain and pressure the bunion causes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the bunion protector for a couple of days and I love it.  No pain at all!!!  My foot feels better now even if I don&#x27;t use it but most of the time I do.</li>
            <li> These are soft rubber and not strong enough to actually &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; a bunion issue in my opinion. The longer side pieces that are supposed to cover the bunions I dont use. I only use the spacers and you have to hook it on your toe next to big toe as the hold isnt large enough to go on your big toe. I tried walking with these in my athletic shoes and over time I did get used to them but first few times they were distracting. I think it is more uncomfortable to wear these in conjunction with ortho arch supports. I have pair of indoor workout shoes that i do not put arch supports in and they feel more comfortable. The main purpose I got these for was so I could do my Barr Amp bootcamp workout (which has a lot of toe raised squat positioning) and not have my big toes start to ache...especially the left one. These keep my big toes aligned for the workout. I would not want the plastic pieces to be hard and im glad they are soft but i doubt they would hold up long with everyday use as the hole for the toe to fit is very thin feeling. I cant imagine sticking the piece over the big toe. As for the cushion that has the side piece that goes down over the bunion...their photo shows it fitting flush with the side of the foot. That was not case with me. The side piece stuck out and didnt lay against my foot. This got on my nerves but i didnt wear them in shoes so over time maybe they would mold and bend to your foot. These fit my purpose for a workout aid but if i were trying to correct my bunion alignment issues as in therapy activity then I would by a more rigid detailed contraption that focused more on correction than comfort.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.I suffer prom pronation and always wear custom orthos but this product gave me great relief as it keeps my big toe separate from the next toe...Only needed to use one of them so far but glad I have the left foot one as well.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with foot conditions knows how miserable they can be.&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to do more work on my feet since using this product. Small separators seem to get easily misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;This is big enough not to lose or get lost.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Both the big toe protector and the toe separator work great.  I put them on right away, and have been comfortable wearing them night and day for several weeks now.  They don&#x27;t cure the bunions, but they definitely help.  Very comfortable and easy to wash.  Really soft and comfortable to wear with shoes on if the shoes are roomy.</li>
            <li> I experienced pain relief.  The shield protector made shoes more comfortable, even though I only wear shoes 2-3 hours per day.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I wear it all day with socks. I cannot wear it when I play basketball as the shield hinges would rip.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I am an ER nurse and on my feet for 12 hour shifts and with a small but painful bunion on my right foot it gets rough.  This has taken all that pain away and I am so excited.  I have tried several things but this is the only thing that has worked.  THANKS</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and they ease the rubbing that causes bunion pain.</li>
            <li> They make wearing my shoes more comfortable for awhile, however, they do not work in my case for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased toe spreaders at drug stores and used them for quite some time to help my bunion pain.  I am so thrilled that this time I purchased these.  They are so much more comfortable and gentle with my toes.  I actually look forward to putting them on.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget they are there and go to bed with them on.  I will be purchasing more of these.  They make my bunion so tolerable.</li>
            <li> Using them at all times</li>
            <li> Wonderful relief! The soft, cushy protector provided immediate relief of the sharp stabbing pain that I normally feel when I put on my shoes.  I am able to wear it all day long.  Thank you, Denada.</li>
            <li> The material is too soft to be functional.</li>
            <li> So this product is great. Only 1 problem when you wear them all day then take them off the inside of your big toe and second toe hurt. If they could fix this problem I would be in heaven. I wear them for 12 hours walking on my feet. They give me so much relief because my bunion screams. The bunion cover is the best feeling. They aren&#x27;t cheaply made. Very soft and skin like feeling. I wear them then step in the shower and rinse them and wear them again the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised that this product has received anything less than 5 stars!  I&#x27;m young, active, and unfortunately, have a medium sized bunion on one foot.  The pain was starting to become intense regardless what type of shoe I wore or what activity I did.  These bunion relief things were my last ditch effort before making an appointment with a podiatrist.  After almost a week of wearing them, I am pain free.  I started out by wearing it for a couple hours at a time, working my way up to an entire day and then adding the toe spacer at night. To alleviate any irritation around my toes, I lightly coat it with some baby powder before putting it on.  It takes a few days to get used to (I mean, you are wedging some foreign object between your toes, after all); however, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge change in my toe/foot positioning already, even when I take it off for a bit.  I highly recommend this product if you want immediate relief.</li>
            <li> I bought these to wear in dressy shoes that put pressure on the bunion and cause pain.  They do relieve the pressure and make it possible to wear something other than sneakers when I go out.  You will still need a shoe with a roomy toe; pointy toes would be too tight.  I only wear dressy shoes occasionally.  Usually I wear Crocs with CorrectToes: https://nwfootankle.com/products/11-correct-toes-medium</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mother-in-law, and she LOVES them.  She says the toe spacer is so comfortable, she wears it all day and night.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing for a month or so and my bunions don&#x27;t hurt. Hopefully somehow it will straighten out over time, but i guess I might have to go to the doctor to make sure of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it all day long and I don&#x27;t notice it when I&#x27;m wearing it. I actually use it when I go running. It was a bit uncomfortable but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Loved the product from day one of using it. Very comfortable in any type of shoe I have worn, and has alleviated bunion pain especially when I am on my feet for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I wear these every day with every type of shoe.  So comfortable and I have noticed my big toe begin to straighten out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! These work better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried many things to relieve my bunions. The soft material allows you to wear them for an extended period of time. I&#x27;ve even  worn them at night and it was very comfortable. Also, I power walked for an hour and a half then put in a full day of work as a hairstylist. This is especially great, because I had to give up walking for exercise years ago due to having bunions on both feet. It was just too painful.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.  I have to wear compression socks and the larger bunion separators are difficult to get placed properly when you have compression socks, but the smaller pieces work just fine - -- save the larger ones for loose socks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;m using this to prevent my bunion from getting worst and it helps.</li>
            <li> These may seem like a simple fix, but they have done wonders to help me stop a quickly developing bunion issue.  The big toe separator may cause some discomfort when worn in a shoe for long periods of time, but ultimately this seems to be a great help.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m seeing progress?!</li>
            <li> I was having constant pain all of a sudden and found I had a bunion.  I wore the bunion protector under my shoes and was able to wear it all day.  The pain immediately went away.  I also use the toe spacer at home and while sleeping.  So far I have yet to feel the pain I experienced prior to using either product.&lt;br /&gt;I wear the bunion protector during the day in my shoes and spacer when at home and at night.  I have done this every day for two weeks and have not had any pain.  Hoping it will help fix my situation before it gets worse.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> These are very irritating.  Maybe I has a sensitivity to the silicon.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and works well</li>
            <li> The toe spacer is very helpful; I wear it all the time when I am at home and it provides relief.  I do not wear with shoes but as my toe pain is most prevalent when I&#x27;m in my bare feet, the toe spacer definitely lessens the pain.</li>
            <li> Great relief.  I can wear them with all closed toe shoes. Provides great padding.</li>
            <li> These were great while they lasted. Unfortunately they didn&#x27;t last very long. The side-padded pair ripped in half after wearing them for less than 3 weeks. My feet are size 7.5 &amp; narrow and my bunions are small. There&#x27;s no reason this should happen.</li>
            <li> If you have a bunion or the start of one you should buy these!!  My foot was very painful and I did not want foot surgery..been there, done that and it is horrible.  These things fit fine, inside any shoes, very comfortable and eliminates all pain!!!  Fantastic!  The toe spacer is my favorite.</li>
            <li> In theory these look like they would work well,  in practicality they do almost nothing to realign the great toe and relieve pressure.  The only items in this set are the toe spacers that I wear at night.  Unfortunately they do tend to fall off as I change positions.  They are too bulky to wear with most shoes I have for work  ( I am a nurse and on my feet many hours a day ).</li>
            <li> I wore them for a while, but stopped because my bunions star to hurt</li>
            <li> very comfortablet to wear - finally toes are where they are supposed to be in my shoes.</li>
            <li> The bunion relief kit does a terrific job.  I am able to wear both the spacer and the protector inside my sneakers  I can only wear the protector with me dress shoes. It is has helped to ameliorate much of the pain and discomfort I was experiencing I am an&lt;br /&gt;Avid walked a averaging at least 40 milers per week.  This product has allowed me to continue my routine without pain</li>
            <li> Awesome find!!! This really does help to keep the friction off of the bunion. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I wore the protectors in the day and it gave me what I wanted- relief from my throbbing bunions! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> So far working very well</li>
            <li> When my order didn&#x27;t come in complete, they promptly replace the order.  Great Customer service.  This product is great because it is made of a soft gel.  They fit perfectly and I could really tell they were working after wearing them for a few hours.  Will keep purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how the bunion protector was relief right away.  The gel was cooling and they slide over your toe so they stay in place.</li>
            <li> I returned it because it was not the product I thought I was getting. I believed it to be a device to help realign my toe because of the bunion.</li>
            <li> Great to wear during the day inside of shoes for bunion relief all day! Covers it up to avoid friction. The gel material is so soft and comfortable. Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> The bunion protectors gave me pain relief while wearing certain shoes.  I didn&#x27;t even notice them while wearing sneakers, and some of my flats... they didn&#x27;t work in some of my tighter fitting shoes. I&#x27;ve slept with the spacers on and have been wearing them barefoot at home nightly... they have yet to cause me any discomfort at all. Thank you for a great product :)</li>
            <li> Where have these been all my life?! These work PERFECT, and you can&#x27;t even feel you are wearing them.</li>
            <li> The reason that I had bought this,was because of my hurtful bunion. The shield would not stay in place,when place in shoes. The toe spacer made my toe hurt even more. I was not pleased and do not wear them.</li>
            <li> HaPpY I bought these.  My feet feel so much better. Less stress and achey.  They can be worn with shoes.</li>
            <li> My bunion on my right foot is really bad, so the big toe protector helped somewhat in protecting my bunion&lt;br /&gt;from rubbing against the inside of my shoes so it wouldn&#x27;t be too painful, but after a while it began to feel too&lt;br /&gt;tight. I did love the toe separators though. I recommend this product for people who have a light bunion problem.</li>
            <li> The protector broke the first time I wore it for a whole day. the second one did the same. Besides that they seem to work well and I only have the seperators left but they work and seem to be making a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn the larger protector probably three or four times since purchasing the kit. And I&#x27;ve worn it for about an hour and a half each time while working out (fast walking). I have found it to be remarkably comfortable both barefoot and also inside my sneaker. I also believe that over time it could really help prevent the condition from worsening. Additionally, I have not felt any pain while exercising and using the protector. It&#x27;s early days yet but I feel optimistic. Thank you very much for offering what seems to be a wonderful solution.</li>
            <li> I got them for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day - she&lt;br /&gt;loves them!  Said they are very comfortable but she cut a little off the&lt;br /&gt;bottom to customize for wearing with her shoes to make them even better -&lt;br /&gt;said they pushed her second toe a little too much - but now they are&lt;br /&gt;perfect.  She wears them everyday.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable!</li>
            <li> Using the Big Toe Protector during the day in combination with Foot Smart&#x27;s Bunion Regulator at night helps to decrease discomfort of, and straighten, a big and second toe wanting to cross under and over each other, respectively. Also, I have found it very helpful to tape down the rising second toe in a crisscross fashion under the foot. It is my experience that the Toe Protector can be worn easily in an athletic shoe or boot or simply with socks around the house. They are so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them.</li>
            <li> These things hurt when you wear them with any other foot wear other than light slippers. Even then they hurt your skin and make your toe bones sore.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with  your product. I can wear it all day long, it is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;DenadaDance has a very good service, when I send them an e-mail with some questions, they responded fast, and their answers to my questions were perfect.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and not enough separation!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. I really wish it was wider so it ran the entire length of my toe but it is overall a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear with shoes. Stopped pain immediately. Glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> love your product, easy to sleep with. It has only been 2 weeks but already the pain has reduced. thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I actually have bunions or not, but I definitely experience frequent pain and tenderness on the top of my foot at the ball connecting my big toe, and wearing these in the evenings or to sleep in reduces the pain tremendously.  The set is made of nice, flexible plastic and work well in separating the toes.  Although I would highly recommend this item for usage without shoes, I have yet to find a pair of my shoes that I can comfortably wear the spacers or protectors with.  Also, the protectors are fairly large and peak out the sides of the flats I&#x27;ve tried to wear them with.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to clean.  I can already tell a difference with my bunions.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the bunion protector/shield most of all, because it cushions my bunion, protecting it from rubbing too much against my shoes. I also like that the bunion shield includes a toe spacer, which really does a great job in straightening my big toe while I’m wearing my shoes. My only suggestion would be to perhaps have different sizes for the toe spacer, as I think mine is a tad too thick.</li>
            <li> I do not have serious bunion issues....But this product is working well for me....Relieved my paid after the first use.</li>
            <li> These are so incredibly soft and comfortable! They are very well designed and comfortable to wear. I highly recommend them over any other protector I&#x27;ve found. The other product I&#x27;ve found that significantly helps is Yoga Toes. There is no doubt about it- bunions suck, but it doesn&#x27;t have to mean foot pain forever. Finding the right product and managing the condition as early as possible is key.</li>
            <li> The bunion &#x27;shield&#x27; part continual rolls up or doesn&#x27;t stay put.  The toe spacer shifts about also.  Shame - was really hoping it work live up to the hype:(</li>
            <li> Works. Wish was made of different material.... but. Works well enough. Wearing right now.</li>
            <li> I love the DenadaDance® Bunion Pain Relief Kit. I may have to purchase two more sets one for my mother and a spare set for me.&lt;br /&gt;This kit is something that really does work.  Great product and service!</li>
            <li> These protectors are incredibly soft, just stretch over your big toe in order to protect a bunion, or the smaller one is used to prevent toes from overlapping. I use the bunion protector the most, I can wear my shoe&#x27;s with it and it&#x27;s very comfortable for about 4 or 5 hours, then it starts to feel as if it is rubbing. Once I take it off it&#x27;s fine.  I have worn the the toe spacers (the smaller ones) while I sleep.  They are pretty comfortable until I wake up because my feet are to warm in my socks, that&#x27;s when I take them off.  Walking in toe spacers is not very comfortable for me, there not bad at first, but after about an hour or so my toes become slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> great product. i wear the toe spacers in my shoes to work. ( i stand about 8 hours ) they have really helped my feet.</li>
            <li> So tight that it cuts off circulation and the ones that do not wrap around the toe are not solid enough to separate the toes. They just squish back together.</li>
            <li> because I stay on with sandals</li>
            <li> Nice.  Have been wearing the large piece with shoes on occasion.  Provides better alignment of toes and as a result some pain relief, especially with high heeled shoes.  Would recommend it for anyone with bunion pain.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Easy to wear.  I have big man canoe feet and these fit nicely. It&#x27;s a one size fits all kind of a thing. They stretch and have enough give that they fit comfortable on the toes.They seem to be made of a soft rubbery silicone type material They are flexible and stretchy and provide a nice bit of cushioning between the toes. The ones the goes around the big toe have a &amp;#34;shield&amp;#34; that covers the outside of the toe so that it cushions the toe from rubbing inside a shoe, and that does relieve some pain for me. The spacer that goes on the second toe and between the big toe is also cushioned and feels good - relieves some pain.</li>
            <li> The toe spacer worked really well.  I felt some discomfort the first day I used it, but it was very comfortable on the second day on, and I can used it all day without any problem.  The best part is that it protects my toe from the pain the friction with the &amp;#34;bunion toe&amp;#34; causes.  It is a little bulky to wear with regular width shoe, but perfect with a wider shoe.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the purchase.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My feet were killing me today, and after only a trip to the store I decided to try these, I&#x27;ve had them for a while but didn&#x27;t hold much hope. Instant relief! I wore them under some boots and had to go out again and for once in my life, my toes don&#x27;t hurt. I hope this love affair lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Works for me! It doesn&#x27;t fix the problem, but it relieves pain while walking and running which was my main concern. There are many products out there for this issue, but none have worked for me like this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> The bunion spacers work fine.  Sometimes the smaller one moves out of place when I pull my sock on. Once they are in place within shoe, they remain in correct position keeping toes apart.  Since I haven&#x27;t worn them too long, I can&#x27;t really comment how effective they would be in the long term.</li>
            <li> Both products have helped with tenderness and pain!</li>
            <li> I do not actually have painful bunions but I do have a toe that is starting to grow inward, so I&#x27;m mainly using them to try to treat that. Putting socks over the longer device is often a hassle and I&#x27;ve elected just to do that at work. No real complaints, tho!</li>
            <li> I have only worn these while sleeping but I can already tell they are helping. I&#x27;ve been wearing them for a couple of weeks. The material is very comfortable and realigns my big toe and eases the pain from my bunion. I&#x27;m hoping over time it will get better and go away. We shall see! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> What a great idea. This &#x27;bunion relief set&#x27; does exactly what it advertises. It protects the outer area of the big toe from the painful rubbing of shoes while gently separating and realigning the toe. It&#x27;s easy to wear inside shoes and is very helpful toward pain relief. I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Two of the toe separators did not do that well.  They sank down to the bottom of the toe.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the upper part of the toe that is overlapping the next toe.  However, the third toe separators&lt;br /&gt;stays in place.  I am using it.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;joe</li>
            <li> these keep your toes separated and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have bunion problem so happy I found these gels because it really releases the pressure in my feet.</li>
            <li> I bought these to wear with my open-toe dance shoes (I am a latin dancer). The toe separators works better than bunion shield because my dance shoes are very tight. I wore the bunion shield with tennis shoes, and they fit in comfortably. With this separator, my toe turns in less which helps with pain. I wish that the spacer was a little bit wider because on me the gap between the big toe and the second toe is rather big. These of course don&#x27;t heal/correct the foot structure but help with managing the symptoms. Would I recommend this to others? Yes I would. Because they are silicone, they stay in place while I dance and are soft enough to allow my toes to move where they need to move.</li>
            <li> Very soft and I could feel a difference when wearing the spacers.</li>
            <li> Provides good support and comfort - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of time and money. These are made of such soft silicon, they don&#x27;t provide any support, and at best, provide a small amount of &amp;#34;cushion&amp;#34; from friction against your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t order these again.</li>
            <li> I only need them at night, for some reason is when my feet are sore. There is one version (the longer one) that doesn&#x27;t move and it helps wonders. The smaller version moves so I have used it with shoes but it feels weird and I don&#x27;t feel I need it anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a lark (good upsell Amazon) and didn&#x27;t have much for expectations. I have bunions on both feet and the affected toes are often sore, tender to the touch, and seem to crave that feeling of separation. These little rubber doodads are pretty amazing.Right away, I started wearing them all day. I am on my feet 8+ hrs/day, and they have worked in a variety of shoes. I took them on a 4 mile run. The protection area is great for incidental bumping, which used to put me through the roof. I wear the separators to bed. My feet feel better than they have in a long time! They actually look more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; in socks, too.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I can mention, is they make my feet stink. I just bring them in the shower with me (the doodads...and yes,my feet) to rinse them each day.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they last!</li>
            <li> At first these we&#x27;re great.  They help protect bunions.  However, the part the goes between the toes causes an indentation and inflammation.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t wear them because of this.</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful, specially when I workout. They do a great job protecting my bunions. After I started using them, they don&#x27;t get irritated anymore!</li>
            <li> I wore it once all day and on both feet.  I am talking about the larger piece that goes over the big toe and then seperates it from the 2nd toe.  For spacing it did well.  However the thing was too tight on the toe and cut of the circulation to the big toe worse on the right than the left.  Perhaps I hav big toes, but I am a size 8 and a half with be width so think it is fairly normal in size.  Anyway as I said I wore it all and it did not hurt  at all so when I removed my socks at bedtime and saw what  happened to my toe, I was alarmed.  But the swelling and crease line did go down overnight and feels normal now.  Perhaps I should not have worn them all day but there was no warning not to and they did not hurt me.  However, I will never my toe into anything like that again.  The things actually feel very soft, and you wouldn&#x27;t think they could cute off the circulation like that but they did.</li>
            <li> Pretty well useless for my mother&#x27;s application. Her doctor said not to use.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for spacing toes and easing bunion discomfort.better than others I have used.good guality.</li>
            <li> I initially likes these bunion pain relievers but they ended up breaking up only after a few months. I ending up washing them with my jeans and I think that the bunion reliever with the side bunion protection ended up getting pulled too much in the wash.</li>
            <li> Too tight on toes. Was refunded.</li>
            <li> 1.  The protector pad just makes my foot wider, so shoes and tighter--ouch!&lt;br /&gt;2.  The corrector does not straighten my big toe, puts pressure on my other toes--ouch!, and won&#x27;t stay on when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I wear mine all of the time, day and night.  Very comfortable and my foot feels stable.</li>
            <li> Fit well, but don&#x27;t provide much support because they&#x27;re so squishy.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week and use it in my work shoes to cushion my toes. Its so soft and squishy I love it! I wear flat pumps even though I shouldn&#x27;t because of my bunion and I have to wear slip on socks with my pumps all the time because of the pain. This does not show with my slip on socks and I can hardly feel it. Bunions can be very painful and this sure does help.</li>
            <li> A good quality product that looks just as the picture shows. I have worn both items in all types of shoes. The larger is harder to deal with when putting on socks, but that can be the only complaint by this wearer. My feet are quite severe, so this will not correct what has been done. The spacers have allowed me to work on trying to build up strength and joint mobility as they help with stability and alignment during exercise. Do believe I have less end of the day pain when wearing.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this on his toe and it is very very helpful.  Straightening out his toe and relieving pain.  He went with out it one night and the next morning his toe was painful.  He eats the smaller ring like loop 24/7 now.</li>
            <li> Love em. My feet have never been happier!</li>
            <li> These have already helped, within a few days, to relieve the bunion pain and seem to be helping realign my big toe.  At least it&#x27;s able to stretch a little more than before, doesn&#x27;t curve inward so much towards the second toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using the small one at night, large during the day.  Gel is comfortable, but firm enough so it doesn&#x27;t pick up dirt if you go barefoot.</li>
            <li> This is the right concept but is very stick &amp; not THICK ENOUGH to supply great comfort while wearing shoes!</li>
            <li> Great if you have the beginnings of a bunion! Probably not so effective for those who have severe bunion.</li>
            <li> Helpful to separate toes and helps with the &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34; sensation under my toes. Sometimes either it slips or maybe it&#x27;s my foot but I will have some pain when walking.</li>
            <li> I have waited several months to do a review on this item...so I could truly test the product more thoroughly. I LOVE this product.  I have bunions and it is hereditary.  I had been having increased pain and my bunions are getting worse with age and activity (I had to give up running because of the effects on my bunions and making them progress more quickly).  I wear these in my tennis shoes daily, and it helps keep my bunions from hurting at night after walking on my feet all day...plus, I walk several miles a day for exercise.  Note:  You have to build up to wearing these all day.  First week, I could only wear them a couple of hours a day.  Next week, 4-5 hours, by the end of 2-3 weeks, I could wear them all day...don&#x27;t even know I have them on.  But, I thought I would not get to wearing them all day without discomfort the first few days...almost gave up.  Push through,  it takes time for the tendons in your foot to adjust and become stretched without discomfort.  As far as I can tell after several months of daily usage, this product will not correct your bunions... but will help prevent further progression.  This is key for me, since my mother&#x27;s feet and grandmother&#x27;s feet have severe bunions (all toes overlap and feet on their feet and finding shoes to wear comfortably is almost impossible).  I am trying to prevent this, and this is the best product I have found so far...better than toe stretchers and toe stretching socks in my opinion.  They rinse off easily when cleaning, too.  Also, have held up very well.  I hope this review helps...especially for those fighting bunions.</li>
            <li> I received my bunion relief kit today.  I was wearing some cute boots, and they were already beginning to aggravate my bunion a bit after a few hours of wear.  I put the bunion protector on my big toe, and put my boot back on and actually went shopping for a couple of hours!  These things are amazing!  No kidding...good, soft quality, very kind to my skin, and just feel great inside my shoe on my poor bunion.  I am very impressed with this product, and new feel more confident to try some of the cute boot choices out there this season.  I encourage anyone who suffers from bunion pain to give this product a good look.  They certainly don&#x27;t cure the issue, but they sure make my feet happy!!! Plan to order a second set just to never be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the customer service was awesome!  After I placed my order, I received a detailed email letting me know how to use the items and how to care for them to assure long use.  Very impressive.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price at all.  I returned these.  I bought a different set (2 pairs) for like $5 on Amazon that work just as well.  This will do nothing in the way of correcting bunions.  They may help make it more comfortable.  But really these are overpriced, they are just toe spacers.</li>
            <li> I like it. If you treat them as a gift probably not buy it because the product only covered with a thin plastic beg. Touch softly and no smell.</li>
            <li> I received a sample product to evaluate and test, and I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;These protectors are incredibly soft, just stretch over your big toe in order to protect a bunion, or the smaller one is used to prevent toes from overlapping.&lt;br /&gt;They feel great, and here is why I&#x27;m so happy with this product...&lt;br /&gt;I have a bunion on one foot, and recently wore a new pair of shoes for too long and a blister formed right on the bunion. Unless they were slippers, I hadn&#x27;t been able to wear shoes for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;Put one of these on, and the cushy protector covered the healing blister! My shoes are no problem now.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product that addresses a common foot problem.</li>
            <li> This has helped me tremendously</li>
            <li> The pain actually increased as the toe was placed in a position it did not want to be in, but I think that&#x27;s a sign it&#x27;s working.  After removing the spacer the bunion actually is improved.&lt;br /&gt;I have intermittent pain in my big toe and it&#x27;s not terribly out of alignment, but the protector does shield the area quite well.  These spacers and protectors are very easy to wear in shoes and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would wear a spacer on my second toe at night with a sock to keep it from moving and could go most of the night before it became painful from the toe not wanting to be aligned. I think it&#x27;s a long term thing, wear them a little at the beginning and increase wear-time gradually until you notice a distinct improvement when not wearing them.  I also wear a &amp;#34;Good Feet&amp;#34; prosthetic in my shoes and that helps the rest of my foot in combination with this spacer.  The spacers are amazingly flexible, gel-like and very soft and comfortable. What is uncomfortable is trying to get your toe where it does not want to be.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor did not instruct me to use any kind of products for the pain in my big toe so I&#x27;m kind of self-medicating. I am trying different products and these spacers are the least painful or uncomfortable. The most uncomfortable and painful is a toe splint I purchased separately that straps on the foot. I can only tolerate that for less than an hour at a time.  But I do believe that returning the toe to its natural alignment is important so I am hoping this all works.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soft and supple spacer.  It is exactly what I was imagining inventing myself before I began researching for a product and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Could not feel a difference, felt like it was more in the way and going to slip around more than anything. Save your money and go buy soft bed Birkenstocks.</li>
            <li> I orders the bunion pads for my husband. He really likes them. They are comfortable and most importantly, they help his bunions! Customer service is amazing if you need any help from them. I would definitely recommend them for anyone needing anything for bunions.</li>
            <li> Both the Toe Spacer and the Bunion Protestor are easy to wear in walking shoes during a long time. They can thus provide a gentle stretch in your daily life without special time-consuming exercisers. Use the Bunion Protector right after dancing in high-heeled shoes and experience the desired pain relief in your bunions!</li>
            <li> For several years I wore a plastic/velcro splint at night that offered relief, but lately the top of the splints irritated my feet.  I ordered this bunion relief set, and it arrived promptly, along with a follow-up email from the company - unheard of these days!  The silicone is nice and smooth, and they seem durable, although I&#x27;ve only had them a few weeks.  I wear the protectors on both of my feet, and I never wake up at night to take them off as I did with my splints.  I am trying to find shoes that are wide enough for me to wear the protectors during the day.  The toe protector is uncomfortable to wear in shoes, but I wear it around the house.  Bunions are a pain, but as my son told me, &amp;#34;At least you have feet, mom!&amp;#34;  So true...</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! I&#x27;m only 25, but I&#x27;ve just started to really see the signs of bunions the past 6 months to a year. (Thanks, Mom!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, these are very squishy, which is a great thing when you&#x27;re wearing them in your shoes. I&#x27;ve been wearing them when I work out and in my shoes at work and they&#x27;ve made a huge difference when I&#x27;m not wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in case you&#x27;re wondering, you CAN wear both of these sets inside of your shoes. The ones that go over the bunion might be visible if your shoes don&#x27;t cover the whole area, but otherwise your safe and they&#x27;re comfortable. They can also both be worn with socks. If you&#x27;ve ever worn tights this&#x27;ll be a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended. Buy these. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I got pain relief using the toe spacers right away. The pain and swelling got better each day.  The bunion shield protector did not help, and I quit using it after a few days. It was too much, even in the shoes I bought with more space in the toe box. Both the toe spacers and the shield protector are comfortable when worn with shoes. One was as comfortable as the other. I was able to wear either of these 24/7 immediately. Great product!!)</li>
            <li> Great product!!  A newcomer to the whole bunion situation and very concerned, frustrated, overwhelmed by so many different gizmos and gadgets.  Thank goodness I came across this item from DenadaDance.  Works wonderfully.  Takes a bit of getting used to, but very comfortable and now wear everyday with socks and shoes and tend to forget they&#x27;re there!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> These worked for me. I found relief from my pain and i keep wearing them every night.</li>
            <li> I am a botched bunion surgery survivor. After having a bad result from bunion surgery on my left foot several years ago, I swore I would never let another surgeon near my feet. As time were on, my other foot got worse and worse and the big toe was turning inward and causing problems with my other toes. Luckily, I found these on Amazon, figured I would give them a try (I needed to do something) and ordered them. I have been able to wear the bunion shield all day in my shoes and it gives me a LOT of relief. The shield tends to peel off at night when I am tossing and turning in bed so I have been wearing toe spacer at night. I haven&#x27;t been using these products long enough to know if there will be any long-term correction to my big toe turning in (I don&#x27;t even know if that is possible) but they have given me a lot of relief from a very painful condition and helped me avoid the dreaded ortho surgeon.</li>
            <li> I like these &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; toe spacers as far as being a comfortable way to help with bunion problems but I find that they aren&#x27;t very durable.  They tend to start tearing around the edges, especially around the toe area, even though the material itself is flexible.  I ordered a different brand previously that didn&#x27;t come with the smaller &amp;#34;over the second toe&amp;#34; spacers but the same thing happened.  The tears are tiny at the moment so I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the spacers will actually last before the tears make them impossible to wear.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. This is something that I really just started to notice after adding more intense workouts to my daily routine. Its very comfortable and fits in all my shoes. the space is nice for when I am walking around barefoot in my house. I know this is not going to fix the problem, but I believe it is helping my toe not get worse.</li>
            <li> Instant relief and results within the first two days of use. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and its durability.  I wear these as needed (I have dr. prescribed shoe inserts).  I also take care of them as described by the company and they are still in like-new condition.  I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I use them every day. I have to wear sneakers but the Bunion Relief works!</li>
            <li> I got some kind of arthritis causing virus this summer resulting in bunion like pain among many other joints in pain. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been wearing these around the house in my socks and in my shoes. Today the two joints made big pops and the toes went straighter. That was after a few days of continuous use. I can&#x27;t say my toes feel better yet, but the toe has straightened back out a little. They&#x27;re relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom, who says they work very well and have reduced her pain.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Really helps to keep my big toe in line. These are very comfortable. I can wear them for long periods of time, and forget I even have them on. Recommend for anyone with bunions.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter because she has terrible bunions and these are wonderful!  She said she is getting relief and because they are a rubber like material they will be washable.  The disposable bunion pads can add up!  Excited to have my daughter get a lot of use out of these!  Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> After just 2 days I like it very much already. Those things are soft, comfortable, wearable in shoes, and they relieved my feet pain immediately. I use toe spacers, the big toe protectors went to my mum, but she hasn&#x27;t tried them on yet. Will update when we get an opinion on those.</li>
            <li> I have large bunions on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;My big toes change their direction and move toward the other toes.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to discover the \\&quot;Bunion Pain Relief set\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I use both spacers and bunion protectors regularly throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;As a result I can say that my feet aren&#x27;t so tired anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I can now go for long walks without pain in my feet or bunions.&lt;br /&gt;My bunions are protected from the shoe pressure and they are less inflamed when I wear the bunion protectors.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very soft and feels good on the toes.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the bunion protectors will help my toes to find their correct position.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you DenadaDance for this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have bunions, using for helping move big toe possibly straight and to open space between big and second toe.  Use at night, not during the day.  Can&#x27;t imagine wearing during the day with that large spacer. Not sure if it&#x27;s working, too soon to tell, but very comfortable and truly don&#x27;t understand why anyone would ever not be able to figure out how to put it on.  I am hopeful!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I only have a mild to moderate bunion on one foot, and do not have pain. However, I am very athletic, and would get calluses on the bunion foot from my athletic shoes. My goal was to prevent the bunion from getting worse, and to help prevent further calluses. I typically wear the spacer with bare feet or with socks/work shoes, and even to bed. The bunion protector is amazing under a sock and running shoes/tennis shoes. etc. Very comfortable and really helps the callus problem (and helps with absorbing pressure). I can wear these products all day without discomfort (and I like that they are so easy to clean!) And since I only have a bunion on my right foot, I realized I could reverse these and use them all on my right foot! ;)</li>
            <li> Useful and comfortable</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver. It helps in protecting the feet&#x27;s fingers from bunions. These protectors are very soft and hold the fingers well. The big one is to protect the big toe and the small one is to keep the small finer away from the toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If bunions worsen they can end up forming blisters or corn which can be very painful and make it hard to wear proper shoes and walk. This protector will help avoid all this. If you have any thing occurring on your toe, just put on these protectors and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a painful bunion so I don&#x27;t really need the one with the bunion sleeve.  I wear the other one all the time.  Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> All of the positive feedback I read on here made my decision to purchase this item over the others easy.  I overnighted the item and was completely convinced that this would help remedy what is becoming a bunion issue.  The material used to is too soft and pliable - it provided absolutely no support in separating/realigning my big toe(s).  And, perhaps my feet are too small (I wear a women&#x27;s size 6 shoe), but it slipped on/off too easily and didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.  Total waste of time.  I could have ordered something else and might already be on the road to relief.</li>
            <li> These are so simple but so very effective! I don&#x27;t have pain on the outside of my big toe so I&#x27;ve not used the bunion cushion yet, however when my toe starts to shift toward my other toes my foot goes into spasm and I can&#x27;t walk until I pull my toes apart and my foot calms down...sorry maybe too graphic. The toe spacer completely prevents this from happening. I&#x27;m sleeping with it on now as well. Actually, I only take it off to wash it, so I switch between the 2 I purchased. I do wish they came in a more flesh tone though since I wear sandals so much of the time.&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t noticed just how well they were working until I didn&#x27;t wear the spacer for almost 2 days and I began limping. I put it back on&lt;br /&gt;and it took about 2-3 hours for my foot to feel good again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only worn them with Teva&#x27;s so far so I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;ll feel with regular shoes but my guess is they wouldn&#x27;t be too uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;These have been a life saver thus far.</li>
            <li> Really did not help much</li>
            <li> did not use/need toe spacers; however the silicone big toe protectors are a godsend. great product, thanks</li>
            <li> Really helped my bunion pain.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Relatively worthless. Made from really soft elastomer that can&#x27;t in any way keep toes from going where they want to go if you&#x27;ve got what&#x27;s commonly referred to as &amp;#34;bunions&amp;#34;. And it doesn&#x27;t help that the pictures show these on a normal healthy foot with NO &amp;#34;bunions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of these. Easy to wear and comfortable depending on which shoes i wear. It really helped my painful bunions.</li>
            <li> I love these they are so comfortable and all products work great</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this, but this product truly is amazing!! I noticed results right away! The foot my Bunyon is on feels so much better and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to wear, just takes a day or so to get used to having it on. LOVE this product so much!!</li>
            <li> Wore it at night and woke up to stinging pain!</li>
            <li> Material seems to be a very good quality gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a male with relatively small feet.  Even so, these did not fit or cushion my bunion very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toe Spacers - worked relatively well. Hurt at first. Kept on for a few hours - and actually seemed to help a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toe Protectors - did not work.  The part that goes between the toes is larger than what I expected from the picture.It was uncomfortable and HURT - and did not stop hurting.  That portion was too large and really pushed my toe apart. The portion that was supposed to go over my bunion to help shield it was too short and did not extend sufficiently over the top of my foot to fully cover the bunion area.  I kept it on hoping that my foot will feel better - but it did not.  When I removed it, the device left a raw mark over the part of the foot that it was on. I was left limping more than my usual amount. A long session icing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed.  I think that this idea is great - but requires several different size configurations.  One size does not fit all.  Who knows, maybe these will actually help most people.  They did not help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denada Dance communicates with the customer to try to help provide information to help succeed with the product.  I think that they really do intend to produce a good product.  I will continue to watch if they come out with something else that may better meet my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the product.  Combination of Amazon and Denada Dance was very nice to help make the return as easy as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the [[ASIN:B00AZ0NR3C DenadaDance Toe Stretchers Set]] since I got them last year so I was really excited to get to try this [[ASIN:B00KUTUNU8 Bunion Relief set by DenadaDance]].  Personally, I would use them more for toe separation, however I knew a friend who has serious bunion issues and gave them to her to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple days of use, she had one simple word to describe them, fantastic.  They are ridged, however quite flexible at the same time.  I like how they keep their shape and also you get a total of four pieces, 2 big toe protectors and 2 toe spacers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the [[ASIN:B00KUTUNU8 Bunion Relief set by DenadaDance]] is a really great product and I personally found it beneficial. I will continue using this product and will update my review should I find any negatives about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> This product is ok, it adds space between my big toe and my next toe. I can&#x27;t speak to alleviating any pain since my bunion is not as bad as others. Overall, I can&#x27;t say it has helped too much- surgery may be the only permanent fix.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t miracle workers, but they&#x27;ve really helped me.  I wear them regularly and wash the, with soap and water.  I&#x27;d definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I can wear these in my boots or slippers or to bed (only with socks though, or they come off).  They are comfortable and are helping from big toe going further &#x27;south&#x27;, well...East.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like much when it arrives but these little gems are very comfortable, easy to use and seem to perform as promised. I have only worn them twice but so far I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am only using the bunion spacers and shields on my right foot. I have a severe bunion and several hammertoes. I just passed the 15 weeks post op mark on my left foot so my right foot is really to help me delay another surgery until my left foot is fully healed. The toe spacer is actually quite comfortable and I can wear it in shoes all day. I have worn the separater a couple of times, in shoes, for about 6 hours. Comfortable. I am not feeling pain in the foot and I am hoping that by using the spacers I will avoid pain! I do wear a bunion splint at night, too.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with my DenadaDance bunion relief kit.  The soft gel protectors have made wearing shoes much less painful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never, ever, E V E R, given any business or item a 5 star rating... Ever! This has been my first one.  I was spectacle at first thinking that all the other post were &amp;#34;inflated&amp;#34;, but boy was I mistaken.  These things really work for me!  I&#x27;ve worn them with my sneakers, office shoes AND my dance shoes.  The first couple of days I did notice that I was wearing them, but after the 3rd day I could barely notice I had them on with my closed toe shoes.  Heck, on the 5th day, I stopped noticing them AND didn&#x27;t need to get my feet rubbed-- hahaha, my spouse  really liked that part.  I NEED  to buy another pair or two.  Great product.  And I can rinse them off easy to get the lint off of them and they don&#x27;t stink after a day&#x27;s use.  They don&#x27;t loose their shape either.  I am thoroughly impressed.  5-stars all day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fix them but provides a good cushion</li>
            <li> Works great, and a great seller, Thank you, Cheryl</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Rubber stretched over toes with ease. I recommend to anyone with severe bunion pain. Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product. Seller was kind enough to provide additional information. My mom said her pain got reduced the first time she wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my and could not use the thumb because did not fit her well.  she was only able to use the small toe piece.</li>
            <li> These are nice and comfy, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I expected a device that used the ball of the foot with a more forceful pull on the lg toe, That&#x27;s not how this works -it is really a &#x27;wedge&#x27; between the toes with the thin, &#x27;ball-of-the foot pad not able to exert any force on the big toe.  It does serve the function of making the &#x27;wedge easier to find and held in-place better.</li>
            <li> I must say, so far I am really liking your product. I have gotten pain relief from using both the spacers and the protectors. I never knew such products existed and wish I had learned about them years ago. The protector is very useful in absorbing pressure and eliminating the pain from shoes rubbing against the bunion. They are actually pretty comfortable to wear in shoes, as I have already worn them in a few different pairs, including flats. I have been able to wear the spacers for hours at a time without any discomfort, probably about 6-8 hours when Im sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and have not had any bunion pain since I started using them.  I used to get sharp stabbing pain through my big toe up through my foot but that hasn&#x27;t happened once since using this product.  I wear the toe spacer from morning until I go to bed at night, they are very comfortable and can be worn in my shoes also.  I switch the spacer for the bunion pad while doing the treadmill and it is comfortable while running.  This is the third product I have tried for bunion relief and absolutely the best one.  They have great customer service also, contacting me to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I have a bunion on each foot, but the left one is much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing the toe spacer daily for a couple of weeks, and the protector a bit less, but the pain in my left foot, which prior to this was hurting most of the day (and especially at night, an intense burning), is almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple product, but it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best product I&#x27;ve found as a toe straightener.  I like that it can be worn to bed and one can walk around the house with it on as well.  It works fast and quickly alleviates pain.</li>
            <li> These feel so good I almost feel a little guilty.  Great price.  Arrived on time.  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, the bunion feels better every day.  I wear the device all day long in comfort!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I very much enjoyed the seller emailing me about the product I had bought with some more information. It showed me that they care that their customers are using their product correctly. The bunion relief pads and toe spacers are wonderful! They do a great job and I can wear them while sleeping which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> Very good. Customer service is also very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I have ever found for the problem.  Outstanding!!!!!</li>
            <li> I did and do get pain relief from using both the protectors and the spacers. I use them daily.Both products absorb the pressure on the bunion and the spacers help to keep the pressure off of some fragile bones toward the center toes on my foot. I have broken one foot twice in two separate places and the other once - all within the past 18 months.The bunion spacers are very comfortable in all my shoes. I have to be careful to wear wider shoes when using the bunion shields.I&#x27;m wearing the spacers all day and the shields (protectors) approx. 4-6 hours a day. They are very easy to clean. I just wash them out quickly with antiseptic soap every evening. Hopefully, using these cushions will ward off bunion surgery for a few years.</li>
            <li> These work great but I can&#x27;t wear them 24/7 at this time.  Had surgery on first toe and now it&#x27;s starting to wander again.  This definitely helps on both feet.</li>
            <li> The spacers and the protectors are soft and comfortable that I hardly know I have them on when I&#x27;m bare foot or wearing athletic shoes.  My pumps and sandals aren&#x27;t wide enough to wear the spacers or protectors.  I&#x27;ve only been using the spacers and protectors for a little over a month so it&#x27;s too soon to notice a correction in my toe alignment.  I know it will take time undo years of wearing high heals and narrow toed shoes.  I only experience occasional pain in my feet, but since I&#x27;ve been wearing the spacers/protectors, I haven&#x27;t felt any pain.  I will continue to use the spacers/protectors and will follow up in about six months to share whether I see a difference in how my toes look.</li>
            <li> This does give you instant relief, but cannot wear for a long period of time, only a few hours and then it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> the shield protector helped to release some pain, I wear it when I need to take a walk.  toe spacer is uncomfortable, I can hardly wear it.</li>
            <li> At first, I was upset that DenadaDance company contacted me to give instructions on how to care for the products, however, now that I&#x27;ve received/used the product, the company is right. You want to take good care of these items because THEY REALLY WORK!  I&#x27;ve worn them all day with shoes and all night in my sleep and my feet feel wonderful.  My toes no longer lean so far over the other toes that they almost overlap them.  The big toes are straighter already and I&#x27;ve only had the spacers for a week.  Thank you Amazon for having this company on your roster.</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of pain in my one of my feet, specifically the toe. After googling what it could be, I self diagnosed myself with the beginning of a bunion. Although I technically cant see anything there, I believe its the first phase of developing and the pain, though mild, was worying me. So I bought these little relief thingies;) thats what I call them, after reading that its best to start relieving toe pain as soon as possible to avoid crazy deformities and major pain. I can tell you that they work. I wear them as much as I can, around the house, when I go out...as much as possible, and they pain is absolutely relieved. Not to mention that I have started doing toe stretches as well. Yes, I am taking all measures necessary to avoid getting an ugly bunion!!! Anyway, they helped me! I would recommend for sure!!</li>
            <li> Effective.  Soft and pliable, not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I wore them all day without a problem. I think that they&#x27;re great! I&#x27;m glad I ran across them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I LOOOOVE these!!! My bunions, especially one of them have been so painful lately that I have been at my wits end -- I am so glad I saw these and ordered them!!! My feet do not like socks, but I suppose a sheer pair of socks to hold these in place will be needed from now on, or they will wear our from rubbing against the inside of my shoes.</li>
            <li> I have used this bunion relief cushion for some time now and had amazing results. I&#x27;m consistently amazed by how useful this simple tool has been for my comfort. More importantly, it helps with my insecurities. It is strange to say, but this cushion has even increased my self confidence.</li>
            <li> This relieves my pain and is perfect for what it was needed for.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it fir awhile but have not seen any improvement yet.  I will try and wear it for another month to see. The bad part about this product is that it didn&#x27;t become with directions. The manufacture just assume the purchaser will know what to do.</li>
            <li> This product worked. No more pain. However, it seems overpriced for 4 small pieces of foam.</li>
            <li> I wear the one between my toes all the time to get pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;The bunion doesn&#x27;t hurt that much but my second toe does.  I will&lt;br /&gt;buy your products again and thanks for the email.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really has helped with the discomfort. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I do get relief from both spacer and bunion protector. Bunion shield is helpful in absorbing the pressure in my shoes. And very comfortable! I could wear the toe spacers with work tennis for about 12 hours. I find the shields more comfortable however. The shields I can wear barefoot or in shoes.</li>
            <li> Both the big toe protector and the toe spacer fit comfortably when wore with shoes. I can also feel soreness in my bunion after a couple hours of wearing it but no major pain.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product.  Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fixed my overlapping toes.</li>
            <li> This is great and helping me to postpone needed surgery. I would recommend this to anyone with bunions and an adjacent hurting toe. It can&#x27;t do what surgery will do, obviously, but it will help you hang in there until you can&#x27;t wait any longer for surgery, if your bunion is that bad, like mine.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  They are really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product with immediate relief!  The spacers are great for all day use and the toe protector work great in stiff shoes where the side of your foot rubs.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the results of this product. The relief to both the bunion and the adjacent toe is remarkable. I play golf and walk when I play and the device is so comfortable I forget it is even on my foot. Relief far beyond expectations. Best investment in a long time</li>
            <li> I had to throw them out after 3 uses. I was getting blisters around my toes because of it. Its a really great product overall but I think it has to be made with some kind of cloth material instead.</li>
            <li> they seem to help some of the pain of worn overnight.Have not tried to wear in shoes during the day hours.</li>
            <li> They worked very well until one of them broke after around one month of use...</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service. My bunion pain got so bad that it even hurt to walk in sneakers. I live in NYC and depend on my feet as transportation. The toe protector alone does it for me. I can&#x27;t begin to express how grateful I am for this product. I can walk again.</li>
            <li> These work great.  It takes a few days to get used to them, but then the pain is gone, even in heels.</li>
            <li> Stupid little sponges.  What was I thinking?</li>
            <li> Its weird.. it actually works! The protector only works with some shoes though, cause it does expand the feet a bit. I do like the little toe separator. I use it when I am chilling at home. I have had less bunion pain over the last week using it.</li>
            <li> No product will work miracles, but this set has helped relieve much of the pain caused by my bunions and hammertoes. I&#x27;ve worn them at home without shoes, and all day long at work with sneakers and sandals. Since I bought them this spring, I haven&#x27;t tried them yet with regular closed-toe shoes.</li>
            <li> Both toe protectors and spacers were very comfortable and easy to wear!</li>
            <li> Do not use yet...&lt;br /&gt; looks like a good product</li>
            <li> I noticed lately that my right big toe is starting to turn in a bit I believe from wearing ballet flats. My right foot is a tiny bit smaller than my left-my left big toe is fine and not turning in. I have been wearing the spacer all day while home and then the bunion one when I wear my ballet flats. I noticed after a few days of wearing the joint felt a little achey but that is to be expected. No biggie. I hope it works. I know it will take some time and will update the review to 5 starts if I see a huge differenct or lower the rating if nothing happens.They are comfy and totally doable.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I can already tell a difference in only a few days.  Granted, they&#x27;re not going to &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; my big honking bunions, but they have given me so much pain relief I am hopeful I can avoid surgery. I&#x27;m still working on the best way to use them and have even ordered another set. My feet are 61 years old and have suffered much abuse over the decades - ballet, pregnancy, etc. While my bunions are huge most of my pain has been on the instep and top of the foot. These little gems have given me a great deal of relief, so much so that I&#x27;ve started walking longer, farther and faster. Definitely work the money.  Oh, and a surprising but incredible benefit, relief of back pain. Yep. I&#x27;ve been seeing a chiropractor who couldn&#x27;t really determine the source of the pain. Apparently it&#x27;s my feet! Hooray!!</li>
            <li> the big toe protector/spacer works great, the hole in the other spacer is on the smaller side not as comfortable as the bigger one. I still use both though its nice this comes in a four pack so I can rotate wearing them. Im using these after bunion surgery to maintain the position of the toe as suggested by my Dr. These work great for that.</li>
            <li> These are pretty comfortable, with and without shoes. I can tell they are on with shoes on, but not to the point where they bother. The only problem is if wearing them all the time, even taking them off to clean, they can or may cause your skin between your toes where it touches to become irritated and tender, kind of like athletes feet, due to the moisture. I am just starting to feel the bunion, so I&#x27;m trying to be proactive. Let&#x27;s see if it helps to prevent it. Overall I would recommend.</li>
            <li> After wearing for about a week the pain and throbbing from my bunion was significantly reduced. I now notice the difference when I do not where it for long periods of time. These little tools are effective and sturdy providing help with proper alignment, reducing pain and increasing comfort.</li>
            <li> Love the product and passing the word around to other people with Bunion pain. This stuff works great for my husband. Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I did receive some pain relief from using the bunion protectors from the first day.  It is now much more comfortable to wear my sneakers and whole shoes.  I usually wear the protector about 10 hours a day.  But the toe spacers I used for a couple hours and then sleep with them a couple nights per week. This is over a month since I started wearing them and if I sleep in the spacers I don&#x27;t have to use them during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the toe separator.  It&#x27;s small enough to wear with shoes, and even comfortable enough to leave on when I am in my running shoes most days.  Works very well and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about two weeks. I could tell the difference immediately. The protector fits well in my gym shoes and boots.</li>
            <li> The bunion protectors provided significant relief during running as I&#x27;m training for a half marathon.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my Mom and she couldn&#x27;t be happier!  She got relief as soon as she put them on.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite many bunion cushions and toe spacers and these are the best so far. The cushion helps me to do long walks without any pain and it keeps the toes well separated. I am an active dancer and wearing the spacer in my ballet slipper has helped to get rid of the pain I used to get while dancing. The spacer is easy to put on and it stays in place. The material is soft, yet thick enough, and comfortable.    I wear them both, the cushion and spacer, daily. I wear the cushion for walks and the spacer at home (when I&#x27;m not wearing shoes). Wearing the cushions and doing daily bunion exercises have helped me to get rid of pain and also correct the big toe alignment.    I have been very satisfied with the product and can definitely recommended it.</li>
            <li> it works well for me. But you have to use them creatively, i.e. not just follow the instructions, for myself, I put first two toes together so that make the thumb correct to more straight and it works well and the pain get improved, feel really good. But all these wearing is under slipper not the normal shoes because the room in the head of the shoes is small, if you wearing like this, you will feel uncomfortable, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Only received the two toe spacers. Disappointed as was really looking forward to trying both.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be correctors but they&#x27;re actually to wear with your shoes. They&#x27;re not comfortable to wear with shoes.</li>
            <li> These are amazingly comfy and have stopped my foot pain! I wear them all day at work</li>
            <li> The bunion shield initially created soreness between the great toe and the 2nd. I used liquid Band-Aid to build up some resistance. I work as a nurse and my shifts are very long. My foot is getting use to the shield and I don&#x27;t need the liquid Band-Aid anymore. I also don&#x27;t pull the shield all the way to touch the webbed skin between the toes (you know what I mean). I am happy with the shield and it is bringing me much relief. My constant pain has diminished greatly. My bunion pain rarely wakes me up at night anymore. I have been showing the shield off at work hoping others can find relief also.  *Okay I now have an update. It seems you currently need to contact this company through Amazon to get action for customer service. The representative from this company says they are updating the website to assist in the responsiveness of the company. Not only did I get replacement I also received a full refund. Since I believe the effort was 100% satisfaction guaranteed I am willing to go back to my original rating of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have bunions and I use these everyday, all day. I love them and honestly can&#x27;t imagine life with out them now</li>
            <li> Worked AMAZING and immediately. I wear them in every conceivable type of enclosed shoe, sometimes they show, but I don&#x27;t care; they make such an incredible difference.</li>
            <li> The bunion shields and the toe spacers are very comfortable to wear as they are very soft. Still they do a good job in separating the toes and protecting the sensitive bunion skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using both products to keep my second toe from rubbing against my big toe.  The skin on my second toe was really getting irritated, so I was looking online for the best product to separate the two toes...I can wear them all day! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I got these for my old woman. Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Again, a complete waste of money, plastic too soft to have any affect, no pain relief no joy, just another con...as a bunion sufferer (and you guys reading this will relate) one seeks relief! No relief here,</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT.  COMFORTABLE BUT DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> Very interesting and informative.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I use it daily and can already see improvement.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products!  I use them all the time with my overlapping toe.  So comfortable!</li>
            <li> As you can tell by my name, I love shoes. I wear 5-6 inch heels on an almost daily basis. And sometimes I can spent 6-8 hours on my feet. Needless to say I was starting to have a significant amount of pain to the point where my feet hurt in flats and I was getting shooting pains by just stepping on the gas.&lt;br /&gt;I have been wearing the bunion toe spacer for about a week now. I put them on when I get home after work and have been keeping them on when I sleep. I have already noticed that my big toe has become more aligned. My feet hurt less, and my heels are back on.&lt;br /&gt;I have also worn the toe protector. It is comfortable and I was able to wear it throughout the day. Obviously they work better with a sneaker or boot. It is too bulky to wear with heels or open toe shoes (but I don&#x27;t think the product is intended to wear with heels).&lt;br /&gt;This company has fantastic customer service. They emailed me with instructions once I ordered the product and then followed up with another email about a week later to see how they were working.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews. but this product was worth it. Would recommend to anyone-especially my fellow shoe lovers out there whose feet are starting to pay the price for fashion!</li>
            <li> I have only used them for about 2 weeks, however, it has made a difference in the comfort of several pairs of shoes.  Easy to use ---I sleep with them on as well as use them when barefooted or in my wider toe bed shoes!</li>
            <li> I use both the protector, (every day with work shoes) and the spacers (every night). Pain relief was noticed almost immediately from the first week. the shield protector works brilliantly in reducing pressure and pain from shoes. It&#x27;s barely noticeable at all. Highly recommended. they work with my work shoes perfectly.  I also used it with my weekend shoes.  I wear the toe spacers from the time I get home from work, overnight while I sleep, and take it off when I shower. I have never felt any discomfort or pain while wearing it</li>
            <li> I would like to order 100 of these so I never run out!  This really helps my bunion, I gave one to someone else that had a bunion, leaving me with only one toe separator and I lost that one in my bed and am now in a panic! I wear it 24/7 since getting it. I wear it during yoga and in the shower. Anyway I advise trying this for your bunion, I am a nurse and very athletic and don&#x27;t want surgery, this may prevent it.</li>
            <li> I am finding this product very helpful.  I can now wear some shoes that were causing pain.</li>
            <li> Just started using but very comfortable thus far.</li>
            <li> These gel toe protectors really do work.  Not only does the spacer feel good between the big toe and the second toe, but the pad covers and protects the bunion from pain of pressure and rubbing (although I wish the pad was just a touch bigger to cover a large bunion).  It does the job and I&#x27;m really glad I ordered these.  The other enclosed spacer can be used to isolate an ingrown toenail from the next toe and thereby relieve pain from that problem too.</li>
            <li> fits fine without shoes, but once worn with shoes toes begin to hurt. Only had the product for about a month so I cant vouch for the long term benefits but product does provide instant temporary relief.</li>
            <li> The do the job.  Not much more I can say</li>
            <li> I was just searching for inexpensive ways to help my bunions, and I&#x27;m really glad I chose it because it definitely helps! The toe separators are helpful, but the sleeve that goes on makes a barrier between your foot and the shoe is pretty amazing. It&#x27;s super soft and helps more than I thought it could. It shows a bit when I&#x27;m wearing some flats, but it doesn&#x27;t matter when it doesn&#x27;t rub and relieves some pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many toe separators and other bunion relief options,  but nothing worked very well.  The DenadaDance gave me immediate relief,  especially the big toe protectors that cover the bunion area.  The material is extremely soft,  but firmly stays in place throughout the day.  I can wear the smaller toe spacers at night with no discomfort at all.  I believe the main reason they work so well is the soft rubber material.  Other spacers have been way too hard for my tender feet.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I wear them daily, they relieve the discomfort of bunions and they also are helping reposition my toes into proper alignment.</li>
            <li> Relief for achy bunions! Need to sell 2 packs!</li>
            <li> If you have painful bunions,  get some!!  glad i did..</li>
            <li> Great product I used the spacer with out the protection and my toe felt so much better...I&#x27;ll be wearing these all the time. Nice soft and flexible!</li>
            <li> squishy!!! it&#x27;s a super squishy silicone feeling, it&#x27;s kinda nice although I wish it had more volume than needed. it does space my big toe to be straight, but idk that it would correct anything over time (will report back). the toe separator one fits inside my flats. the one with the cover is soft too, but it peaks out of my flats. it feels nice and cool on my starter bunion but it doesn&#x27;t lie flat on it- but it is a thing that sticks out lol. it would totally form to a shoe though. Idk how it holds up during a work day, inside a shoe liner and flats, I will update my review, but so far it&#x27;s kinda cool!</li>
            <li> Good product. I was skeptical when I bought it but I&#x27;m glad I did. They are very comfortable and they even fit well in my shoes with relaxing the laces a little. I love to run and I wasn&#x27;t able to for a while because of the pain. I&#x27;m able to run again and that alone deserves the 5 stars</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and cushiony. I&#x27;ve worn them for long walks and all day at work.</li>
            <li> Very helpful to align toes and relieve bunion pain. My wife had been using a bunion &amp;#34;splint&amp;#34; at night but it began to hurt her. This product saved her having a surgery and the lengthy recovery period.</li>
            <li> Great to wear when you expect to be on your feet or walking for a while. I use the larger version that goes over the big toe most often.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this product &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; better than any others that I&#x27;ve tried.  The package includes 2 toe spacers and 2 toe spacers/bunion protector.  Both items fit well, are soft, and really relieve pain.&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the reviews, and this was the product that received the most positive reviews, including the Footsmart site, which didn&#x27;t have any product with high reviews for bunion pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It will take time to see if using these &amp;#34;protectors&amp;#34; &amp;#34;self-correct&amp;#34; the alignment.&lt;br /&gt;They are a comfortable gel, which questions their longevity. However, one barely notices/feels them on the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;For me it was not a pain issue, but a numbness sensation in the area beneath the big toe, near the ball of the foot, where the base of the toe bone is adjacent to the longer foot/big toe bone.  Please excuse the lack of correct anatomical terms.</li>
            <li> They feel a little strange when you first use them, but they&#x27;re really soft and comfortable, and if your feet are as crummy as mine are, they really do help keep toes from mashing into one another.  I just rinse them off every night and use them again the next day -- great little product!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like them as I did think they were too pliable</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Use these while I&#x27;m not super active and having both options of over the gig toe/between toes is helpful.  Soft, soft material that&#x27;s eay to clean.  Bought these after trying CorrectToes,which didn&#x27;t work for me at all, due to the shape and hard material (even after modification, so I sent it back).</li>
            <li> The material is very soft and the toe separators fit perfectly to my second toe. The bunion protectors can help me reduce the pain on the big boney bunion I have.</li>
            <li> I have bunions on both feet, the one on my right foot is worse.  I dont worry too much about it but recently,  whenever I wear my sneakers to exercise , I get pain.  The pain usually starts when I go to bed and its excruciating.  When I dont wear the sneakers its okay. Finding a suitable footwear to exercise was an exercise in futility.  I couldn&#x27;t find any exercise footwear that was bunion friendly.  I checked online and found DenadaDance #1Bunion relief, I read the reviews and found that they were the best, so I ordered it. I used the big toe protector and put on my sneakers, went and exercise.  It was so comfortable, it fitted easily in my sneahers, was not uncomfortable. That night I waited for the pain, no pain. The entire week I waited and no pain. I am sold, this thing really works. Thank you! I was so worried that I would have to stop my walking exercise. I would recommend this product to anyone with bunions.</li>
            <li> So comfy, so painless, and so effective. haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are worth the money, they are high quality and work especially when if you wear socks or house slippers, or any shoe (that covers the plastic. Not overly thick, I can still wear these with shoes or just around the house. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helped me run a half marathon, thought I wasn&#x27;t going to do it. Still wearing it daily, comfortable inside your shoe, you forget you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> Update: the manufacturer contacted me and refunded my money. I have upgraded the rating to 3 stars due to the great customer service.  BUYER BEWARE! These did not help my feet at all. I tried to return them and Amazon says they are not eligible for return. It states very clearly in the product title that there is a 100% satisfaction guarantee, and if you are not satisfied, there is a no-hassle return policy. That is what enticed me to purchased the product. FALSE ADVERTISING. BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> I purchased these to keep my big toe and second toe separated, not so much to relieve bunion pain. So far they are working. I wear them at night and in shoes during the day. They relieve the pain under my second toe by keeping it from laying on top of my big toe. Sometimes I use the toe separator and sometimes the separator attached to the bunion guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing these off and on for the past two months or so, and must say I&#x27;ve been quite surprised with how effective they are! My bunion pain went away after about 2 weeks of consistent use, and can wear them all day without much discomfort. However, they can be a bit uncomfortable after prolonged use with tight shoes or socks, but I highly recommend them if you&#x27;ve got bunions!</li>
            <li> great product. relieved pain of my bunion.  I forgot I had it on.  Gave it 4 stars because it is too large to wear with shoes, so it actually causes more pressure with shoes.  I &#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone though.</li>
            <li> This is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing.  As soon as I put this over my bunion so the divider was between my big toe and the next one, and after I put my shoe on, I could barely walk because of the pain.  The pain came from the toe divider which is way too big for my foot (even though I&#x27;m a size 8 women&#x27;s).  The problem is that the divider is too wide and too tall.  Clearly this should be available in different sizes, or the toe divider should just be smaller in general.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of useful items which you cannot find in the local drug store. Gel separators are nice &amp; thick and hold their shape. My mother gets a lot of relief when using these. I will likely purchase another set but so far they have lasted so well that I&#x27;ve not needed to replace them. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife who&#x27;s suffering from the bunion pain in both her feet. Quite amazing how these relieved some of the pain!!</li>
            <li> Wow! These actually work.  I tried these and within an hour my foot felt much better.  I usually wear them after the work day. I stand all day and walk everywhere.  When I get home I put these on until bedtime.  No need for any unless pain medicine. The Big toe protector works good, but a little hard to conceal with a pair of flats. Buy them.  Much better than suffering the pain.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with bunion relief and strengthening muscles in toes!</li>
            <li> whatever the problem - it will solve it.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product a 5 star just for the big toe protectors. But I could not use the bunion relief pads in my shoes; because of the size and angle of my bunions, the protector portion tended to &amp;#34;crinkle&amp;#34; a bit. And at night, as soft as they are, they were &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; and came off. BUT the toe spacers/protectors are the VERY BEST I&#x27;ve EVER used...and I&#x27;ve used these products for years. I walk extensively for exercise--3 to 4 miles a day--and ALWAYS wear the DenadaDance protectors. They are great in my dress shoes too.  After several weeks of constant use, I am very much aware that my right foot big toe, which previously crossed over the 2nd toe without a separator, tends to keep its distance!  Oh--and did I mention that the material is so very soft...and easy to clean?  I&#x27;m sold!    Update: after several weeks of continued wear, I would now rate this produce FIVE STAR without any reservations! The protectors that didn&#x27;t work for me--well, I clipped off the bunion portion..and now wear them at night while the spacers dry. Since I wear those spacers every single day from morning til night, I usually wash them and let them dry overnight.  So the &amp;#34;altered&amp;#34; bunion protectors take their place as toe spacers for the night!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything else out there over the years!</li>
            <li> Yes, I got pain relief!&lt;br /&gt;My pain was not on the bunion itself, but in the ball of the foot.&lt;br /&gt;Made some shoes a bit more tight, but not impossible to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I can wear them all day.&lt;br /&gt;My issue is more hallux valgus, but the bunion protector with toe spacer is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, the products arrived a clear, small zip lock bag, with only a barcode on the outside. Due to this, I could only presume they were not new.</li>
            <li> The toe spacer is comfortable to wear.  I was able to wear it all day the first time.</li>
            <li> These are soooo soft and squishy you can easily forget you are wearing them. I do not know if these work because my wife is stubborn and refused to wear these after a few days. She said they made her foot hurt worse. I told her that likely the pain she was feeling was the toe starting to move back where it should be but oh well I am not a DR. I guess it will just cost more money down the road when she is enough pain that she will see a DR. Then it will likely be too late for a product like this to work :(</li>
            <li> Both the spacer and protector helped my bunion pain a lot!</li>
