            <li>Excellent price and the item was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant, and good price</li>
            <li>Good product, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant, I don&#x27;t like anti antiperspirants, prefer just to sweat it out, and this lets me do just that.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t go on all goopy or cakey, and lasts for a good period of time.</li>
            <li>but I bought this one because it had a good price</li>
            <li>The smell is so good that people often comment on my scent even when I&#x27;m wearing this with no cologne or bodyspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really good deodorant.</li>
            <li>this is good</li>
            <li>When I wear the Swagger, I have good days.</li>
            <li>Omg this deodorant smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>Scent is good.</li>
            <li>this stuff just smells good.. and the twin pack is a really good deal...</li>
            <li>I smell good.</li>
            <li>Hey everyone, come smell how good I smell.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I sweat a lot, but I do sweat and after 2 hours this deodorant gives off a strong smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell of Swagger is a very nice smell and many girls have noticed who happen to get close to my pits.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent!</li>
            <li>The smell is great, easy to put and washed out.  </li>
            <li>This is the gel kind- not the Antiperspirant, The description does not state this and the packaging does not convey..</li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save makes the price nice.</li>
            <li>came in perfect brand new condition.</li>
            <li>The absolute best but for A LOT more money is the Kiehls Deoderant.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff with the right smell, at a good price.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, washes off easy, stays on while you sweat, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>The look on their faces when I tell them that it&#x27;s Old Spice Deodorant is PRICELESS!!!</li>
            <li>This deodoant so far has worked the best for my son.</li>
            <li>I like this product which I first bought in 5-pack of the 3.25 oz size at Costco for a really great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like a very, very light aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better deal here with S&amp;S (2 for $6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the smell on him.</li>
            <li>Wanting to be able sweat like a pig and smell like a god?  </li>
            <li>What could make it better?  </li>
            <li>, this feels a bit more \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; on my underarm hair after a while and starts to bug me sometimes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always notice it, but it seems like it mostly happens if I re-apply this after working out.</li>
            <li>Most of all I like this deodorant</li>
            <li>What can I say, I love the smell of my hubby&#x27;s puts when he wears this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn your pits like some more alcohol-y deo sticks do.  </li>
            <li>The latest order I have hasn&#x27;t seemed to hold up as well.</li>
            <li>After the end of my work day, I would have to apply more before going to the gym, and after about an hour of working out, the protection just wasn&#x27;t there anymore.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this on my husband and he loves the protection it gives him.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this more than 5 starts.  </li>
            <li>so I am glad I found it on here.  </li>
            <li>Ladies love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>Remember this blue gel is the best,</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good price.</li>
            <li>This is one of many great Old Spice products.  </li>
            <li>What Can I say, it&#x27;s&#x27; OLD Spice and it works great.  </li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m happy and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m a clean person</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>deodorant easily lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>All day I Feel easily.</li>
            <li>I like this version as the smell is not to strong</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any strong body odors or anything and shower 2 times a day, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Sometimes, like when I use this fine product, I do not.</li>
            <li>I have received 2 - 30oz deodorants, that are huge and work just fine.</li>
            <li>Applies on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately we found this one.  </li>
            <li>I love Old Spice deodorant since it makes me smell nice and helps hide any after workout funk</li>
            <li>Thanks Again Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>an last all day very nice product</li>
            <li>My son was using a different scent that we loved and it seems to have been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Overall good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It smells good, lasts a long time, cheap.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li>buy it if you want to smell good for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for the past 8 years because it&#x27;s inexpensive, effective, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong upon first application, but eventually calms down and is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Leaves me fresh smelling and works well.</li>
            <li>Masculine without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>son recommended; he&#x27;s right, does the job</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is truly the first product that actually  covers up the odor totally and replaces it with a light, pleasant, masculine, clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>He is a mechanic and gets pretty sweaty and gross during the Florida summertime, however this keeps him smelling kind of decent.  </li>
            <li>Man loves this, and he smells Fabulous when he uses Old Spice Zone Collection</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s an avid runner and sometimes works outdoors</li>
            <li>so he re applies probably more than necessary, and it&#x27;s given him a rash before.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>this should do well for you ;)</li>
            <li>going through many drug-store brands that are cheaper and more expensive, the one I really like the most is:&lt;br /&gt;Degree</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that actually keeps my boyfriend from sweating and keeps him smelling delicious all day long</li>
            <li>This is one of my two favorite Old Spice scents; I typically alternate between Swagger and Pure Sport.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s still a great product, but if you sweat heavily, the \\&quot;Sweat Defense\\&quot; line of Red Zone products may be something to considering trying out, as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t, not so much.</li>
            <li>I mean, really good.</li>
            <li>I like this scent better than any other.</li>
            <li>I bought this twin pack because it was a great price, and Old Spice Red Zone products are the only ones that have consistently kept me stinky-free all day long.</li>
            <li>; Old Spice has come a long way with there line of new products; from body washes / sprays / deodorants; I am sure you to will find a scent</li>
            <li>After not finding this particular flavor the last few times I&#x27;ve checked retail stores, I was very pleased to see it sold in a 2-pack on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old spice fan and really like the swagger scent.</li>
            <li>This is a much more convenient and cost-effective way to purchase that&#x27;s not available at the stores I shop at.</li>
            <li>Well you&#x27;ve found the right product, the next step is to buy it and use it.  </li>
            <li>Deodorant is all about matching something that meshes the way you naturally smell, and if you&#x27;re pure irish</li>
            <li>and he told me it was Old Spice Swagger deodorant.  </li>
            <li>i would prefer it over my old axe deodorant</li>
            <li>you use Old Spice, grab it while you can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the old saying goes......</li>
            <li>I needed to add a few things to my order to get free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Spice masks my natural man scent for a generous period of time</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smell of the Swagger scented products, so this deodorant stick is still a hit as far as she&#x27;s concerned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And now I realize, wow...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Old Spice Swagger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since I was 11 years old because puberty.</li>
            <li>and if you already got that Prime action, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but bought the wrong one so gave these to my brother.</li>
            <li>that white stuff, ugh, can&#x27;t get it out of my pits and the clear gel is like someone sneezed in in there.  </li>
            <li>Apparently I have lost the ability to learn from my mistakes.</li>
            <li>Once again, Old Spice comes through with Red Zone Swagger.  </li>
            <li>Big Old Spice fan.</li>
            <li>I usually am a big fan of old spice products, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the product label and description (even though it says \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; on them twice), and I bought this without realizing that Old Spice makes both an anti-perspirant plus deodorant as well as JUST a deodorant under their Red Zone moniker.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh, a little sporty, a little like cologne, without smelling too much like soap or body wash.  </li>

            <li> in all, it&#x27;s still a great product, but if you sweat heavily, the \\&quot;Sweat Defense\\&quot; line of Red Zone products may be something to considering trying out, as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t, not so much.</li>
            <li> I mean, really good.</li>
            <li> I like this scent better than any other.</li>
            <li> I bought this twin pack because it was a great price, and Old Spice Red Zone products are the only ones that have consistently kept me stinky-free all day long.</li>
            <li> ; Old Spice has come a long way with there line of new products; from body washes / sprays / deodorants; I am sure you to will find a scent</li>
            <li> After not finding this particular flavor the last few times I&#x27;ve checked retail stores, I was very pleased to see it sold in a 2-pack on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old spice fan and really like the swagger scent.</li>
            <li> This is a much more convenient and cost-effective way to purchase that&#x27;s not available at the stores I shop at.</li>
            <li> Well you&#x27;ve found the right product, the next step is to buy it and use it.  </li>
            <li> Deodorant is all about matching something that meshes the way you naturally smell, and if you&#x27;re pure irish</li>
            <li> and he told me it was Old Spice Swagger deodorant.  </li>
            <li> i would prefer it over my old axe deodorant</li>
            <li> you use Old Spice, grab it while you can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the old saying goes......</li>
            <li> I needed to add a few things to my order to get free shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old Spice masks my natural man scent for a generous period of time</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell of the Swagger scented products, so this deodorant stick is still a hit as far as she&#x27;s concerned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And now I realize, wow...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Old Spice Swagger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since I was 11 years old because puberty.</li>
            <li> and if you already got that Prime action, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but bought the wrong one so gave these to my brother.</li>
            <li> that white stuff, ugh, can&#x27;t get it out of my pits and the clear gel is like someone sneezed in in there.  </li>
            <li> Apparently I have lost the ability to learn from my mistakes.</li>
            <li> Once again, Old Spice comes through with Red Zone Swagger.  </li>
            <li> Big Old Spice fan.</li>
            <li> I usually am a big fan of old spice products, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the product label and description (even though it says \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; on them twice), and I bought this without realizing that Old Spice makes both an anti-perspirant plus deodorant as well as JUST a deodorant under their Red Zone moniker.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh, a little sporty, a little like cologne, without smelling too much like soap or body wash.  </li>
            <li> Was that the tail end of the 3.25 oz size discontinued because of the TSA 3.0 oz restrictions, or perhaps the new, smaller size is a hidden price hike by reducing the package contents?</li>
            <li> The gel is not as long lasting as the solid.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell would las at least 8 hours, but really seems to only last around 4.</li>
            <li> and we ended up talking a bit...not to sound too weird, but after a minute or two I asked him what the scent was that he was wearing (either as deodorant or cologne)</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to use those up, and Costco has never carried it since.</li>
            <li> It has a long shelf life, so I bought a bunch of these to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found another that lasts as long as this.</li>
            <li> I woke up smelling like a monkey.</li>
            <li> read carefully, this is only the deodorant, not anti-perspirant</li>
            <li> This is not clearly labeled.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the plain old &amp;#34;I&#x27;m just deodorant&amp;#34; style.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Gel Anti-Perspirants/Deodorants, where we live in Australia, they are very hard to get</li>
            <li> def recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t seem to like any other brand.  </li>
            <li> This is the blue hard stick which I used to not like because it felt slimy, but i think they have updated it because I don&#x27;t get that with this product.</li>
            <li> 1 deodorant always seems to last me at least 1-2 months</li>
            <li> It has actually been a slight challange finding this in some supermarkets lately</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started wearing &amp;#34;Swagger&amp;#34;, I strut like Jax Teller from Sons of Anarchy and have the ladies chasing me down relentlessly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong type this is clear; my fault.</li>
            <li> - I was trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Maybe not best for sensitive pits.</li>
            <li> I took a shower, dried off and put on this deoderant and went to bed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for a few years.</li>
            <li> Swag on little bro, Swag on!</li>
            <li> He usually uses Fiji</li>
            <li> Usually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a hard to find at stores.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Weak ass deodorant.</li>
            <li> Wow the smell is crazy!!</li>
            <li> Rather uncomfortable when it does happen, and the reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4-star rating instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Silly me.</li>
            <li> This deoderant fails after 2 hours...</li>
            <li> IT FAILED IN MY SLEEP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m stuck with a two pack.</li>
            <li> but when I work out at the gym, I sweat and sometimes it stinks.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me from smelling bad while working in the office.</li>

            <li> I like this product which I first bought in 5-pack of the 3.25 oz size at Costco for a really great price. It took me a long time to use those up, and Costco has never carried it since. Was that the tail end of the 3.25 oz size discontinued because of the TSA 3.0 oz restrictions, or perhaps the new, smaller size is a hidden price hike by reducing the package contents? It has a long shelf life, so I bought a bunch of these to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though - this is NOT the antiperspirant variant of Swagger. It&#x27;s the plain old &amp;#34;I&#x27;m just deodorant&amp;#34; style. This is the second time I have ordered this thinking it was antiperspirant. Apparently I have lost the ability to learn from my mistakes. &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Good deodorant, and good price</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m a clean person but when I work out at the gym, I sweat and sometimes it stinks.  A guy walked by that was working out next to me and we ended up talking a bit...not to sound too weird, but after a minute or two I asked him what the scent was that he was wearing (either as deodorant or cologne) and he told me it was Old Spice Swagger deodorant.  I picked this up at my drugstore (for $5.99) the next day.  It&#x27;s a much better deal here with S&amp;S (2 for $6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly the first product that actually  covers up the odor totally and replaces it with a light, pleasant, masculine, clean fresh scent.  It&#x27;s almost like a very, very light aftershave.  Note: this version is not an antiperspirant, it&#x27;s only a deodorant (which is what I prefer when I&#x27;m working out and sweating at the gym...I use another unscented antiperspirant only for work or going out)</li>
            <li> Great deodorant with a great smell.  My boyfriend loves it and I love the smell on him.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this stuff and smells great all day.</li>
            <li> Only problem, it does not last.  I wish the smell would las at least 8 hours, but really seems to only last around 4.</li>
            <li> Looking to attract the ladies?  Wanting to be able sweat like a pig and smell like a god?  Well you&#x27;ve found the right product, the next step is to buy it and use it.  The smell of Swagger is a very nice smell and many girls have noticed who happen to get close to my pits.  I&#x27;ve found that using Swagger with scents such as Fierce by Abercrombie makes for a smell no woman can resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the deodorant does what it is supposed to.  It goes on easy, washes off easy, stays on while you sweat, and smells great.  Basically everything you&#x27;re looking for in deodorant.</li>
            <li> Good product, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and the item was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have to beat the ladies off every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> product smells and does what it is suppose to do as described. i would prefer it over my old axe deodorant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant.  It smells like Swagger.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I thought I would never get a girlfriend. I hadn&#x27;t even kissed a girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started wearing &amp;#34;Swagger&amp;#34;, I strut like Jax Teller from Sons of Anarchy and have the ladies chasing me down relentlessly. I now run through girls like Drano.</li>
            <li> great product. my bf loves the smell and i do too! def recommend to other people. came in perfect brand new condition.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;If you use Old Spice, grab it while you can.&lt;br /&gt;As the old saying goes......nothing last forever.</li>
            <li> I needed to add a few things to my order to get free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;My Man loves this, and he smells Fabulous when he uses Old Spice Zone Collection Swagger.&lt;br /&gt;This was a hard to find at stores.&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent price, GREAT smelling.&lt;br /&gt;  We will keep buying it from Amazon&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Again Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Good deodorant, I don&#x27;t like anti antiperspirants, prefer just to sweat it out, and this lets me do just that. Old Spice masks my natural man scent for a generous period of time, doesn&#x27;t go on all goopy or cakey, and lasts for a good period of time.</li>
            <li> Once again, Old Spice comes through with Red Zone Swagger.  This is one of many great Old Spice products.  Yes!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband but he hates the smell of this one. He usually uses Fiji but I bought this one because it had a good price - I was trying to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t swagger when I wear it, but it does keep me from smelling like an ogre.</li>
            <li> What Can I say, it&#x27;s&#x27; OLD Spice and it works great.  I like this version as the smell is not to strong and it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so no yellow pits.  Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save I don&#x27;t have to worry about every running out.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t seem to like any other brand.  He is a mechanic and gets pretty sweaty and gross during the Florida summertime, however this keeps him smelling kind of decent.  It&#x27;s pretty strong upon first application, but eventually calms down and is pleasant.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Applies on smooth.  Lasts the entire day.  Washes off easily.  What could make it better?  Find it on sale and get extras.</li>
            <li> I bought this twin pack because it was a great price, and Old Spice Red Zone products are the only ones that have consistently kept me stinky-free all day long. However, I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the product label and description (even though it says \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; on them twice), and I bought this without realizing that Old Spice makes both an anti-perspirant plus deodorant as well as JUST a deodorant under their Red Zone moniker. So shame on me for breaking the cardinal rule of not reading closely and just assuming a Red Zone product would be like the others I&#x27;ve been using (I blame peer pressure during an Amazon lightning sale!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my [[ASIN:B0017U074G Red Zone \\&quot;Sweat Defense\\&quot;]] anti-perspirant and deodorant, this feels a bit more \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; on my underarm hair after a while and starts to bug me sometimes. I don&#x27;t always notice it, but it seems like it mostly happens if I re-apply this after working out. Rather uncomfortable when it does happen, and the reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4-star rating instead of 5. My wife loves the smell of the Swagger scented products, so this deodorant stick is still a hit as far as she&#x27;s concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s still a great product, but if you sweat heavily, the \\&quot;Sweat Defense\\&quot; line of Red Zone products may be something to considering trying out, as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of my two favorite Old Spice scents; I typically alternate between Swagger and Pure Sport.  The smell is so good that people often comment on my scent even when I&#x27;m wearing this with no cologne or bodyspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant easily lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve never found another that lasts as long as this.</li>
            <li> really good deodorant. I really like it. no smell, no spot. All day I Feel easily. Most of all I like this deodorant</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen.  He loves it.  But it is just deodorant, no antiperspirant.  This is good stuff with the right smell, at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love Old Spice deodorant since it makes me smell nice and helps hide any after workout funk I might have brewed up.</li>
            <li> Big Old Spice fan. I like this scent better than any other. This is only deodorant, not anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> this is good I used an the morning  an last all day very nice product</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love the smell of my hubby&#x27;s puts when he wears this. He&#x27;s an avid runner and sometimes works outdoors so he re applies probably more than necessary, and it&#x27;s given him a rash before. He will take a month off and use Dove and then come back. Maybe not best for sensitive pits.</li>
            <li> When I wear the Swagger, I have good days. When I don&#x27;t, not so much. It&#x27;s almost as if my pit condition foretells my day. Today, for example, was an &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; day. And now I realize, wow... I didn&#x27;t have Swagger under my arms. Silly me. Tomorrow I will wear the Swagger once again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the one you need in your daily life.</li>
            <li> Weak ass deodorant. I stunk after two hours. I&#x27;m not a stinky guy, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t stop any odor.  I threw both sticks away and went back to speed stick.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I smell. Sometimes, like when I use this fine product, I do not.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, easy to put and washed out.  Oh and doesn&#x27;t leave any visible residue on the pits!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong type this is clear; my fault.</li>
            <li> Buying this two pack saved me a couple bucks. It is what it is, deodorant, two pack, save some money. I have prime so shipping isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old spice fan and really like the swagger scent. This is the blue hard stick which I used to not like because it felt slimy, but i think they have updated it because I don&#x27;t get that with this product.</li>
            <li> Swagger? Cant have swagger if you smell like a chimpanzee. This deoderant fails after 2 hours... I took a shower, dried off and put on this deoderant and went to bed... I woke up smelling like a monkey. IT FAILED IN MY SLEEP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swaggerless.... wish I could rate it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, but got this for my brother. We both like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white streak, but it can leave a blue streak stain on white T-shirts.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this for my brother who is away for school. When I asked him what items he would need he requested this deodorant specifically! I guess he loves it so i&#x27;m happy and the shipping was super fast. I ordered it on October 22nd and he received it on the 24th. Swag on little bro, Swag on!</li>
            <li> My son was using a different scent that we loved and it seems to have been discontinued.  Fortunately we found this one.  PLEASE DON&#x27;T DISCONTINUE!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for the past 8 years because it&#x27;s inexpensive, effective, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Irritates the skin. Can&#x27;t use...Be warned.</li>
            <li> Great scented deodorant; Old Spice has come a long way with there line of new products; from body washes / sprays / deodorants; I am sure you to will find a scent / kind for you!</li>
            <li> This is a great deo that my wife and I both like the smell of.  Smells fresh, a little sporty, a little like cologne, without smelling too much like soap or body wash.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your pits like some more alcohol-y deo sticks do.  After not finding this particular flavor the last few times I&#x27;ve checked retail stores, I was very pleased to see it sold in a 2-pack on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Leaves me fresh smelling and works well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Gel Anti-Perspirants/Deodorants, where we live in Australia, they are very hard to get and I&#x27;ve always gotten him just one brand/type much more expensive than buying bulk - these are great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for a few years. This is a much more convenient and cost-effective way to purchase that&#x27;s not available at the stores I shop at.</li>
            <li> Omg this deodorant smells sooo good. This is the only deodorant that actually keeps my boyfriend from sweating and keeps him smelling delicious all day long</li>
            <li> This is not clearly labeled.  This is the gel kind- not the Antiperspirant, The description does not state this and the packaging does not convey..</li>
            <li> Keeps me from smelling bad while working in the office. Usually. The latest order I have hasn&#x27;t seemed to hold up as well.</li>
            <li> I usually am a big fan of old spice products, but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I wouldn&#x27;t say I sweat a lot, but I do sweat and after 2 hours this deodorant gives off a strong smell that isn&#x27;t very pleasant. Unfortunately I&#x27;m stuck with a two pack. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The gel is not as long lasting as the solid.</li>
            <li> Snooty people ask me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing.  The look on their faces when I tell them that it&#x27;s Old Spice Deodorant is PRICELESS!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! Works throughout the day. Pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from being smelly and my wife approves.  That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m looking for when I buy deodorant for myself.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells good, lasts a long time, cheap.  buy it if you want to smell good for a long time.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save makes the price nice. Scent is good. Masculine without being overwhelming. No antiperspirant to clog your sweatholes with poison.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I have received 2 - 30oz deodorants, that are huge and work just fine. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a product lover and like to try different things to find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; one. What I didn&#x27;t like about this deodorant is that it has a funky smell after a while. It is definitely not 24 hour protection. After the end of my work day, I would have to apply more before going to the gym, and after about an hour of working out, the protection just wasn&#x27;t there anymore. I don&#x27;t have any strong body odors or anything and shower 2 times a day, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through many drug-store brands that are cheaper and more expensive, the one I really like the most is:&lt;br /&gt;Degree Adrenaline Series - Slightly more expensive, but none of the issues mentioned above. The absolute best but for A LOT more money is the Kiehls Deoderant.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this on my husband and he loves the protection it gives him.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t melted or anything and it smells great.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t expect it to be deoderant i thought it was the uhh antisperant, but w..e still works making the sweat not smell like sweat. lol</li>
            <li> this stuff just smells good.. and the twin pack is a really good deal...1 deodorant always seems to last me at least 1-2 months</li>
            <li> son recommended; he&#x27;s right, does the job</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but bought the wrong one so gave these to my brother.</li>
            <li> Been my go to for deodorant for years.  I wish I could give this more than 5 starts.  I have actually had people ask if I was wearing cologne before.  Nope, just my Swag!  It has actually been a slight challange finding this in some supermarkets lately so I am glad I found it on here.  I just added it every 3 months to my &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;www.amazon.com/gp/subscribe-and-save/details/\\&quot;&gt;Subscribe and Save&lt;/a&gt;.</li>
            <li> read carefully, this is only the deodorant, not anti-perspirant</li>
            <li> Teenage son swears by it!</li>
            <li> Wow the smell is crazy!!</li>
            <li> I smell good. I mean, really good. Hey everyone, come smell how good I smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Old Spice Swagger. Ladies love it. I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice since I was 11 years old because puberty.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodoant so far has worked the best for my son. Also the sent is not as overpowering as Axe!</li>
            <li> Smell lasts all day. No antiprespirent for skin allergrns. Overall good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Swagger, for the ladies, or the fellas, or your mom, or your self... I think we all know this smells great.  Compliments on my stench all the time wearing this stuff.  All the time.  And this twin pack is $2 cheaper than in the store and if you already got that Prime action, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep one in my bag, at work and an extra at home just incase I forget to pick some up.  Remember this blue gel is the best, that white stuff, ugh, can&#x27;t get it out of my pits and the clear gel is like someone sneezed in in there.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s my favorite.  Deodorant is all about matching something that meshes the way you naturally smell, and if you&#x27;re pure irish this should do well for you ;)</li>
