            <li>bought the auburn color retail - love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Just be aware you will need eyebrow hair for this to work to the best of its ability.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li>Great for an easy fill-in.</li>
            <li>I ever tryed its amazing for eyebrows and mascara trust me and buy it</li>
            <li>Makes eyebrows look amazing.</li>
            <li>Good price but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Honestly, what is this?</li>
            <li>Nice idea</li>
            <li>With that being said, it is really easy to use and get used to, so if you give yourself one &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; session you&#x27;ll be good to go and will nail application every time.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang  of it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Perfect application &amp; looks much more realistic than eye pencil.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural and covers gray and lighter colored brows like magic!!!  </li>
            <li>It would be good for someone with light eyebrows, but it does not work well for those of us with thinning eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>smile HAPPY camper....</li>
            <li>This is far and away the best!</li>
            <li>I have very fine eyebrows and the brush wouldn&#x27;t even pick up the hairs.</li>
            <li>A powder or pencil is probably more suitable.</li>
            <li>The darkest color was very light</li>
            <li>I showed it to my hairdresser yesterday who has very light brows</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>for what it does and the price is better than $22 for benefit&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Maybelline</li>
            <li>I love about this</li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>I have gray in my brows and this is SO much better than plucking them, so</li>
            <li>Omg I love this brow mascara...</li>
            <li>The Mommy Makeup works sooo much better in directing the product.  </li>
            <li>As I become more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; ok age I find that my brows are thinner the bushy brows I had in HS and college..  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This gel is a nice way to highlight those light colored eyebrows that aren&#x27;t noticed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic  product!</li>
            <li>anyway I will be buying more...</li>
            <li>But, let me say again how satisfied I am with it.  </li>
            <li>I thank the seller sincerely for delivering this to me ahead of schedule and fully intact.</li>
            <li>So I would love to hear their thinking on that.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;M SATISFIED WITH IT.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job than I have ever been able to do with a pencil.</li>
            <li>Its between like and love with this product.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a better one.</li>
            <li>It would work much better on someone with more hair on brows.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser colors my brows with my hair dye when she colors my hair, but even though the color is permanent it only lasts 2-3 weeks on my brows, so this is perfect between visits.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my eyebrows and the I tryed it on my lashes and it work better</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brow products.</li>
            <li>Much better and easier than eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over-accentuate my brows and it gives them just a bit more fullness where I want it.</li>
            <li>Got this product at store and love it.</li>
            <li>I put it over top.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited and purchased two,</li>
            <li>So the idea is a pretty good one.</li>
            <li>The special brush that comes along with it makes application very easy and precise!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use like better than a pencil.</li>
            <li>This product makes my morning routine go so much more quickly because I don&#x27;t have to spend all my time in the mirror trying to make sure my brows look perfect and even with each other.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s easy to remove when you wash your face.</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and makes my brows thicker and fuller and helps shape the.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love any kind of brow gel/mousse, a lot of times, in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work</li>
            <li>makes my eyebrows look more full and also keeps them in place</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make them any thicker, nor does it make your brows look more full.</li>
            <li>It was fine until I tried to take my makeup off at night.</li>
            <li>If you want bold, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to fill in my brows much, but I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>so my eyebrows are light compared to haircolor).</li>
            <li>I am blonde and makes eyebrows look great.</li>
            <li>So far so good, will reorder.</li>
            <li>Maybe Maybelline just needed something unique to make this brow product stand out from all others.</li>
            <li>For the first time I look like I have full eyebrows, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I apply this sculpting brow gel, I use a cotton swab to carefully clean up any residue.</li>
            <li>I like the special brush that comes with this product</li>
            <li>Easy and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast to use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a African American with fair skinned so this color really looks good on me.  </li>
            <li>I have had good results with the wear of this product; once it&#x27;s dry, it stays put.</li>
            <li>I just fill it in a little more with a pencil and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>In case you can&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this &amp;#34;eyebrow drama&amp;#34; by Maybelline!!!  </li>
            <li>Next, I spray my regular brow brush (NOT this product&#x27;s brush) with a very light misting of hair spray and give my brows a good shaping to set them in place.</li>
            <li>Worth returning?  </li>
            <li>I think the key to getting good results with this is to not use too much.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>and she was going to run right out and buy a tube for herself.</li>
            <li>My hair is dark brown, and the Deep Brown color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend and I will surely order again.</li>
            <li>I did notice that there was a &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34; fee which the exact amount I would have paid for shipping.  </li>
            <li>This is the first, I&#x27;m surprise, but if it worked for others.....</li>
            <li>I love it too in that my hairs on my brows are turning white and</li>
            <li>I was glad to see Maybelline give this a try, because I confess to having used regular mascara on my brows to thicken them up and keep the look in place.</li>
            <li>I am so, so glad that this product is back.  </li>
            <li>: I do my eyeshadow first, including application of the highlighting shade under my brows.</li>
            <li>I end up using eyebrow pencil first</li>
            <li>Other nice thing is that your brows stay put...groomed in place.</li>
            <li>it out the first time when you aren&#x27;t fully made up and ready to walk out the door, though, like I did.</li>
            <li>I agree with others who say that pretty much you need to use it in conjunction with your eye pencil.</li>
            <li>I do better on the right side vs the other which I tend to get goopy.</li>
            <li>is more of when i&#x27;m on the go and not much time to define the line etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>is that it actually makes my eyebrows look thicker (instead of filled in) because it colors/thickens each hair strand.</li>
            <li>It does not seems to do much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product really brings out the beauty of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just swipe and go and lasts for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my unruly light eyebrows and it does give just enough color to highlight without looking painted.  </li>
            <li>I still look like I don&#x27;t have much for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I know that one doesn’t use much but</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday, she loves how nice her brows look.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is not the best for those with thin brows such as mine.</li>
            <li>This is what I tried because I&#x27;ve tried so many other things before.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and have fine, sparce brows.</li>
            <li>Brown should have gotten black but it was okay</li>
            <li>congratulations, continue to order it, but it was packaged nicely and it came earlier than I expected..</li>
            <li>It was great and only cost $3 or $4 a tube, so I was very distressed when other companies started offering all sorts of brow covers that were not nearly as good or easy to use for 5 to 10 times the price.</li>
            <li>I love this little eyebrow gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, this is so much faster than my previous pencil and powder method.</li>
            <li>The product went on clumpy and I found myself having to do a lot of manipulation to make it look more natural and less clownish.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Maybelline New York Eyestudio Brow Drama.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy, simple and looks natural - will definitely purchase again, as long as I can find this shade again!  </li>
            <li>I with they would bring back the Define-a-Brow pencil in light blonde.</li>
            <li>this product solves the problem of the occasional grey hair and keeps the brows looking finely groomed and completely full all day long.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it looks so natural!  </li>
            <li>As a final step, I very carefully reapply a bit more of the highlighting eyeshadow underneath my brows and feather it in with my shadow brush to blend.</li>
            <li>I opened and it immediately felt much lighter than I had expected and I do think it had dried out a bit, since I put in some of my favorite liquid rejuvenator and it seemed like it was much heavier, and that the product had loosened up a bit.</li>
            <li>or if it&#x27;s a simple problem with the packaging of that certain bottle.</li>
            <li>The other is white and does not cover easily.</li>
            <li>this colorblind really natural.</li>
            <li>The ball makes it so you can&#x27;t direct where you want the product.  </li>
            <li>Produces natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It defines my brows and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Trying to not waste my money, I tried using it on my eyelashes which didn&#x27;t work either</li>
            <li>Mine are sparse but this does stay/last much longer than regular eyebrow pencil .</li>
            <li>Therefore, I don&#x27;t really have enough eyebrow hair for this product to grab onto.</li>
            <li>Natural looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li>She said it was natural looking and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes this gel minimally less than perfect is the weird brush.  </li>
            <li>After that drys, I use a small amount of this product with a light touch.</li>
            <li>I was so hopeful that this new eyebrow product would work like the commercial shows.</li>
            <li>The color is buildable, so one or two swishes for subtle definition, or several for a dramatic look- perfect for nearly nonexistent brows like mine.</li>
            <li>No ugly mess on the skin because this product only covers the brow hairs.  </li>
            <li>as i&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyebrows have thinned and have begun to grey entirely too soon.  </li>
            <li>Everything looks so natural, it was the quickest way to wake up my face, I am definitely adding this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little embarrasing first time using it</li>
            <li>ANd that worked pretty well, though I had to use a practically dry mascara brush to avoid a mess.</li>

            <li> This is far and away the best!</li>
            <li> I have very fine eyebrows and the brush wouldn&#x27;t even pick up the hairs.</li>
            <li> A powder or pencil is probably more suitable.</li>
            <li> The darkest color was very light</li>
            <li> I showed it to my hairdresser yesterday who has very light brows</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> for what it does and the price is better than $22 for benefit&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Maybelline</li>
            <li> I love about this</li>
            <li> Love this product....</li>
            <li> I have gray in my brows and this is SO much better than plucking them, so</li>
            <li> Omg I love this brow mascara...</li>
            <li> The Mommy Makeup works sooo much better in directing the product.  </li>
            <li> As I become more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; ok age I find that my brows are thinner the bushy brows I had in HS and college..  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This gel is a nice way to highlight those light colored eyebrows that aren&#x27;t noticed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  product!</li>
            <li> anyway I will be buying more...</li>
            <li> But, let me say again how satisfied I am with it.  </li>
            <li> I thank the seller sincerely for delivering this to me ahead of schedule and fully intact.</li>
            <li> So I would love to hear their thinking on that.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SATISFIED WITH IT.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job than I have ever been able to do with a pencil.</li>
            <li> Its between like and love with this product.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a better one.</li>
            <li> It would work much better on someone with more hair on brows.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser colors my brows with my hair dye when she colors my hair, but even though the color is permanent it only lasts 2-3 weeks on my brows, so this is perfect between visits.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my eyebrows and the I tryed it on my lashes and it work better</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brow products.</li>
            <li> Much better and easier than eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over-accentuate my brows and it gives them just a bit more fullness where I want it.</li>
            <li> Got this product at store and love it.</li>
            <li> I put it over top.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited and purchased two,</li>
            <li> So the idea is a pretty good one.</li>
            <li> The special brush that comes along with it makes application very easy and precise!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use like better than a pencil.</li>
            <li> This product makes my morning routine go so much more quickly because I don&#x27;t have to spend all my time in the mirror trying to make sure my brows look perfect and even with each other.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s easy to remove when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes my brows thicker and fuller and helps shape the.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love any kind of brow gel/mousse, a lot of times, in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work</li>
            <li> makes my eyebrows look more full and also keeps them in place</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make them any thicker, nor does it make your brows look more full.</li>
            <li> It was fine until I tried to take my makeup off at night.</li>
            <li> If you want bold, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to fill in my brows much, but I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> so my eyebrows are light compared to haircolor).</li>
            <li> I am blonde and makes eyebrows look great.</li>
            <li> So far so good, will reorder.</li>
            <li> Maybe Maybelline just needed something unique to make this brow product stand out from all others.</li>
            <li> For the first time I look like I have full eyebrows, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I apply this sculpting brow gel, I use a cotton swab to carefully clean up any residue.</li>
            <li> I like the special brush that comes with this product</li>
            <li> Easy and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a African American with fair skinned so this color really looks good on me.  </li>
            <li> I have had good results with the wear of this product; once it&#x27;s dry, it stays put.</li>
            <li> I just fill it in a little more with a pencil and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> In case you can&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this &amp;#34;eyebrow drama&amp;#34; by Maybelline!!!  </li>
            <li> Next, I spray my regular brow brush (NOT this product&#x27;s brush) with a very light misting of hair spray and give my brows a good shaping to set them in place.</li>
            <li> Worth returning?  </li>
            <li> I think the key to getting good results with this is to not use too much.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> and she was going to run right out and buy a tube for herself.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, and the Deep Brown color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend and I will surely order again.</li>
            <li> I did notice that there was a &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34; fee which the exact amount I would have paid for shipping.  </li>
            <li> This is the first, I&#x27;m surprise, but if it worked for others.....</li>
            <li> I love it too in that my hairs on my brows are turning white and</li>
            <li> I was glad to see Maybelline give this a try, because I confess to having used regular mascara on my brows to thicken them up and keep the look in place.</li>
            <li> I am so, so glad that this product is back.  </li>
            <li> : I do my eyeshadow first, including application of the highlighting shade under my brows.</li>
            <li> I end up using eyebrow pencil first</li>
            <li> Other nice thing is that your brows stay put...groomed in place.</li>
            <li> it out the first time when you aren&#x27;t fully made up and ready to walk out the door, though, like I did.</li>
            <li> I agree with others who say that pretty much you need to use it in conjunction with your eye pencil.</li>
            <li> I do better on the right side vs the other which I tend to get goopy.</li>
            <li> is more of when i&#x27;m on the go and not much time to define the line etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> is that it actually makes my eyebrows look thicker (instead of filled in) because it colors/thickens each hair strand.</li>
            <li> It does not seems to do much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product really brings out the beauty of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just swipe and go and lasts for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I used this for my unruly light eyebrows and it does give just enough color to highlight without looking painted.  </li>
            <li> I still look like I don&#x27;t have much for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I know that one doesn’t use much but</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday, she loves how nice her brows look.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is not the best for those with thin brows such as mine.</li>
            <li> This is what I tried because I&#x27;ve tried so many other things before.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and have fine, sparce brows.</li>
            <li> Brown should have gotten black but it was okay</li>
            <li> congratulations, continue to order it, but it was packaged nicely and it came earlier than I expected..</li>
            <li> It was great and only cost $3 or $4 a tube, so I was very distressed when other companies started offering all sorts of brow covers that were not nearly as good or easy to use for 5 to 10 times the price.</li>
            <li> I love this little eyebrow gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, this is so much faster than my previous pencil and powder method.</li>
            <li> The product went on clumpy and I found myself having to do a lot of manipulation to make it look more natural and less clownish.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Maybelline New York Eyestudio Brow Drama.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy, simple and looks natural - will definitely purchase again, as long as I can find this shade again!  </li>
            <li> I with they would bring back the Define-a-Brow pencil in light blonde.</li>
            <li> this product solves the problem of the occasional grey hair and keeps the brows looking finely groomed and completely full all day long.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it looks so natural!  </li>
            <li> As a final step, I very carefully reapply a bit more of the highlighting eyeshadow underneath my brows and feather it in with my shadow brush to blend.</li>
            <li> I opened and it immediately felt much lighter than I had expected and I do think it had dried out a bit, since I put in some of my favorite liquid rejuvenator and it seemed like it was much heavier, and that the product had loosened up a bit.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s a simple problem with the packaging of that certain bottle.</li>
            <li> The other is white and does not cover easily.</li>
            <li> this colorblind really natural.</li>
            <li> The ball makes it so you can&#x27;t direct where you want the product.  </li>
            <li> Produces natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It defines my brows and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Trying to not waste my money, I tried using it on my eyelashes which didn&#x27;t work either</li>
            <li> Mine are sparse but this does stay/last much longer than regular eyebrow pencil .</li>
            <li> Therefore, I don&#x27;t really have enough eyebrow hair for this product to grab onto.</li>
            <li> Natural looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li> She said it was natural looking and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes this gel minimally less than perfect is the weird brush.  </li>
            <li> After that drys, I use a small amount of this product with a light touch.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful that this new eyebrow product would work like the commercial shows.</li>
            <li> The color is buildable, so one or two swishes for subtle definition, or several for a dramatic look- perfect for nearly nonexistent brows like mine.</li>
            <li> No ugly mess on the skin because this product only covers the brow hairs.  </li>
            <li> as i&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyebrows have thinned and have begun to grey entirely too soon.  </li>
            <li> Everything looks so natural, it was the quickest way to wake up my face, I am definitely adding this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little embarrasing first time using it</li>
            <li> ANd that worked pretty well, though I had to use a practically dry mascara brush to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> May make your brows look a little messy if you don&#x27;t go back and clean up.</li>
            <li> It makes me crazy, so I normally fill in my brows lightly with a pencil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark blonde and bought soft brown.</li>
            <li> I really needed something like this to fill in the shady spots.</li>
            <li> Also, i had to order dark brown color because no black was offered.</li>
            <li> Most of the current brow products are designed to fill in missing brows, so they&#x27;re thick, messy and time-consuming to use and are overkill for my needs.  </li>
            <li> it looks so natural you would never believe a brush that shaped round would define the brows so well, and the arch...</li>
            <li> I found I didn&#x27;t have time to fill in my brows because I used powder/pencil making it a long process</li>
            <li> I have used for years Maybelline  mascara in the pink and green tube (brown/black) for a fairly natural covering on my white brow.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed not so much with the size of the brush like other people because I still have enough brows although it is true that it could have been smaller</li>
            <li> we will see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> This might have worked if there was any product in the tube....almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> Then I give it time to dry.</li>
            <li> and this isn&#x27;t quite dark enough</li>
            <li> but then when I tried to wash it off after only 4 hours about 10 eye brow hairs came off, this stuff is strange its like dried, caked, flaky coloring....</li>
            <li> I find it works fine on one of my crazy and whiskery eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were a little darker, but it works well</li>
            <li> It cover any grey hairs and keeps brows in place while not sticking to skin!!!</li>
            <li> Total waste of $6.99</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> To me, it makes the product harder to use rather than easier.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I did not like this product and am curious how this was put out and why it has 4 stars.</li>
            <li> but the fact that the container feels quite empty.</li>
            <li> My natural eyebrows were thick and bushy and I let someone trick me into getting them for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have thick perfectly marked eyebrows please stick to your eye pencil.</li>
            <li> (I dye by dark blonde hair black</li>
            <li> I even tried a liquid eyeliner that actually wasn&#x27;t bad if it was the right color., but it took a long time to get it</li>
            <li> The bottle I received (not sure if this is the same for everyone) seemed almost empty?</li>
            <li> I did order the other also</li>
            <li> That works, but I&#x27;m not sure it makes that big a difference.</li>
            <li> you can use an ordinary brush and get the same effect.</li>
            <li> , I went back to small brush with eyebrow powder</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected, but it still blends well.</li>
            <li> And the product left dark flakes of color on my skin bemeath the eyebrows that was hard</li>
            <li> Even though I have dark hair, my eyebrows don&#x27;t always show up in pictures.</li>
            <li> and they get too dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting my eyebrows arched for a long time and woke one morning and said no more....</li>
            <li> The brush is odd and can leave some clumps.</li>
            <li> Understated, not bold but does the trick to give some color to your brows.</li>
            <li> I hope the price goes down a little</li>
            <li> so the product just fills in what&#x27;s already there without making a mess.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several other products that sounded promising, but they always left me poorer and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice</li>
            <li> I agree with others that you must wipe the little blob off the tip before you apply.</li>
            <li> Not very pleased at all.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t forgiving once it has dried, and if you have to make any corrections you will have to remove the brow mascara and any underlying/surrounding makeup.</li>
            <li> all dried up.</li>
            <li> Was mine dried out?</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t get is the round ball applicator?</li>
            <li> Takes just a few seconds to use.</li>
            <li> The brush was poorly designed: too big &amp; round.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A LITTLE HARD TO WASH OFF OTHER THAN THAT,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty impossible to mess up your brows with this!</li>
            <li> That said one uses very little so it won’t maybe be a problem.</li>
            <li> And shipping was almost as expensive as the actual product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a flaw to the design</li>
            <li> This Maybelline is hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Makes brows hard.</li>
            <li> when I take out the brush it feels that there is hardly anything inside.</li>
            <li> I bought this brow mascara because after plucking my brows for a number of years (stupid thing to do because otherwise my brows would be very fashionable now)</li>
            <li> but the application sucks.</li>
            <li> I saw the MommyMakeup on Amazon for 18-20 bucks and thought that I&#x27;d like something less expensive.  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the ball end of the wand is awkward to use, and it makes the normal part of the wand virtually impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i get tired of putting powder on brows and my Anastasia brow</li>
            <li> FOREVER becasue of over plucking and getting the brows too thin and sparse.  </li>
            <li> I always used a brow pencil and was not happy because you can see the pencil mark on my brows.</li>
            <li> Not for thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have pencil thin brows</li>
            <li> they are now too thin and also because I had an accident at a child hitting my brow against a door so in the place of the wound</li>
            <li> I tried this product in the Blonde tint and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not impressive at ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> This product unfortunately did not do the job.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and sparse eyebrow hairs, so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for something to &amp;#34;fill</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed, I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Both brand have staying power, The Maybelline is a bit lighter than I&#x27;d prefer but the wand stinks.  </li>
            <li> This has an awkward wand that clumps--weirdest shape I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, but I&#x27;d like them to work it out and come up with an improved version based on feedback.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a horrible experience and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> I ended up tossing it as it streaked and was very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to get it on your eye brow without it getting all over your forehead.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve never ordered a product that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated the product itself.</li>
            <li> It clumps and looks horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The darkest color was very light (I dye by dark blonde hair black so my eyebrows are light compared to haircolor). The brush is odd and can leave some clumps. Good price but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little embarrasing first time using it</li>
            <li> I like this product. I bought it from Walmart and it worked okay. Sometimes i get tired of putting powder on brows and my Anastasia brow gel.&lt;br /&gt;This is more of when i&#x27;m on the go and not much time to define the line etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good for what it does and the price is better than $22 for benefit&#x27;s brand.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Maybelline</li>
            <li> I have fair eyebrows and always struggle with getting my eyebrows to show up, yet not look fake/cakey. I&#x27;ve been using the eyebrow wax/powder kits for years, but thought I&#x27;d try this and see how it compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this is that it actually makes my eyebrows look thicker (instead of filled in) because it colors/thickens each hair strand. For the first time I look like I have full eyebrows, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out the first time when you aren&#x27;t fully made up and ready to walk out the door, though, like I did. It isn&#x27;t forgiving once it has dried, and if you have to make any corrections you will have to remove the brow mascara and any underlying/surrounding makeup. With that being said, it is really easy to use and get used to, so if you give yourself one &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; session you&#x27;ll be good to go and will nail application every time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.... The best ever made and the delivery was so quick......</li>
            <li> Great brush tool. I only wish it were a little darker, but it works well and I only need to apply it once in the day. Great price too.</li>
            <li> junk. all dried up. whats with the &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; brush? dont get it.</li>
            <li> Even though I have dark hair, my eyebrows don&#x27;t always show up in pictures. It makes me crazy, so I normally fill in my brows lightly with a pencil. I saw this at the store, and decided to order it and see what it was like. I&#x27;m in heaven! It&#x27;s literally like putting on mascara but it doesn&#x27;t get on your skin, you will just darken your brows perfectly and they&#x27;ll look awesome. My hair is dark brown, and the Deep Brown color is perfect for me. It doesn&#x27;t come off if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to get caught in the rain or if you&#x27;re working out at the gym yet it&#x27;s easy to remove when you wash your face. This product makes my morning routine go so much more quickly because I don&#x27;t have to spend all my time in the mirror trying to make sure my brows look perfect and even with each other. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have gray in my brows and this is SO much better than plucking them, so this is what I have been using for a while. Works great!</li>
            <li> I find it works fine on one of my crazy and whiskery eyebrows. The other is white and does not cover easily. I can still use this product by dabbing the color onto my skin beneath the white hairs with the applicator tip before using according to directions. I have used for years Maybelline  mascara in the pink and green tube (brown/black) for a fairly natural covering on my white brow. I like the special brush that comes with this product so I plan to experiment with combining both products.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this mascara..it is awesome.. easy to take off!!  I had been looking for a GOOD mascara!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine eyebrows and the brush wouldn&#x27;t even pick up the hairs. Total waste of $6.99; I&#x27;m taking it back for a refund. And I&#x27;m going back to the eyebrow powder. They&#x27;ve taken it out of stores, but I found it at Walmart online.</li>
            <li> Understated, not bold but does the trick to give some color to your brows. Other nice thing is that your brows stay put...groomed in place. If you want bold, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> Omg I love this brow mascara... it delivered a excellent job, even better than the eye pencil. it looks so natural you would never believe a brush that shaped round would define the brows so well, and the arch... Great product! I bought the deep Brown this colorblind really natural. I&#x27;m a African American with fair skinned so this color really looks good on me.  definitely recommend and I will surely order again.</li>
            <li> This is what I tried because I&#x27;ve tried so many other things before.  I&#x27;ve used a pencil FOREVER becasue of over plucking and getting the brows too thin and sparse.  I even tried a liquid eyeliner that actually wasn&#x27;t bad if it was the right color., but it took a long time to get it just right.  I saw the MommyMakeup on Amazon for 18-20 bucks and thought that I&#x27;d like something less expensive.  I did order the other also so I had a comparison.  This Maybelline is hard to use.  The ball makes it so you can&#x27;t direct where you want the product.  I have thought of using a different wand, which would help.  The Mommy Makeup works sooo much better in directing the product.  Both brand have staying power, The Maybelline is a bit lighter than I&#x27;d prefer but the wand stinks.  The Mommy Makeup is too pricey.  Trying the Loreal brand next.  Now that I know what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the pencil. You have to go over the brows several time and they get too dark</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable product. It cover any grey hairs and keeps brows in place while not sticking to skin!!!</li>
            <li> Great for an easy fill-in. May make your brows look a little messy if you don&#x27;t go back and clean up.</li>
            <li> Brown should have gotten black but it was okay</li>
            <li> Makes brows hard. Wasn&#x27;t a fan</li>
            <li> Great product for brows!  Very easy to apply, long-lasting too!  As I become more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; ok age I find that my brows are thinner the bushy brows I had in HS and college..  However even though Amazon offered shipping I did notice that there was a &amp;#34;handling&amp;#34; fee which the exact amount I would have paid for shipping.  From now on I&#x27;ll stick to eBay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it feels. It does not seems to do much.</li>
            <li> This product is the best invention for eyebrow makeup yet. Looks very natural and covers gray and lighter colored brows like magic!!!  The special brush that comes along with it makes application very easy and precise!  No ugly mess on the skin because this product only covers the brow hairs.  That&#x27;s why it looks so natural!  No drawing eyebrows on the skin!!! Love this product!  I have beautiful eyebrows again.  In case you can&#x27;t tell, I highly recommend this &amp;#34;eyebrow drama&amp;#34; by Maybelline!!!  It&#x27;s a godsend for eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> Not impressive at ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> easy to apply. makes my eyebrows look more full and also keeps them in place</li>
            <li> So far so good, will reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this little eyebrow gel. The brush is shaped perfectly for easy application.</li>
            <li> I ended up tossing it as it streaked and was very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve never ordered a product that I didn&#x27;t like. This is the first, I&#x27;m surprise, but if it worked for others.....congratulations, continue to order it, but it was packaged nicely and it came earlier than I expected.. Sorry!</li>
            <li> I really love this! I have not had any issues with the ball like others have stated, but my brows are a bit thicker. I have very dark brown hair and this isn&#x27;t quite dark enough so I do still use a powder before then put this on last and it is perfect!</li>
            <li> This might have worked if there was any product in the tube....almost completely dry. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works so well. Easy and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li> This gel is a nice way to highlight those light colored eyebrows that aren&#x27;t noticed. I really like this product. It brushes on like a mascara wand, so you can comb your eyebrows. It has a gel like feel to it, so it stays put on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Hated the product itself. Prefer powder</li>
            <li> Ugh. I really wanted to like this product. It was fine until I tried to take my makeup off at night. I couldn&#x27;t get it off! It felt like I was pulling glue out of my eyebrows... I lost a lot of eyebrow hair trying to wash my face. Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 Maybelline brow drama, one for me and my daughter. The day I received them,  I gave one my daughter one, she said she will use it once in awhile.  She uses it everyday, she loves how nice her brows look.  I love it too in that my hairs on my brows are turning white and the brow drama covers it so well.  I always used a brow pencil and was not happy because you can see the pencil mark on my brows. This is a great brow happy I purchased the Maybelline New York Eyestudio Brow Drama.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but it would not go on evenly and left me with stuff smeared all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> Good product to darken brow--easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin</li>
            <li> I have very thin and sparse eyebrow hairs, so I&#x27;m always on the hunt for something to &amp;#34;fill them in&amp;#34; and make them look manicured. This product unfortunately did not do the job. The product went on clumpy and I found myself having to do a lot of manipulation to make it look more natural and less clownish. I think this product is not the best for those with thin brows such as mine. A powder or pencil is probably more suitable.</li>
            <li> Was mine dried out? It didn&#x27;t seem like it did anything...but then when I tried to wash it off after only 4 hours about 10 eye brow hairs came off, this stuff is strange its like dried, caked, flaky coloring....I like the idea of this but the application sucks.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast to use! This product is a money and time time saver. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Just use your favorite mascara instead and save yourself some money!  This has an awkward wand that clumps--weirdest shape I&#x27;ve ever seen. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> bought the auburn color retail - love it!  It&#x27;s super easy, simple and looks natural - will definitely purchase again, as long as I can find this shade again!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and have fine, sparce brows. I tried this product in the Blonde tint and was very disappointed. As others have mentioned, the ball end of the wand is awkward to use, and it makes the normal part of the wand virtually impossible to use. I have found if you happen to rub your brows at any point during the day, it can cause the gel to clump and look like dirt on your brows. The formula also seems to make my skin feel irritated and itchy. I with they would bring back the Define-a-Brow pencil in light blonde. That was perfect, and great for filling in any gaps.</li>
            <li> This is the brow cosmetic I&#x27;ve been waiting for all my life.</li>
            <li> all this does is coat your existing hairs on eyebrows.  it doesn&#x27;t make them any thicker, nor does it make your brows look more full.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product.  It would be good for someone with light eyebrows, but it does not work well for those of us with thinning eyebrows.  You need something for the makeup to stick to.  I like NYX eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to apply and makes my brows thicker and fuller and helps shape the.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  product! Produces natural looking eyebrows.  Takes a little practice but once you get the hang  of it very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this!!!! It&#x27;s so easy to use, this is so much faster than my previous pencil and powder method. The color is buildable, so one or two swishes for subtle definition, or several for a dramatic look- perfect for nearly nonexistent brows like mine. Everything looks so natural, it was the quickest way to wake up my face, I am definitely adding this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This product really brings out the beauty of my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been getting my eyebrows arched for a long time and woke one morning and said no more.... My natural eyebrows were thick and bushy and I let someone trick me into getting them for over 30 years. Now that I&#x27;m letting them grow back in I really needed something like this to fill in the shady spots. Thank you Maybelline!!! Good job, well done....I hope the price goes down a little anyway I will be buying more... smile HAPPY camper....</li>
            <li> Yet again, I know I have already written a review on this product.  But, let me say again how satisfied I am with it.  With age, my brow are either thinning or turning white.  This is the ideal product to correct all that.  I thank the seller sincerely for delivering this to me ahead of schedule and fully intact.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed! Very strong odor, clumpy, would not purchase it again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good concept that isn&#x27;t well executed. I was glad to see Maybelline give this a try, because I confess to having used regular mascara on my brows to thicken them up and keep the look in place. ANd that worked pretty well, though I had to use a practically dry mascara brush to avoid a mess. So the idea is a pretty good one. What I don&#x27;t get is the round ball applicator? If ever an application cried out for a flatter brush, this is it. So I would love to hear their thinking on that. I agree with others that you must wipe the little blob off the tip before you apply. I agree with others who say that pretty much you need to use it in conjunction with your eye pencil. I fill in any gaps with the eye pencil and then finish off with this. That works, but I&#x27;m not sure it makes that big a difference. Disappointing, but I&#x27;d like them to work it out and come up with an improved version based on feedback.</li>
            <li> Quite good but my eyebrows are not.</li>
            <li> as i&#x27;ve gotten older, my eyebrows have thinned and have begun to grey entirely too soon.  this product solves the problem of the occasional grey hair and keeps the brows looking finely groomed and completely full all day long.  it&#x27;s easy to use and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  IT&#x27;S A LITTLE HARD TO WASH OFF OTHER THAN THAT, I&#x27;M SATISFIED WITH IT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to get it on your eye brow without it getting all over your forehead.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have thick perfectly marked eyebrows please stick to your eye pencil. I was very excited and purchased two, all the brush does is comb out your brows you can use an ordinary brush and get the same effect. Am very disappointed, I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on the internet, and it is everything that was promised.  It does a better job than I have ever been able to do with a pencil.</li>
            <li> Its between like and love with this product. It defines my brows and looks natural. I&#x27;m a dark blonde and bought soft brown. The only drawback, if I should call it that, is that I have to learn to apply. I do better on the right side vs the other which I tend to get goopy. I just use a qtip to wipe off/blend until I learn how to get it on. Otherwise I am really liking this product.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful that this new eyebrow product would work like the commercial shows. It&#x27;s been a horrible experience and a waste of money. It&#x27;s no different than using mascara on your brows. It clumps and looks horrible! It also does not filll in the areas that has no hair.Trying to not waste my money, I tried using it on my eyelashes which didn&#x27;t work either so I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> The brush was poorly designed: too big &amp; round. And the product left dark flakes of color on my skin bemeath the eyebrows that was hard&lt;br /&gt;to remove. Also, i had to order dark brown color because no black was offered. Not very pleased at all. And shipping was almost as expensive as the actual product. Would never re-order this product. Still looking for a better one. Worth returning?  Don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> It would work much better on someone with more hair on brows. Mine are sparse but this does stay/last much longer than regular eyebrow pencil . I just fill it in a little more with a pencil and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like this brow makeup.  It works well to highlight the brows and keep them neatly arranged.</li>
            <li> Not for thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Perfect application &amp; looks much more realistic than eye pencil.</li>
            <li> I am so, so glad that this product is back.  I used Maybelline brown tinted brow gel for years and then about 5 years ago they discontinued it. It was great and only cost $3 or $4 a tube, so I was very distressed when other companies started offering all sorts of brow covers that were not nearly as good or easy to use for 5 to 10 times the price. If Maybelline had to discontinue a product did it have to be MY brow gel instead of one of their umpteen jillion types of mascara?  Most of the current brow products are designed to fill in missing brows, so they&#x27;re thick, messy and time-consuming to use and are overkill for my needs.  For those like me who have brows that are turning gray or those who have brows that are very light and want them darker this product is the best.  It&#x27;s just swipe and go and lasts for the whole day.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried several other products that sounded promising, but they always left me poorer and very disappointed. The only thing that makes this gel minimally less than perfect is the weird brush.  I could do without that.  To me, it makes the product harder to use rather than easier.  Maybe Maybelline just needed something unique to make this brow product stand out from all others. My hairdresser colors my brows with my hair dye when she colors my hair, but even though the color is permanent it only lasts 2-3 weeks on my brows, so this is perfect between visits. I showed it to my hairdresser yesterday who has very light brows and she was going to run right out and buy a tube for herself.</li>
            <li> Just be aware you will need eyebrow hair for this to work to the best of its ability. With aging, ailments, and prescriptions, my hair seems to be disappearing all over. Therefore, I don&#x27;t really have enough eyebrow hair for this product to grab onto. It seems it would work well if I did.</li>
            <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t smudge or run, stays put</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  A little darker than I expected, but it still blends well.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my eyebrows and the I tryed it on my lashes and it work better then any mascra I ever tryed its amazing for eyebrows and mascara trust me and buy it add length to my lashes and it also dafinded my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Natural looking eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She loved it. She said it was natural looking and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again.  It doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t smear, and does a good job of darkening and defining my brows.  It does not make them look thicker, however.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s usuability (especially for beginners) is definitely a 1 star. So if you&#x27;re sort of just starting out filling in your brows I definitely would not recommend this, as it has just too big of a wand! Honestly, what is this? That being said, I didn&#x27;t like this product. I love any kind of brow gel/mousse, a lot of times, in the morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work I found I didn&#x27;t have time to fill in my brows because I used powder/pencil making it a long process and I loovvveee hitting the snooze button and getting that extra 12 minutes of sleep. I have tried a lot of different gels and this simply does not compare both in the wand and the mousse itself. The bottle I received (not sure if this is the same for everyone) seemed almost empty? I opened and it immediately felt much lighter than I had expected and I do think it had dried out a bit, since I put in some of my favorite liquid rejuvenator and it seemed like it was much heavier, and that the product had loosened up a bit. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a flaw to the design or if it&#x27;s a simple problem with the packaging of that certain bottle. All in all, I did not like this product and am curious how this was put out and why it has 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Brows look great.</li>
            <li> Nice idea and it does work.  I used this for my unruly light eyebrows and it does give just enough color to highlight without looking painted.  It actually stayed on until the next day...that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Too clumpy to be an eyebrow mascara.</li>
            <li> some how, it doesn&#x27;t get on my skin. It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> Goes on and same as mascara, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, will buy mascara instead if I wanted that look, which I dont</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brow products. This is far and away the best!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to fill in my brows much, but I absolutely love this product! Tinted gel that gets brows the way you want them. It&#x27;s pretty impossible to mess up your brows with this!</li>
            <li> Much better and easier than eyebrow pencil.  Takes just a few seconds to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t over-accentuate my brows and it gives them just a bit more fullness where I want it. I don&#x27;t have pencil thin brows so the product just fills in what&#x27;s already there without making a mess. Here&#x27;s how I use it: I do my eyeshadow first, including application of the highlighting shade under my brows. Next, I spray my regular brow brush (NOT this product&#x27;s brush) with a very light misting of hair spray and give my brows a good shaping to set them in place. After that drys, I use a small amount of this product with a light touch. Once I apply this sculpting brow gel, I use a cotton swab to carefully clean up any residue. Then I give it time to dry. As a final step, I very carefully reapply a bit more of the highlighting eyeshadow underneath my brows and feather it in with my shadow brush to blend. I have had good results with the wear of this product; once it&#x27;s dry, it stays put. I think the key to getting good results with this is to not use too much.</li>
            <li> Got this product at store and love it. Makes eyebrows look amazing. I am blonde and makes eyebrows look great. Easy to use like better than a pencil.</li>
            <li> Does not work well, I went back to small brush with eyebrow powder</li>
            <li> Love it!! Perfect color</li>
            <li> No drama to it.  I end up using eyebrow pencil first and then just to use this up I put it over top.  Without using eyebrow pencil along with it I still look like I don&#x27;t have much for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I bought this brow mascara because after plucking my brows for a number of years (stupid thing to do because otherwise my brows would be very fashionable now) they are now too thin and also because I had an accident at a child hitting my brow against a door so in the place of the wound no brows grow anymore. I was a bit disappointed not so much with the size of the brush like other people because I still have enough brows although it is true that it could have been smaller but the fact that the container feels quite empty. I know that one doesn’t use much but when I take out the brush it feels that there is hardly anything inside. That said one uses very little so it won’t maybe be a problem. I have had it for a while no and it is still going…… we will see how long it lasts!</li>
