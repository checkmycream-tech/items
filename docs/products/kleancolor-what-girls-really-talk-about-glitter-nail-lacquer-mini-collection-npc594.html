            <li>These are just awesome, I am a big fan of glitter and theses just suit me.</li>
            <li>it  ok to have around to  polish</li>
            <li>Im going to try them again with a better top coat and see if that helps.</li>
            <li>It goes semi-clear for most of the colors so what you mostly see is the glitter</li>
            <li>ok I guess</li>
            <li>I have bought this many times before..</li>
            <li>My granddaughter also loves them I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I needed about 5 coats to get it looking ok.  </li>
            <li>, they love nail polish and this package gave them many colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>, now I know they enjoyed their Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors with this set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sparkly and cute!</li>
            <li>This company has great colors and for the price great deals but my nails chipped after half a day of wearing.</li>
            <li>Good color dries fast</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor for those with smell issues.</li>
            <li>Love the minis because color styles change so quickly</li>
            <li>These little guys provide good selection, good coverage and don&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>Fabulous colors.</li>
            <li>This was a great gift for my teenage granddaughter.</li>
            <li>They are tiny, but that is what is so great about these glitter polishes.</li>
            <li>It looks fabulous in the bottle and on her nails...</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I seen every one with different color nails at new years</li>
            <li>Unique shades.  </li>
            <li>I loved them overall.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, you need about three coats but no need for a top coat.</li>
            <li>sparkly makes a good gift cheep and cute not a fan of the green one</li>
            <li>I love the glitter colors and the mini bottles had more than enough polish.</li>
            <li>These are perfect as a gift, especially for someone younger who is just getting into polish.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, long duration, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I think this is great for little girls or teens.</li>
            <li>These a great little nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>She loved all the different colors and the glitter.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped fairly fast.</li>
            <li>They are glittery and more mature looling.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but the colors are cute and pretty and the paint dries quickly!</li>
            <li>They were the right consistency.</li>
            <li>I guess it is the right size for their fingers.</li>
            <li>Great product, just surprised at how tiny the containers actually were when they arrived, but my granddaughter enjoyed them, so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li>Mini is certainly the correct word to use!  </li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>are a real hit with teenagers!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not as much as a problem as the smell!</li>
            <li>The glitter colors in this set are pretty.</li>
            <li>They are very affordable!</li>
            <li>Was a nice small gift for someone special to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for a special young lady.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that the colors are extremely light, I was fooled big time by the colors on the bottle.</li>
            <li>This nail polishes are very girly.</li>
            <li>I really think my Granddaughter will like these.</li>
            <li>I did get them fast.</li>
            <li>She does really like them though.</li>
            <li>one for the price I think is ok if you want extra colors to complete your collection.</li>
            <li>I use them on special occasions or as a top coat on a bright base coat.</li>
            <li>The color is very nice, I just don&#x27;t like how small they are, Would like a bigger size.  </li>
            <li>These bottles are small which is nice as glitter nail polish is not going to be used every day.</li>
            <li>Nice colors but much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li>The price is decent and this weekend I got compliments.</li>
            <li>3 times out of bottles ok for teens as gift for xmas for your teens and little girls</li>
            <li>I like thi just wish they were the normal nail polish size.</li>
            <li>My polish addiction has been passed down to my twelve year old sister, and I know she&#x27;s going to love this set when I give it to her at Christmas.</li>
            <li>They come in a cute little box too!</li>
            <li>Vivid.  </li>
            <li>These nail polishes are very cute, but I must say that mine came very thick, it shows that they are old.</li>
            <li>Long last top coating needed to last.</li>
            <li>I ended layering nearly 4 times the amount of polish just to be able to see the sparkles, but the colors themselves hardly showed up at all.</li>
            <li>Delivered early.</li>
            <li>They were very prompt with emailing me back as soon as I emailed them.</li>
            <li>I bought this to go with a 7 year old&#x27;s nail dryer set as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the patience that is required of a group of 7 year old girls.</li>
            <li>I bought for my 5 year old, so</li>
            <li>I got these as a gift for an old roommate who loves nail art and glitter, so I got her these to play with.</li>
            <li>the flakes of glitter in the polish are so big that it will not even stay on your nails &amp; the ones that do stay on are so big they stack on top of each other &amp; become glumpy.</li>
            <li>I actually thought they where the size as normal nail polish, but they are the mini version</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely used this polish &amp; I&#x27;m considering throwing out the rest out that I haven&#x27;t used or either give it away to the kids so they can play around with it because its not worth using &amp; expecting to show it off on my hands or feet.</li>
            <li>The only problem i had was a bottle was half full.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old totally loves this set.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I ordered it yesterday, and asked them if I can get it as early as possible because I needed this for party favors next week.</li>
            <li>Colors don&#x27;t really show and they were way smaller than what I had expected</li>
            <li>Quick drying and small enough to carry with you anywhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and while they colors are very pretty, the actual container is quite small.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the polish to start doing pedicures for the kids, I found that not only are the colors barely visible, you have to dig to get the sparkles out.</li>
            <li>The liquid part of the polish was pretty much dried up.</li>
            <li>this nail polish was way too thick, never dried, and once it did dry the next day it would peal right off.</li>
            <li>This is no OPI (most evident in its inability to last for a long time), but for the price, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>

            <li> This is no OPI (most evident in its inability to last for a long time), but for the price, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> My neice is obsessed with nail polish, 2 sets with free shipping</li>
            <li> mini - but they are dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about staining and stuff, but I gave these as a gift to a 12 year old girl</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, by a long shot.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I thought the packaging was a little bigger, are small.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is not worth buying....</li>
            <li> The polish faded and literally peeled off in less than a day.</li>
            <li> And the truth would return for the price of buying if your content come less dense.</li>
            <li> 2 bottles are about half full &amp; 3 bottles are goopy &amp; polish has gone bad</li>
            <li> That was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> The black has little silver circles in it and the green has little hearts.</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased this for the price if I had known how little I would get.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but the purple one was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> 3 of the nails polish were dried out when I got them</li>
            <li> I see a lot of possibilities with these little bottles and they are not too small either</li>
            <li> The polish was a little and hard to apply</li>
            <li> Sorry for the short review, but there were no problems with the shipping or the product.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see what their staying power is.</li>
            <li> and yes it is small</li>
            <li> then you know how frustrating it can be when you are forced to wait on 4 layers of nail lacquer to dry.</li>
            <li> The only color I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the green one.  </li>
            <li> Polish is thick and not cute at all.</li>
            <li> They were also really thick.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with my purchase will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> They are small, and they come in a variety of colors!</li>
            <li> buy it very small bottles</li>
            <li> Bottles very small.  </li>
            <li> it looks very childish and you need a base coat under</li>
            <li> Too bad they smell so awful!  </li>
            <li> I am brutal on polish, but this brand stays on my nails for a longer than others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible and will leave you sick at times!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This nail polishes are very girly. I actually thought they where the size as normal nail polish, but they are the mini version, I forgot to read the descirption lol... but other than that they are great, and they work great as well. I like thi just wish they were the normal nail polish size.</li>
            <li> grandaughter loved it</li>
            <li> Nice colors but much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> My grand daughters loved these, they were delivered in time too!</li>
            <li> Nice product. It was just what I spected. Delivered early. Nice colors, long duration, easy to remove. Just Perfect, I&#x27;m a happy buyer</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas, and she loved it. Sorry for the short review, but there were no problems with the shipping or the product.</li>
            <li> This was bought for a gift for a teenage girl. She loved all the different colors and the glitter.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped fairly fast. Was a nice small gift for someone special to me.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this person again. no problem.</li>
            <li> My neice is obsessed with nail polish, 2 sets with free shipping and I was done.  Love the minis because color styles change so quickly</li>
            <li> These bottles are small which is nice as glitter nail polish is not going to be used every day. The colors are vibrant, you need about three coats but no need for a top coat. The way to remove glitter nail polish is with acetone (which you can get at any drug store), not the non-acetone or you&#x27;ll be scrubbing away for hours. The price is decent and this weekend I got compliments. And these are not just for teenagers. I&#x27;m 45! (Also they are good if you need a fill but haven&#x27;t got the time to go to a salon as you can use these glitters to fill in that gap!)</li>
            <li> These little guys provide good selection, good coverage and don&#x27;t chip easily. I bought a set for my sister, too.</li>
            <li> Love the nail polish but more so their customer service. I ordered it yesterday, and asked them if I can get it as early as possible because I needed this for party favors next week. I got it overnight! They were very prompt with emailing me back as soon as I emailed them. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I like this product &amp; it comes with low cost. I will recommend this product for future buyers. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with a 7 year old&#x27;s nail dryer set as a birthday gift. The first thing I noticed is that the colors are extremely light, I was fooled big time by the colors on the bottle. When I opened the polish to start doing pedicures for the kids, I found that not only are the colors barely visible, you have to dig to get the sparkles out. I ended layering nearly 4 times the amount of polish just to be able to see the sparkles, but the colors themselves hardly showed up at all. That was pretty disappointing. If you have experience painting nails then you know how frustrating it can be when you are forced to wait on 4 layers of nail lacquer to dry. Not to mention the patience that is required of a group of 7 year old girls. The polish faded and literally peeled off in less than a day. It&#x27;s an inexpensive product and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but the purple one was dried out when I got it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift. I really think my Granddaughter will like these. Fabulous colors.I am anxious to see what their staying power is.</li>
            <li> I loved all of the polishes!! The only problem i had was a bottle was half full. I didnt see any spilled polish so i assumed it was a mistake. The colors were beautiful. I loved them overall. They were the right consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about staining and stuff, but I gave these as a gift to a 12 year old girl and she really loved them and the variety.  She&#x27;s done some incredible stuff with it!</li>
            <li> Shiny and glittery. Good for sunny days and upbeat attitude day&#x27;s. Long last top coating needed to last. A breezy day</li>
            <li> good size for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Nice colors but you can see the difference between this brand and others more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This one for the price I think is ok if you want extra colors to complete your collection.</li>
            <li> This is no OPI (most evident in its inability to last for a long time), but for the price, it&#x27;s not so bad. I think this is great for little girls or teens.</li>
            <li> The youngster loved them.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift for my teenage granddaughter. She loves to have different colors and colors with glitter are a real hit with teenagers!</li>
            <li> The bottles are smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but the colors are cute and pretty and the paint dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I thought they would be bigger bottles  I bought for my 5 year old, so I guess it is the right size for their fingers.</li>
            <li> These are just awesome, I am a big fan of glitter and theses just suit me. Quick drying and small enough to carry with you anywhere.</li>
            <li> I am brutal on polish, but this brand stays on my nails for a longer than others. This is a great top coat glitter, I liked it so much I used them as party favors for a girls night out.</li>
            <li> buy it very small bottles it  ok to have around to  polish 3 times out of bottles ok for teens as gift for xmas for your teens and little girls</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift for an old roommate who loves nail art and glitter, so I got her these to play with. They have great coverage and look super cute! I just wish they were bigger.</li>
            <li> This company has great colors and for the price great deals but my nails chipped after half a day of wearing. Im going to try them again with a better top coat and see if that helps. I did get them fast.</li>
            <li> It goes semi-clear for most of the colors so what you mostly see is the glitter, some of the darker colors have a deeper consentration of glitter. It&#x27;s super sparkly and cute! I love it!</li>
            <li> It ok I guess but it has nice colors some 😂 and yes it is small</li>
            <li> pre teen  niece loved them</li>
            <li> Colors don&#x27;t really show and they were way smaller than what I had expected</li>
            <li> My daughter realy loved getting this for Christmas.She also loved the colors, and how good the glitter looked in the polish.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old totally loves this set. It does have a strong odor for those with smell issues. A good buy.</li>
            <li> sparkly makes a good gift cheep and cute not a fan of the green one it looks very childish and you need a base coat under</li>
            <li> i thought they would be bigger...that&#x27;s not as much as a problem as the smell! It&#x27;s terrible and will leave you sick at times! you need a nailpolish under them because they are transparent.</li>
            <li> I have bought this many times before.. The colors are beautiful and the polish lasts and lasts Will prob. buy again!</li>
            <li> this nail polish was way too thick, never dried, and once it did dry the next day it would peal right off.</li>
            <li> The glitter colors in this set are pretty. Too bad they smell so awful!  They were also really thick. I just threw them away.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter in law, she loved them.  The colors are vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love the glitter colors and the mini bottles had more than enough polish. My granddaughter also loves them I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> nice i like it i brought to my girlfriend for a gift and she like it and it looks awesome!!!</li>
            <li> The polish was a little and hard to apply</li>
            <li> This nail polish is not worth buying....the flakes of glitter in the polish are so big that it will not even stay on your nails &amp; the ones that do stay on are so big they stack on top of each other &amp; become glumpy. I&#x27;ve rarely used this polish &amp; I&#x27;m considering throwing out the rest out that I haven&#x27;t used or either give it away to the kids so they can play around with it because its not worth using &amp; expecting to show it off on my hands or feet.</li>
            <li> Bottles very small.  I would not have purchased this for the price if I had known how little I would get.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are very cute, but I must say that mine came very thick, it shows that they are old. I thought the packaging was a little bigger, are small. And the truth would return for the price of buying if your content come less dense.</li>
            <li> of course they are mini - but they are dry. Polish is thick and not cute at all. On to the next item.</li>
            <li> 3 of the nails polish were dried out when I got them</li>
            <li> Glitter polishes! They are tiny, but that is what is so great about these glitter polishes. I use them on special occasions or as a top coat on a bright base coat. They are small, and they come in a variety of colors! I love them! They came very quickly, within about 3 days of ordering them! They come in a cute little box too! They are very affordable!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but they all look really nice! I see a lot of possibilities with these little bottles and they are not too small either, just I don&#x27;t think I need a big bottle of glitters!</li>
            <li> Vivid.  Lasting color.  Unique shades.  Tons of compliments.  Inspired me to begin building my collection of full-sized bottles in these shades, as well as others.</li>
            <li> These are perfect as a gift, especially for someone younger who is just getting into polish. My polish addiction has been passed down to my twelve year old sister, and I know she&#x27;s going to love this set when I give it to her at Christmas. Definitely a great intro-to-polish set!</li>
            <li> These a great little nail polishes.  Love the colors!  They are glittery and more mature looling.  The only color I wasn&#x27;t crazy about was the green one.  I needed about 5 coats to get it looking ok.  Other than that I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a special young lady. It looks fabulous in the bottle and on her nails...well just Gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Very nice gift for girls of all ages, they love nail polish and this package gave them many colors to choose from.  I was very happy when I seen every one with different color nails at new years, now I know they enjoyed their Christmas presents.  The price was great!!</li>
            <li> I love the colors with this set. The black has little silver circles in it and the green has little hearts. Can&#x27;t wait to use them all</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and while they colors are very pretty, the actual container is quite small.  Mini is certainly the correct word to use!  She does really like them though.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves her nail polish.  The colors are just what the kids are using now.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with my purchase will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product, just surprised at how tiny the containers actually were when they arrived, but my granddaughter enjoyed them, so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> The liquid part of the polish was pretty much dried up. Not worth the money, by a long shot.</li>
            <li> 2 bottles are about half full &amp; 3 bottles are goopy &amp; polish has gone bad</li>
            <li> great seller ..kids loved them</li>
            <li> Good color dries fast</li>
            <li> One of the nail polishes had leaked and did not have time to return product.  Was a gift and no time to purchase another before Christmas.</li>
            <li> The color is very nice, I just don&#x27;t like how small they are, Would like a bigger size.  So I am hoping that I can find some of the colors in a bigger size.</li>
