    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product works best if used after using the gel version.</li>
            <li>wonderful product  </li>
            <li>Fresh\\&quot; shaving creams which scent wise works perfect with this aftershave product.</li>
            <li>Great product, my husband won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Great price/value</li>
            <li>Found the item at a reduced price and he is a \\&quot;happy camper\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is the version of the gel except it comes in a lotion cream format, and it is just as great.</li>
            <li>But it works great in the colder months.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price</li>
            <li>at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great price too.</li>
            <li>so it is a good thing he loves it.</li>
            <li>IMO, it&#x27;s also superior to Gillette&#x27;s gel after shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving cream wise</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good price for a pack of 6.</li>
            <li>Smells good, moisturizes, an heals nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>These are good for shaving and I like this brand as its good to use and helps razor burn and bumps</li>
            <li>After a good scrub and/or shave, I use it all over</li>
            <li>This stuff has a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t burn, but gives you a good feel after shaving.</li>
            <li>Great product that would make your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It fades nice over an hour or two so it doesn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;steal\\&quot; smell once it fades out.</li>
            <li>Did not realize it was a gel rather than a liquid which was my own fault.</li>
            <li>Nice to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>Nicely smells.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t change it easily!</li>
            <li>This product is most appealing because of its creamy substance.  </li>
            <li>Periodically I try something else, invariably pricier and with more cachet.</li>
            <li>I tend to use this more in the winter.</li>
            <li>After Shave GEL because it moisturizes and sooths my face a bit better.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of having it delivered to my door instead of walking the aisle at a locdal store.</li>
            <li>Found it easily on Amazon at a lower price with free shipping to my door.  </li>
            <li>This product is available (at the time of this review) at Walmart, and if not through Walmart, than through the Procter and Gamble online store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It keeps your face smooth all day, and you keep that aftershave scent going.</li>
            <li>The scent/fragrance is a light barber shop smell</li>
            <li>Grateful that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin smooth</li>
            <li>I like to get a really close shave and this lotion soothes my skin nicely after I finish.</li>
            <li>I bought this once just as a cheap aftershave to soothe razor burn.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind though, that all faces are different, but for my patchy-oily-dry face, this is really the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So, great product but one star off due to strong scent.</li>
            <li>10 cents worth of ingredients.</li>
            <li>After Shave Lotion for many years and I will continue to buy it for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I still prefer the gel as gel sticks better and can hold the fragrance longer, but the lotion gives your face a nice smooth feeling especially if you obtain dry skin after a shave.</li>
            <li>So so, but not as  good as the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; colored gel product...limited scent...and slightly oily..</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years as my favorite after shave lotion not only because of the scent but also because it is a creamy lotion that does not sting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came on the market some 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite aftershave lotion and I can only find it online!</li>
            <li>Its pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Decided to give a try after many decades of Old Spice regular.</li>
            <li>Fragrance wise they are both the same, but the sensitive skin version is a little lighter on the skin.</li>
            <li>Though it doesnt help much with ingrowing hairs since it doesnt keep the skin that soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the aroma is fairly strong and bothers my girlfriend, who has allergic sensitivity to many household products.</li>
            <li>I use the \\&quot;Gillette Series Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>If you like this product I also suggest \\&quot;Gillette Series Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>I buy this all the time, but prefer Gillette&#x27;s Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>the more traditional, blue colored gel, can&#x27;t be shipped to Japan for some odd reason.</li>
            <li>Tossed them out &amp; went back to Old Spice (when I can find it).</li>
            <li>I found that it worked as a complete facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would certainly advice it to other costumers.</li>
            <li>This is usually less that $2 in the stores, so that&#x27;s possibly a 70-90%-ish savings over most other ACTUAL facial moisturizers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is most appealing because of its creamy substance.  Gillette&#x27;s gel aftershave lotion fails to be a worthy competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eamonn G.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this aftershave for years because it works and is also inexpensive. Unfortunately, the aroma is fairly strong and bothers my girlfriend, who has allergic sensitivity to many household products. Had to stop wearing and switch to a product without scent. So, great product but one star off due to strong scent. If they made a no-scent version, I&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband won&#x27;t use anything else. Great price/value if you sign up for subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses this aftershave and when all our local stores stopped carrying the product I turned to Amazon.  Found the item at a reduced price and he is a \\&quot;happy camper\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like it compare to other balsamic after shaves cause it doesnt keep your face oily afterwards. Though it doesnt help much with ingrowing hairs since it doesnt keep the skin that soft. Its pretty decent. I would certainly advice it to other costumers.</li>
            <li> My local stores had stopped carrying this product in favor of the gel which I didn&#x27;t like as well.  Found it easily on Amazon at a lower price with free shipping to my door.  No more wasted time and gas searching</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son and did not realize it was a six pack so it is a good thing he loves it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!  My order consisted of six in a box.  Since it lasts a long time, I kept three and donated the other three to a local food/social services agency that helps people in need.  This aftershave will be an added bonus!  My husband loves the way it makes his face feels.</li>
            <li> Periodically I try something else, invariably pricier and with more cachet. Yet, price be damned, I keep coming back to Gillette&#x27;s after shave cream because all others have left at least some degree of residual greasy stickum, and I like my skin feeling like skin not an oilcloth. IMO, it&#x27;s also superior to Gillette&#x27;s gel after shave. Don&#x27;t look to either the cream or the gel for a ladycatcher scent, though; it&#x27;s utterly odorless.</li>
            <li> This product is available (at the time of this review) at Walmart, and if not through Walmart, than through the Procter and Gamble online store. It&#x27;s also available from Amazon. I use the \\&quot;Gillette Series Sensitive Skin After Shave Gel\\&quot; which I give five out of five stars. This is the version of the gel except it comes in a lotion cream format, and it is just as great. I still prefer the gel as gel sticks better and can hold the fragrance longer, but the lotion gives your face a nice smooth feeling especially if you obtain dry skin after a shave. There are two versions of this product (as with the gel version); one is the regular lotion, and the other is the sensitive skin version. Fragrance wise they are both the same, but the sensitive skin version is a little lighter on the skin. This product works best if used after using the gel version. I would recommend using the Gillette After Shave Gel (blue bottle - same size as this white bottle version), and about an hour or two later apply this lotion version. It keeps your face smooth all day, and you keep that aftershave scent going. The scent/fragrance is a light barber shop smell so it is not feminine nor is it over-the-top masculine. It fades nice over an hour or two so it doesn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;steal\\&quot; smell once it fades out. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like something from a nurses medicine cabinet or from a gyms locker room. I give this product a five out of five star rating. If you like this product I also suggest \\&quot;Gillette Series Sensitive Skin After Shave Gel\\&quot; which is the gel version of this product, but in gel format, and comes in the same size yet a blue bottle.  I do not recommend mixing this with other after shave products (like using Brute or Old Spice after shave colognes on your face after using this) as the mix of different fragrances can leave an odd smell on your face. Shaving cream wise I would recommend as a counterpart the \\&quot;Gillette Foamy Original\\&quot; or \\&quot;Gillette Foamy Barber Shop Fresh\\&quot; shaving creams which scent wise works perfect with this aftershave product.</li>
            <li> package a little awkward; can&#x27;t stand up. like the contents though.</li>
            <li> Decided to give a try after many decades of Old Spice regular. Did not realize it was a gel rather than a liquid which was my own fault. Did not like the scent either.Tossed them out &amp; went back to Old Spice (when I can find it).</li>
            <li> I tend to use this more in the winter. It&#x27;s a littler too thick for a summer after shave. But it works great in the colder months.</li>
            <li> 10 cents worth of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as my favorite after shave lotion not only because of the scent but also because it is a creamy lotion that does not sting.  Lately I have found it increasingly difficult to find this lotion in supermarkets or drug stores.  Amazon delivered it to my home for the supermarket/drug store price even including the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time, but prefer Gillette&#x27;s Sensitive Skin After Shave GEL because it moisturizes and sooths my face a bit better. For those reasons I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Good product. Nice to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Good price for a pack of 6. This stuff has a nice scent, doesn&#x27;t burn, but gives you a good feel after shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette Series After Shave Lotion for many years and I will continue to buy it for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since it first came on the market some 20 years ago. I was bummed they no longer sold it in the stores. Grateful that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells good, moisturizes, an heals nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin smooth</li>
            <li> These are good for shaving and I like this brand as its good to use and helps razor burn and bumps</li>
            <li> wonderful product  at a great price.  Love the convenience of having it delivered to my door instead of walking the aisle at a locdal store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after shave lotion for 5 years and I won&#x27;t change it easily! Great product that would make your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Nicely smells.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is usually a bit dry which causes discomfort after shaving. This cream not only moisturizes the skin after shaving but also relieves any discomfort associated with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite aftershave lotion and I can only find it online! It&#x27;s a really great price too.</li>
            <li> I like to get a really close shave and this lotion soothes my skin nicely after I finish. I like the aroma, too, and have had numerous compliments on it. I have been using it for years and I can recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s skin feels a bit raw after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one who cared about what aftershave or aftershave lotion I&#x27;ve used after a shave. I bought this once just as a cheap aftershave to soothe razor burn. I found that it worked as a complete facial moisturizer. After a good scrub and/or shave, I use it all over and my face is moisturized just as well as with all of the other facial moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried, and in my opinion are all way too overpriced and usually too oily even if there&#x27;s no mention of any sort of oil in the ingredients. I can&#x27;t tolerate a grease-face. This is usually less that $2 in the stores, so that&#x27;s possibly a 70-90%-ish savings over most other ACTUAL facial moisturizers. Keep in mind though, that all faces are different, but for my patchy-oily-dry face, this is really the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve also used the gel in the same manner, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well compared to the lotion.</li>
            <li> So so, but not as  good as the &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; colored gel product...limited scent...and slightly oily..but all in all...not too bad when the other after shave gel isn&#x27;t available...at least for me here in Japan...the more traditional, blue colored gel, can&#x27;t be shipped to Japan for some odd reason.</li>
