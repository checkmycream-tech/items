            <li>Works great....</li>
            <li>It has been amazing!  </li>
            <li>Conditioner is awesome, but not in love with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It really is a deliciously pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would say this would work on anyone&#x27;s hair because it is a pleasant shampoo and conditioning product.</li>
            <li>Good value also.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NO GOOD ;(</li>
            <li>While it does a good job of taming frizz</li>
            <li>Mother said her hair has never felt so good &amp; fuller.</li>
            <li>My hair loved the Argan Oil</li>
            <li>My hair loved the Argan Oil</li>
            <li>This shampoo provides excellent slip and rinsed clean from my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I rinsed my hair with warm water, then applied the Renpure shampoo on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Renpure doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;read\\&quot; like that kind of company</li>
            <li>Renpure doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;read\\&quot; like that kind of company</li>
            <li>This particular argan oil formula is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil Shampoo has a light scent of Argan oil and something floral which is great if you&#x27;re not the biggest fan of sweet and fruity scents.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these.</li>
            <li>i have been using argan oil products like shampoo and conditioner for more than a year now</li>
            <li>my hair becomes more healthy, thicker and shinny.</li>
            <li>I have always had healthy hair</li>
            <li>So I will be buying from Food City from now on :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Try Agadir if you want a better argan oil product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of these.</li>
            <li>Real quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels after using these two.</li>
            <li>I feel that it rinses very clean, and helps my hair stay moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is very rich and lasts many washes and leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>After I used the shampoo and conditioner my hair felt very nice and made my natural curl look more tamed.</li>
            <li>I chose this product for my fine hair to help with the static of the winter months.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my natural hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that this shampoo &amp; conditioner is, by far, the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This detangling method is recommended by YouTube vlogger @naptural85, and it minimizes breakage while easily removing shed hair.</li>
            <li>Throughout the application and rinse of the shampoo, I noticed that my fingers slid easily through my strands and to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>The product has a strong perfume smell, I had to return it because of the reaction I had to the smell.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell but not offensive and wears off soon.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>A huge pet peeve of mine!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t matter, as the scent doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair anyway, and I prefer to pick my own trusted (allergy-friendly) scents.</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed for this Renpure shampoo and conditioner are reassuringly free of parabens, sulfates, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Great shampoo and conditioner and works on my curly, sometimes dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It does not create much of a lather, but most sulfate free products do not.  </li>
            <li>Overall good products though</li>
            <li>Overall, if someone wants a great product, I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I love and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Had to use way more shampoo and conditioner than normal.</li>
            <li>but in terms of the product they are really great and less falling hair for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how soft it is, but I don&#x27;t like to shampoo twice, what a pain!</li>
            <li>As with all non-sulfate shampoos this doesn&#x27;t lather, which is fine, but I still don&#x27;t like it much.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this product because they describe it as organic and free of certain harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and i can say im fully satisfied with the result so far.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>But with this product my hair must be washed more frequently as it makes it a bit oily.  </li>
            <li>Sad to say, the best products often are a victim of their own success, changing a beloved formula to cut corporate costs.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still on the watch for other good shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still on the watch for other good shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I recently discovered argan oil and have been buying as many products containing it that I can find.</li>
            <li>3 stars considering this product is just okay for my specific hair type.</li>
            <li>went first to the organic products.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to give it a try</li>
            <li>am very particular about consistency and texture of my shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is very pretty and soft after using this product for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Fly aways are minimal and my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li>works better then expected.  </li>
            <li>This really is a 5-star product, but I am giving it a 4-star because of the price Amazon has it listed for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>SO MUCH CHEAPER IN THE STORE THAN ON</li>
            <li>really like softness</li>
            <li>Normally, my shrinkage is immediately evident upon leaving the shower causing tangles if I didn&#x27;t twist my hair for the wash.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my shrinkage is immediately evident upon leaving the shower causing tangles if I didn&#x27;t twist my hair for the wash.  </li>
            <li>The downfall, I&#x27;m using too much water shampooing my hair twice</li>
            <li>You can really feel the Argan Oil in every scrub.</li>
            <li>(And yes, maybe the whole industrial don&#x27;t-care-much-about-shelf-sexiness thing is a strategy in itself.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this product claiming to contain argan oil.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft but the roots tend to get pretty oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Renpure&#x27;s Argan oil duo left my kinks and coils clean, moisturized, and detangled.  </li>
            <li>I have long, wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s going to take longer for the broken hair to grow out, but most of that now is more than three inches long, so I&#x27;ve stopped or at least greatly slowed the breakage</li>
            <li>but  older I get, the more I notice it is getting a little wirey in certain spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, my hair looks better (shinier, curlier, softer/less frizzy, less prone to color fade) than it has since my teens were toddlers.</li>
            <li>On top pf that it made my skin break out - like previous reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li>previously I used another brand and thought I&#x27;d try this one since it was on sale and discovered it was much better...</li>
            <li>Thanks to recommendations by the natural hair community on YouTube, I was introduced to Renpure Organics Argan Oil Luxurious Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I think this shampoo would work very well for someone who doesn&#x27;t have an oily scalp, because it made the rest of my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>As a guy, it&#x27;s not something that I would normally pay attention to</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used all sorts of curling/scrunching products and protectors with silicone to try to bring those curls back and would have my face break out in a severe sunburn-like rash, pretty much every time I tried them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest this product to other women who are looking for a lighter shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I subsequently bought the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon and have again been pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary impact.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and found Renpure conditioner very drying, leaving my hair MORE tangled at the roots than from using other brands of conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I had to spend more time using other conditioners and oils to get my hair back right until I shampooed the Renpure results out my next shampoo.</li>
            <li>it was becoming a little greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, my hair looks better (shinier, curlier, softer/less frizzy, less prone to color fade) than it has since my teens were toddlers.bit odd, if mild.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked healthier after the first use but a week later I started noticing</li>
            <li>could understand that some shampoos may cause reaction in a sensitive skin and some people might be allergic to something - but this!</li>
            <li>This shampoo also requires a little extra rinsing to be sure you&#x27;ve gotten it all out.</li>
            <li>I also have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>so I always just thought it was naturally frizzy too.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how soft it made my hair.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair softer, but when I straighten my hair, it STAYS STRAIGHT without need to re-iron for about 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I have completely used my shampoo but probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a year ago I looked in the mirror and realized that much of my natural curl was gone, and that my mane resembled an abused Barbie doll&#x27;s coif a bit too closely.  </li>
            <li>if you want to know just ask in a direct question....</li>
            <li>shampoo and conditioner smell a bit odd, if mild.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it, especially since it is the cheapest shampoo I have used in recent years.</li>
            <li>My hair looked worse and was much more tangled after using this.</li>
            <li>Getting only i bottle each made this a less than economical transaction.</li>
            <li>it gives hair non- greasy like some other products, thanks.........</li>
            <li>but it does leave your hair feeling clean before you move on to the conditioner (unlike shea moisture for me at least).</li>
            <li>The ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be available prior to purchase, so if you are truly looking for natural, organic, conscious product, I&#x27;m sorry to say, keep looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells pretty plain.</li>
            <li>Other high send products I have experience with, have watery conditioner-</li>
            <li>Additionally, it does not contain sodium chloride, salts, dyes, sulfates, parabens, or gluten which is a plus for my sensitive scalp and naturally dry</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft, gentle enough to use everyday and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>

            <li> My hair is very soft but the roots tend to get pretty oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Renpure&#x27;s Argan oil duo left my kinks and coils clean, moisturized, and detangled.  </li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s going to take longer for the broken hair to grow out, but most of that now is more than three inches long, so I&#x27;ve stopped or at least greatly slowed the breakage</li>
            <li> but  older I get, the more I notice it is getting a little wirey in certain spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, my hair looks better (shinier, curlier, softer/less frizzy, less prone to color fade) than it has since my teens were toddlers.</li>
            <li> On top pf that it made my skin break out - like previous reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> previously I used another brand and thought I&#x27;d try this one since it was on sale and discovered it was much better...</li>
            <li> Thanks to recommendations by the natural hair community on YouTube, I was introduced to Renpure Organics Argan Oil Luxurious Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I think this shampoo would work very well for someone who doesn&#x27;t have an oily scalp, because it made the rest of my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> As a guy, it&#x27;s not something that I would normally pay attention to</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used all sorts of curling/scrunching products and protectors with silicone to try to bring those curls back and would have my face break out in a severe sunburn-like rash, pretty much every time I tried them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest this product to other women who are looking for a lighter shampoo for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I subsequently bought the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon and have again been pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary impact.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and found Renpure conditioner very drying, leaving my hair MORE tangled at the roots than from using other brands of conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I had to spend more time using other conditioners and oils to get my hair back right until I shampooed the Renpure results out my next shampoo.</li>
            <li> it was becoming a little greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, my hair looks better (shinier, curlier, softer/less frizzy, less prone to color fade) than it has since my teens were toddlers.bit odd, if mild.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked healthier after the first use but a week later I started noticing</li>
            <li> could understand that some shampoos may cause reaction in a sensitive skin and some people might be allergic to something - but this!</li>
            <li> This shampoo also requires a little extra rinsing to be sure you&#x27;ve gotten it all out.</li>
            <li> I also have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> so I always just thought it was naturally frizzy too.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how soft it made my hair.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair softer, but when I straighten my hair, it STAYS STRAIGHT without need to re-iron for about 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I have completely used my shampoo but probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a year ago I looked in the mirror and realized that much of my natural curl was gone, and that my mane resembled an abused Barbie doll&#x27;s coif a bit too closely.  </li>
            <li> if you want to know just ask in a direct question....</li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner smell a bit odd, if mild.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, especially since it is the cheapest shampoo I have used in recent years.</li>
            <li> My hair looked worse and was much more tangled after using this.</li>
            <li> Getting only i bottle each made this a less than economical transaction.</li>
            <li> it gives hair non- greasy like some other products, thanks.........</li>
            <li> but it does leave your hair feeling clean before you move on to the conditioner (unlike shea moisture for me at least).</li>
            <li> The ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be available prior to purchase, so if you are truly looking for natural, organic, conscious product, I&#x27;m sorry to say, keep looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells pretty plain.</li>
            <li> Other high send products I have experience with, have watery conditioner-</li>
            <li> Additionally, it does not contain sodium chloride, salts, dyes, sulfates, parabens, or gluten which is a plus for my sensitive scalp and naturally dry</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft, gentle enough to use everyday and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> far, this duo is taking care of my hair, has reduced the greasiness I experience on the day after washing (with other products), has decreased my scalp itchiness and dryness, and I am excited to see how my hair has improved after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells nice but NOT GOOD for wavy, curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> If anyone has used shea moisture shampoo, it is like that where there is little to no noticeability of suds so it does not strip your hair of its natural oils</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and the conditioner goes a long way with my hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and coats my hair very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, very curly, and somewhat coarse</li>
            <li> Shine was maintained but my hair was BONE dry</li>
            <li> (I am of mixed Central American, Caribbean, and European descent); I have used countless oils, used to get expensive keratin treatments every 3 months, and have tried countless shampoo/conditioners.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so chemically smelling and it doesnt go away till your hair is completely dry!</li>
            <li> I also have an issue with my hair becoming very limp and dull from heavy product and this has not caused that issue either!</li>
            <li> I wish it had a little thinner consistency to go on easier especially since I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 5 shampoos in, I could feel my hair start to get softer and see it start to transform from everyday air or blow-dried frizz to actual curls like I used to have.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a small suds that is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Complete with lots of short, broken hair strands sticking every which way.</li>
            <li> I started looking for something other than harsh shampoo/conditioners because my scalp was getting open sores.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner only on the ends of my hair, I only apply a very small amount on my roots every now and then.</li>
            <li> leaves the hair feeling lanky, dry and slightly grimy.</li>
            <li> and I prefer this product to any other Argan oil shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair did not tangle after the product was rinsed out as it does with other shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not feel there was any Argon oil or any other healing or &#x27;conditioning&#x27; properties in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give names of other brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> A few days after using these my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy or dry anymore...</li>
            <li> I would have to use the product to try and make my hair less greasy which, of coarse, only made it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far worse experiences with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair seems a lot healthier and a lot less greasy.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is ridiculous- buy it at your local drugstore for much less.</li>
            <li> My hair usually gets matted once wet as shrinkage occurs and the strands start tangling together.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made my roots a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to so don&#x27;t expect a fruity, heavy smell.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mother because her hair gets perfumed every few months &amp; at 83 the hair has no body  </li>
            <li> For a few years, I&#x27;ve been working triage with a small roster of products that passed the allergy test, and coconut oil as conditioner - which weighs heavily on my hair if I&#x27;m not very precise with the amount, but seemed to mitigate some of the drying damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle was positively dowdy, for a shampoo product with uber-trendy Argan oil and somehow I just felt reassured by the apparent lack of marketing savvy.  </li>
            <li> bad side of it is that you can actually buy these stuff lesser in some grocery than purchase it here in amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to find a reasonably priced shampoo that won&#x27;t irritate my skin and won&#x27;t fry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It did very little and smelled</li>
            <li> Usually, I would leave a water-based conditioner like this one in as part of the LOC method, but for the sake of review I wanted to used these products as instructed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allowed, so</li>
            <li> This was so hard to get to lather in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is privately owned, but I&#x27;m too cynical to not be searching for a backup plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I believe it is privately owned, but I&#x27;m too cynical to not be searching for a backup plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Argan conditioner was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy, frizz-prone hair.</li>
            <li> My thick, 3C/4A hair responds well to Argan Oil and that is one thing that drew me to this product.  </li>
            <li> Looking at the description my wife took it to mean 2 bottles of each product.  </li>
            <li> Not a good Product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> it also leaves a residue on my hair and scalp which seems to be getting worse the longer</li>
            <li> They seriously need to work on the formula!</li>
            <li> This is possibly the worst shampoo and conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> I randomly found this product in the trial section of a drugstore.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through somewhat random trial, I eventually got around to Renpure.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair rough and had a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be somewhat lingering petroleum-based, yet sorta artificially sweat residual smell.</li>
            <li> The smell was annoying while I tried to leave the conditioner in.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo and conditioner i have ever used, plus the smell is just noxious!</li>
            <li> Dont buy this, its a terrible product!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner and works on my curly, sometimes dry, frizzy hair. Good value also.</li>
            <li> wife loves it.  works better then expected.  wife has to use non sulfate now so you need a variety</li>
            <li> This is possibly the worst shampoo and conditioner ever. It made my hair rough and had a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  I have extremely thick curly hair and I prefer this product to any other Argan oil shampoo.  It is inexpensive and the conditioner goes a long way with my hair.  The conditioner is very rich and lasts many washes and leaves my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> Smells nice but NOT GOOD for wavy, curly, thick hair. My hair looks frizzy, brittle and does not feel good.&lt;br /&gt;NO GOOD ;(</li>
            <li> I LOVE these. I started looking for something other than harsh shampoo/conditioners because my scalp was getting open sores. A few days after using these my scalp wasn&#x27;t itchy or dry anymore... I also have naturally curly hair so I always just thought it was naturally frizzy too. After I used the shampoo and conditioner my hair felt very nice and made my natural curl look more tamed. It takes some getting used to so don&#x27;t expect a fruity, heavy smell. It&#x27;s smells pretty plain. However, I can&#x27;t complain- My hair seems a lot healthier and a lot less greasy.</li>
            <li> Perfume alert!!  I was attracted to this product because they describe it as organic and free of certain harmful ingredients.  The product has a strong perfume smell, I had to return it because of the reaction I had to the smell.  The ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be available prior to purchase, so if you are truly looking for natural, organic, conscious product, I&#x27;m sorry to say, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I give zero starts. This is the worst shampoo and conditioner i have ever used, plus the smell is just noxious! This was so hard to get to lather in my hair. Had to use way more shampoo and conditioner than normal. The smell is so chemically smelling and it doesnt go away till your hair is completely dry! My hair looked worse and was much more tangled after using this. Dont buy this, its a terrible product!</li>
            <li> i have been using argan oil products like shampoo and conditioner for more than a year now and i can say im fully satisfied with the result so far. my hair becomes more healthy, thicker and shinny. it actually helps to style the hair i want to. bad side of it is that you can actually buy these stuff lesser in some grocery than purchase it here in amazon. but in terms of the product they are really great and less falling hair for me</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> This really is a 5-star product, but I am giving it a 4-star because of the price Amazon has it listed for.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 32 oz. Shampoo &amp; Conditioner (pump bottles) at Walgreen&#x27;s for $7.99 each. SO MUCH CHEAPER IN THE STORE THAN ON AMAZON!!!.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is AHHHHHMAZING! It smells perfect for a woman or a man. It really is a deliciously pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I am very particular about consistency and texture of my shampoo and conditioner. This shampoo lathers and cleans well and is not watery. The conditioner is thick and coats my hair very well. Other high send products I have experience with, have watery conditioner- ICK... A huge pet peeve of mine!&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this duo for a week, but I can already tell that there is a difference in my hair texture. I have always had healthy hair but  older I get, the more I notice it is getting a little wirey in certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;So far, this duo is taking care of my hair, has reduced the greasiness I experience on the day after washing (with other products), has decreased my scalp itchiness and dryness, and I am excited to see how my hair has improved after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, but NOT FROM AMAZON. I recommend going to your local Walgreen&#x27;s and saving time and money!</li>
            <li> really like softness it gives hair non- greasy like some other products, thanks.........</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy, frizz-prone hair. I bought this shampoo/conditioner based off a friend&#x27;s recommendation. I really wanted to like it, especially since it is the cheapest shampoo I have used in recent years. While it does a good job of taming frizz it also leaves a residue on my hair and scalp which seems to be getting worse the longer I use the product. My hair has never felt so greasy. I will finish up the bottles I have, but definitely would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so good after one wash!</li>
            <li> Conditioner is awesome, but not in love with the shampoo. I prefer a cleaner feel after shampooing. Overall good products though</li>
            <li> I randomly found this product in the trial section of a drugstore. I was pleasantly surprised by how soft it made my hair. As a guy, it&#x27;s not something that I would normally pay attention to but the result was rather noticeable.  I subsequently bought the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon and have again been pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary impact.</li>
            <li> I chose this product for my fine hair to help with the static of the winter months.  It has been amazing!  It does not create much of a lather, but most sulfate free products do not.  I feel that it rinses very clean, and helps my hair stay moisturized.  I would suggest this product to other women who are looking for a lighter shampoo for fine hair.  I also have an issue with my hair becoming very limp and dull from heavy product and this has not caused that issue either!</li>
            <li> I have been testing various hair-softening products for YEARS and I can honestly say that this shampoo &amp; conditioner is, by far, the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.  My hair is very thick, very curly, and somewhat coarse (I am of mixed Central American, Caribbean, and European descent); I have used countless oils, used to get expensive keratin treatments every 3 months, and have tried countless shampoo/conditioners.  This particular argan oil formula is incredible.  Not only is my hair softer, but when I straighten my hair, it STAYS STRAIGHT without need to re-iron for about 2 days.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  I love and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mother because her hair gets perfumed every few months &amp; at 83 the hair has no body  SHE LOVE&#x27;S IT!!!! My mother has been permming her hair since the mid 40&#x27;s so the hair has damage. Mother said her hair has never felt so good &amp; fuller.</li>
            <li> Thanks to recommendations by the natural hair community on YouTube, I was introduced to Renpure Organics Argan Oil Luxurious Shampoo and Conditioner.  My thick, 3C/4A hair responds well to Argan Oil and that is one thing that drew me to this product.  Additionally, it does not contain sodium chloride, salts, dyes, sulfates, parabens, or gluten which is a plus for my sensitive scalp and naturally dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found sample sizes of this product at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.  Now that I have tested it, I am going to buy the full-size using my Amazon Prime membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using these products, I finger detangled my hair by coating each strand with coconut oil then V05 Moisture Milk Conditioner.  This detangling method is recommended by YouTube vlogger @naptural85, and it minimizes breakage while easily removing shed hair. I rinsed my hair with warm water, then applied the Renpure shampoo on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil Shampoo has a light scent of Argan oil and something floral which is great if you&#x27;re not the biggest fan of sweet and fruity scents.  Throughout the application and rinse of the shampoo, I noticed that my fingers slid easily through my strands and to my scalp.  My hair usually gets matted once wet as shrinkage occurs and the strands start tangling together.  This shampoo provides excellent slip and rinsed clean from my hair.  I noticed that my hair did not tangle after the product was rinsed out as it does with other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil Conditioner has an even lighter scent.  I find it reminiscent to Nivea hand lotion. My application for conditioner is from the ends up, stopping before reaching my scalp.  I let it sit for the recommended 2-3 minutes then rinsed it out.  Usually, I would leave a water-based conditioner like this one in as part of the LOC method, but for the sake of review I wanted to used these products as instructed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renpure&#x27;s Argan oil duo left my kinks and coils clean, moisturized, and detangled.  Normally, my shrinkage is immediately evident upon leaving the shower causing tangles if I didn&#x27;t twist my hair for the wash.  However, my hair retained length and my curls clumped together without my help.  That&#x27;s a sign of happy hair.  My hair loved the Argan Oil formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!rized, and detangled.

My hair loved the Argan Oil formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Strong smell but not offensive and wears off soon.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo and conditioner! However, I went to a grocery store and found it for 5 dollars each. So I will be buying from Food City from now on :)</li>
            <li> I recently discovered argan oil and have been buying as many products containing it that I can find. This shampoo and conditioner smells great, works great and I love the way it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Looking at the description my wife took it to mean 2 bottles of each product.  Getting only i bottle each made this a less than economical transaction.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, fine hair. My hair is very soft but the roots tend to get pretty oily. This shampoo only works well if I shampoo TWICE, focusing on my roots. The downfall, I&#x27;m using too much water shampooing my hair twice and it&#x27;s made my roots a little frizzy. I use the conditioner only on the ends of my hair, I only apply a very small amount on my roots every now and then. Not always. I have completely used my shampoo but probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle. *I think this shampoo would work very well for someone who doesn&#x27;t have an oily scalp, because it made the rest of my hair so soft.* I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how soft it is, but I don&#x27;t like to shampoo twice, what a pain! This shampoo also requires a little extra rinsing to be sure you&#x27;ve gotten it all out. 3 stars considering this product is just okay for my specific hair type. I&#x27;ve had far worse experiences with other shampoos. My bf loved using it for his beard though!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. You can really feel the Argan Oil in every scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great.... But save yourself some money... I paid $19.49 for the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon but found it after at Target for only $4.99 each!!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft, gentle enough to use everyday and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. Fly aways are minimal and my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick-but-fine graying hair -- about 50%, my colorist says -- and skin allergies.  It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to find a reasonably priced shampoo that won&#x27;t irritate my skin and won&#x27;t fry my hair.  For a few years, I&#x27;ve been working triage with a small roster of products that passed the allergy test, and coconut oil as conditioner - which weighs heavily on my hair if I&#x27;m not very precise with the amount, but seemed to mitigate some of the drying damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago I looked in the mirror and realized that much of my natural curl was gone, and that my mane resembled an abused Barbie doll&#x27;s coif a bit too closely.  Complete with lots of short, broken hair strands sticking every which way. (That last, from my reading, I&#x27;ve determined may be owing to using coconut oil by itself as a conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went first to the organic products.  When paying the big bucks yielded paltry results, I switched to a a drugstore \\&quot;Purology\\&quot; knockoff.  It did very little and smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through somewhat random trial, I eventually got around to Renpure.  The bottle was positively dowdy, for a shampoo product with uber-trendy Argan oil and somehow I just felt reassured by the apparent lack of marketing savvy.  (And yes, maybe the whole industrial don&#x27;t-care-much-about-shelf-sexiness thing is a strategy in itself.  Whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 5 shampoos in, I could feel my hair start to get softer and see it start to transform from everyday air or blow-dried frizz to actual curls like I used to have.  (I&#x27;ve used all sorts of curling/scrunching products and protectors with silicone to try to bring those curls back and would have my face break out in a severe sunburn-like rash, pretty much every time I tried them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to take longer for the broken hair to grow out, but most of that now is more than three inches long, so I&#x27;ve stopped or at least greatly slowed the breakage cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shampoo and conditioner smell a bit odd, if mild.  It really doesn&#x27;t matter, as the scent doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair anyway, and I prefer to pick my own trusted (allergy-friendly) scents.

It really doesn&#x27;t matter, as the scent doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair anyway, and I prefer to pick my own trusted (allergy-friendly) scents.

            <li> I love this product. It leaves my natural hair feeling great. I would say this would work on anyone&#x27;s hair because it is a pleasant shampoo and conditioning product. For those who want to know if the shampoo creates a lot of suds (which I think some naturals don&#x27;t like since it strips the hair (I don&#x27;t like it either) it does soap up. However, it is a small suds that is barely noticeable. If anyone has used shea moisture shampoo, it is like that where there is little to no noticeability of suds so it does not strip your hair of its natural oils but it does leave your hair feeling clean before you move on to the conditioner (unlike shea moisture for me at least). Overall, if someone wants a great product, I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I see result in the softness of my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Walmart. My hair looked healthier after the first use but a week later I started noticing it was becoming a little greasy. I would have to use the product to try and make my hair less greasy which, of coarse, only made it worse. I finally threw the products away and I&#x27;ve never looked back!</li>
            <li> Not a good Product!&lt;br /&gt;I leaves the hair feeling lanky, dry and slightly grimy. As if it&#x27;s not been cleaned but actually coated in something. On top pf that it made my skin break out - like previous reviews mentioned. I was willing to give it a try but that was a big mistake. Returning it immediately. Do not try it.&lt;br /&gt;I could understand that some shampoos may cause reaction in a sensitive skin and some people might be allergic to something - but this! This leaves your hair dirtier than when you stared. They seriously need to work on the formula!</li>
            <li> My hair is very pretty and soft after using this product for a couple weeks. But with this product my hair must be washed more frequently as it makes it a bit oily.  And I am no teenager.</li>
            <li> As with all non-sulfate shampoos this doesn&#x27;t lather, which is fine, but I still don&#x27;t like it much. I wish it had a little thinner consistency to go on easier especially since I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> The Argan conditioner was such a disappointment. Others here had mentioned problems with the smell and I found it to be somewhat lingering petroleum-based, yet sorta artificially sweat residual smell. Not good. The smell was annoying while I tried to leave the conditioner in. I did not feel there was any Argon oil or any other healing or &#x27;conditioning&#x27; properties in this product. I wear my hair short and natural without chemical straighteners and found Renpure conditioner very drying, leaving my hair MORE tangled at the roots than from using other brands of conditioner. I expected more from this product claiming to contain argan oil. I do not feel there is any healing oil in this product. Shine was maintained but my hair was BONE dry and I had to spend more time using other conditioners and oils to get my hair back right until I shampooed the Renpure results out my next shampoo. Try Agadir if you want a better argan oil product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these. However, I just bought this conditioner at Walgreens yesterday for 5.99 a bottle. Amazon&#x27;s price is ridiculous- buy it at your local drugstore for much less.</li>
            <li> Real quick delivery. Love the way my hair feels after using these two.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand to others I&#x27;ve used... previously I used another brand and thought I&#x27;d try this one since it was on sale and discovered it was much better... I&#x27;d give names of other brands I&#x27;ve used but  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m allowed, so if you want to know just ask in a direct question....</li>
