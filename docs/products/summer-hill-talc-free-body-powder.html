            <li> Alas, it is discontinued and therefore any left in the universe comes at a premium.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a body powder.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this item which was ordered over a month ago.</li>

            <li> I love the scent, and it layers very nicely with the bodywash and lotion. I get a whiff of the fragrance all day, without it being overpowering. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> SUMMER HILL by Crabtree &amp; Evelyn has a nice, gentle and pleasant scent.  I purchase the Talc-Free Power and sprinkle it in the closets and on the bathroom rugs.  You can also wear it on your body or put it on your clothing.  It makes you and the house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Love the powder.  I do have a problem with the price.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Summer Hill.  Still, I wished that they still made it in &amp;#34; bath powder&amp;#34; form with powder puff, not just the tin can form.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same high guality that all C &amp; E products are and very cooling to use in the summer, especially.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this item which was ordered over a month ago. And I am down to the last few drops of product and practically scrapping the side of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a nightly and daily ritual for me to use these product after evry shower and bath. I love my lotions, gels, and powders. I don&#x27;t think I can go with out them. Please assist and forward my items.....Thank you so much</li>

            <li> Nice scent.  Hard to find a body powder.  A little expensive?</li>
            <li> It is very fine, light powder, with a pleasant scent, but the delivery methode needs work. It tends to poof out of the top, whenever you set the bottle down. I will purchase a non-talc from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn again, but I might try a different scent.</li>

            <li> I am a repeat buyer!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful powder and the scent lasts a long while. I also ordered the body lotion and bar soap to match. All are great.</li>
