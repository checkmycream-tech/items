    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I thought that since there is not a lot of sun in our winters, I could use Age Perfect SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Age Perfect is a wonderful cream that moisturizes your skin, helps reverse the visible process of aging AND protects your face from sun damage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;May switch to Age Perfect products after my Revitalift is gone.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Having the opportunity to test it out before I buy it is especially nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have not found that perfect product that will help diminish my lines, I continue to spend my money on products.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent.</li>
            <li>The perfect gift for my mom.</li>
            <li>This one has worked the best on my aging skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Age Perfect Day Cream by L&#x27;Oreal for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>This is a very good product!</li>
            <li>and I started using Age Perfect and in 6 months they were gone.</li>
            <li>good price as well!</li>
            <li>I was happy to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li>I wore it under makeup and it looked great all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It includes a sunscreen SPF 15 which is a great habit to get into but can sometimes make skin look greasy, not with this product</li>
            <li>Great product to wear under make-up.</li>
            <li>product recommends a strict regimen of their products and that might be great for someone else.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is great too.</li>
            <li>I bike every day, so this is a great non-greasy way of getting some sun screen, and a mositurizer in one application</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this \\&quot;perfect day cream\\&quot; by Loreal.</li>
            <li>box is a real interesting piece of work.</li>
            <li>I use both now and, before I received the free Age Perfect cream from Amazon Vine, I had been using it for about 6 or 8 months.  </li>
            <li>so it is a good value as well.</li>
            <li>but I am hoping that the two together will produce good effects over time.  </li>
            <li>A good daytime cream for the money.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was good</li>
            <li>You would not get this always on good price</li>
            <li>but as per brand the product was good for use...</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal products, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>And the skin on my face looked as good as it</li>
            <li>but it does moisturize my face and thats a good reason to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 with my fair share of sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>4 stars is a really good rating from me.</li>
            <li>She loved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved it, good service</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my skin feel moist and it has a very pleasant and light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased I have a great product to stand by.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect Day Cream SPF 15 is a pretty good daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>&quot;  Love it!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t honestly tell if it is lightening my skin</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling under or over moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Although sometimes when the weather is really warm and humid, I prefer applying a lighter cream.</li>
            <li>The SPF 15 was effective in protecting the skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li>have always liked having a separate day cream and richer night cream.</li>
            <li>It does the job nicely within minutes of application, with no need for night cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much for my skin in the summer, but perfect in the winter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a nice day cream by itself, and you can wear it alone or under your makeup.</li>
            <li>While I do like the nice, creamy texture, an hour after applying, my skin feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying this new Age Perfect cream which contains soy seed proteins.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect is a good product at a moderate price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable for my budget, has a nice light scent and it feels good going on.  </li>
            <li>Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin turned out to be a very rich, moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>but it is nice to get more product in the Age Perfect and both products cost the same.  </li>
            <li>Some people (with oily skin) may not care for it, but I use it consistently and am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect Day Cream is indeed perfect for mature skin, and for younger persons, also.  </li>
            <li>It just would be nice if they made them scent free.  </li>
            <li>OK, so I&#x27;m lying again.</li>
            <li>Most look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect Day Cream didn&#x27;t affect the application of my cosmetics or turn them a different shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the company &amp; the products.</li>
            <li>MY WRINKLE ARE SOFTERS, MY FACE IS NOW BETTER</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it more than twice to be able to review its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>guess my love for L&#x27;Oreal products is a result of having lived in France for so many years and having used their shampoos, cleansers, creams.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and the sun has not added any more age spots since I started using \\&quot;Age Perfect.\\</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I received this product and the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>my skin always feels clean, no build ups of any kind.</li>
            <li>Then you can smooth the BB cream over it for a nice smooth finish because the two products work together</li>
            <li>but this one does an excellent job of keeping those fine lines at bay and tackling dry patches.</li>
            <li>I put my makeup on top of it and it goes on smooth as well.</li>
            <li>It absorbed nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>(she loved perfume too, so her bathroom always smelled very floral.)  </li>
            <li>I have been using the age perfect night cream longer, about a month and a half, and I like it even better</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin of my face and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>This cream is nice to the touch and although it says day cream, it is just the right consistency for my night time cream too and it has an spf 15 sunscreen incorported too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very, very mild.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend with my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy with the soft, smooth way my face feels and my make-up applies evenly over it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not noxious, it&#x27;s just so strong that I felt overwhelmed by it.</li>
            <li>It does have a rather strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars, except for the unnecessarily strong scent that gave it.</li>
            <li>and I do even think that I am seeing my dark spots fading which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed, and I think this will be a part of my daily skin care regimen going forward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed no brightening or smoothing of fine lines or wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a huge tub - which seems somewhat unhygienic to me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the smell that was a huge turn off for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This cream goes on smoothly and feels as if it is going to be greasy.  </li>
            <li>My skin is already light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, not greasy and my skin never turned oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and has a glow</li>
            <li>I would think this is a great facial cream that has anti-sagging and anti-age spot ingredients that hydrates the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I like the way it goes onto my face smoothly and absorbs into the skin and takes away dryness.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels moisturized and smooth after each application.</li>
            <li>The price is great, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Since I am in my early 50&#x27;s I thought this cream might be a good choice for my skin.</li>
            <li>Also good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product good for dry skin...</li>
            <li>While I cannot say that this product is fabulous, it&#x27;s not bad either</li>
            <li>Full of cheap ingredients with lots of hype, this is one brand to stay away from.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t bother my skin; it went on nice &amp; smooth &amp; didn&#x27;t dry out quickly; felt kind of satiny.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the skin - it really soaks in.</li>
            <li>, it is good because it brings more amount than other presentations.</li>
            <li>female friend loved it</li>
            <li>I love perfume, but I prefer to choose the scents that I wear, and I would never choose a scent like this one: it really does smell like my grandma&#x27;s bathroom</li>
            <li>This is a good basic moisturizer, and has made my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li>The product is full of mineral oil, parabens, and reads like a science lab.</li>
            <li>My face felt nice and soft, and it took the itch away.</li>
            <li>Both the day and night creams have pretty strong smells that are probably not what I would like</li>
            <li>Most companies, including Avon, normally package all of their creams and lotions in 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li>I love the rich white cream and the wonderful delicate</li>
            <li>This is an excellent skin creme, and even if you use the BB cream, you will also want to use this especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>and was surprised there was a similar product L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin with Soy Seed Proteins, SPF 15 in a 2 1/2 ounce size jar.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles except some light lines by my eyes</li>
            <li>Complete Day Cream SPF 18 - 48g/1.7oz]] for over 10 years or more</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with it&#x27;s effects so far.  </li>
            <li>so maybe worth a try anyway.</li>
            <li>I found my skin to be much more hydrated than I expected, and the effect has been much better than the Olay serum/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but it was worth noting.</li>
            <li>I am 60, have sensitive skin,no age spots and not too many wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been using a whole line of L&#x27;Oreal creams for mature sensitive skin: Nutrissime, Revitalift Complete, Triple Power, Age Perfect hydra-nutrition.</li>
            <li>I put this cream on my face in the morning and used it for several weeks while we had nice sunny days.</li>
            <li>I always wait about 10 minutes before putting powder so the cream will get a chance to be absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with ivory soap and have for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>I rarely scrub or put astringent on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this for a week and like 99% of facial products, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer but does not do much for creases and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Since most women who like perfume are generally pretty picky about, I don&#x27;t understand why L&amp;oacute;real would intentional pour such a strong, floral scent into this cream.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is very creamy and rich.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice subtle fragrance, not oily, and leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>right away;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hey, they have to sell their products to stay in business, right?  </li>
            <li>It has all the qualities I look for in a face cream for aging skin, and the price is right, too.</li>
            <li>Your skin will soak it right up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy, has a light pleasant fragrance and an spf of 15.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has mature skin and wants a gentle yet very effective face cream for daytime or really anytime.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount to be effective, making this a good value.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Brightens and smoothes mature skin while reducing the appearance of age spots, fine lines, and surface wrinkles\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am always excited to try their new products.</li>
            <li>This one did not look oily and overall my skin looked better.</li>
            <li>But the scent was oppressive and I was constantly aware that the product was on my face.</li>
            <li>I was interested to review this product, since I use L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift skin regimen.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a higher SPF</li>
            <li>When I got the L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect cream, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is thick, creamy and does a great job of moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>May be okay for younger skin type.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any measurable difference in the tone of my skin, but I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks, so perhaps I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is the thickness.</li>
            <li>Repeated daily use appeared to produce better looking results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also tried the Day/Night cream which she ultimately prefers to this as she believes it is more versatile.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and more elastic when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>ITS  A GOOD PRODCUTAND HAVE BEEN USING FEW YEARS</li>
            <li>I tried this a little over a year ago and have been very satisfied with the results and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>One of the most dramatic improvements I&#x27;ve found using this skin care product over the others that contain SPF 15 sunblock, is how quickly and easily it blends into your skin, without leaving that highly noticeable white residue that most creams leave on the surface of the skin from the titanium oxide ingredients most of them contain.  </li>
            <li>It works great, goes on easy, and you only need a really small amount.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any makeup other than lipstick, so L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day must do the job of making my aging skin appear less wrinkled, without leaving a shiny film.  </li>
            <li>which is surprising since the third and fourth ingredients are glycerine and mineral oil.</li>
            <li>So far my skin feels more soft and I am seeing some firming results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use much product during the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This cream has a nice balance; it moisturizes, protects, smooths and reduces dark spots all without being greasy on my fussy skin.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is nice, but SPF 15 not really adequate for prolonged outdoors.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to slide onto my face and neck and last all day.</li>
            <li>I like that it absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>The jar is quite large, and will probably supply a consumer 2-3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I am younger than the target age for this but have fair skin that tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li>I have found that if I wet my fingertips with a little water before applying the cream it goes on more smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Beta hydroxy acid complex helps improve the appearance of age spots, fine lines, and surface wrinkles while soy seed proteins improve elasticity for more toned, supple and resilient skin\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I really wish that skin care and cosmetic products would stop putting scents into their formulas.</li>
            <li>I went on walks, did gardening, wanted to check how much protection the SPF 15 gave me.</li>
            <li>really like this L&#x27;Oreal Day Cream.</li>
            <li>really?  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is a reasonable price of 12.00 is another.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything</li>
            <li>The SPF 15 has really help reduce the age spots.  </li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of moisture for my 58 year old skin and it keeps the age spots off.</li>
            <li>My face never got that &amp;#34;sticky mask&amp;#34; sensation that so many other moisturizers leave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a rich cream that is uniquely non-greasy, although it does take a little time to &#x27;sink in&#x27;.</li>
            <li>try to find in some other store where you may get in better price...</li>
            <li>in fact I use it maybe 6 times a year, so I am probably more sensitive to scents than most women, but to me this cream smelled so overpoweringly of old-fashioned floral perfume that I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with people that promise more or give half truths to sell something and this might be one of those instances</li>
            <li>Best day cream for the price and very comparable to the very expensive high end creams.</li>
            <li>found that my skin was losing elasticity, forming more lines and dark spots.</li>
            <li>so better keep looking the price whenever it go down</li>
            <li>It glides right onto your skin, and although it&#x27;s thick, it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>By the time I finish doing my morning regimen and get ready to put on my makeup, it has totally been absorbed.  </li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t have that sensitivity, I think it is a really decent</li>
            <li>well yeah, we&#x27;re getting older.  </li>
            <li>I can usually find at least one good thing to say about most products, but with this one I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Her comment was essentially that she could do without this, but really liked the other two products.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent which I do not really care for, but it&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
            <li>So, I put it on, waited my normal 10 minutes, and went to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li>this is a nice thick cream &amp; it works.</li>
            <li>and I bought 2 jars thinking I was getting the old formula if you have any of the old formula for the L&#x27;oreal day moisturizer I&#x27;d like to exchange!!!.</li>
            <li>and I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new day cream.</li>
            <li>new in the box.  </li>
            <li>think the price is unbelievably low for this quality product and I no longer buy my L&#x27;Oreal creams during my trips to France, as the price here is the same as in their huge supermarket</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for a few years now and it has become my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Possibly one must use it for a lot longer and buy lots more bottles of it, but I am not willing to make that bet.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different creams with all different price ranges and was pleasantly surprised that this is one I actually like.</li>
            <li>When I wore dark colors I could see a white ring at the top of the collar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid more money for facial products that did less for the look and feel of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As little as possible is what my faces likes and the more I do to it</li>
            <li>I AM 65 YEARS OLD, AND THIS PRODUCTS HELP ME EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li>This burns my skin, so if you have sensitive skin, I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My face felt so wonderfully soft after using this cream.</li>
            <li>The cream feels silky soft as it goes on.</li>
            <li>I frequently run into problems with lots of creams that either irritate my skin or nose.  </li>
            <li>I apply it at night, and use the L&#x27;Oreal Complete for daytime.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She loves it so far</li>
            <li>If you are chemically sensitive, as I am, I would recommend either passing on this product or not putting it on your face at night.  </li>
            <li>It is a rich cream that needs just a little bit to thoroughly cover and moisturize.</li>
            <li>the positive side, minor flaws did seem to disappear.</li>
            <li>I ordered several items from different people, and this was the first to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for a moisturizer, the L&#x27;Oreal name, the SPF 15, and slightly larger than normal ounces.</li>
            <li>scent is a little overpowering and it leaves my face looking super greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and used to use pure oil then moisturizer until my friend recommended this.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because of the SPF 15 broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other ladies obviously like the scent, and it probably adds to their enjoyment in using this cream, but for those who have sensitive sniffers, or who are allergic to floral scents, you might want to avoid this one.</li>
            <li>First, I should reveal that I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough or regularly enough to notice any reduction in wrinkles or spots (and I have plenty of both), so I can&#x27;t say what sort of results you might find in that arena.</li>
            <li>Since the jars looked the same as the old ones except for the fact that soy product was used in the formula and that was listed on the labeling.  </li>
            <li>Even if a product doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claims, I would continue to use it, especially it might be beneficial in the long run.  </li>
            <li>Just your average moisturizer with too much fragrance.</li>
            <li>have never had any trouble or any reaction to the the creams or lotions from L&#x27;Oreal and my facial skin is smooth - not flaky or rough.  </li>
            <li>At first it was not available and they sent the BB cream which she loves and for which we now subscribe on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely do not like this new moisturizer</li>
            <li>although, immediately after putting it on I feel like they are less noticible because of the way it really soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price range, but people should not expect miracles from it or any other age related products, regardless of price.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and have dry skin.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I thought that since there is not a lot of sun in our winters, I could use Age Perfect SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Age Perfect is a wonderful cream that moisturizes your skin, helps reverse the visible process of aging AND protects your face from sun damage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;May switch to Age Perfect products after my Revitalift is gone.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Having the opportunity to test it out before I buy it is especially nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have not found that perfect product that will help diminish my lines, I continue to spend my money on products.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> This one has worked the best on my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Age Perfect Day Cream by L&#x27;Oreal for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> This is a very good product!</li>
            <li> and I started using Age Perfect and in 6 months they were gone.</li>
            <li> good price as well!</li>
            <li> I was happy to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am quite happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I wore it under makeup and it looked great all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It includes a sunscreen SPF 15 which is a great habit to get into but can sometimes make skin look greasy, not with this product</li>
            <li> Great product to wear under make-up.</li>
            <li> product recommends a strict regimen of their products and that might be great for someone else.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is great too.</li>
            <li> I bike every day, so this is a great non-greasy way of getting some sun screen, and a mositurizer in one application</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this \\&quot;perfect day cream\\&quot; by Loreal.</li>
            <li> box is a real interesting piece of work.</li>
            <li> I use both now and, before I received the free Age Perfect cream from Amazon Vine, I had been using it for about 6 or 8 months.  </li>
            <li> so it is a good value as well.</li>
            <li> but I am hoping that the two together will produce good effects over time.  </li>
            <li> A good daytime cream for the money.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was good</li>
            <li> You would not get this always on good price</li>
            <li> but as per brand the product was good for use...</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal products, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> And the skin on my face looked as good as it</li>
            <li> but it does moisturize my face and thats a good reason to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 with my fair share of sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars is a really good rating from me.</li>
            <li> She loved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved it, good service</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel moist and it has a very pleasant and light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased I have a great product to stand by.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect Day Cream SPF 15 is a pretty good daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> &quot;  Love it!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t honestly tell if it is lightening my skin</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling under or over moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Although sometimes when the weather is really warm and humid, I prefer applying a lighter cream.</li>
            <li> The SPF 15 was effective in protecting the skin from sun damage.</li>
            <li> have always liked having a separate day cream and richer night cream.</li>
            <li> It does the job nicely within minutes of application, with no need for night cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much for my skin in the summer, but perfect in the winter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a nice day cream by itself, and you can wear it alone or under your makeup.</li>
            <li> While I do like the nice, creamy texture, an hour after applying, my skin feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this new Age Perfect cream which contains soy seed proteins.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect is a good product at a moderate price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable for my budget, has a nice light scent and it feels good going on.  </li>
            <li> Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin turned out to be a very rich, moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> but it is nice to get more product in the Age Perfect and both products cost the same.  </li>
            <li> Some people (with oily skin) may not care for it, but I use it consistently and am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect Day Cream is indeed perfect for mature skin, and for younger persons, also.  </li>
            <li> It just would be nice if they made them scent free.  </li>
            <li> OK, so I&#x27;m lying again.</li>
            <li> Most look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect Day Cream didn&#x27;t affect the application of my cosmetics or turn them a different shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the company &amp; the products.</li>
            <li> MY WRINKLE ARE SOFTERS, MY FACE IS NOW BETTER</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it more than twice to be able to review its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> guess my love for L&#x27;Oreal products is a result of having lived in France for so many years and having used their shampoos, cleansers, creams.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and the sun has not added any more age spots since I started using \\&quot;Age Perfect.\\</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I received this product and the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance.</li>
            <li> I have used this many times.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> my skin always feels clean, no build ups of any kind.</li>
            <li> Then you can smooth the BB cream over it for a nice smooth finish because the two products work together</li>
            <li> but this one does an excellent job of keeping those fine lines at bay and tackling dry patches.</li>
            <li> I put my makeup on top of it and it goes on smooth as well.</li>
            <li> It absorbed nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> (she loved perfume too, so her bathroom always smelled very floral.)  </li>
            <li> I have been using the age perfect night cream longer, about a month and a half, and I like it even better</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin of my face and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> This cream is nice to the touch and although it says day cream, it is just the right consistency for my night time cream too and it has an spf 15 sunscreen incorported too.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very, very mild.  </li>
            <li> Easy to blend with my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am happy with the soft, smooth way my face feels and my make-up applies evenly over it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not noxious, it&#x27;s just so strong that I felt overwhelmed by it.</li>
            <li> It does have a rather strong scent.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, except for the unnecessarily strong scent that gave it.</li>
            <li> and I do even think that I am seeing my dark spots fading which is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed, and I think this will be a part of my daily skin care regimen going forward.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed no brightening or smoothing of fine lines or wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a huge tub - which seems somewhat unhygienic to me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the smell that was a huge turn off for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This cream goes on smoothly and feels as if it is going to be greasy.  </li>
            <li> My skin is already light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, not greasy and my skin never turned oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and has a glow</li>
            <li> I would think this is a great facial cream that has anti-sagging and anti-age spot ingredients that hydrates the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I like the way it goes onto my face smoothly and absorbs into the skin and takes away dryness.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels moisturized and smooth after each application.</li>
            <li> The price is great, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Since I am in my early 50&#x27;s I thought this cream might be a good choice for my skin.</li>
            <li> Also good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product good for dry skin...</li>
            <li> While I cannot say that this product is fabulous, it&#x27;s not bad either</li>
            <li> Full of cheap ingredients with lots of hype, this is one brand to stay away from.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t bother my skin; it went on nice &amp; smooth &amp; didn&#x27;t dry out quickly; felt kind of satiny.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the skin - it really soaks in.</li>
            <li> , it is good because it brings more amount than other presentations.</li>
            <li> female friend loved it</li>
            <li> I love perfume, but I prefer to choose the scents that I wear, and I would never choose a scent like this one: it really does smell like my grandma&#x27;s bathroom</li>
            <li> This is a good basic moisturizer, and has made my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> The product is full of mineral oil, parabens, and reads like a science lab.</li>
            <li> My face felt nice and soft, and it took the itch away.</li>
            <li> Both the day and night creams have pretty strong smells that are probably not what I would like</li>
            <li> Most companies, including Avon, normally package all of their creams and lotions in 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> I love the rich white cream and the wonderful delicate</li>
            <li> This is an excellent skin creme, and even if you use the BB cream, you will also want to use this especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> and was surprised there was a similar product L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin with Soy Seed Proteins, SPF 15 in a 2 1/2 ounce size jar.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles except some light lines by my eyes</li>
            <li> Complete Day Cream SPF 18 - 48g/1.7oz]] for over 10 years or more</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with it&#x27;s effects so far.  </li>
            <li> so maybe worth a try anyway.</li>
            <li> I found my skin to be much more hydrated than I expected, and the effect has been much better than the Olay serum/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but it was worth noting.</li>
            <li> I am 60, have sensitive skin,no age spots and not too many wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using a whole line of L&#x27;Oreal creams for mature sensitive skin: Nutrissime, Revitalift Complete, Triple Power, Age Perfect hydra-nutrition.</li>
            <li> I put this cream on my face in the morning and used it for several weeks while we had nice sunny days.</li>
            <li> I always wait about 10 minutes before putting powder so the cream will get a chance to be absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with ivory soap and have for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> I rarely scrub or put astringent on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for a week and like 99% of facial products, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer but does not do much for creases and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Since most women who like perfume are generally pretty picky about, I don&#x27;t understand why L&amp;oacute;real would intentional pour such a strong, floral scent into this cream.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is very creamy and rich.  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice subtle fragrance, not oily, and leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> right away;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hey, they have to sell their products to stay in business, right?  </li>
            <li> It has all the qualities I look for in a face cream for aging skin, and the price is right, too.</li>
            <li> Your skin will soak it right up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy, has a light pleasant fragrance and an spf of 15.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has mature skin and wants a gentle yet very effective face cream for daytime or really anytime.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to be effective, making this a good value.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Brightens and smoothes mature skin while reducing the appearance of age spots, fine lines, and surface wrinkles\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am always excited to try their new products.</li>
            <li> This one did not look oily and overall my skin looked better.</li>
            <li> But the scent was oppressive and I was constantly aware that the product was on my face.</li>
            <li> I was interested to review this product, since I use L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a higher SPF</li>
            <li> When I got the L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect cream, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick, creamy and does a great job of moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> May be okay for younger skin type.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any measurable difference in the tone of my skin, but I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks, so perhaps I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is the thickness.</li>
            <li> Repeated daily use appeared to produce better looking results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also tried the Day/Night cream which she ultimately prefers to this as she believes it is more versatile.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more elastic when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> ITS  A GOOD PRODCUTAND HAVE BEEN USING FEW YEARS</li>
            <li> I tried this a little over a year ago and have been very satisfied with the results and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> One of the most dramatic improvements I&#x27;ve found using this skin care product over the others that contain SPF 15 sunblock, is how quickly and easily it blends into your skin, without leaving that highly noticeable white residue that most creams leave on the surface of the skin from the titanium oxide ingredients most of them contain.  </li>
            <li> It works great, goes on easy, and you only need a really small amount.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any makeup other than lipstick, so L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day must do the job of making my aging skin appear less wrinkled, without leaving a shiny film.  </li>
            <li> which is surprising since the third and fourth ingredients are glycerine and mineral oil.</li>
            <li> So far my skin feels more soft and I am seeing some firming results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use much product during the hot summer months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This cream has a nice balance; it moisturizes, protects, smooths and reduces dark spots all without being greasy on my fussy skin.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is nice, but SPF 15 not really adequate for prolonged outdoors.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to slide onto my face and neck and last all day.</li>
            <li> I like that it absorbs quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> The jar is quite large, and will probably supply a consumer 2-3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I am younger than the target age for this but have fair skin that tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if I wet my fingertips with a little water before applying the cream it goes on more smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Beta hydroxy acid complex helps improve the appearance of age spots, fine lines, and surface wrinkles while soy seed proteins improve elasticity for more toned, supple and resilient skin\\&quot;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I really wish that skin care and cosmetic products would stop putting scents into their formulas.</li>
            <li> I went on walks, did gardening, wanted to check how much protection the SPF 15 gave me.</li>
            <li> really like this L&#x27;Oreal Day Cream.</li>
            <li> really?  </li>
            <li> The fact that it is a reasonable price of 12.00 is another.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for everything</li>
            <li> The SPF 15 has really help reduce the age spots.  </li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of moisture for my 58 year old skin and it keeps the age spots off.</li>
            <li> My face never got that &amp;#34;sticky mask&amp;#34; sensation that so many other moisturizers leave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a rich cream that is uniquely non-greasy, although it does take a little time to &#x27;sink in&#x27;.</li>
            <li> try to find in some other store where you may get in better price...</li>
            <li> in fact I use it maybe 6 times a year, so I am probably more sensitive to scents than most women, but to me this cream smelled so overpoweringly of old-fashioned floral perfume that I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with people that promise more or give half truths to sell something and this might be one of those instances</li>
            <li> Best day cream for the price and very comparable to the very expensive high end creams.</li>
            <li> found that my skin was losing elasticity, forming more lines and dark spots.</li>
            <li> so better keep looking the price whenever it go down</li>
            <li> It glides right onto your skin, and although it&#x27;s thick, it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> By the time I finish doing my morning regimen and get ready to put on my makeup, it has totally been absorbed.  </li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t have that sensitivity, I think it is a really decent</li>
            <li> well yeah, we&#x27;re getting older.  </li>
            <li> I can usually find at least one good thing to say about most products, but with this one I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Her comment was essentially that she could do without this, but really liked the other two products.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent which I do not really care for, but it&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
            <li> So, I put it on, waited my normal 10 minutes, and went to put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> this is a nice thick cream &amp; it works.</li>
            <li> and I bought 2 jars thinking I was getting the old formula if you have any of the old formula for the L&#x27;oreal day moisturizer I&#x27;d like to exchange!!!.</li>
            <li> and I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new day cream.</li>
            <li> new in the box.  </li>
            <li> think the price is unbelievably low for this quality product and I no longer buy my L&#x27;Oreal creams during my trips to France, as the price here is the same as in their huge supermarket</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for a few years now and it has become my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> Possibly one must use it for a lot longer and buy lots more bottles of it, but I am not willing to make that bet.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different creams with all different price ranges and was pleasantly surprised that this is one I actually like.</li>
            <li> When I wore dark colors I could see a white ring at the top of the collar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid more money for facial products that did less for the look and feel of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As little as possible is what my faces likes and the more I do to it</li>
            <li> I AM 65 YEARS OLD, AND THIS PRODUCTS HELP ME EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> This burns my skin, so if you have sensitive skin, I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My face felt so wonderfully soft after using this cream.</li>
            <li> The cream feels silky soft as it goes on.</li>
            <li> I frequently run into problems with lots of creams that either irritate my skin or nose.  </li>
            <li> I apply it at night, and use the L&#x27;Oreal Complete for daytime.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She loves it so far</li>
            <li> If you are chemically sensitive, as I am, I would recommend either passing on this product or not putting it on your face at night.  </li>
            <li> It is a rich cream that needs just a little bit to thoroughly cover and moisturize.</li>
            <li> the positive side, minor flaws did seem to disappear.</li>
            <li> I ordered several items from different people, and this was the first to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for a moisturizer, the L&#x27;Oreal name, the SPF 15, and slightly larger than normal ounces.</li>
            <li> scent is a little overpowering and it leaves my face looking super greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and used to use pure oil then moisturizer until my friend recommended this.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of the SPF 15 broad spectrum protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other ladies obviously like the scent, and it probably adds to their enjoyment in using this cream, but for those who have sensitive sniffers, or who are allergic to floral scents, you might want to avoid this one.</li>
            <li> First, I should reveal that I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough or regularly enough to notice any reduction in wrinkles or spots (and I have plenty of both), so I can&#x27;t say what sort of results you might find in that arena.</li>
            <li> Since the jars looked the same as the old ones except for the fact that soy product was used in the formula and that was listed on the labeling.  </li>
            <li> Even if a product doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claims, I would continue to use it, especially it might be beneficial in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Just your average moisturizer with too much fragrance.</li>
            <li> have never had any trouble or any reaction to the the creams or lotions from L&#x27;Oreal and my facial skin is smooth - not flaky or rough.  </li>
            <li> At first it was not available and they sent the BB cream which she loves and for which we now subscribe on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely do not like this new moisturizer</li>
            <li> although, immediately after putting it on I feel like they are less noticible because of the way it really soaks into your skin.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price range, but people should not expect miracles from it or any other age related products, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is very thick, rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> No wonder my skin looked dull and tired and felt shrunken - kind of the opposite of their marketing hype.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know if I simply got a bad jar or if they all smell like this.  </li>
            <li> Thick and rich, this heavily fragranced cream promises skin improvement and sun protection.</li>
            <li> Smell aside, it&#x27;s also pretty heavy and little greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> After only three weeks of daily use, the dark spots on my forehead are noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li> I had a long review written about this</li>
            <li> as long as I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive, but can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> And even though I have oily skin, I was also noticing dry spots and some flaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also made my face feel dry and drawn.</li>
            <li> I used it and my skin still appeared dry and lines did not diminish.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this day cream works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin because of the weather &amp; the cream softens it over night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t notice any major difference in my skin after using it for 3 weeks, but I do like how creamy it is, the scent is unnoticeable after a few minutes and it isn&#x27;t too greasy</li>
            <li> It is heavier in consistency than the day cream I normally use, but it&#x27;s not been a negative feature.</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive brands, to more affordable and this is where I have landed.</li>
            <li> After only a few days I notice a breaking out and dry flaky patches, I didn&#x27;t realize what the cause was, so</li>
            <li> Not much that I can see</li>
            <li> so I can only use this a few times a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles didn&#x27;t completely disappear since I started using it (which was around a year ago) but they definitely haven&#x27;t gotten any worse, either....</li>
            <li> But after a single use, I wasn&#x27;t inclined to make a long project out of it because it&#x27;s so heavily scented that I felt like I was leaving a scent trail wherever I went.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how long I used the previous day cream but</li>
            <li> I also noticed that even with the limited use (just a couple of weeks), the cream has had an impact on the dark spots.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this cream, so apply sparingly.</li>
            <li> I recommend you try this product due to</li>
            <li> It does not make my face shiny like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I have other Loreal products</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, due to the mineral oil, I would not buy this product again.  </li>
            <li> I will also look into some of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other skin care products soon.</li>
            <li> Be careful about applying it on your neck close to your collar when wearing dark tops.</li>
            <li> It starts by saying how menopause effects our skin, how it starts the sagging process due to hormonal changes...</li>
            <li> (though it still feels a little greasy on my very dry skin compared to other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; allergic to something that they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be about the same quality as other BBs I have tried lately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using an Olay combo serum/moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t address the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it will help my skin NOT to sag or to take care of my dark spots</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you only have to use very small amounts as well.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe you get less of Revitalift because it has a stronger SPF number (18).</li>
            <li> I recently tried a fairly expensive one, and ended up back to this.</li>
            <li> face felt less tight and the wrinkles and creases were noticeably lessened by the end of the week</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem sticky on me and its IN my skin in the morning and not all over my pillow or in a sticky mess on my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, not greasy or oily feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the luxurious texture did not result in soft, moist skin for me.</li>
            <li> My skin felt moisturized and hydrated but did not feel heavy, greasy, or sticky.</li>
            <li> I take all of my makeup off everyday and wash my face twice a day...with ivory.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and see that the wrinkles and lines are kept in check.  </li>
            <li> I started having age spots on my cheeks a few years ago</li>
            <li> When I have it on, I can smell it all day long, and to me it&#x27;s not a pleasant</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it under my make-up as it is a little thick for me on the days I wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s really very little to recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The weird scent goes away after a short time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or excessively aromatic.  </li>
            <li> Not as bad as the new day/night moisturizer that I tried</li>
            <li> but my throat is not nice</li>
            <li> I may write like my grandma but at least I don&#x27;t smell like her.  </li>
            <li> at least 3 years(I think)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for awhile now and agree that it makes a subtle difference, but it&#x27;s not magic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It did not absorb and lay heavily upon my skin, suffocating my pores.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Your experience may vary, but mine was not good.</li>
            <li> I hate to say I have mature skin</li>
            <li> I found it sort of irritating to my eyes</li>
            <li> the worse it looks and feels to</li>
            <li> continued use made the problem worse and worse.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of an old bottle of suntan lotion, the one you&#x27;ve been hanging on to for a year or two &amp; smells awful when applied.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream, like cold cream.</li>
            <li> So even though  imperfections were  diminished, it is unlikely I will use this again.</li>
            <li> but I think its expensive as per the price and quantity...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately though I didn&#x27;t read the ingredient list until I used the product for 10 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I used it</li>
            <li> I hydrates my skin well, without any annoying greasiness.  </li>
            <li> and I hated having to put on sunblock over my face cream.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Face and Throat Day Cream SPF 18  [[ASIN:B005IYOJ3W L&#x27;Oreal Skin Expertise RevitaLift Complete Day Cream SPF 18 - 48g/1.7oz]] for over 10 years or more and was surprised there was a similar product L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin with Soy Seed Proteins, SPF 15 in a 2 1/2 ounce size jar.  Revitalift is only 1.7 oz.  I thought maybe you get less of Revitalift because it has a stronger SPF number (18). I use both now and, before I received the free Age Perfect cream from Amazon Vine, I had been using it for about 6 or 8 months.  I thought that since there is not a lot of sun in our winters, I could use Age Perfect SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if it matters but it is nice to get more product in the Age Perfect and both products cost the same.  I am in my upper sixties with combination skin even after all of these years.  I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles except some light lines by my eyes but my throat is not nice - the texture is not going to get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any trouble or any reaction to the the creams or lotions from L&#x27;Oreal and my facial skin is smooth - not flaky or rough.  I recommend you try this product due to it&#x27;s generous quantity of 2.5 oz. Most companies, including Avon, normally package all of their creams and lotions in 1.7 oz. bottles, tubes and jars so it is a good value as well.</li>
            <li> If this is making a difference, it must all be subcutaneous, because I see no change on the surface of my skin.  Possibly one must use it for a lot longer and buy lots more bottles of it, but I am not willing to make that bet.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 2 weeks now but I am pleased with it&#x27;s effects so far.  I have been using the age perfect night cream longer, about a month and a half, and I like it even better but I am hoping that the two together will produce good effects over time.  Both the day and night creams have pretty strong smells that are probably not what I would like but they are non intolerable.  It just would be nice if they made them scent free.  I do like the way they make my skin feel though and I do even think that I am seeing my dark spots fading which is wonderful.  I have found that if I wet my fingertips with a little water before applying the cream it goes on more smoothly and easily.  I like the fact that you only have to use very small amounts as well.  I would recommend both creams to anyone that is over fifty.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this \\&quot;perfect day cream\\&quot; by Loreal. Goes on smoothly, not greasy or oily feeling at all.  My skin felt well hydrated and moist with its use.  good price as well!</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have dry skin.  This cream goes on smoothly and feels as if it is going to be greasy.  But it&#x27;s not.  By the time I finish doing my morning regimen and get ready to put on my makeup, it has totally been absorbed.  I like the way it makes my skin feel moist and it has a very pleasant and light fragrance.  My skin is already light so I can&#x27;t honestly tell if it is lightening my skin but it does provide sun protection.  A good daytime cream for the money.</li>
            <li> OK, so I&#x27;m lying again. The only way you&#x27;ll wake up looking like Charlize is if you went to sleep looking like Charlize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream goes on non-greasy which is surprising since the third and fourth ingredients are glycerine and mineral oil. I found it sort of irritating to my eyes so I kept it away from them. The weird scent goes away after a short time. I like that it has a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make a lot of difference? Not much that I can see but it works alright as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s inexpensive so maybe worth a try anyway.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich, this heavily fragranced cream promises skin improvement and sun protection. Unfortunately, the luxurious texture did not result in soft, moist skin for me. It did not absorb and lay heavily upon my skin, suffocating my pores. I was happy to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, minor flaws did seem to disappear. I don&#x27;t like to use much product during the hot summer months. Most look and feel greasy. This one did not look oily and overall my skin looked better. But the scent was oppressive and I was constantly aware that the product was on my face. So even though  imperfections were  diminished, it is unlikely I will use this again.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of the SPF 15 broad spectrum protection. It does not make my face shiny like other sunscreens. I use the cream before applying my foundation. My complexion appears improved and my face is not sticky or shiny. I found a $3 coupon and paid a whopping $12 for the product off the shelf. I have other Loreal products but I am quite happy with this one. I recommend to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> female friend loved it</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect is a good product at a moderate price.  The sunscreen is nice, but SPF 15 not really adequate for prolonged outdoors.</li>
            <li> I was interested to review this product, since I use L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift skin regimen. Age Perfect is a wonderful cream that moisturizes your skin, helps reverse the visible process of aging AND protects your face from sun damage. It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, not greasy and my skin never turned oily throughout the day. My face never got that &amp;#34;sticky mask&amp;#34; sensation that so many other moisturizers leave. I wore it under makeup and it looked great all day. Age Perfect Day Cream didn&#x27;t affect the application of my cosmetics or turn them a different shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt less tight and the wrinkles and creases were noticeably lessened by the end of the week I used it. A little goes a long way with this cream, so apply sparingly. The jar is quite large, and will probably supply a consumer 2-3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May switch to Age Perfect products after my Revitalift is gone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling under or over moisturized.  My skin tends to be dry.  It comes in a huge tub - which seems somewhat unhygienic to me.  The scent is very, very mild.  I wish it had a higher SPF</li>
            <li> I got this cream because I started to notice changes to my skin.  found that my skin was losing elasticity, forming more lines and dark spots. And even though I have oily skin, I was also noticing dry spots and some flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using an Olay combo serum/moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t address the dark spots. When I got the L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect cream, I was a bit skeptical. It has mineral oil in its ingredient list, and I thought this would leave my skin greasy. Surprisingly, it did not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rich cream that is uniquely non-greasy, although it does take a little time to &#x27;sink in&#x27;. It is a rich cream that needs just a little bit to thoroughly cover and moisturize. I found my skin to be much more hydrated than I expected, and the effect has been much better than the Olay serum/moisturizer. I also noticed that even with the limited use (just a couple of weeks), the cream has had an impact on the dark spots. While they are not gone, they have lightened just a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a nice balance; it moisturizes, protects, smooths and reduces dark spots all without being greasy on my fussy skin. I&#x27;m pretty impressed, and I think this will be a part of my daily skin care regimen going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it (hence the 4-star rating) is the scent. I really wish that skin care and cosmetic products would stop putting scents into their formulas. There is no reason that this cream needed a perfume.</li>
            <li> I had a long review written about this and then my page reloaded and *POOF* it was gone.  So now I&#x27;ll just list the highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am younger than the target age for this but have fair skin that tends to be dry.  This moisturizer is thick, creamy and does a great job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;-It includes a sunscreen SPF 15 which is a great habit to get into but can sometimes make skin look greasy, not with this product though.&lt;br /&gt;-It does have mineral oil in it which causes me to break out after extended use so I can only use this a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;-It does use a lot of products derived of animal fats so if you&#x27;re vegan/vegetarian, that would be something you might want to know.&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t notice any major difference in my skin after using it for 3 weeks, but I do like how creamy it is, the scent is unnoticeable after a few minutes and it isn&#x27;t too greasy (though it still feels a little greasy on my very dry skin compared to other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, due to the mineral oil, I would not buy this product again.  But if you don&#x27;t have that sensitivity, I think it is a really decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Ensulizole (1.7%), Octinoxate (7.5%) (the sunscreen components)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Myristyl Myristate, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Palmitic Acid, Ammonium Polyacrylatedimethyl Tauramide, Titanium Dioxide, PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Mannitol, PEG 20 Stearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (Beta Hydroxy Acid), Acrylates Crosspolymer, Butylene Glycol, Alumina, Cyclodextrin, Yeast (Faex) Extract, Soluble Collagen, Disodium Succinate, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Skull Cap) Root Extract, Morus Bombycis Root Extract, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, FIL</li>
            <li> This product made my face itch, so I stopped using it right away;&lt;br /&gt;It also made my face feel dry and drawn.</li>
            <li> Love the company &amp; the products. I tried the products at 18 &amp; never switched. I am pleased I have a great product to stand by.</li>
            <li> this product was not what I expected.I used it and my skin still appeared dry and lines did not diminish. May be okay for younger skin type.</li>
            <li> I AM 65 YEARS OLD, AND THIS PRODUCTS HELP ME EVERY DAY. MY WRINKLE ARE SOFTERS, MY FACE IS NOW BETTER</li>
            <li> It was good but I think its expensive as per the price and quantity... You would not get this always on good price so better keep looking the price whenever it go down you can get else try to find in some other store where you may get in better price... but as per brand the product was good for use...</li>
            <li> Great product to wear under make-up. Low SPF though.</li>
            <li> Since I am in my early 50&#x27;s I thought this cream might be a good choice for my skin. The hydrating moisturizer and anti age spot features caught my eye. I also like the fact that it contains sunscreen; this is an added bonus, as are the soy seed proteins it contains.  It is heavier in consistency than the day cream I normally use, but it&#x27;s not been a negative feature. Although sometimes when the weather is really warm and humid, I prefer applying a lighter cream. It has a light scent which I do not really care for, but it&#x27;s not overpowering and I can live with it. I may see if they make an unscented version to try next time. I have not noticed any measurable difference in the tone of my skin, but I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks, so perhaps I need to give it more time. While I cannot say that this product is fabulous, it&#x27;s not bad either and I would try using it again. I will also look into some of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s other skin care products soon.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream for Mature Skin turned out to be a very rich, moisturizing cream. I could feel the richness of the cream moisturizing my 50+ skin. It was not at all greasy. It absorbed nicely into the skin. I have only one caution. When I wore dark colors I could see a white ring at the top of the collar. This didn&#x27;t stain the shirt but it was worth noting. Be careful about applying it on your neck close to your collar when wearing dark tops. The SPF 15 was effective in protecting the skin from sun damage. I like this product.</li>
            <li> This burns my skin, so if you have sensitive skin, I do not recommend this product. I didn&#x27;t use it more than twice to be able to review its effectiveness. Had to wash it off! Burns!</li>
            <li> I have tried very expensive brands, to more affordable and this is where I have landed. It works great, goes on easy, and you only need a really small amount. I have very dry skin and used to use pure oil then moisturizer until my friend recommended this. I also like the night time one as well. You certainly can&#x27;t beat the price. I recently tried a fairly expensive one, and ended up back to this.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new day cream. Over the years, I have had good luck with L&#x27;Oreal products, so I thought I would give this a try. The first thing I noticed is the thickness. It is a very thick cream, like cold cream. I rechecked the label. Yes, it is indeed a day cream. Hmmm... So, I put it on, waited my normal 10 minutes, and went to put my makeup on. My foundation caked. CAKED. All over my face. Not good. Since then, I have tried waiting varying amounts of time. I have tried applying with sponges and with my fingers. I have tried 3 different foundations. No matter what, the foundation cakes when I use this cream. If I use a different moisturizer, no caking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - For whatever reason, every foundation I tried to use after applying this cream caked up. I will not be using it again. Your experience may vary, but mine was not good.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my wife and here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my love for L&#x27;Oreal products is a result of having lived in France for so many years and having used their shampoos, cleansers, creams. I am always excited to try their new products. I am 60, have sensitive skin,no age spots and not too many wrinkles. I have been using a whole line of L&#x27;Oreal creams for mature sensitive skin: Nutrissime, Revitalift Complete, Triple Power, Age Perfect hydra-nutrition. I was looking forward to trying this new Age Perfect cream which contains soy seed proteins.&lt;br /&gt;This cream comes in a white glass 2.5 oz pot with a white plastic lid and there is a protective cover under the lid so the cream does not spill over when traveling. I love the rich white cream and the wonderful delicate scent.&lt;br /&gt;I have always liked having a separate day cream and richer night cream.I put this cream on my face in the morning and used it for several weeks while we had nice sunny days.I went on walks, did gardening, wanted to check how much protection the SPF 15 gave me. My face never got red. I never got sun burnt, so this was sufficient protection for me. I might need to use additional sunscreen during summer months. My face felt so wonderfully soft after using this cream. I always wait about 10 minutes before putting powder so the cream will get a chance to be absorbed by my skin. Works perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is unbelievably low for this quality product and I no longer buy my L&#x27;Oreal creams during my trips to France, as the price here is the same as in their huge supermarket \\&quot;Carrefour\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I would give this cream 6 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> I like Loreal and the creams they offer but none had the SPE I needed. I work outside and I hated having to put on sunblock over my face cream. This product is so easy to slide onto my face and neck and last all day. I hate to say I have mature skin but I guess at 60 I do. My face is smooth and has a glow I didn&#x27;t know I could have. So this is now what I reach for every morning</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream SPF 15 is a pretty good daytime moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t find it at all irritating to my skin and went on smoothly. The cream feels silky soft as it goes on. My skin felt moisturized and hydrated but did not feel heavy, greasy, or sticky. And the skin on my face looked as good as it felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cream is going to work miracles but this one does an excellent job of keeping those fine lines at bay and tackling dry patches. Repeated daily use appeared to produce better looking results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the quality of the product, at this price, it is an out and out bargain. I&#x27;ve paid more money for facial products that did less for the look and feel of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this L&#x27;Oreal Day Cream.</li>
            <li> I love perfume, but I prefer to choose the scents that I wear, and I would never choose a scent like this one: it really does smell like my grandma&#x27;s bathroom (she loved perfume too, so her bathroom always smelled very floral.)  Since most women who like perfume are generally pretty picky about, I don&#x27;t understand why L&amp;oacute;real would intentional pour such a strong, floral scent into this cream.  Smell aside, it&#x27;s also pretty heavy and little greasy feeling.  I can usually find at least one good thing to say about most products, but with this one I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Just your average moisturizer with too much fragrance.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend who loves it.</li>
            <li> I like that it absorbs quickly and completely.  No greasy residue.  Easy to blend with my skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the itching problem others seem to have.  Could be I&#x27;m not \\&quot;yet\\&quot; allergic to something that they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this to be about the same quality as other BBs I have tried lately.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic moisturizer, and has made my skin smoother.  After only three weeks of daily use, the dark spots on my forehead are noticeably lighter.  It only takes a small amount to be effective, making this a good value.</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with people that promise more or give half truths to sell something and this might be one of those instances but I gave it 5 stars for how it makes my skin feel when I touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is a real interesting piece of work. It starts by saying how menopause effects our skin, how it starts the sagging process due to hormonal changes...well yeah, we&#x27;re getting older.  Nothing stays the same after say 50. See visable results...really?  Only if I have a magnifying glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I will say this about this product.  It&#x27;s affordable for my budget, has a nice light scent and it feels good going on.  It doesn&#x27;t seem sticky on me and its IN my skin in the morning and not all over my pillow or in a sticky mess on my face. I didn&#x27;t try it under my make-up as it is a little thick for me on the days I wear makeup.  I do like it on my face if I skip the foundation regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a specific regimen and its very simple.  I wash my face with ivory soap and have for most of my adult life.  I take all of my makeup off everyday and wash my face twice a day...with ivory. I rarely scrub or put astringent on.  As little as possible is what my faces likes and the more I do to it the worse it looks and feels to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product recommends a strict regimen of their products and that might be great for someone else.  Hey, they have to sell their products to stay in business, right?  This cream is nice to the touch and although it says day cream, it is just the right consistency for my night time cream too and it has an spf 15 sunscreen incorported too.  What a plus!  We ALL need that. I can&#x27;t say that it will help my skin NOT to sag or to take care of my dark spots but it does moisturize my face and thats a good reason to buy it.  The fact that it is a reasonable price of 12.00 is another.</li>
            <li> I frequently run into problems with lots of creams that either irritate my skin or nose.  Having the opportunity to test it out before I buy it is especially nice.  This one didn&#x27;t bother my skin; it went on nice &amp; smooth &amp; didn&#x27;t dry out quickly; felt kind of satiny.  It&#x27;s the smell that was a huge turn off for me.  It reminds me of an old bottle of suntan lotion, the one you&#x27;ve been hanging on to for a year or two &amp; smells awful when applied.  Honestly I don&#x27;t know if I simply got a bad jar or if they all smell like this.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of [[ASIN:B0007W1R58 Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream 1.7 Oz]], which also feel silky or satiny, but doesn&#x27;t smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product page claims:&lt;br /&gt;1.  \\&quot;Brightens and smoothes mature skin while reducing the appearance of age spots, fine lines, and surface wrinkles\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  I am 49 with my fair share of sun damaged skin.  I noticed no brightening or smoothing of fine lines or wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2.  \\&quot;Beta hydroxy acid complex helps improve the appearance of age spots, fine lines, and surface wrinkles while soy seed proteins improve elasticity for more toned, supple and resilient skin\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  Again, no noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not found that perfect product that will help diminish my lines, I continue to spend my money on products.  Even if a product doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claims, I would continue to use it, especially it might be beneficial in the long run.  This cream, because of it&#x27;s smell, is the one reason I will not continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on the Vine program.  At first it was not available and they sent the BB cream which she loves and for which we now subscribe on Amazon.  She also tried the Day/Night cream which she ultimately prefers to this as she believes it is more versatile.  Her comment was essentially that she could do without this, but really liked the other two products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I don&#x27;t wear perfume every day - in fact I use it maybe 6 times a year, so I am probably more sensitive to scents than most women, but to me this cream smelled so overpoweringly of old-fashioned floral perfume that I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. When I have it on, I can smell it all day long, and to me it&#x27;s not a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other ladies obviously like the scent, and it probably adds to their enjoyment in using this cream, but for those who have sensitive sniffers, or who are allergic to floral scents, you might want to avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this L&#x27;Oreal Skin Moisturiser Cream for some years now and I really love it. I apply it at night, and use the L&#x27;Oreal Complete for daytime. I really like this product. It has a very nice subtle fragrance, not oily, and leaves my skin nice and soft. I don&#x27;t wear make-up, never have(foundations, powders, etc), only blush, so my skin always feels clean, no build ups of any kind. Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife would like, use it every day, it is good because it brings more amount than other presentations. Thanks for everything</li>
            <li> First, I should reveal that I didn&#x27;t use this product long enough or regularly enough to notice any reduction in wrinkles or spots (and I have plenty of both), so I can&#x27;t say what sort of results you might find in that arena. But after a single use, I wasn&#x27;t inclined to make a long project out of it because it&#x27;s so heavily scented that I felt like I was leaving a scent trail wherever I went. It&#x27;s not noxious, it&#x27;s just so strong that I felt overwhelmed by it. If they come out with an unscented version, I&#x27;d try it again; as it is, well, no.</li>
            <li> I tried this a little over a year ago and have been very satisfied with the results and the price is right.  I use it everyday and see that the wrinkles and lines are kept in check.  I would recommend this product.  4 stars is a really good rating from me.</li>
            <li> Best day cream for the price and very comparable to the very expensive high end creams.</li>
            <li> One of the most dramatic improvements I&#x27;ve found using this skin care product over the others that contain SPF 15 sunblock, is how quickly and easily it blends into your skin, without leaving that highly noticeable white residue that most creams leave on the surface of the skin from the titanium oxide ingredients most of them contain.  I bought the day cream for daytime use, and the nighttime formula for before bedtime.  I hydrates my skin well, without any annoying greasiness.  It has all the qualities I look for in a face cream for aging skin, and the price is right, too.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this day cream works well for me.  It soaks into my skin without feeling greasy.  Some people (with oily skin) may not care for it, but I use it consistently and am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who spends a lot of time outside so I need something to protect my face while moisturizing it - but without smelling like my grandma.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  It&#x27;s not greasy or excessively aromatic.  I may write like my grandma but at least I don&#x27;t smell like her.  This product is excellent.</li>
            <li> If I believed everything I read I would think this is a great facial cream that has anti-sagging and anti-age spot ingredients that hydrates the skin.  HA! All I needed to do was read the ingredient list to turn me off. Unfortunately though I didn&#x27;t read the ingredient list until I used the product for 10 days.  No wonder my skin looked dull and tired and felt shrunken - kind of the opposite of their marketing hype. The product is full of mineral oil, parabens, and reads like a science lab. Full of cheap ingredients with lots of hype, this is one brand to stay away from. I&#x27;m sorry I used it&lt;br /&gt;for as long as I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for awhile now and agree that it makes a subtle difference, but it&#x27;s not magic.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a decent product for the price range, but people should not expect miracles from it or any other age related products, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because they have changed the formula and it burns my skin.  Not as bad as the new day/night moisturizer that I tried and I am of course talking about L&#x27;oreal product.  I absolutely do not like this new moisturizer and I bought 2 jars thinking I was getting the old formula if you have any of the old formula for the L&#x27;oreal day moisturizer I&#x27;d like to exchange!!!. Since the jars looked the same as the old ones except for the fact that soy product was used in the formula and that was listed on the labeling.  I am NOT allergic to soy products.  I don&#x27;t remember how long I used the previous day cream but at least 3 years(I think)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any makeup other than lipstick, so L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Day must do the job of making my aging skin appear less wrinkled, without leaving a shiny film.  It does the job nicely within minutes of application, with no need for night cream.</li>
            <li> I use this product during the day in the dryer winter when I expect that I will need a moisturizer with a sunscreen.  It&#x27;s too much for my skin in the summer, but perfect in the winter.  Also good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for my mom. She loved.</li>
            <li> I ordered several items from different people, and this was the first to arrive.  It arrived just as it was described &#x3D;&#x3D; new in the box.  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all. This one has worked the best on my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and I love it. It has just the right amount of moisture for my 58 year old skin and it keeps the age spots off. I also have sensitive skin but this cream does not bother my skin at all. The sunscreen is great too.</li>
            <li> After only a few days I notice a breaking out and dry flaky patches, I didn&#x27;t realize what the cause was, so continued use made the problem worse and worse. Now I have patches that look like puckered skin and a burning sensation. I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive, but can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom. She loves it so far</li>
            <li> I have been using this Age Perfect Day Cream by L&#x27;Oreal for about 2 weeks now and I like the way it goes onto my face smoothly and absorbs into the skin and takes away dryness. I am happy with the soft, smooth way my face feels and my make-up applies evenly over it.  The SPF 15 has really help reduce the age spots.  I can wear this without any make up and the sun has not added any more age spots since I started using \\&quot;Age Perfect.\\&quot;  Love it!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream is indeed perfect for mature skin, and for younger persons, also.  This product is very thick, rich and creamy.  Your skin feels moisturized and smooth after each application. An added benefit is the SPF 15 sunscreen protection.  This is a very good product!</li>
            <li> this is a nice thick cream &amp; it works. I have dry skin because of the weather &amp; the cream softens it over night.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the skin - it really soaks in. My skin feels softer and more elastic when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I received this product and the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect BB Cream Instant Radiance. This is an excellent skin creme, and even if you use the BB cream, you will also want to use this especially if you have dry skin. It glides right onto your skin, and although it&#x27;s thick, it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on very smoothly. Your skin will soak it right up. Then you can smooth the BB cream over it for a nice smooth finish because the two products work together really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a nice day cream by itself, and you can wear it alone or under your makeup. It will last longer because of its consistency, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. My face felt nice and soft, and it took the itch away. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has mature skin and wants a gentle yet very effective face cream for daytime or really anytime.</li>
            <li> I bike every day, so this is a great non-greasy way of getting some sun screen, and a mositurizer in one application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved it, good service</li>
            <li> I started having age spots on my cheeks a few years ago and I started using Age Perfect and in 6 months they were gone.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for a few years now and it has become my favorite by far. I also use the night creme.</li>
            <li> I love this product good for dry skin... I have used this many times. Good for the price. Can buy</li>
            <li> This is the only L&#x27;Oreal product I&#x27;ve tried that I&#x27;d never buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little overpowering and it leaves my face looking super greasy.  While I do like the nice, creamy texture, an hour after applying, my skin feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only 15 SPF to offer, there&#x27;s really very little to recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> 50 years ... I maintain the moisture of the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I recommend it. ok</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different creams with all different price ranges and was pleasantly surprised that this is one I actually like. It&#x27;s thick and creamy, has a light pleasant fragrance and an spf of 15. My wrinkles didn&#x27;t completely disappear since I started using it (which was around a year ago) but they definitely haven&#x27;t gotten any worse, either....although, immediately after putting it on I feel like they are less noticible because of the way it really soaks into your skin. I use it every day for that reason alone. I put my makeup on top of it and it goes on smooth as well. The price is great, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase this on Amazon, but found it on sale at my grocery store for $13.99.  The product itself is very creamy and rich.  It feels good on the skin of my face and absorbed quickly.  It does have a rather strong scent.  If you are chemically sensitive, as I am, I would recommend either passing on this product or not putting it on your face at night.  So far my skin feels more soft and I am seeing some firming results.  I would have given this product 5 stars, except for the unnecessarily strong scent that gave it.</li>
            <li> ITS  A GOOD PRODCUTAND HAVE BEEN USING FEW YEARS AND  ON LINE CHEAPER THAN FEGULAR STORES SO THAT IS WHYU I NEED IT AND FOR AGE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for a week and like 99% of facial products, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer but does not do much for creases and wrinkles. But I did not expect it to as I&#x27;ve learned all such promises are gimmicks to increase sales. Bought it for a moisturizer, the L&#x27;Oreal name, the SPF 15, and slightly larger than normal ounces.</li>
