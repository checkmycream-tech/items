            <li>I really believe you too will fall in love with PROACTI.  </li>
            <li>With social media and so much pressure to look perfect now a days there are so many more (external) options to having clear skin.</li>
            <li>Glad they made a new version.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased the larger amount.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully Amazon will carry more of the line in the future.</li>
            <li>My skin is now clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did not have proactive, we only had noxema and most of my friends had pimples</li>
            <li>We have tried so many skin products for my daughter and this is the only one that is consistent.</li>
            <li>It lasts so much longer.  </li>
            <li>Product was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months now and love my skin so clear and much smoother than it has been in a long time</li>
            <li>I love that this is available to purchase individually when I need it and without being subject to proactiv membership requirements.</li>
            <li>After I clean with Proactiv for only about a minute, I apply Gold Bond Healing Lotion for moisture.  </li>
            <li>I kept it for a month in case there was a problem with that particular lot # for those products (there were 4 in all)  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I guess I can only use the original as my skin stays smooth with only an occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>And this product say specifically 90 days worth, but I have always made it last longer!</li>
            <li>I used my new tube and my face turned bright red as though I had a third degree sun burn, my eyes swelled and my skin broke out in numerous tiny pimples all over my face.</li>
            <li>The one product I CANNOT live without.</li>
            <li>As long as I use PROACTIV my skin stays youthful and fresh.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it to my 13 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>I am looking for a Proactive product for an adult who does not have acne.</li>
            <li>I have been using the old proactiv for years (I am 44) and was terrified to try anything in fear that I would break out.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult with adult acne...</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m 55 yrs old and thought it might help with my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Well I finally gave in and tried the new proactive.  </li>
            <li>I have no clue what ingredient(s) were causing such a disaster from this new product.</li>
            <li>as far as spots, aging, that&#x27;s a big NOPE!</li>
            <li>This does not dry your skin at all.  </li>

            <li> This does not dry your skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Ran out of my 3 oz after several months and was desperate for more.  </li>
            <li> The old one used to be really harsh.</li>
            <li> I started using it every other day,then after a week, I started using it every day but only at night.  </li>
            <li> I had a very little bit of itching the first few times I used it,  but no swelling or redness.  </li>
            <li> My skin is the clearest it has been in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> and it works just as well, if not better than the old version.  </li>
            <li> I will now use it on a regular basis but never more than daily.  </li>
            <li> I had tiny bumps all over my face and bigger hard bumps too.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but you only need to use a small amount each time so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Yet a teen likes to stay up late, not drink enough water and eat comfort food.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday &amp; has definitely seen a difference in his skin.  A+++</li>
            <li> It may be good on other faces but horrible on mine.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does work little bit but not enough...🚫</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a little grainy and act like an exfoliant</li>
            <li> When I used the Proactiv Cleaning System a few months ago, I had what I thought was an allergic reaction to it: itching, swelling, redness of my face.  </li>

            <li> This is a must for me twice a day! Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true PROACTIV BELIEVER !  I use their entire line.  As long as I use PROACTIV my skin stays youthful and fresh.  No blemishes ever. Give PROACTIV a chance.  I really believe you too will fall in love with PROACTI.  I recommend this skin care regimen for all ages from 10 to 100... You&#x27;re never to young or never too old to seek beautiful healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Proactive+ Skin exfoliator!  I use it every morning in the shower!  I am so glad that I purchased the larger amount.  It lasts so much longer.  I am happy with all of the proactive+ products, because they are great with acne.  It also makes my skin feel very fresh.  And this product say specifically 90 days worth, but I have always made it last longer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good and brand new.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wron product so I gave it to my 13 year old grandson. I am sure it will help him just as Proactive helped my son 20 years ago. I am looking for a Proactive product for an adult who does not have acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for at least 15 years and I stared using Proactiv+ when it hit the market.  I have no complaints.  Hopefully Amazon will carry more of the line in the future.</li>
            <li> This the BEST exfoliator!  My son loves it.  He uses it everyday &amp; has definitely seen a difference in his skin.  A+++</li>
            <li> My grandchildren are teenagers and use it daily.</li>
            <li> great Product , no problems</li>
            <li> I love that this is available to purchase individually when I need it and without being subject to proactiv membership requirements. I have used this product since it came out through proactiv and I have had great results. It is pricey, but you only need to use a small amount each time so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it. Seen results in 2 days.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing i&#x27;ve used on my face ever. My skin is now clear and smooth. It even helped my cystic acne that i&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> Been using this product and it works great!  My skin is the clearest it has been in a very long time.  This does not dry your skin at all.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After trying the cheaper Acne Free cleanser and still breaking out, I  very happily came back to this one. It&#x27;s simply the best, my skin is clear and smooth. You get what you pay for..  Proactiv is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Proactive is and isn&#x27;t. I believe the skin reflects the constant changing ebb and flow of the internal process and homostasis of the body&#x27;s organs. Hormones will reflect the skin&#x27;s chaos and diet plays a role. Yet a teen likes to stay up late, not drink enough water and eat comfort food. What can I say? When I was teen I did not have proactive, we only had noxema and most of my friends had pimples so it was not big deal. With social media and so much pressure to look perfect now a days there are so many more (external) options to having clear skin. The problem with proactive is like an addiction once your skin gets use to it the more you have to use it or the pimples will continue. We have tried so many skin products for my daughter and this is the only one that is consistent.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this seller previously great product fast shipping, have used this face wash brand for years</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great service.</li>
            <li> I have been using the old proactiv for years (I am 44) and was terrified to try anything in fear that I would break out.  Well I finally gave in and tried the new proactive.  I LOVE IT!  It feels great, it&#x27;s even easier to use and it works just as well, if not better than the old version.  I am really happy with it and glad I finally tried it.</li>
            <li> When I used the Proactiv Cleaning System a few months ago, I had what I thought was an allergic reaction to it: itching, swelling, redness of my face.  My eyelids were swollen, and I didn&#x27;t even use it around my eyes.  But I was following the instructions which were, to use the products twice a day every day.  That was overkill!!!!  I was refunded by Proactiv and stopped the treatment immediately.  I kept it for a month in case there was a problem with that particular lot # for those products (there were 4 in all)  Once the month was up, I threw them all away.  Within a couple of days, my acne returned with a vengeance!  I decided to go to Amazon and see if I could get just the cleanser.  I was able to order just that one product.  I started using it every other day,then after a week, I started using it every day but only at night.  After I clean with Proactiv for only about a minute, I apply Gold Bond Healing Lotion for moisture.  I use it at night because I take 25mg of Benadryl to help me sleep, so it helps in case I develop a rash again.  I had a very little bit of itching the first few times I used it,  but no swelling or redness.  It is GREAT!  I will now use it on a regular basis but never more than daily.  It works miracles!  I am 57 and still having serious acne problems but since I adjusted the dose I am almost acne-free and I no longer have to take a daily antibiotic that I had been taking for over 3 years!  I will be a proactiv fan for life!</li>
            <li> The one product I CANNOT live without.</li>
            <li> Great love this have been using for a year</li>
            <li> The best product out of the Proactiv line. leaves my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Does work little bit but not enough...🚫</li>
            <li> Wife and kids love this stuff</li>
            <li> My favorite cleaner of all time. The old one used to be really harsh. Glad they made a new version.</li>
            <li> I am an adult with adult acne...this is the only cleaner that clears my face up, I will never run out again</li>
            <li> This is the worst treatment I have ever tried for acne!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a tube of this through Amazon. It is quite possible that I received an expired product or counterfeit product. I have been using ProActiv successfully for months. I used my new tube and my face turned bright red as though I had a third degree sun burn, my eyes swelled and my skin broke out in numerous tiny pimples all over my face. Horrible just horrible.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m 55 yrs old and thought it might help with my complexion.  It does make my skin softer but as far as spots, aging, that&#x27;s a big NOPE!</li>
            <li> cleans your face like it should</li>
            <li> I liked the concept, but it didn&#x27;t work well with my skin and I tried it for about two weeks.  I had tiny bumps all over my face and bigger hard bumps too.  I guess I can only use the original as my skin stays smooth with only an occasional pimple. I have no clue what ingredient(s) were causing such a disaster from this new product.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way. When I don&#x27;t use this it&#x27;s noticeable. I&#x27;ll never run out again! I use this as a face wash and use a lotion with the same ingredient afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleanser I have ever used. I ran out and went about two months without it. NEVER again! I could see a huge difference in just one week!!!</li>
            <li> I applied it to my face per instructions.  The next two days my face broke out in bumps with whiteheads all over my face. It&#x27;s so embarrassing.  It may be good on other faces but horrible on mine.</li>
            <li> Very good product I recommend</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a little grainy and act like an exfoliant but it doesn&#x27;t.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> Product was packaged very well. Love Proactive products. will buy again.</li>
