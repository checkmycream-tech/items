            <li>I love all natural products.</li>

            <li>and I most definitely recommend this product.</li>

            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a use for Castor oil.</li>
            <li>If not I would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>Great for hair and skin especially if you have dry hair and skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it works miracles, however, it does keep nice and clean.</li>

            <li>Awesome, tired after hearing views on you tube,recently went natural and using on my hair,just ordered another.my hair shines now</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for--castor oil at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Has helped my dry skin greatly I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is &#x27;pure&#x27;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its pure, cole pressed castor oil</li>
            <li>Really Didn&#x27;t Help</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very multipurpose.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than olive oil</li>
            <li>I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym.</li>
            <li>Would not hesitate to purchase other items certainly as well for sure.</li>
            <li>so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.</li>
            <li>It also is nice on the skin and face in small amounts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read you can also take a teaspoon full for different ailments, and it is used to regrow hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this kind of castor oil faithfully for the past year.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this oil.</li>
            <li>The high end serums work, but also come with a hefty price.</li>
            <li>I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has left my normally oily skin feeling soft, yet clean.  </li>
            <li>-I even use it with visible results on the very mature face.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and a lot thicker than ever!</li>
            <li>Again all natural.</li>
            <li>this is the real stuff i dont think it is because i brought 2 oil products from the same company castor oil and advecodo oil</li>
            <li>You may be surprised.</li>
            <li>I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair.</li>
            <li>I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth.</li>
            <li>I read online that castor oil can be used for natural hair as a conditioner, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>and they both have exact same texture and smell and look exacally the same</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much softer and not nearly as brittle.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve also found that I can use &#x27;Extra Light Olive Oil&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;(not the green color olive oil)</li>
            <li>American with a natural hair style.</li>
            <li>I love using this mixed with a few other oils to cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li>A thick consistency that will serve as a perfect barrier between my hair and the cold weather this season</li>
            <li>SMELL/ good or bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I highly recommend getting this oil.</li>
            <li> The high end serums work, but also come with a hefty price.</li>
            <li> I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has left my normally oily skin feeling soft, yet clean.  </li>
            <li> -I even use it with visible results on the very mature face.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and a lot thicker than ever!</li>
            <li> Again all natural.</li>
            <li> this is the real stuff i dont think it is because i brought 2 oil products from the same company castor oil and advecodo oil</li>
            <li> You may be surprised.</li>
            <li> I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair.</li>
            <li> I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth.</li>
            <li> I read online that castor oil can be used for natural hair as a conditioner, so I bought it.</li>
            <li> and they both have exact same texture and smell and look exacally the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much softer and not nearly as brittle.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also found that I can use &#x27;Extra Light Olive Oil&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;(not the green color olive oil)</li>
            <li> American with a natural hair style.</li>
            <li> I love using this mixed with a few other oils to cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li> A thick consistency that will serve as a perfect barrier between my hair and the cold weather this season</li>
            <li> SMELL/ good or bad.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a certain internal sensation that I usually get when I use it that I don&#x27;t seem to be getting with.this last bottle.</li>
            <li> I will just use the skinny brush that came in the popular tube of  expensive lash growing product that turns your eye lids dark as a side effect.</li>
            <li> It really is soothing and I have no more problems with foot fungus.  </li>
            <li> after I wash the oil out.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is pretty thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have this bottle next to my bathroom sink to help out with the dry weather in Colorado</li>
            <li> It can feel heavy at first but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair at all.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up my face a little.</li>
            <li> I purchased this very viscous (thick) oil to use with (Flora Organic)</li>
            <li> its castor oil from what I can tell looks the same has the other brand I have though it has a nutty smell to it</li>
            <li> I had bought this to use as a face wash to help with dry skin and acne.</li>
            <li> Used for lymphatic massage after a dry sauna sweat and shower, it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> it being dry</li>
            <li> Now I dilute it a little bit with other natural oils and massage it into my scalp twice a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> reason I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel a little uneasy about the fact that the only label on the bottle just says that its castor oil and doesn&#x27;t give any other info.&lt;br</li>
            <li> try Sunny Isle Jamaican black castor oil next time</li>
            <li> Sent me an e-mail (and responded quickly when I told them I accidentally gave the wrong address).</li>
            <li> but it feels like it and is thick thick like castor oil and changing from my other CO to this one has changed my OCM that I can tell I have a few more pimples</li>
            <li> Hair stays completely moisturized with this product, and no more flakey scalp due to</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a little while</li>
            <li> protected shipping,tightly closed bottle&lt;</li>
            <li> A heavier base oil, this castor oil is fantastic to mix with lighter oils, such as apricot or grapeseed to go along with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It was neatly packaged and it came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time.</li>
            <li> And this oil and other will stop that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> using it for OCM with some other oils from this guy too.</li>
            <li> Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO&#x27;s omega-9 fatty acids can help.</li>
            <li> I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking.</li>
            <li> Slight odor that I like to mask with lavender oil or tea tree oil, but not awful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a little bit in my shampoo as well as my conditioner</li>
            <li> Tried it in my hair to just make it a little &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got braids a few weeks ago and they were so tight that I had to take the edges out</li>
            <li> :B006NZQ0K0 Castor Oil Pure Organic Cold Pressed Virgin 8 Oz]]</li>
            <li> hardly any odor-some can be a bitter smell.  </li>
            <li> I read that if you rub this in thin areas that it will help grow your hair back.</li>
            <li> I leave it for few hours and then wash it off.</li>
            <li> Not sure which product is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the actual product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not relieving my gas or constipation like it usually does.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and then wash my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;color-yellowish-rather hard to specify the color on the picture</li>
            <li> It is really thick</li>
            <li> OMG, it was so thick and hard to wash out!</li>
            <li> and it is much less expensive</li>
            <li> has at least doubled in just a month of using it!</li>
            <li> very thick, pure---oil&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very very thick though.</li>
            <li> Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;3)Massage oil for Knee - makes a slightly annoyed knee joint happier after rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;Great Price and quality.</li>
            <li> Im thinking even though the expiration date says 2015, this bottle must be outdated.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Usage-Cosmetics-hair&lt;br /&gt;smell- difficult to say-something like the smell of sunflower oil&lt;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Is this oil expeller pressed or cold pressed,&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair 2 times and with a crazy amount of soap, to get it out.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible, it is very thick.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for hair and skin especially if you have dry hair and skin like I do. Definitely have to repurchase soon.</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil to use when I mix henna and so far the results are great.  Makes the henna very easy to rinse out and we all know the benefits of this for hair growth so win win for me.</li>
            <li> I combined this product with Avocado oil, Jojoba Oil, Tea-tree Oil, Peppermint Oil and Shea butter. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much softer and not nearly as brittle. Not sure which product is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I put it in my eyes every night, to treat corneal abrasions, and it has solved all my problems. Problems even doctors couldn&#x27;t solve (non-invasively.) My current eye doc even said he should &amp;#34;write this up,&amp;#34; castor oil in the eyes for this issue. (I didn&#x27;t invent it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great, pure castor oil.</li>
            <li> Great basic Castor Oil for beauty needs. I use it for my Oil Cleansing Method mix everyday and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> very thick, pure---oil&lt;br /&gt;color-yellowish-rather hard to specify the color on the picture - in fact, it is yellowish..&lt;br /&gt;Usage-Cosmetics-hair&lt;br /&gt;smell- difficult to say-something like the smell of sunflower oil&lt;br /&gt;nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;well protected shipping,tightly closed bottle&lt;br /&gt;with exp date on the bottle to 12-2014&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006NZQ0K0 Castor Oil Pure Organic Cold Pressed Virgin 8 Oz]]</li>
            <li> Excellent grade of oil for hair styling.  No smell, can be used as a carrier oil for essential oil treatment of hair. Love the see through bottle.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing to say the least.  It smells horrible, it is very thick.  I would definitely not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing skin. I apply it at night on my face and my feet.  It really is soothing and I have no more problems with foot fungus.  It appears that the nail issues with yellowing are resolving as well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had bought this to use as a face wash to help with dry skin and acne. There is nothing wrong with the actual product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It actually made me break out more and made my skin really oily. I may try it out for my hair instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought I had hives. I planned on using it for my skin and internally for hive treatment. Turns out it was Bed Bug bites so I had this bottle of castor oil laying around and wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with it. Turns out after some more research this works great on hair and skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it to help moisturize my hair. African/ American with a natural hair style. It can feel heavy at first but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair at all. It also is nice on the skin and face in small amounts. Absorbs nicely and has a pleasant scent. I put a little bit in my shampoo as well as my conditioner and it adds extra moisture and shine. I&#x27;ve read you can also take a teaspoon full for different ailments, and it is used to regrow hair.  This oil is an all around wonder, Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly was as advertised use it on my face to help with break outs time will tell fingers crossed</li>
            <li> Sent This To My Sister To Put On Her Back For Pain.  Really Didn&#x27;t Help And It Went Moldy. Bottle Is Very Pretty</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for--castor oil at a reasonable price.  Very happy!  Everything I&#x27;ve purchased by Dr. Adorable has been great so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome, tired after hearing views on you tube,recently went natural and using on my hair,just ordered another.my hair shines now</li>
            <li> Really Great buy!  Excellent shopping at this store.  Would not hesitate to purchase other items certainly as well for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it every day for my skin. Has helped my dry skin greatly I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product and I will continue to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I am really pleased with it. I use it for my face, hair and eyebrows. Shipping was fast and product packaged very well. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing from Dr. Adorable again.</li>
            <li> awesome! I can&#x27;t wait to use this oil to seal moisture into my 3c/ 4a tresses. A thick consistency that will serve as a perfect barrier between my hair and the cold weather this season</li>
            <li> Great purchase, I could not find pure organic in other places so this was a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing amazing products</li>
            <li> This oil and others are, the reason why my hair is starting to look fuller and thicker and I still have my edge, a lot of woman hair is falling out around the hair line. And this oil and other will stop that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have.</li>
            <li> Bought this to add to homemade creams.  Seems to work well.  Will be ordering more when I run out. nice</li>
            <li> LOVE It. I purchased this oil to mix with my shea butter for my hair and skin and I am loving the combo. I will be ordering again and I most definitely recommend this product. Package it great plus it looks just like the pic shown. Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> its castor oil from what I can tell looks the same has the other brand I have though it has a nutty smell to it so that makes me wonder but it feels like it and is thick thick like castor oil and changing from my other CO to this one has changed my OCM that I can tell I have a few more pimples but I think its hormones not this &#x3D;) and I kinda do like the nutty smell tho its a bit strong I add lavender and plan to get tea tree too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I got braids a few weeks ago and they were so tight that I had to take the edges out cause I could not stand it. I read that if you rub this in thin areas that it will help grow your hair back. I have only been using for a little while so I am still trying to get use to it. It is really thick so you have to rub it in good, but I plan to keep it up cause I have heard really good things.</li>
            <li> I use this with the OCM (oil cleansing method). Shipping was super fast &amp; product feels great on my skin. I love it! I have oily/acne prone skin and I mix 40% castor oil with 30% JoJoba Oil, and 30% Grapeseed Oil. I also add 5 drops tea tree EO. :)</li>
            <li> Again all natural. I love all natural products. This is great. I order avocado and caster oil. The texture the packaging everything about it I love!</li>
            <li> I have this bottle next to my bathroom sink to help out with the dry weather in Colorado</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> A heavier base oil, this castor oil is fantastic to mix with lighter oils, such as apricot or grapeseed to go along with essential oils.  Used for lymphatic massage after a dry sauna sweat and shower, it leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is &#x27;pure&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;good price but maybe that&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;Will try Sunny Isle Jamaican black castor oil next time</li>
            <li> I purchased this very viscous (thick) oil to use with (Flora Organic) Almond Oil for haircare. I hope it gives me good results as it had given to others.</li>
            <li> i would defiantly recommend buying from dr. adorable.  this pure, organic, cold-pressed, virgin castor oil is just as described.&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li> hardly any odor-some can be a bitter smell.  I have never had a moisturizer penetrate as deeply as this oil does-I even use it with visible results on the very mature face.</li>
            <li> I make a natural scalp and hair treatment and this pure, and wonderful oil has made it so much better!</li>
            <li> I dont beliave this is the real stuff i dont think it is because i brought 2 oil products from the same company castor oil and advecodo oil and they both have exact same texture and smell and look exacally the same</li>
            <li> Bought is product to use as part of a cleansing and detoxing process. It works but I&#x27;ve also found that I can use &#x27;Extra Light Olive Oil&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;(not the green color olive oil) and it is much less expensive so I will use this up but not buy more.</li>
            <li> It Works!!!  My hair dresser told me to try it.  But of course I had to research it myself first.  Sure enough many women reported it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I poured some in a vial to keep in the bath for when I wash my face before bed, and i apply it there.  The rest i keep in the fridge to keep it fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just one WEEK, I am growing Brows again!!!!!  My face looks so much more balanced. I am super happy.  I have had some seeping into the eye when I put it on my lashes.  So I quit - but I think it probably does help them too. I plan to try again.  I will just use the skinny brush that came in the popular tube of  expensive lash growing product that turns your eye lids dark as a side effect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading reviews on Earth Clinic about the many benefits of Castor Oil. I have tried it with success on the following:&lt;br /&gt;1)Dry Eyes - noticed relief from dryness and amazingly my penguecula, which I have had for years on both eyes, have faded only after a week.&lt;br /&gt;2)Moisturizer on face and body - and noticed my patchy eyebrow thickening up again and skin tone improving. Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;3)Massage oil for Knee - makes a slightly annoyed knee joint happier after rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;Great Price and quality. Slight odor that I like to mask with lavender oil or tea tree oil, but not awful.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying for the price. It&#x27;s very multipurpose. And if you don&#x27;t like it for your body, you can always use it for a household lubricant as it was used and still is for machinery.&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly multipurpose! Great Find!Love it!</li>
            <li> This product itself is great and it is exactly what I expected. It was neatly packaged and it came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> This product is what it says it is, came at a nice reasonable price and I didn&#x27;t have to go search for it in a store</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Needed an oil for conditioning my hair.  Works perfectly!  Much thicker than olive oil so it conditions much better.</li>
            <li> I like this castor oil. I think it even gives a [[ASIN:B000BNRKPY Heritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce]] a run for its money. This oil does a fantastic job on skin. I&#x27;m not sure if it works miracles, however, it does keep nice and clean. I highly recommend getting this oil. You may be surprised.</li>
            <li> I love using this mixed with a few other oils to cleanse my face.  It leaves my face feeling very clean.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a use for Castor oil. I am using it for skin care, mixed with olive oil for face cleansing. Dr. Adorable seems to provide a high quality product. No complaints yet!</li>
            <li> I have been using a mixture of castor oil and olive oil on my face twice a day and have to say my skin looks better than when I purchased high end serums. The high end serums work, but also come with a hefty price. They smell better but this works just as well for pennies per use.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast, well packaged, and the shipper was really nice too. Sent me an e-mail (and responded quickly when I told them I accidentally gave the wrong address). The oil seems to be good quality, and also does not have a smell to it (as a carrier oil shouldn&#x27;t) so this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; oil. Check out essential oils for that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for OCM with some other oils from this guy too. Worked well and came off as easily as you can expect it to. Overall great product and quick shipping (ordered sunday, got it wednesday).</li>
            <li> perfect for to put on your body to help heal it it can be used for other things im sure to</li>
            <li> 1. Is there a company called Dr. Adorable, Inc. since if there is I cannot find any link to their site on the Net. No link, no phone numbers, no address, ZILCH...&lt;br /&gt;2. Is this oil filtered or unfiltered,&lt;br /&gt;3. Is this oil hexane gassed,&lt;br /&gt;4. Is this oil expeller pressed or cold pressed,&lt;br /&gt;5.  Is this oil for internal or external use,&lt;br /&gt;6. Is this oil USDA organic since there is no certification stamp nor USDA stamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Dr. Adorable representative will respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix. I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time. I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO&#x27;s omega-9 fatty acids can help. I leave it for few hours and then wash it off. I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth. I mix with VCO since it keeps the mix not only liquid but runny. It is the best mix after shaving. I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym. The mix keeps the bees and flies away.  I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking. I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any oil from any nut, seed or grain will go rancid, having no nutritional value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.</li>
            <li> Tried it in my hair to just make it a little &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;. OMG, it was so thick and hard to wash out! I had to wash my hair 2 times and with a crazy amount of soap, to get it out. Good on the skin. Helped clear up my face a little. Very very thick though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of castor oil faithfully for the past year. It works wonders for my inflammation, aching joints, and constipation. I also use it for castor oil packs. There&#x27;s a certain internal sensation that I usually get when I use it that I don&#x27;t seem to be getting with.this last bottle. It&#x27;s not relieving my gas or constipation like it usually does. The castor oil packs don&#x27;t feel the same either. Im thinking even though the expiration date says 2015, this bottle must be outdated. Or maybe it&#x27;s just me. I rated them with a 3 because delivery was on time, and they replied to my e-mail within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Castor oil for my beauty products and this has been a high quality oil that has worked great in my products. the bottle came sealed, no leaks and no evidence of contaminiation.</li>
            <li> Got this to try as one reviewer had suggested to mix this with Almond Oil for hair breakage/loss and it is definitely helping and there is NO SMELL/ good or bad.  Just perfect!!</li>
            <li> I have never bought castor oil before, but I gave this a good rating because it seems to be everything Id hoped.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! Try it!!! Hair stays completely moisturized with this product, and no more flakey scalp due to it being dry</li>
            <li> Love it...is really good for the hair</li>
            <li> I got this to make my hair grow faster and I feel like the growth of my hair has at least doubled in just a month of using it! I swear it grew over an inch, and it&#x27;s always super soft and healthy feeling after I wash the oil out.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is pretty thick and sticky. I used it one time by itself on my hair and it washed out fine and worked great, I just didn&#x27;t like the stickiness. Now I dilute it a little bit with other natural oils and massage it into my scalp twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel a little uneasy about the fact that the only label on the bottle just says that its castor oil and doesn&#x27;t give any other info.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this to people who want to grow their hair.</li>
            <li> Castor oil does wonders to whatever problem you have! Great product, fast delivery! Will definetly purchase again! I like that its pure, cole pressed castor oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this mixed with EVOO to wash (yes, wash) may face.  So far it has left my normally oily skin feeling soft, yet clean.  No more breakouts.  Also, I&#x27;ll probably use it to make homemade soap after I have my daughter, and I can work with lye again.</li>
            <li> Really good quality oil.I use it as hair moisturizer before shower.I apply it for 15 min and then wash my hair as usual.My hair is strong and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this for hair, lashes and brows. It does sting my eyes. If not I would give it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I am still trying it out to determine the results........ I am comparing it to my castor oil that is not organic. I got used to the smell of the non-organic castor oil.  A pleasant fragrance of the nuts............</li>
            <li> Every since I had my daughter last June, I have been trying to find something that works for the removal of stretch marks. I read online that castor oil can be used for natural hair as a conditioner, so I bought it. I then found out that I could use castor oil on blemishes and to remove stretch marks. Well, I have used castor oil on both my hair and stomach and I have awesome results!!! The stretch marks on my stomach are fading tremendously! My hair is soft and a lot thicker than ever!</li>
