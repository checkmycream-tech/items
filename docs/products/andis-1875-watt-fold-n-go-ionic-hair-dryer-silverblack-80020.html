            <li>its great and light and portable.</li>
            <li>ceramic hair dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for such a great price.</li>
            <li>This product has some nice features.</li>
            <li>It folds up and packs nicely.  </li>
            <li>She liked it a lot, however after some usage, the retractable cord stopped working</li>
            <li>It has 3 speeds which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked this dryer for the 2 years it lasted.</li>
            <li>It stopped retracting on its own after I used it twice.</li>
            <li>I liked the dryer itself but</li>
            <li>and I thought that would be a nice feature, but</li>
            <li>I like my own dryer when I travel</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      </li>
            <li>We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Then I finish sparingly with my own version of Ojon oil.    </li>
            <li>It was nice while the retractable cord worked, but that stopped working after 2 months.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Conair 1875 model for many, many years and got great use out of them.  </li>
            <li>And delievery time was speedy so got to owning my own hairdryer ASAP.  </li>
            <li>And the folding and retractable cord feature is a nice added bonus.      </li>
            <li>retractable cord nice feature.</li>
            <li>The hair-dryer cord comes in handy.</li>
            <li>This dryer has a retracable handle which makes it nice to store or take on trips.</li>
            <li>I always bring my own with me on trips but this time I never used it.  </li>
            <li>Very compact, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Compact, nice fold up handle.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s best is the folding handle which doesn&#x27;t take up much space</li>
            <li>The item purchased arrived  a whole lot sooner then stated and in excellent condition</li>
            <li>I really liked it</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is kind of sluggish &amp; doesn&#x27;t retract all the way.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer was recommended to me by a coworker after I commented on how nice her hair looks.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice drying speed and heat.</li>
            <li>We used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Got one just like we saw and liked in a hotel.</li>
            <li>In May 2008, I stayed at a nice hotel in Philly that had this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Retractable cord is nice and folding mechanism seems durable.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Fits nicely into a travel bag.  </li>
            <li>the retracting cord is a nice bonus plus the dryer folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried it in on of hotels, liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my wife and I ask her if she liked it</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would be handy for traveling.</li>
            <li>while you won&#x27;t have an L-shaped thing in your luggage, you also don&#x27;t have a nice compact bathroom appliance.  </li>
            <li>and she liked not having the cord strewn about.  </li>
            <li>This RC-2 is absolutely the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Folds compactly and the retractable cord is nice.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the cord retractor and the ability to fold the handle for storage.  </li>
            <li>We took it on our cruise and it worked quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Fits nicely in drawer since it folds.</li>
            <li>It had features that I liked</li>
            <li>Very happy...and the price is great!</li>
            <li>Wish it had a warm setting...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>retractable cord is also a nice touch</li>
            <li>Fits nice in the vanity drawer and out of the way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm but sometimes like a hotter one.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>My mother and I wanted to buy these after having used them in a really nice hotel in Boulder, Colorado.</li>
            <li>Nice dryer,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement to love as much as I loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it -</li>
            <li>Nice quality.  </li>
            <li>so it gives a nice grip</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer &amp;  I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the airflow.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>All of our friends who use this hair dryer comment about how nice it is.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shorter profile of it.</li>
            <li>Also, the retractable cord and folding handle are so nice for storage.  </li>
            <li>I always liked this model for travel.</li>
            <li>It is a nice dryer</li>
            <li>nice retractable cord</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter</li>
            <li>It folds up nice and compact and has a lot of power.  </li>
            <li>Really nice  Hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Cord retracts well and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;The cord retracts as it should and it folds nicely to store under the sink</li>
            <li>used it today, and it made my hair nice and</li>
            <li>It is a nice dryer beyond that.  </li>
            <li>I liked the retractable cord and the folding</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is nice, when it works</li>
            <li>I´m loving it.</li>
            <li>Attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have the folding handle..</li>
            <li>and now I own my own.</li>
            <li>The heat is nice.</li>
            <li>The folding handle is nice, too, if you want to travel with it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the dryer and I may buy another.</li>
            <li>So nice.</li>
            <li>very good product &amp; priced right.</li>
            <li>it drys hair and stores conveniently and was not very expensive, but its not the perfect dryer by any means.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>It got real hot and I recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer.</li>
            <li>The high setting was warm at best.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s a great size and performs well-- drying hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>For the price, the three speeds, the cool button, the retractable cord it is great.  </li>
            <li>Smart design, great price and superior service.</li>
            <li>They are great and hold up to moderate usage very good.</li>
            <li>I bought this after using it in a Hotel in New York, it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>Otherwise, recommended, great price for a great product (I&#x27;ve had it nearly 3 months at this point and will update if it breaks within a year).</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;d still be available, so my daughter will be happy to know she can get a replacement.</li>
            <li>Best light weight powerful hair dryer i have ever owned.</li>
            <li>You feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a dryer.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and has a great retractable power cord.</li>
            <li>It has good strong power but</li>
            <li>Good price, blow strong.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful hairdryer that leaves my hair very soft and silky....</li>
            <li>This was very easily transportable.</li>
            <li>First used this blow dryer at a Four Seasons hotel in Hawaii and LOVED it!  </li>
            <li>SURE GLAD I DID!</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!!</li>
            <li>The quick cool shots of air are great too!  </li>
            <li>And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering purchasing the professional model because I was so impressed by this one (and</li>
            <li>Love it, nice size</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product, I had many a good hair days :</li>
            <li>I would have liked it better</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever owned a hair dryer I&#x27;ve liked more.</li>
            <li>I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  </li>
            <li>i took it to costa rica with my, easy to travel with, great and quick dryer!</li>
            <li>Okay, I haven&#x27;t owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years, but I must say, this one is exactly perfect and has everything I would ever want in a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer does a very fine job of dryng my hair.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer and perfect when traveling</li>
            <li>A perfect little dryer for a GREAT price.</li>
            <li>Good looking and powerful foldable blow dryer!</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s got great power without it being so hot that you have to worry about the heat burning your hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer seemed great at first, but it just stopped working after about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>We first experienced this dryer in a hotel.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>POWERFUL AND NOT EXPENSIVE, IT&#x27;S THE PERFECT SIZE,LOVE IT</li>
            <li>This blow dryer dries my hair quickly and I loved the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hair dryer for the money - quick drying time</li>
            <li>Nice Airflow; and the retractable cord is easy to manage when I put it away.</li>
            <li>Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, the handle opens and folds easily, the retractable cord works well.</li>
            <li>It is kind to my thinning hair (I&#x27;m 65+) and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to store (love the retracing cord and fold up handle), saves space, beautifully designed and has great power, it is inexpensive</li>
            <li>The dryer dries my hair quickly and has a good length cord.  </li>
            <li>i love this new blowdryer, it&#x27;s just as it described and was a very good price.</li>
            <li>The cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect -- not too hot and not too cool.</li>
            <li>My wife who is very particular with hair dryers, (takes her own on trips even though every hotel has them) loved it.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is HUGE!  </li>
            <li>The retractable cord is a huge plus!  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I love that this hairdryer folds up, and cord retracts.  </li>
            <li>I love the folding handle, retractable cord and compact design.</li>
            <li>I love thait</li>
            <li>I used this hairdryer in  a hotel and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Seems like they could have made it retract more than that.      </li>
            <li>This hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>Lighter weight, better balanced, cord retracts *</li>
            <li>My hair has not looked better from drying with this product.</li>
            <li>&quot; look most days, but</li>
            <li>Since the heater, motor, and handle still work, I&#x27;m keeping it till I can find something better.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord, although it doesn&#x27;t always completly retract each time.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I knew immediately upon opening the package that I would not be able to give it to her.  </li>
            <li>The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually.</li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>so most travel dryers won&#x27;t do the trick at all.  </li>
            <li>keep looking. :)</li>
            <li>How many of you have wives and daughters that have to sit there and play with the darn thing to get the cord all the way in?  </li>
            <li>Love the look and feel of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Have used this hair dryer for more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love it more.  </li>
            <li>I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>I discovered it in a hotel and had to make it mine:)</li>
            <li>It turns out, that it works better than the one I keep at home.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-larger than my most travel hair dryers I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>I got a conair one instead and it works much better.</li>
            <li>We purchased two of them and love them.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed it all year.</li>
            <li>just wish the cord feature worked better (which was one of the reasons I purchased this model).</li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord</li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>but the cord needs assistance retracting and could have more power.</li>
            <li>I love the retracting cord and folding feature, it stores neatly at home as well.  </li>
            <li>We love it and again for the price you cannot beat it.  </li>
            <li>Replaced it with a 2175 Watt Conair Blackbird which is weaker and more cumbersome.</li>
            <li>I love the way it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of heat.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will get used to the heaviness the more I use it.  </li>
            <li>but the Andis is so much more</li>
            <li>a great product, reliability, functional, fast drying and&lt;br /&gt;gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; or \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>She likes the Andis better than the one she has at home.</li>
            <li>and I can safely say that it is a bit better because it is quieter.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for several weeks now and am still very happy.  </li>
            <li>OMG I love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>so bought 2 on line and then 2 more wanting to share this with my close friends and sister.  </li>
            <li>But that is somewhat appropriate.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>light weight, effective hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Bought one for home and love it.  </li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t need to make sure the cord isn&#x27;t touched by water.</li>
            <li>I have had many blow-dryers.</li>
            <li>First of all the price is amazing for what you get!</li>
            <li>the retractable cord gets stuck , but still love it</li>
            <li>which once you have this you won&#x27;t be able to ever buy one without this feature.</li>
            <li>I love my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have bought one more just to have on hand.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord component works most times, but does need some help and has gotten stuck a couple of times (I&#x27;ve had the hairdryer a month now).  </li>
            <li>For $20, if it lasts a year its better than the competition.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well or better and leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would be more compact, for traveling.</li>
            <li>Does the job better than most.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>If I need to use the retractable cord feature, I manually wind the cord before storing but most of the time, I store without retracting the cord.</li>
            <li>Seems quieter and more flow too ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you :)</li>
            <li>This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a \\&quot;mid-size\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Love the retractable plug.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, much better than what I had</li>
            <li>in more, though.</li>
            <li>I love the retracting cord and that the handle folds</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more compact.  </li>
            <li>I like the retractable cord the most and the folding handle.  </li>
            <li>We love this.  </li>
            <li>love everything about it</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>If your hair requires more, perhaps look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I got to try this while staying at a Grand Hyatt, but I wish I had used the Babyliss travel dryer I brought with me.</li>
            <li>The even better part is I now have tons of body.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s quite pleased and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  </li>
            <li>but I fell in love with this one when I was staying in the ritz carlton hotel.</li>
            <li>this dryer is so much better than the two revlons i used before.</li>
            <li>This one is compact and I love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Get one at the pharmacy for $5 more and you will be better</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love the fold up handle and retracting cord.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Although it is OK, it is not one that I would have selected just as a hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>, I would love for it to be</li>

            <li>It is very easy to use and light weight.</li>
            <li>Honestly - this blow dryer doesn&#x27;t work any better than another one I could have purchased in the super market.  </li>
            <li>Normally, 3-5 days delivery is great for me.</li>
            <li>Pretty good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>good quality, blows plenty  of hot air.</li>
            <li>Still retracts, but nowhere as good as when it was first purchased.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  </li>
            <li>When unfolded, this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it.  </li>

            <li>I used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little dryer when it works, but my experience has been that \\&quot;when it works\\&quot; can be iffy at best.    </li>
            <li>all this is a great little dryer, at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Compact and light and easy to store I wish I had purchased this six months ago!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and stores nicely.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I stumbled upon this at a hotel I was staying at and couldnt believe how much I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I love how it compacts for easy storage.</li>
            <li>The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and I love the &amp;#</li>
            <li>Love the way it folds up and is easy to transport and store.</li>

            <li>I purchased this dryer because I wanted a compact, easily portable dryer for travel &amp; the idea of a retractable cord was appealing.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly, folds up nicely and neatly.</li>
            <li>but I love the retractable cord and the fact that it folds and fits easily in my vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>It takes some precision switching fr hot to cool &amp; vise-versa, otherwise it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is...</li>
            <li>Sure glad it was still available.</li>
            <li>I fly frequently, and the space in my luggage is precious.  </li>
            <li>It folds up nicely and works great for my daily use at home.</li>
            <li>I used it myself again for 2 weeks and loved it so much that I ordered 2 more.</li>

            <li>When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  </li>
            <li>Love this one...handle works, cord retracts just fine /</li>
            <li>and it works fine on the dog.  :)</li>
            <li>The blower itself works fine, but I bought it for the retractable cord, which is more a pain than a gain.</li>
            <li>I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  </li>
            <li>Very good and efficient quiet too.</li>
            <li>But what I like best is the low setting which is fantastic for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It would probably be best to spend a little more to get a better quality dryer than to replace this one a couple time a year.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s compact, powerful and the folding handle/retractable cord are great little features that make it ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair dryers I have found for the money I spent.  </li>
            <li>I also have Carpel Tunnel and appreciate this is a light weight dryer compared to most.</li>
            <li>I have used this dryer in hotels before but never have I experienced a dryer that is this loud.</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>Fortunately we travel more by ground</li>
            <li>/&gt;This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for my young daughter to use.</li>
            <li>It works better than any hair dryer she has ever had but its dirt cheap</li>
            <li>It is light and love the retractible cord.</li>
            <li>Great dryer except that the retractable cord stops completely retracting.  </li>

            <li>It heats up, has a retractable cord and folds for easy storage.</li>
            <li>There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
            <li>It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Powerful, nice grip, light and not too noisy.</li>
            <li>STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  </li>
            <li>Strong and compact</li>
            <li>I have not had chance to use it allot, but so far so good :)</li>
            <li>you can get a ionic ceramic dryer with a high wattage that doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp, makes your hair look good , folds, retracts cord, and doesn&#x27;t cost $200, what is there to think about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a portable hair dryer it is ok, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>The heat is consistent and quick, and the air flow if good.  </li>
            <li>and I love the cool button.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own the first time, and now when I press the button to retract, I have to help the cord go in.  </li>
            <li>We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!</li>
            <li>I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago</li>
            <li>Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li>If you want to blow dry your hair quickly, this hair dryer is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed, I wrote down the name of the dryer and searched for it on line.  </li>
            <li>It is hands down the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used in my life</li>
            <li>This is a very good hairdryer -- doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a full size hair dryer made by the same company, and they&#x27;re both very good quality hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>the end was when the folding handle just quit holding in place, thus a good time to get a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 years and the cord still retracts just fine.</li>
            <li>- it dries my hair efficiently and the cord retracts fine.</li>
            <li>The blow dryer works fine</li>
            <li>Easy to get the hair styled, light weight.</li>
            <li>Although the blowdryer dries my hair just fine, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already had some issues with the retractable cord, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>handle is awesome as well (takes up less space when storing)  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The retractable cord and folding handle work fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li>My hair feels a lot softer and not burnt, so the lower heat seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>Still works fine.</li>
            <li>Home use is fine and it&#x27;s compact because of the retractable cord and folding handle.  </li>
            <li>That works fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working fine.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting dries hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>The price was fine and it arrived timely; just as it appeared in the photo shown on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer was working fine for about 2 months.</li>
            <li>That works fine for me</li>
            <li>The weight seems fine to me.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived and it is fine  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length fine hair.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to store.</li>
            <li>My replacement however has been fine.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to use and compact.  </li>
            <li>Excellent First  Introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable</li>
            <li>and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something light and easy to store, hence the foldable handle and retractable cords.</li>
            <li>It dries well, folds up perfectly to fit in my cabinet, and the cord even pulls in so I can easily store it or pack it.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>Is it fine for trips?</li>
            <li>The cord retracts smoothly and folds easily.  </li>

            <li>Seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Its Ion technology dries my hair so quickly!</li>
            <li>The Andis Ionic Hair Dryer has alot of power in drying your hair quick!  </li>
            <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the others and it folds up real nice for packing and storing in the drawer.</li>
            <li>It is effecient &amp; drys hair quickly and makes my hair shine!  </li>
            <li>This dryer does well with drying quickly &amp; being relatively kind to your hair; powerful for its size.  </li>
            <li>love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pack my own dyer as it&#x27;s large and bulky, and had to use the hotel dryer.</li>
            <li>It was the best little hair dryer ever....loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect little size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel</li>
            <li>Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush.</li>
            <li>The best, hands down!</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional.</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge improvement in my hair.  </li>
            <li>wanted to replace my huge hairdryer with something&lt;br /&gt;smaller</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer because I liked it so much when I used at our hotel on vacation in April.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a hairdryer that leaves my hair so smooth at the ends.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is cheap</li>
            <li>I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this dryer regularly for 8 months now and it is a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li>so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air.</li>
            <li>I used this hair dryer at a hotel and liked it so much i took a picture of it</li>
            <li>Still happy with the way it dries my hair, but have found the same problem others have with the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li>The retracting cord works smoothly, too.</li>
            <li>More importantly it&#x27;s Powerful ...</li>
            <li>At this price, I&#x27;ll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  </li>
            <li>The hair-dryer has a softer sound to it, so it doesn&#x27;t disturb any one in the house.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability -- an asset for storage and travel.</li>
            <li>CHEAPLY MADE, THE CORD WOULD NOT FULLY RETRACT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUSH IT IN</li>
            <li>I have to say this blow-dryer is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I suppose it all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for in a dryer, but I would say overall, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li>the retractable cord is a great convenience in my tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li>Love the blow dryer, however the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.</li>
            <li>I like the compact size and light weight of of this dryer.</li>
            <li>Then one day I&#x27;m using it and it makes that godawful sound again.</li>
            <li>I bought this for it compactness hoping it would be light for carrying to the gym.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and works so well and</li>
            <li>Bought it primarily  for the retractable cord feature.  </li>
            <li>When you held it, you could feel how cheaply made it was.  </li>
            <li>It is a fabulous hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Compact &amp; light.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is so smooth and works well.</li>
            <li>Its not to big, and great to take with you on the go.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars based on the fantastic warranty and customer service.</li>
            <li>I have had it now for several years and it is still working great.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I ordered one online.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey CHI and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle.</li>
            <li>cord did not retract smoothly or reliably.  </li>
            <li>Tons of power and comfortable to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much I came home and ordered one.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>Overall - I think this is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I found my hair was silky and smooth</li>
            <li>If you dont have space for a regular one, this is great.</li>
            <li>It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  </li>
            <li>Cant believe I found such a great affordable blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I used this hairdryer staying at a JWMarriott and liked it so much I had to find it and purchase for myself.  </li>
            <li>but I returned it because I couldn&#x27;t find a curling diffuser to fit</li>
            <li>Also it folds up so it fit in the drawer.</li>
            <li>Found this gem in a hotel in Savannah and liked it so much I took a photo and found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Completly died after one month of light use.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love this powerful hairdryer and the compact design is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>It depends what features are important to you.  </li>
            <li>Ionic  feature makes hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>The light weight, retractable cord and folding handle is what sold me.</li>
            <li>Over all still like the fact it will fit in my bath drawer regardless.</li>
            <li>was light weight and compact.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There was such a noticeable difference my boyfriend even commented on how great my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I keep this in and nothing else would fit.</li>
            <li>so I need to pack light.</li>
            <li>Also was not as light as I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than not retracting, but there&#x27;s a good 8 inches left after its retracted.  </li>
            <li>Although larger and heavier than most folding dryer&#x27;s,the price was good</li>
            <li>and so far the quality has been good also.</li>
            <li>Yep, its loud, but it works, and it works good.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly without drying it out and the retractable cord and folding handle makes it easy to pack and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>The product is really good, the hair becomes shine and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Conair 1875 Ionic and this and this Andis is far superior to it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Thanks Andis for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military.</li>
            <li>She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  </li>
            <li>well made, blows good a solid hair dryer, would buy again, glad to have found this.</li>
            <li>Good price, no problems so far.</li>
            <li>This manufacturer was familiar to me because I groom my dog with their fine clippers.  </li>
            <li>Tried this at a hotel when I was out of town on business - looked it right away, since I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to control air flow switch cool air blast button are a plus.</li>
            <li>The dryer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and compact.</li>
            <li>its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful.</li>
            <li>The force of the air blowing is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Very powerful</li>
            <li>It is very powerful.</li>
            <li>The main feature of this dryer that I find most appealing is the power.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, dry fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  </li>
            <li>It dries your hair fast and the cool feature is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a Medium speed which is rare, and the Cool setting, which I love.</li>
            <li>Made packing super easy.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable.</li>
            <li>We used this hair dryer in the hotel in New Mexico and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>like I had used a serum and best of all, my hair dried so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li>When it came, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for use at home everyday!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s powerful!</li>
            <li>I first used this hair dryer in a hotel and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It fits our small bathroom perfectly and create a neat organized drawer with the retractable cord.    </li>
            <li>So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister.</li>
            <li>I saved the original packaging and it says there is a 60 month warranty</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it after my first use.  </li>
            <li>have very fine hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t get too hot but dries it quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered it when I got home and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently!</li>
            <li>Well worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>Deducted a star from my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>So far it meets all of her expectations and we&#x27;re very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Works ok, still noisy and gets too hot to touch</li>
            <li>That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not as warm as my normal one</li>
            <li>Originally saw this hair dryer in a Hyatt House hotel...</li>
            <li>Great for travel and does not fry my long hair like the hotel dryers.</li>
            <li>This is my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair dryer, but ti&#x27;s powerful!  </li>
            <li>Great power yet small and with the retractable cord very easy to store.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is medium size, easy to hold and not awkward feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed by how powerfully and quickly it dried my hair.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast, isn&#x27;t too loud, my hair looks great all day.</li>
            <li>Despite having a foldable handle and retractable cord, the hair dryer is built very well and doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as many $20 portable hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Only had my dryer for a month but so far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  </li>
            <li>Works well, good power, able to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li>powerful, folds up and the cord retractor is strong.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very nicely using the focused tip; has 2 heat levels plus a cool dry; is light weight; has a retractable cord and folds up.</li>
            <li>Great for my daughter&#x27;s college dorm room with limited space.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, which is good for my incredibly thick hair, but it&#x27;s great to have the cooling button on it.  </li>
            <li>I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  </li>
            <li>Very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>The reason &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; can blow circuit breakers.  </li>
            <li>I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it.</li>
            <li>My wife is the one who uses it the most, and she found it to be large and cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special there, but it dries</li>
            <li>The price was right and it is compact which she loves!</li>
            <li>Price was right, too!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get super hot but very powerful!</li>
            <li>I first used this blowdryer at a hotel and liked it so much I looked for it online.</li>
            <li>and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  </li>
            <li>Last week the barrel got bright orange like a flame thrower again</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers, but this one is really a good product.  </li>
            <li>Works great, cord retracts as expected.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and has the feature of retractable cord; however, it doesn&#x27;t always work smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Use the cool shot button at the end of drying so as to set the style.</li>
            <li>(so you will have the wire hanging outside), but its power was really good compared to the price..</li>
            <li>I have a full sized one for home</li>
            <li>and I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the full sized version.</li>
            <li>It was convenient for travel and did a good job, just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I like that it has the cool shot option.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have the cool temp option</li>
            <li>Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li>However, this dryer has 3 settings - Hi, Med, Lo - and a cool button.  </li>
            <li>It also has a cool blast button, but I don&#x27;t use that.</li>
            <li>I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews</li>
            <li>It is also true about the manufacturer&#x27;s return policy.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s almost a full size hair dryer</li>
            <li>and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy.</li>
            <li>I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst</li>
            <li>However I do wish for a slimmer/lighter aluminum frame blower with ultra quite and powerful motor, and a smooth retractable frame mechanism, using variable heat/speed adjustment.</li>
            <li>This is a good dryer, especially for travel use.  </li>
            <li>Waited for it to cool off and threw it away.</li>
            <li>but because it folds, it travels very well with the power you can&#x27;t get from most</li>
            <li>Changing the switch setting did not make a difference, it continued to run at full speed.  </li>
            <li>Fair price including the extra for shipping.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as frizzy and full of flyaways (though it&#x27;s been moist where i&#x27;m at).</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it so much</li>
            <li>Needed to wait to cool off.</li>
            <li>and she simply said she loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full sized dryer that happens to fold and has a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>It has a good solid feel and heft.</li>
            <li>Is good but is not for travell is big</li>
            <li>It works well when it works, however its only good for 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li>I love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology, which I really need for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Besides the weight, it is full size in length as well, which just happens to fold.    </li>
            <li>It is good just too big.</li>
            <li>The dryer works really well, and I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>This will be the best $20 you&#x27;ve spent in a long time; plus, I was able to get free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Aim, blow, cool blast</li>
            <li>MY HAIR WAS SO FULL OF BODY AND SHINY--</li>
            <li>We have a home full of blow dryers, every bathroom has one</li>
            <li>Retractable cord and it folds, even though it is full size and full power.</li>
            <li>Nice power &amp; doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair like my old dryer did.</li>
            <li>The heat settings are high-medium-low, plus there&#x27;s a cool button for a shot of cool air when you&#x27;re styling.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is powerful and leaves hair feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cord doesn&#x27;t always retract well, but good enough.  </li>
            <li>I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is perfect for thick hair.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s absolute favorite hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I really wanted more speeds as it turns out.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Cool shot&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t come out as cool as I would like.  </li>
            <li>the cool setting works</li>
            <li>I like the 3 speeds plus the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  </li>
            <li>Good hair dryer especially for the price!!</li>
            <li>nice size, color and not heavy weight.</li>
            <li>I am a flight attendant and many hotels I stay in have this hair dryer</li>
            <li>It does fold up but it is a full size hair dryer.</li>
            <li>She loved hers, so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, compacts well, retractable cord works but could use a tiny bit of help now and again.</li>
            <li>It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad value at all.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and have found it to have good temperature and it leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it more manageable than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair)</li>
            <li>It easily folds up and the cord retracts to a nice short length.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t tried it yet during the humid summer months when my hair frizzes out, right now my hair is unbelievably smooth after drying.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this one due to the great reviews and price.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Other than the cord retraction issue, it is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is very compact, great for travelling, and the best part is that it actually works despite its small size!</li>
            <li>I gave it a try the other day and was so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The reasonable price and great performance are the features that me coming back to this brand.</li>
            <li>Quick drying</li>
            <li>Product dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product, especially for the price - quite powerful, i like the folding handle and retractable cord</li>
            <li>It dries your hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been super lucky with mine.  </li>
            <li>But it drys quick</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can keep the frizzies out, and my hair dries quickly without drying out.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for travel, although slightly bigger than some of the mini blowdryers it stays compact because of the retractably cord and folding handle, and you get all the power of a standard blow dryer and ionic technology</li>
            <li>If the cord doesn&#x27;t go in the first time, pull it all the way out, make sure its not twisted, and try it again.  </li>
            <li>This thing dries my hair super quick.</li>
            <li>Luckily my voltage transformer did not burn out</li>
            <li>Yet, it dries as quickly as any hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord was a selling point for me, and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a super buy at the price .</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and is lightweight and the retractable cord is a plus.  </li>
            <li>Although I do have to admit it&#x27;s definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually.</li>
            <li>We bought this after using one at a high end hotel and are quite pleased.</li>
            <li>This blowdryer is light and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the folding handle and retractable cord ( neither of which has caused me any trouble) but what most impresses me is how quickly it dries my hair, even my daughter who has enough hair for 10 people was impressed with it&#x27;s speed of drying her hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t just find products and fall in love like this, but as I was doing my hair</li>
            <li>This is the only ceramic, ionic blow dryer with a retractable cord that I could find on the market and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot but has a lot of power which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud, either, which I like, and the ions actually make my hair feel so much smoother afterwards, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is a huge plus, the folding neck is a plus, I really just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that even though I ordered 2 items separately on the same say, they both arrived as promised and in one box.</li>
            <li>loved that it had the ionic ceramic features exactly like my full size Andis hair dryer I use regularly at home.</li>
            <li>The settings are also good - 3 varieties that dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already</li>
            <li>Light weight, and folds easily for storage and has a good &#x27;balance&#x27; for my small hand.</li>
            <li>I really needed a new dryer and I&#x27;m glad I picked this one!</li>
            <li>well, this may not be the most powerful dryer on the market, but i highly recommend it because: &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying my new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using my new dryer.</li>
            <li>Because of size and weight, it&#x27;s not well-suited for travel, and the retractable cord does not fully retract, but from reviews I&#x27;ve read, this type of mechanism is problematic more often than not - you just live with the fickle function when you choose a model with both a retractable cord and a folding handle.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, although a tad heavy, but works like a full size dryer.  </li>
            <li>Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally</li>
            <li>I would recommend this dryer for someone who wants a compact, easy to use hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Retractable cord and folding handle are very convenient and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Still a pretty good price, but I won&#x27;t buy the same item for fear that it will break again.</li>
            <li>Plus, as promised, this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy.</li>
            <li>My hair also is smoother looking after drying.  Very convenient as it has the retractable cord and folds for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and very affordable.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  </li>
            <li>, the air velocity is higher, the hair dries quicker and better and at the end of the day the hair feels much smoother and silkier than ever</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer because it is fast, not too hot and saves me time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and drys my hair quickly without &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Also I wish that the cool shot would correspond to low/medium/high, but even though I have the dryer on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; the pressure comes out higher for the cool shot.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li>This one was at or very near the top.</li>
            <li>+&#x27;s are that it&#x27;s simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord &amp; has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  </li>
            <li>I like the different settings, and the high setting it very effective.   </li>
            <li>I used the dryer the first time and my hair felt like silk!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  </li>
            <li>I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer and when I plugged it in for the first time, it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom!</li>
            <li>This was my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother - spend a little more and get a much better quality for your money!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much smoother after drying it!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was needing and wanting !</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem.</li>
            <li>Light weight, not too loud and easy on the hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to take with me and dries my hair fast!</li>
            <li>Also great if you’re tight on space.</li>
            <li>The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>It really dries my hair quickly, which helps with the frizz!</li>
            <li>The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!</li>
            <li>I had been using a travel hairdryer and liked that it was compact, yet powerful enough to get the job done quickly.    </li>
            <li>Great little folding hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great little dryer.</li>
            <li>I used one of these at a Marriott once, and thought it was a great little dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Great device for it&#x27;s little size.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, not to loud and cord retracts just fine.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t be available then, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing</li>
            <li>Wow, it is huge ... and not just huge for a &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; ...</li>
            <li>Great size, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It came out straight and smooth</li>
            <li>The handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes, so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes.</li>
            <li>Great for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li>I had no hair product on my hair, just freshly shampooed.  </li>
            <li>It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a dryer, but I liked this one enough after my hotel test-drive that I will be purchasing one immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 2012:</li>
            <li>and I did not use the hair dryer more than 5 or 6 times, it has stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  </li>
            <li>The wind is never too powerful.</li>
            <li>The air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter.  </li>
            <li>It is quite powerful and ionic.  </li>
            <li>Almost good enough to replace my actual blow dryer (which to be fair is about 3 years old).    </li>
            <li>It has lots of power, more than my old full-size one.</li>
            <li>Nice unit when it works, but none of them last over a year.  </li>
            <li>You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t worth me packaging and going to post office etc</li>
            <li>My own hairdryer finally gave out</li>
            <li>Extremely useful to have the retractable cable.</li>
            <li>Its powerful, the cord retracts, and the handle folds...</li>
            <li>This is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size.  </li>
            <li>Used this product at a Courtyard Marriott and was surprised to find it better than my home hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  </li>
            <li>Works well on low setting too, and  folds nicely for travel.</li>
            <li>a hotel, I used this blow dryer and was amazed at how powerful it was.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer.</li>
            <li>IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>Compact and powerful.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer itself is lightweight yet delivers a powerful performance.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was nice enough to replace the dryer at no charge, just after the return policy expired.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s powerful and</li>
            <li>Now, I cannot seem to get it to completely retract - maybe 5 inches at most.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and compact,excellent for travel.</li>
            <li>Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it was an effective hair dryer, but there are several that work as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a powerful hair dryer and found this at a resort.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out</li>
            <li>Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful .</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s definitely a quality product -- what&#x27;s nice is that, unlike some of those clunky heavier types, it is still quite lightweight and a  &#x27;breeze&#x27; to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, yet portable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is so powerful.</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>but it is powerful</li>
            <li>Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability.</li>
            <li>It gets good and hot to dry my hair</li>
            <li>Small size easy storage and does the job fairly well and with</li>
            <li>I usually do not believe negative reviews if there are many, many, many more positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hot, but dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries super fast and with ZERO frizz!</li>
            <li>very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick!</li>
            <li>retractible cord, folds for packing, dries very well, affordable and salon friendly</li>
            <li>My other dryer has been retired, for good.</li>
            <li>read other reviews also, seems like a good deal but not worth it if it breaks this quickly and easily!!</li>
            <li>The cord retraction has to be \\&quot;helped\\&quot; right at the end, but that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>I guess I wasn&#x27;t reading the description quite right when I ordered this dryer, I was hoping it had 2 levels of power plus 3 temps.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    </li>
            <li>was right.  </li>
            <li>Died right after the return period expired.</li>
            <li>I went home, found it on Amazon, and ordered one right away.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li>It broke right away.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and we are very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>I bought a T3 hair dryer over a year ago, and it broke after about 15 uses (it made a funny sound and stopped working without being damaged), so I will never spend that much money on a hair dryer again</li>
            <li>This is great - powerful but small.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image)</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage.</li>
            <li>The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there.</li>
            <li>Told the BF how much I loved it and he ended up going to the hotel on one of his next trips and they sold him a new one from housekeeping right from the hotel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, retract cord and high powered.</li>
            <li>it gets it&#x27;s thoroughly dry, I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the replacement - the Babylisspro TT for only a little more $ - looks nicer, feels nicer, works nicer, and is lighter.</li>
            <li>a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  </li>
            <li>Great price, sturdy, dries my thick shoulder-length hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that powerful and my girls would most likely kill this pretty quick.</li>
            <li>We like the new unit fine.</li>
            <li>so great that I took it out of the carry on and began using it in place of my usual blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the cool setting very often</li>
            <li>I wanted something small and it has been great.</li>
            <li>Great for a small apartment.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li>I use the medium setting and find it more than adequate to dry my hair fairly quickly</li>
            <li>Is is easy to hold and has a blast of air that easily dries long hair.</li>
            <li>It was so good that I wrote down the model</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a former hairdresser, and has long been loyal to Conair dryers, but this one had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s an exceptional dryer for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for something a little more durable, even if it ends up costing a bit more.</li>
            <li>A good dryer, I must admit I don&#x27;t find anything particularly different about this Ionic dryer as compared to other dryers (e.g., I can&#x27;t say my hair is shinier or more manageable).</li>
            <li>I was looking at other hair dryers, and 10$ more, 20$ more-- didnt seem to be much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Note that the retractable cord didn&#x27;t work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>overall, great dryer at a terrific price!</li>
            <li>my waist length hair super fast,..</li>
            <li>This is a great looking and functioning item that is essential in every home--especially ones with smaller bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>I think this dryer is a great deal for the money, especially with the added features of the retractable cord, folding handle and multiple speed settings.  </li>
            <li>And it literally does not dry for more than 5 minutes because it over heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This being said, this particular dryer&#x27;s cord only retracts &#x27;most&#x27; of the way, leaving a 6&amp;#34; tail and the plug hanging free to dangle and tangle.</li>
            <li>It dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud.</li>
            <li>The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying.</li>
            <li>This dryer is shaped for optimal delivery of air, and the airflow volume feels as powerful at altitude as most similarly priced consumer hair dryers at sea level.</li>
            <li>It has lots of power and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I am beginning to try to find time to go back and voice feedback on the items I use most in my household.</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good dryer I retired my old one</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had spent more time reading them!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and since I am use to hairdryers being a bit loud, this one was not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>I like the hair dryer very much.  </li>
            <li>Your effort will be very much</li>
            <li>The price for this hairdryer is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and so far she likes it fine.</li>
            <li>It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair.</li>
            <li>Still, I believe I got my money&#x27;s worth with this very decent Andis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm enough to dry the hair but minimizes the stress and damage that the heat of most dryers inflicts.  </li>
            <li>the handle does not &#x27;lock&#x27; into the extended position, so it was a little tricky trying to hold the hair dryer in a good position to use it.  </li>
            <li>This blowdryer is everything I was looking for; affordable, compactable (but beware, it&#x27;s not a dinky little thing), durable and of course, good at drying hair.     </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s  a good little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great hair dryer with 3 speeds, which is super hard to find!  </li>
            <li>Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting?</li>
            <li>Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn&#x27;t stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use.</li>
            <li>Good value, strong air flow , and enough heat for a fast dry.</li>
            <li>While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  </li>
            <li>What sucked was that it broke within the first week of owning it.  </li>
            <li>When I went to pull it out of the wall to check my outlet, the adapter was so hot it burned my hand, and the plastic had started to melt.</li>
            <li>Definitely way better than using those hair scorchers attached to hotel bathroom walls,</li>
            <li>has three speeds unlike most dryers that only have two settings.</li>
            <li>I find the medium and low settings to lack the heat, and sometimes want to finish my hair with lower fan speed with more heat.</li>
            <li>First used this hair dryer when staying at a motel &amp; had to have it.  </li>
            <li>Not too much to say; it works well and is powerful.</li>
            <li>My first unit was purchased in April, before traveling to China for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Most hairdryers will last a couple years.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the weight of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>its bigger than I thought but better that what I had.</li>
            <li>I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li>So we took a photo and found the exact model on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t aware that it</li>
            <li>I love my ANDIS Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer, I throw it in my travel bag, it has all the power of a bigger, heavier dryer.    </li>
            <li>This was the first one I have seen with a retractable cord, which is what first attracted me.  </li>
            <li>I had tried this one without the retracting cord at a hotel and liked its more quiet and fast drying on my long hair.</li>
            <li>The air is never too hot.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product at Four Seasons Hualalai in Kona.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason.  </li>
            <li>First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  </li>
            <li>I was also interested in trying a ceramic dryer to see if it made a difference in hair health</li>
            <li>The first model I received stopped retracting the cord within a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and the cord still retracts (most of the way, but not quite all the way).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had one of those last more than a year.</li>
            <li>THE HANDLE FOLDS &amp; IT DRYS VERY WELL!  </li>
            <li>Bigger than most travel size blow dryers but</li>
            <li>It had the hot, electric smell.</li>
            <li>I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  </li>
            <li>Lastly I think the product could be improved with a more ergonomic handle.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to &amp;#34;mix and match&amp;#34; speeds and heat settings, but that&#x27;s not possible.</li>
            <li>And it was reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>Even on the highest setting it&#x27;s not too hot.</li>
            <li>First saw at hotel in San Diego.  </li>
            <li>I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not feeling the ionic part of the dryer, I had a different brand before that worked way better.</li>
            <li>After the first day of using this hair dryer, I knew I had to have it.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>But this is a first.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not retract all the way.  </li>
            <li>On top of that the retraction mechanisim stopped working after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Oh, .. it also dries your hair fast!</li>
            <li>First tried this item at a hotel.</li>
            <li>Generally pleased with the dryer, but cord occasionally does not fully retract.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it in an upscale day spa in Chicago.  </li>
            <li>First the cord retraction mechanism stopped working a year ago.</li>
            <li>Not too loud, dries hair quickly, relatively light weight to hold and like the cord retraction feature.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer work exactly like it was described.</li>
            <li>This is the first Andis hair dryer I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I thought it should come with more separate low heat styling controls.</li>
            <li>She really likes it!</li>
            <li>The volume of air his higher</li>
            <li>I bought my first one in May 2012 and it blew up in Dec 2012.  </li>
            <li>For years I have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country &amp; Caribbean.  </li>
            <li>The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  </li>
            <li>The first arrived with a cord that would not retract.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so hot that it fries my hair, yet</li>
            <li>Also, after using it for several weeks&lt;br /&gt;the cord retracts better.</li>
            <li>instead of just the hot.  </li>
            <li>I would surely recommend this if you are looking for a daily use Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that an ionic, ceramic hair dryer could make that much difference!  </li>
            <li>I first tried this dryer when in a hotel in SLC Utah, while traveling on business.</li>
            <li>, I WAS READY FOR STICKER SHOCK!)</li>
            <li>AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be smaller, for travel, but it is ok.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Would absolutely buy it again!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord stopped retracting after the first use</li>
            <li>So now I have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord, leaving about 1/3 hanging out.  </li>
            <li>The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li>My first purchase broke after just two weeks</li>
            <li>, the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  </li>
            <li>and compact.&lt;br /&gt;just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 7-8 years.  </li>
            <li>I first encountered this hair dryer while using one at a hotel.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Con:  sometimes gets too hot</li>
            <li>I finally had to replace my other(identical to this one) because it was damaged during travel (gotta love the airlines)  </li>
            <li>saw this in a hotel first.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li>I really do love this but gave it 4 starts b/c the &amp;#34;push to retract&amp;#34; button pops out often enough when I pull the cord to plug it</li>
            <li>-the idea is novel!&lt;br /&gt;The hot setting is really hot and</li>
            <li>However when I took it to my Eastern Europe tour, it burned out on the first day &amp; even blew the fuse of my hotel room.</li>
            <li>The only way I was able to shut it off was to pull the power cord.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s ever had:  \\&quot;fast and powerful</li>
            <li>Teen daughters love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted three years</li>
            <li>The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!</li>
            <li>It does not get too hot and ruin your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first hair dryer that I don&#x27;t have to do this with.</li>
            <li>Be aware: You&#x27;re paying for the label, not the performance.</li>
            <li>Very compact in size, but dries like a champ!</li>
            <li>Had problems with retraceable cord at first, but now it works every time.</li>
            <li>I gave a 4 stars because the dryer is not that hot.</li>
            <li>First tried this at a Hyatt Hotel.</li>
            <li>I replaced the first one under warranty after about 9 months.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this hair dryer six years ago when I stayed at a hotel in West Palm Beach, FL.  </li>
            <li>First hotel</li>
            <li>Powerful, but gentle.  A+++</li>
            <li>It broke within the first week.  </li>
            <li>Still, a good, but heavy, dryer.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the slide button for the temperature control had more of a lip and/or moved a little more easily, on mine</li>
            <li>For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you&#x27;ll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway).</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I took down the model number and brand name.</li>
            <li>Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels &amp; B&amp;B&#x27;s have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse).</li>
            <li>The thing that annoys me the most is the handle which is square and not super comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of noisy, but does dry hair fast</li>
            <li>Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last long, otherwise very nice</li>
            <li>Folds up to just the right size, the retractable cord is convenient, and it works very well without overdrying.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and there&#x27;s no way to change that at high speed</li>
            <li>It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is a bit heavy and large but has good power</li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand.</li>
            <li>She loved it so much she started using it as her everyday hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is only for 120V and would not be good for international travel.</li>
            <li>This dryer is not quiet but the noise is so much more tolerable compared to some dryers that has whistling noise or just super loud.  </li>
            <li>and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).  </li>
            <li>We had such good hair the entire time!</li>
            <li>Powerful, lots of fan settings, cold air button, and best of all, a retractable cord!</li>
            <li>She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer so much I have an extra one in my guest bathroom!</li>
            <li>Good airflow, a little on the heavy side but great to dry your hair quickly without too much heat!  </li>
            <li>It made my hair less frizzy for sure!</li>
            <li>As she had been in the market for a new one and could not find a suitable one at the big box retailers, I went on to Amazon immediately and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Then right after the return window closed, the retractable cord became more than tricky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  </li>
            <li>This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting.</li>
            <li>I had decided to try it because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i hope your experience is as positive as mine.</li>
            <li>I almost never review items and when I do, they are positive.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>: I wanted to pass along some positive feedback about Andis, the seller.  </li>
            <li>Amazon made ordering and returning a positive customer experience.</li>
            <li>Friends &amp; family that use it also notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li>Worked very well when I first received it.</li>
            <li>Fast drying with lots of shine - I was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5-star hotel I stayed at -</li>
            <li>I notice that it is foldable, drys fast, and not too hot--</li>
            <li>handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  </li>
            <li>We loved it so much that we bought a second one recently when another spare hair dryer we had in the guest room went</li>
            <li>Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died.</li>
            <li>This is a full sized, professional sort of dryer...</li>
            <li>so not sure how good it is yet.</li>
            <li>it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  </li>
            <li>Wrote down the name/model # and immediately came home and ordered one for my own travels.  </li>
            <li>This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn&#x27;t get so hot that I feel like it&#x27;s trying to bake my hair rather than dry it.</li>
            <li>Several reviews mentioned that it broke easily</li>
            <li>It has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it soft and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>When my old Revlon finally bit the dust, I started my online hair dryer research and was amazed to learn that this great hair dryer was available at such a low price.</li>
            <li>I liked the folding feature of the dryer which takes up less space than others.  </li>
            <li>Started making super loud noise and burning smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like my last blow dryer, easy to store with retractable cord.</li>
            <li>They dry works ok for the price.</li>
            <li>This dryer drys quickly and leaves soft and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy and the button which retracts the cord is effecting except on the last inch or two at times.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong after daily use.  </li>
            <li>We have been using these Andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong.</li>
            <li>I HAVE LIMITED SPACE IN THE BATHROOM AND LOVE THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE STYLES FOR THAT REASON.  </li>
            <li>IT IS RATHER LARGE.</li>
            <li>It had all the requirements I wanted except way too large.  </li>
            <li>I have two large ones already.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my &#x27;home&#x27; hair dryer &amp; that is why I returned it.</li>
            <li>Great dryer 3 speeds slow cool button retractable cord and fold up for travel whats left to say ?</li>
            <li>folds,&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer is a good quality and dries my thick hair pretty fast and gives a&lt;br /&gt;silkier texture.</li>
            <li>Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working one morning when my hair was only halfway dry.  </li>
            <li>3mo, holding up strong and traveled to UK and back very well.</li>
            <li>I used this dryer at a hotel in Columbus and loved it because my hair dried quickly, was not overheated in the process, and was so smooth I barely needed to use my flat iron at all to style it.</li>
            <li>Fine, now it&#x27;s a regular drier.</li>
            <li>Works fine especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to spend a little more this time and get something of higher quality!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically it is a decent, no frills dryer that does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my short, thick hair and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The opening where the air blows out is so large, that you really need the attachment to get targeted air.  </li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavier than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it to spend a little more for ceramic technology.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>The dryer seemed to dry my hair at about the same speed as any other dryer, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed with its ceramic or ionic features, even though I think my hair may have been just a wee bit smoother.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!</li>
            <li>This is the only dryer I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my hair puff out and get huge.</li>
            <li>the ionic technology completely renders my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The cord does not retract very well.</li>
            <li>Expected more drying power.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell that it helps the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of them for gifts and the recipients seems to really like them.</li>
            <li>My hair dries in record time and is very silky.</li>
            <li>It is light and on the quiet side.</li>
            <li>I still have to use a flatiron to get a really \\&quot;finished\\</li>
            <li>The motor makes a quiet humming sound, but that&#x27;s it.    </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast this blow dryer works.  </li>
            <li>I do really like the folding feature and retractable cord.</li>
            <li>They make it so much easier to store in a bathroom vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Works better than expected</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>much cleaner look in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>However, the fan really puts out the air.</li>
            <li>Nothing unusual was going on; it just died.</li>
            <li>I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  </li>
            <li>Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I very like it.</li>
            <li>and I wear it straight.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>the noise level is just so high, make you deaf!</li>
            <li>It provides ionic drying which makes you hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works really well.  </li>
            <li>plus it has a couple features that really sold me on it ,  1st</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight!</li>
            <li>I bought another one and now I am more careful.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has 3 \\&quot;speeds.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I really like retractable cords for my hair dryers.</li>
            <li>It makes them so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy and has a powerful airstream.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord.</li>
            <li>but I never seemed to see much benefit from that, either.    </li>
            <li>And it works FAST.</li>
            <li>(I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and</li>
            <li>This thing blows out so much air</li>
            <li>not 100% as powerful as my old hair dryer, but its so compact and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>really well&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to throw it out.</li>
            <li>Fast drying.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord was really tricky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the size as much as the weight.</li>
            <li>it dries hair fast with lots of shine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a hair dryer - how much does quality really matter?</li>
            <li>thanks....</li>
            <li>brought it overseas and it was too much voltage for europe.  </li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Like it but not too much</li>
            <li>Really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>, you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality you get.  </li>
            <li>The cord retractor started not working very well then quit altogether.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know anything about hair dryers</li>
            <li>but this works a lot better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>VERY CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li>I would say that I got my money&#x27;s worth out of a seven year old product.  </li>
            <li>so we don&#x27;t worry much about suitcase space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  </li>
            <li>The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  </li>
            <li>I used this product lightly, however the cord retractor broke after the button fell off and now the power switch doesn&#x27;t operate properly</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  </li>
            <li>disappointing because when it worked it worked great!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very compact and the cord is retractable.</li>
            <li>so treat it gently</li>
            <li>Blow drying is so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I am really picky about blow dryers and my hair, so I am not being frivolous here.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause too much frizz.  </li>
            <li>Really like the results</li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>I only buy ionic hair dryers, as they make your hair really smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried to brush out the lint buildup on the filter but that doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>You gotta expect some noise with that much power.</li>
            <li>It drys your hair fast too.</li>
            <li>If I had not removed the tags from the cord, I would absolutely return it.</li>
            <li>(that incidentally cost 3x as much).  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it has a retractable cord and it folds up...</li>
            <li>The air blows out very forcefully, but doesn&#x27;t seem to feel too &amp;#34;burney.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I buy them 2 at a time because I abuse mine so much.  </li>
            <li>For a compact dryer it really has a lot of power and that is what I need to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>This model is very like the one in the hotel.</li>
            <li>I like the retractable cord and the folding handle; these make storing it much easier.</li>
            <li>Thus, I can stop worrying about too much heat, but still get plenty of air flow.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I returned this hair dryer because, from the very beginning, the cord didn&#x27;t retract.</li>
            <li>but I really do like it.</li>
            <li>It is stronger but nothing that really made me go &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li>This hairdryer works very well having 3 speeds , even heat and the retractable cord and fold up feature</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the 3 settings for air temperature .</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I gave it to my husband who doesn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li>vey well and is very rugged.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li>In addition, that handle wasn&#x27;t very ergonomic...</li>
            <li>I will go with another brand that really backs their products.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy.</li>
            <li>I thought I may of overpaid for just a hair dryer - but this product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but the heat is gentle</li>
            <li>This works very well for a travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord, and folding handle, though, are the real pluses that save the day.</li>
            <li>and it works very well,  </li>
            <li>the vents around the cone distribute the air delivered to the hair so it doesn&#x27;t blow around as much.</li>
            <li>so much I bought one.</li>
            <li>and I really like the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>very compact.</li>
            <li>Very compact.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li>I really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>She really wanted one</li>
            <li>Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel.</li>
            <li>but I have very thin/fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep it though, the retractable cord is a nice function, not present on my current dryer.</li>
            <li>That means it&#x27;s kind of bulky and round.  </li>
            <li>; button occasionally to blow cool air to hair when it get&#x27;s too hot.  </li>
            <li>But compared to many dryers I have tried many do not have the power behind it like this one.</li>
            <li>My last retractable cord dryer had more heat settings than this one, so I do miss the old one.  </li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer for everyday &amp; travel.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>We actually used this in a hotel and loved it so much we wrote down exactly what it was and ordered one for home.</li>
            <li>This leaves the large wall plug and a significant length of cord, about enough to wrap around the body and handle 1.5 times.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and folds into itself...takes up minimal space in your luggage yet, very powerful!  </li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when the new one worked exactly five times...then quit.</li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City.</li>
            <li>: The low, medium and high work fine.</li>
            <li>Based upon other reviews I expected a really great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>long cord that easily retracts without whipping into things or your face.</li>
            <li>My other gym mates love this and use mine while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to get a new one that quickly.</li>
            <li>Very convenient for travel, and dry my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>And I will conider the a large full sized dryer when I get a larger restroom.    </li>
            <li>Only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but for travel purposes, it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
            <li>the ther is it doesn&#x27;t make her hais as static as other blow dryers..</li>
            <li>only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won&#x27;t retract sometimes, but the dryer is still powerful &amp; works like a charm!</li>
            <li>Due to the folding handle, retractable cord, the fact that it is ionic, as well as all of the raving reviews, I thought I would love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>more moving parts usually equals more likely to break).  </li>
            <li>but it takes significantly longer than the one I left at home.  </li>
            <li>The warranty only covers 12 months from original purchase date</li>
            <li>The cord is also nearly a completely loss, the spring loaded retraction only pulls about half the cord in and you can&#x27;t even forcibly shove more than 3/4 of the cord into it.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd times it did the same , but I was able to dry most of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry</li>
            <li>The high isn&#x27;t very high either.</li>
            <li>There is a real difference from the old style dryers - namely the air coming out is not as hot</li>
            <li>It works so much faster than my older one.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair</li>
            <li>word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is smaller than my old one, and fits easily into the drawer.  </li>
            <li>My wife has an abundant, curly head of hair, and when her dryer took its last breath, I looked for a replacement with both ionic and heat sink (ceramic) qualities to efficiently dry her hair without damaging it.  </li>
            <li>The downside is that I don&#x27;t really see a difference in it drying my hair any more efficiently than the blow dryer I had previous.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair and this hair dryer does a great job of getting my hair dry FAST without making me feel like I&#x27;m scorching my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair</li>
            <li>Dries your hair a lot quicker, hair is super smooth and less frizzy!  </li>
            <li>In December, I decided to buy another one for my carry on---same make and model, figuring the first one died early because of the China experience.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is pretty good for a college dorm; it&#x27;s small, the cord is retractable, and the handle folds to make the item seem smaller when you&#x27;re not using it.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the \\&quot;retractable\\&quot; cord is completely misleading.</li>
            <li>It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>They are only partly true...</li>
            <li>It is actually only 3 air speeds + a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty loud</li>
            <li>The only difference in settings between my full sized one and</li>
            <li>Just know that this is a pretty loud blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment!</li>
            <li>I just bought this one because of the reviews, but its nice, not too small but...</li>
            <li>The cool setting actually works.</li>
            <li>We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it&#x27;s a full size</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad for the price, wish it were quieter.</li>
            <li>For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer.</li>
            <li>there is a cool button that cools your hair down no matter what setting you have it on, and 3rd it has a foldable handle who could ask for more..</li>
            <li>Love that it has a retractablr cord and that it folds down.  </li>
            <li>This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this dryer is the design for compact storage - not only does the handle fold in, but the cord retracts - especiallly nice if you are constantly stuffing your dryer in a small drawer.</li>
            <li>It has 3 heat settings (low, medium, and high) and a cool setting.</li>
            <li>Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    </li>
            <li>This fabulous little dryer is also a great size for travel, or simply taking up less space in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Ditch the fancy dryers and go for this one.</li>
            <li>More powerful than some of the other larger hair dryers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to travel dryer as it dries my hair so much faster than my non-travel dryer.</li>
            <li>It worked fine maybe the first half dozen times</li>
            <li>but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point</li>
            <li>I decided to try the ionic/ceramic technology to see if it would work better and be less damaging.</li>
            <li>I love the retractable cord and that the dryer folds in half.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair with more air and less heat.</li>
            <li>but the cord doesn&#x27;t retract much more than half way.  </li>
            <li>The retracting cord on the Andis works much better than my previous dryer and does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; when retracting.  </li>
            <li>And for the money is a decent buy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s retractable wire is another plus.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this dryer mainly because of the 3 heat settings.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than dryers that are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should.</li>
            <li>A decent dryer for the price (maybe).</li>
            <li>I sent it back for a refund which Amazon quickly honored.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a bit heavy and kind of loud.  </li>
            <li>A few weeks ago I was using it when suddenly the barrel got bright orange like it was on fire.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I always have a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; hair dryer, so I dusted that off &amp; used it.  </li>
            <li>First, the cord is pretty short.</li>
            <li>I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and</li>
            <li>Particularly, she loves the cord retract.  </li>
            <li>but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend&#x27;s house since it works so well.</li>
            <li>This replace an earlier model that has stood up well over many years, but finally quit.</li>
            <li>but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this particular dryer again.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought</li>
            <li>Although I do love this dryer they seem to last only one year or so.</li>
            <li>a nice change from my old one which dried out my hair.</li>
            <li>Works better than my more expensive dryers.</li>
            <li>seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused.  </li>
            <li>It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc.</li>
            <li>When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  </li>
            <li>Very loud!  </li>
            <li>Works great for its intended use, especially for how small it is!</li>
            <li>Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  </li>
            <li>However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I use high.  </li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s on high heat though, so don&#x27;t let that deter you if you don&#x27;t like that.)  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for curly-hair individuals.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Tried this hair dryer in a high class hotel.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market, I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For the price, I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It was a high end hotel that we stayed in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had high end</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for the Andis</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>3 speeds with 1 temp each (you can&#x27;t go medium heat, high speed, for example -</li>
            <li>, it truly was FABULOUS!!!!i would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve had it for 10 months the switch is stuck on high and won&#x27;t budge</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars (instead of two) because it does work well even if it is stuck on high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review.</li>
            <li>Way too loud and large for travel.</li>
            <li>Maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord can be a little finicky at times, but is still better than having to wrap it each time.  </li>
            <li>A little noisier than most though</li>
            <li>$200 hair dryers and have no recollection of them being even remotely better than this little baby.  </li>
            <li>I wish the dryer itself was a little more portable for travel</li>
            <li>I know that the cord retracts into the handle but if the handle were a little narrower, it would make gripping it easier for someone with smallish hands like myself.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize what a competent little hair dryer</li>
            <li>main objection is that it is much too loud and for that reason alone I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li>, just be aware that the cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way, it only retracts to a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works better than the large one I have and is so small</li>
            <li>Lite weight, easy to handle and performs extremely well.  </li>
            <li>can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it about 6 weeks now and so far, so good, but that one little glitch is what prompted me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Not too loud and dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  </li>
            <li>So far it is all that it promised works well, and is very compacted</li>
            <li>When it is closed (folded, for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase)</li>
            <li>Much quieter than the old one we had.  </li>
            <li>The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers.</li>
            <li>My old dryer was much louder.</li>
            <li>She does not use it everyday at home as it is mostly a back-up.  </li>
            <li>A bit of a nuisance that spoils overall satisfaction, but still worth buying.</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy which is better than flimsy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the size of a standard blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I like the way it folds up, but the cord rarely retracts all the way without spending 5 minutes pulling it out and pressing the retract button and pushing it back into the handle.</li>
            <li>Plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok dryer for the gym and not recommended for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Great styling my hair, and it&#x27;s really thick and fairly long.</li>
            <li>The only downside was that it is not all that powerful.  </li>
            <li>I had a perfectly good hair dryer but got tired of coiling/wrapping the cord around the handle or something every time I put it away.</li>
            <li>When it was fairly new the hair dryer switch refused to go the the high position.  </li>
            <li>never going back to normal hair dryer again!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not extremely powerful, which isn&#x27;t great because I have a lot of hair to dry which takes awhile, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Most options that do never seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>The folding handle is more important to me because of the limited storage space in my small bathroom.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s old Andis finally gave up, and I luckily found another one on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and dry hair fast.</li>
            <li>Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less.</li>
            <li>It is light and drys thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the retractable cord of this dryer the most, the dryer itself is very loud and heavy, everytime</li>
            <li>Now I have a new blow dryer that I won&#x27;t be using, normally</li>
            <li>Now I have to stand right next to the outlet because the cord won&#x27;t pull out.</li>
            <li>Andis kindly replaced it anyway, but less than 3 months later, the new one has stopped producing heat.  </li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly, but not near as wuickly as it did at the hotel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Did a quick search online and found it through Amazon, bought it right away and have been using it everyday since.</li>
            <li>It has replaced my at-home hair dryer because it blows as hard, if not harder, than my nice one at home but is much lighter to hold and easier to store.  </li>
            <li>I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  </li>
            <li>Has to be turned up on high for actual hot air.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t like changing to a new hairdryer if that ever happens.</li>
            <li>Now...back to looking for a new dryer.....</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve thrown it away and will buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I returned it and Amazon sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happen every time I used it, so I dealt with it, knowing it was time to go shopping for a new hairdryer already.</li>
            <li>I need to get a new blowdryer....</li>
            <li>My wife needed a new hair dryer, so I did some online review checking.</li>
            <li>We can live with that.  </li>
            <li>They sent out two new hairdryers within days.  </li>
            <li>I needed to buy a new hair dryer for my spare bathroom for guests coming into town over Christmas.</li>
            <li>Bought it for our new camper.</li>
            <li>New one is for guests.</li>
            <li>So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel.</li>
            <li>That should come to about the cost of buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one.</li>
            <li>That said, pumpkin seems content with her new dryer.</li>
            <li>I needed a new blower at that time and found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry just fine, however I never dry on the high speed...</li>
            <li>I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark.  </li>
            <li>the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Does dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky.</li>
            <li>The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I&#x27;m not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  </li>
            <li>My old hair dryer was eight years old - it got very hot, but it still didn&#x27;t dry my hair very well, and I could smell burning hair when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!</li>
            <li>but it sounds like a leaf blower on high, louder even than my old monster.  </li>
            <li>So I went online and ordered one to replace my very loud one at home.</li>
            <li>however it is very loud</li>
            <li>It is loud when it is up on high, but given that it dries my hair faster, its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It blows plenty of air and gets hot enough to dry her hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It fits in my small hand with the cool, blast button in the right place.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as hot as some of the other hairdryers I&#x27;ve used over the years; I mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li>Right away I was disappointed to see it didn&#x27;t have separate settings for temperature (cool, warm, hot) and air flow (low, medium, high).</li>
            <li>Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.</li>
            <li>Takes up much less room in their bathroom than a full size dryer and is much quieter.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair and this dryer works pretty quickly to flatten it out and make it smooth.</li>
            <li>On medium heat the dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough when styling.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s actually pretty big.</li>
            <li>While using it, there came a loud cracking sound as some piece of the internal workings broke and the fragments subsequently rattled around inside noisily wreaking havoc.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first for my daughter &amp; myself in 2007, and the second for her in 2009 to take to college.</li>
            <li>It drys just fine, retracts as it&#x27;s supposed to and takes up less space which is the point, isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li>The second arrived ok but the cord stopped retracting after 4mths and now I am back to having the same type of hairdryers I used to have.  </li>
            <li>Not only is 1875 watts plenty hot</li>
            <li>It overheated the first day (in spite of the proper converter and adapter), so it didn&#x27;t get used again until returning to the states.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it so affordable!</li>
            <li>Lightweight, works well, inexpensive ... and my first one lasted three years with virtually daily use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently.</li>
            <li>I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently.</li>
            <li>More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of Andis before seeing the reviews on Amazon, but this dryer is just in a different league from the &#x27;recognizable&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li>Looked first at a couple local retailers but did not find it.</li>
            <li>I first heard of Andis hair dryers when we stayed at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this I have a feeling this dryer will last.</li>
            <li>Compared to the two other folding handle, retractable cord hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, the Andis RC-2 is more solidly built.</li>
            <li>Not extremely loud either but powerful.</li>
            <li>And like other reviewers have said, it is on the larger side for &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; but that is okay for me.</li>
            <li>I have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers, and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough, but I like the power!</li>
            <li>My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago</li>
            <li>However, after 30 days the coils started burning red hot</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and dry in very short order with this dryer, so I highly recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li>I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold.</li>
            <li>This little dryer is really easy to take on the go.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels smooth and shiny, not weighted down.</li>
            <li>Pretty powerful little machine too.</li>
            <li>Before I bought the second one I purchased a much more expensive one which was actually nowhere as nice as this-</li>
            <li>Use it pretty much every day and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it so far.</li>
            <li>Other than the retracting cord - which is cool - this is a pretty basic dryer.</li>
            <li>so I am now out of luck as far as getting a new one.</li>
            <li>I can almost blow dry and go now, my hair is so calm.  </li>
            <li>I do not notice any better performance due to the ceramic feature and I have noticed less static and frizz with other ceramic models.  </li>
            <li>The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  </li>
            <li>It should be much smaller in size with the same quality &amp; cool shot.</li>
            <li>So since mine is pretty old, I can&#x27;t vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  </li>
            <li>Plugged the Andis back in the next day, the switch was on \\&quot;off\\&quot;, yet the dryer was running at full speed.  </li>
            <li>it folds up for compact storage and possibly travel, though it&#x27;s larger than a true travel-sized dryer.</li>
            <li>This was my first Ionic dryer, and it dried my hair very well and quickly (although I have short hair).  </li>
            <li>The cold shot is nice and cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty large and heavy dryer, so I really like the retractable cord and the folding handle for travel and storage.</li>
            <li>one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel \\&quot;manly\\&quot; in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer</li>
            <li>I tried it in other outlets, waited for it to cool off, etc.</li>
            <li>I use on high which dries my hair just as fast as my regular hair dryer at home and the cold shot works great.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>&quot; it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but since it works so quickly, the weight does not bother me much.</li>
            <li>I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather lug something a little heavy that&#x27;s going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  </li>
            <li>Waited a few days, plugged it in, and it was fine.      </li>
            <li>This is starting to overheat and not dry properly after about 14 months of light (but daily)use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad on the heavy side, but that&#x27;s fine for us.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few weeks, I can say the drier is fine BUT</li>
            <li>We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply.</li>
            <li>There are 2 heat/speed settings on this which means that if you don&#x27;t want high heat you can&#x27;t use high speed and if you don&#x27;t want low speed you can&#x27;t get medium heat.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a separate low, medium, high switch for temperature from the low,medium, high for the fan.  </li>
            <li>Dryer is good but after only having it a short time the retractable cord does not work like it should it only retracts half way.</li>
            <li>it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one, and a big plus is it didn&#x27;t sound loudly as my old one.  </li>
            <li>Just a little big but okay</li>
            <li>Keep the filter at the back vacuumed from time to time and the air volume will stay very high.</li>
            <li>It works great but is heavy and a little big.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that the retractable cord is a little touchy at times - I always make sure to keep it straight when retracting, but the cord still occasionally has issues retracting all the way in.</li>
            <li>I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy enough to quide it gently with the other hand when you press the retract button - keeps it from snaping back.  </li>
            <li>I keep it clear of lint</li>
            <li>It seems to me it should be done before to give the cord a clear path.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was odd that you cannot remove the filter cover and easily clean it</li>
            <li>I also found it to be much louder and much heavier than I&#x27;d expected.  </li>
            <li>But not really portable, or light enough to be a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer to replace an old one that my wife had.  </li>
            <li>I must be the last human being on earth to discover that the ceramic, ionic technology is available on low and moderate-priced hair dryers.</li>
            <li>and it has completely lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>It does leave our hair soft and shiny as my Ion did.  </li>
            <li>It has to be directly on one of the settings or the blowdryer</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the retractable cord much as so many reviewers complained of it breaking.</li>
            <li>I got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t missed the old one for a minute.</li>
            <li>a year later, the blowdryer still works very well.</li>
            <li>One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It make our hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have had no problems with it so far.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer was a replacement gift for another traveling style dryer and so far has lived up to all expectations.  </li>
            <li>But that does not present much of a problem.  </li>
            <li>After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say the retractable cord stopped working after a week, but I&#x27;ve had absolutely no trouble and it&#x27;s been a couple of months.</li>
            <li>On the con side, the hairdryer is bulky and heavier than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Dead after 7 months of light use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>my old 1875w hairdryer&#x27;s cords always getting in the way in the cabinet</li>
            <li>/&gt;People said this dryer was loud, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to getting up in the morning and getting ready now.  </li>
            <li>The cord does not retract completely and has to be pushed in by hand &lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>the loudness doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears like my old ones.</li>
            <li>Seriously, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I am on Amazon looking for a replacement after this device burned out completely...</li>
            <li>it was a $75 plus professional dryer.</li>
            <li>button that&#x27;s a completely separate trigger however, so</li>
            <li>However,  it is starting out very well.  </li>
            <li>Over a month later, and she&#x27;s already told me twice how much</li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction, and we just saw the same hairdryer at a hotel.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s kinda loud.</li>
            <li>Also, it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this a month ago, and used it 5 times before it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>just too loud.  </li>
            <li>I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently</li>
            <li>*DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>Really loud though</li>
            <li>Use this one over my old one all the time now even though I specifically bought it for travel.  </li>
            <li>Only much louder.  </li>
            <li>second unit and really like the quality and service</li>
            <li>We replaced an old one that broke when it was dropped.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>I bought it early December, so</li>
            <li>husband complains that it is too loud.</li>
            <li>This product has the power and feel of a professional hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy and it folds for compactness.  </li>
            <li>Multiple power options, and the highest dries hair fast.</li>
            <li>The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li>Surprised to see the Andis is heavier, bulkier abd</li>
            <li>the cord doesnt retract as completely as the ConAir model.  </li>
            <li>It drys my hair faster than my old dryer did..</li>
            <li>I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  </li>
            <li>I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I&#x27;m bying the same one again.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old hair dryer that&#x27;s retracting feature wasn&#x27;t working after 6 years.  </li>
            <li>were it much lighter weight and smaller.</li>
            <li>Quiet, love the retractable core not real lite, hope that will be a sign it will last.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Ionic 1875, which was on</li>
            <li>I have soft hair after using this dryer everytime</li>
            <li>then it stores completely.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a ittle too loud.  </li>
            <li>Bought one which stopped working (loud grinding noise)</li>
            <li>The cord doesn&#x27;t completely coil up inside of it, there is some hanging out, so that&#x27;s something that might annoy people, if they expect it to coil all the way up to the plug end.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so soft, and it dries your hair in just minutes.</li>
            <li>The dryer is also loud.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I bought this for the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Nice dryer, but auto retractable cord only works a few times before it stops going all the way back into the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it has shut off once or twice on its own.  </li>
            <li>My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don&#x27;t retract.</li>
            <li>Also, as she&#x27;s getting older, I wanted one that wasn&#x27;t super heavy.  </li>
            <li>I Love the retractable cord feature, except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase.  </li>
            <li>Once again, not perfect, but for size it&#x27;s as good as it</li>
            <li>and it was love for my naturally thick, somewhat frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>very fine blond hair and dryers usually leave it electrified, especially in cooler weather.  </li>
            <li>The cool shot, when held down works fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not very small.  </li>
            <li>Great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms!</li>
            <li>It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the strong plastic smell when I first opened the box.</li>
            <li>made the right buying decisions and would like to give back by writting reviews which I hope would benefit the next person.    </li>
            <li>The handle is square, which I thought wasn&#x27;t a big deal when I read the other reviews, but it isn&#x27;t as comfortable as my old one.    </li>
            <li>also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!</li>
            <li>Overall ,heat and power is not any better than several other dryers out there.</li>
            <li>The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  </li>
            <li>Small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>I used this first in a hotel and thought it blew my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li>It also folds in half despite being a full power blow dryer.</li>
            <li>There are some articles that indicate \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryers do not dry hair faster than normal hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but I am confident it will last long enough to fulfill</li>
            <li>I love the speed with which it dries my very long hair to a slight dampness.</li>
            <li>My previous folding dryer was a little smaller, which was nice, but it didn&#x27;t have nearly as much power; I&#x27;ll take the power over the space, thank you.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow as hot as my older dryers, but it dries my hair fast and with less sweating on my part!!  </li>
            <li>I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; option cools down quickly.</li>
            <li>Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again.</li>
            <li>So I normally use the low speed, which is plenty fast for my short hairdo.      </li>
            <li>My hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume.</li>
            <li>It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>, you need to know that this is a &#x27;small&#x27; dryer, and it will be louder and less powerful then a full sized dryer, but it is very useable for its \\&quot;small\\&quot; size.  </li>
            <li>The Andis is powerful and dried my hair quickly on the medium and low settings, but it left me with frizz all over.</li>
            <li>I have very thick  long hair and found this to be a good dryer.</li>
            <li>but I use it on &#x27;high&#x27; and the motor blows the air hard enough that I can dry my hair in only about 5-7 minutes which is good.     </li>
            <li>I was looking for something small enough to fit into my cosmetic bag and it does!</li>
            <li>It has at least as much power as the full size dryer I am replacing.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer (mainly for the gym).</li>
            <li>The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  </li>
            <li>: Before I got this unit, I bought one from Save-On with the exact same spec but a different brand.</li>
            <li>retractable function broke on the older one recently.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one 4 years ago &amp; recently decided to buy another one as a back up.</li>
            <li>To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The retractable cord didn&#x27;t really work so well after the first few months.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I bought as the first blew up in Uk- different voltage.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s older dryer had finally had it and</li>
            <li>From the very first time I used this dryer, the cord wouldn&#x27;t retract all the way-it left about a foot loose.</li>
            <li>Andis deserves high marks for a decent enough product, but definitely rates a &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; for quality control.</li>
            <li>This is a great little dryer - small, fast, keeps frizz down -</li>
            <li>The dryer is not very loud either, it&#x27;s a reasonable noise level.</li>
            <li>I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend the dryer and would have given it 5 stars but for the noise level.</li>
            <li>but if I did I would want there to be different levels (high it</li>
            <li>Instead there was just one setting that consisted of low, medium, and high.</li>
            <li>The fan speed on &#x27;high&#x27; is about what you would get on &#x27;low.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>The dryer does not seem to blow very hot air compared to my previous dryer.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this dryer would live up to it&#x27;s reviews and now the return window is closed.</li>
            <li>This item is a little smaller than my last hair dryer, but the power makes up for any shortness in the top.  </li>
            <li>I only wish it was a little more quiet...</li>
            <li>I usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit</li>
            <li>Usually these don&#x27;t work as well as my own, but this one literally cut my drying time in half, leaving my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>There was no burning smell or popping sound which usually happens when a hair dryer is about to die.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a dryer for traveling that was compact to fit into a small case.</li>
            <li>It was a little noisier and a little heavier than some, but it folded up into a tidy, compact package and</li>
            <li>this one are that the full sized one has two switches, one to set speed and the other to set heat, while this only has the one switch.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and it dried my very thick hair quickly without it being super frizzy.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but it&#x27;s heavy and big.  </li>
            <li>Really quick to dry my long hair.</li>
            <li>At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  </li>
            <li>but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built&#x3D;in converters in their hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li>I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power.</li>
            <li>I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>We sent it back and got a new one from this buyer promptly</li>
            <li>It is only 1 month new.</li>
            <li>My husband has used the same travel hair dryer for 15 years and had a new dryer on his wish list.  </li>
            <li>It dries her hair very fast and doesn&#x27;t melt your hair like other blow dryers can.</li>
            <li>It cut my drying time by more than half compared with my former \\&quot;professional\\&quot; grade more expensive blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>It also worked very well to dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I actually used this in a very upscale hotel on a recent vacation.</li>
            <li>However, mine was a rare anomaly because it overheated and the opening started to contort slightly like it was melting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a more expensive dryer for every day at-home use, but would highly recommend this dryer for traveling!</li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll last as long as the first one.  </li>
            <li>The reasonable price made the decision to buy the same model simple</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than the comparable Sharper Image model, so I find it less useful for travel than that one.</li>
            <li>this dryer at a couple of high end hotels.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to dry hair faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds.</li>
            <li>I have limited space and really like how the cord retracts.</li>
            <li>This is the only blow dryer that does not make my hair frizzy and makes it soooo soft!</li>
            <li>Other hair dryers don&#x27;t seem to put out as much hot air</li>
            <li>But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won&#x27;t do it for you.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
            <li>A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s quite large &amp;  I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough.  </li>
            <li>A slightly narrower handle would be nice for small hands.</li>
            <li>I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  </li>
            <li>The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don&#x27;t have any frizz problems.</li>
            <li>I have VERY thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts.</li>
            <li>I do like the Andis brand, not sure if I would buy this particular one again because of the temp/air flow issue, but it is definitely well made and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Andis customer service is good and they offered to replace it if I send the broken one back at my expense, but shipping will be half the cost of a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>After 11 months, the high and medium settings quit working and only low is still operational.</li>
            <li>I do especially like the THREE settings low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li>it would only work on low speed and not on high.</li>
            <li>I love the size but it was too loud in the high setting and sadly doesn&#x27;t provide enough heat on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>well too.&lt;br /&gt;The tip comes off for a general drying or keep it on for concentrated-area drying and it is included</li>
            <li>The hair dryer works well so far as the drying aspect of it, but the retractable cord only retracts some of the time.  </li>
            <li>It is not quiet but a lot quieter than my old Ion.  </li>
            <li>I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  </li>
            <li>(my old dryer only had about a 2-3 inch slack).  </li>
            <li>I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting.</li>
            <li>I just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one</li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdryer after using the same one in a hotel, and being surprised by the power.  </li>
            <li>I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This dryer is far bigger and heavier than a travel dryer should be.</li>
            <li>I bought this hairdryer earlier this year, when my old hairdryer conked out on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li>Bigger than my old one</li>
            <li>If you pull away when you are drying your hair, it will partly retract, but it just takes getting used to your surroundings and pulling it out far enough to start with.  </li>
            <li>Took a picture of it and a year later, when my old one stopped working, I immediately looked this one up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much heavier than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is.</li>
            <li>My 16yr old daughter asked me to order her another, she loves it over the larger one in the upstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li>One has lasted 5+ years with near daily use.</li>
            <li>I put it in my guest bathroom for now and went back to my old one.</li>
            <li>It barely gets the job done</li>
            <li>And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas for the sole reason to get her OUT of my bathroom and away from using my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Within about another 9 months the second dryer&#x27;s retractable cord would not retract completely.  </li>
            <li>its slightly big, but not heavy that its aches my hand of anything.</li>
            <li>And unfortunately I barely missed the return window.  </li>
            <li>It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is a powerful hair dryer but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>(I figured it would break if I retracted it everyday) and I rarely folded it.  </li>
            <li>This dryer has a retractable cord, which is nice, but not when it fails to retract, which it did.</li>
            <li>Bought for home, still love but wish it was a little less bulky.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited.</li>
            <li>The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down.</li>
            <li>it managed to dry my hair in high humidity.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works extremely well in all aspects, except that its size is quite large to be used as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>(I have dry curly hair and really want a low speed and a medium speed.)  </li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly her hair dried......</li>
            <li>I mean huge.  </li>
            <li>The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past</li>
            <li>Provides just the right amount of heat therefore, no over dried hair or friz.  </li>
            <li>The air temperature is not super hot</li>
            <li>super small</li>
            <li>But I returned it because the retracting mechanism feels and sounds like it won&#x27;t last long, and it just looks a little too cheap.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair so soft and shiny, not dull and brittle like other dryers.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s unrealistic, but I believe a blow dryer should work for more than a few months, especially if the first four months&#x27; worth of use are limited to time on the road.</li>
            <li>Too bad, because aside from that, I liked the settings and it is quieter than most blow dryers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  </li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviewers that it&#x27;s a bit loud and a little cumbersome as a travel dryer (for travel I would recommend the Andis Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the sound and use the smaller dryer for travel myself.  </li>
            <li>A little heavier than I thought it would be but much quieter than my old Conair</li>
            <li>My other dryers lasted much longer than this one.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost of shipping it back to the company since I don&#x27;t know if they will actually send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn&#x27;t gotten a good solid workout like ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and looked in local stores for a compact powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This thing is SO fantastic, seriously.</li>
            <li>I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  </li>
            <li>I used to have such problem with the back/motor part of my old dryer sucking in my hair that got tangled and finally burned out the motor, but this dryer does not suck my hair in!!</li>
            <li>THEN...in the big fat middle of trip to visit friends it burned out completely.</li>
            <li>After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li>it really dries my thick hair fast.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer does not dry out my hair...</li>
            <li>enough / produced boiling lava hot air that damaged my hair unless I held down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room.</li>
            <li>This has a single low, medium, high for temp+fan, with a push button to allow for no heat, just blown air.  </li>
            <li>This new dryer dries my hair in about 1/3 the time it used to take, and it leaves my hair soft and laying down..</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my earlier one because it was heavy, bulky and loud, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much oomph.</li>
            <li>not long after I purchased it for fear that it would get stuck while retracted into the dryer which started to happen.  </li>
            <li>Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  </li>
            <li>This dryer fell short of expectation as the cord barely retracted from the get go.  </li>
            <li>When my existing dryer burned out not long afterward, I went looking for Andis on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nervous because even though this hair dryer dried my hair faster (you should blot before using it though), better and softer than the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; one that I&#x27;d been using, other reviewers have mentioned their ones shutting off and overheating, and I&#x27;m wondering how long mine will last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is a little heavier than the one I replaced; however, it drys quickly, not hot to the touch, and the retractable cord is nice even though it needs a little help retracting at times.  </li>
            <li>This item packs a powerful charge however after just four months of use ( no more than three times a month)</li>
            <li>Thank god my outlet shut off, and thank god the whole thing didn&#x27;t burn my house down.</li>
            <li>I even have to spray my hair while holding it down because it has too much body.  </li>
            <li>The handle folds, but doesn&#x27;t really fold down quite all the way or against the body, so</li>
            <li>Compared to my past dryer that lasted 10 yrs, I&#x27;d say this one was not the best quality, but it&#x27;s also not super expensive, so the buyer will have to weigh the cost vs. the quality...</li>
            <li>I have a small counter space and this dryer doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, but you sure get a lot of quality out of this little machine.    </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s just due to my hair&#x27;s particular quirks and not because the hairdryer is inadequate.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair much faster than my previous ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make as much noise as my previous one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not real sure if I notice much difference with frizz.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair dry in minutes and soft.  </li>
            <li>My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  </li>
            <li>Both are still going strong, although she dropped hers on the tile bathroom floor at school and the cord \\&quot;retract\\&quot; button got broken.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick - it dries it just fine, but it is a frizzy mess when its done no matter how much product I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, if for nothing other than the low price!</li>
            <li>All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  </li>
            <li>The airflow is moderate but not great and the settings are limited to basically high and medium with a cool shot.</li>
            <li>The little air diffuser doesn&#x27;t stay on which really burns me as I have to keep picking up and putting on.....</li>
            <li>It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus.</li>
            <li>But it takes up a little too much room in the luggage.</li>
            <li>My problem was that it only lasted for 2 years, and I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches.</li>
            <li>The dryer didn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my short hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>For once, I ignored other reviewers and hoped that I would be one of the lucky few who got a working retractor.  </li>
            <li>Due to his current hair \\&quot;style\\&quot; (short on the sides, missing on the top),  each use was for less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little \\&quot;fatter\\&quot; than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t write reviews (can&#x27;t seem to find the time), but it took me so long to finally find a hair dryer that I like that</li>

            <li> I liked the dryer itself but</li>

            <li> I really liked it</li>

            <li> In May 2008, I stayed at a nice hotel in Philly that had this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Retractable cord is nice and folding mechanism seems durable.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel.</li>

            <li> while you won&#x27;t have an L-shaped thing in your luggage, you also don&#x27;t have a nice compact bathroom appliance.  </li>
            <li> and she liked not having the cord strewn about.  </li>

            <li> Very happy...and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Wish it had a warm setting...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> retractable cord is also a nice touch</li>

            <li> and I really liked it -</li>
            <li> Nice quality.  </li>
            <li> so it gives a nice grip</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer &amp;  I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> and I liked the airflow.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> All of our friends who use this hair dryer comment about how nice it is.  </li>

            <li> It is a nice dryer</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;d still be available, so my daughter will be happy to know she can get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Best light weight powerful hair dryer i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> You feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and has a great retractable power cord.</li>
            <li> It has good strong power but</li>

            <li> SURE GLAD I DID!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!!</li>
            <li> The quick cool shots of air are great too!  </li>
            <li> And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine.</li>

            <li> Love it, nice size</li>

            <li> I would have liked it better</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever owned a hair dryer I&#x27;ve liked more.</li>
            <li> I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  </li>
            <li> i took it to costa rica with my, easy to travel with, great and quick dryer!</li>

            <li> A perfect little dryer for a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> Good looking and powerful foldable blow dryer!</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s got great power without it being so hot that you have to worry about the heat burning your hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer seemed great at first, but it just stopped working after about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> We first experienced this dryer in a hotel.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> POWERFUL AND NOT EXPENSIVE, IT&#x27;S THE PERFECT SIZE,LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair quickly and I loved the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer for the money - quick drying time</li>
            <li> Nice Airflow; and the retractable cord is easy to manage when I put it away.</li>
            <li> Good price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, the handle opens and folds easily, the retractable cord works well.</li>
            <li> It is kind to my thinning hair (I&#x27;m 65+) and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to store (love the retracing cord and fold up handle), saves space, beautifully designed and has great power, it is inexpensive</li>
            <li> The dryer dries my hair quickly and has a good length cord.  </li>
            <li> i love this new blowdryer, it&#x27;s just as it described and was a very good price.</li>
            <li> The cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect -- not too hot and not too cool.</li>
            <li> My wife who is very particular with hair dryers, (takes her own on trips even though every hotel has them) loved it.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is HUGE!  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is a huge plus!  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> I love that this hairdryer folds up, and cord retracts.  </li>
            <li> I love the folding handle, retractable cord and compact design.</li>
            <li> I love thait</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer in  a hotel and fell in love.</li>
            <li> Seems like they could have made it retract more than that.      </li>
            <li> This hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Lighter weight, better balanced, cord retracts *</li>
            <li> My hair has not looked better from drying with this product.</li>
            <li> &quot; look most days, but</li>
            <li> Since the heater, motor, and handle still work, I&#x27;m keeping it till I can find something better.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord, although it doesn&#x27;t always completly retract each time.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I knew immediately upon opening the package that I would not be able to give it to her.  </li>
            <li> The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually.</li>
            <li> We love it.  </li>
            <li> so most travel dryers won&#x27;t do the trick at all.  </li>
            <li> keep looking. :)</li>
            <li> How many of you have wives and daughters that have to sit there and play with the darn thing to get the cord all the way in?  </li>
            <li> Love the look and feel of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> Have used this hair dryer for more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love it more.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> I discovered it in a hotel and had to make it mine:)</li>
            <li> It turns out, that it works better than the one I keep at home.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-larger than my most travel hair dryers I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I got a conair one instead and it works much better.</li>
            <li> We purchased two of them and love them.</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed it all year.</li>
            <li> just wish the cord feature worked better (which was one of the reasons I purchased this model).</li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord</li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> but the cord needs assistance retracting and could have more power.</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cord and folding feature, it stores neatly at home as well.  </li>
            <li> We love it and again for the price you cannot beat it.  </li>
            <li> Replaced it with a 2175 Watt Conair Blackbird which is weaker and more cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I love the way it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of heat.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will get used to the heaviness the more I use it.  </li>
            <li> but the Andis is so much more</li>
            <li> a great product, reliability, functional, fast drying and&lt;br /&gt;gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; or \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> She likes the Andis better than the one she has at home.</li>
            <li> and I can safely say that it is a bit better because it is quieter.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for several weeks now and am still very happy.  </li>
            <li> OMG I love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> so bought 2 on line and then 2 more wanting to share this with my close friends and sister.  </li>
            <li> But that is somewhat appropriate.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> light weight, effective hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Bought one for home and love it.  </li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to make sure the cord isn&#x27;t touched by water.</li>
            <li> I have had many blow-dryers.</li>
            <li> First of all the price is amazing for what you get!</li>
            <li> the retractable cord gets stuck , but still love it</li>
            <li> which once you have this you won&#x27;t be able to ever buy one without this feature.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have bought one more just to have on hand.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord component works most times, but does need some help and has gotten stuck a couple of times (I&#x27;ve had the hairdryer a month now).  </li>
            <li> For $20, if it lasts a year its better than the competition.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well or better and leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would be more compact, for traveling.</li>
            <li> Does the job better than most.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> If I need to use the retractable cord feature, I manually wind the cord before storing but most of the time, I store without retracting the cord.</li>
            <li> Seems quieter and more flow too ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
            <li> This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a \\&quot;mid-size\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love the retractable plug.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, much better than what I had</li>
            <li> in more, though.</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cord and that the handle folds</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more compact.  </li>
            <li> I like the retractable cord the most and the folding handle.  </li>
            <li> We love this.  </li>
            <li> love everything about it</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> If your hair requires more, perhaps look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I got to try this while staying at a Grand Hyatt, but I wish I had used the Babyliss travel dryer I brought with me.</li>
            <li> The even better part is I now have tons of body.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s quite pleased and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  </li>
            <li> but I fell in love with this one when I was staying in the ritz carlton hotel.</li>
            <li> this dryer is so much better than the two revlons i used before.</li>
            <li> This one is compact and I love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> Get one at the pharmacy for $5 more and you will be better</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  </li>

            <li> One more thing.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> so I could keep it on my counter top.  </li>
            <li> what more do I want?</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase, it is lightweight and travels well.</li>
            <li> I love to retractable cord- folding aspects of this dryer.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MULTIPLES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  </li>
            <li> I love the folding handle &amp; retractable cord.</li>
            <li> It does seem to give me a better drying experience.  </li>
            <li> When I use this dryer,  it makes my hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> And I am glad I purchased the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875 Ceramic Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> The included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this works OK for a while</li>
            <li> Love the 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always glad when I can shop on Amazon for anything it saves me time, gas, and delivery issues.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I saw it and was able to order one for myself.</li>
            <li> Love retractable cord.</li>

            <li> Retractable cord is my favorite feature.</li>

            <li> Pretty good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> good quality, blows plenty  of hot air.</li>

            <li> I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  </li>

            <li> all this is a great little dryer, at a great price.  </li>

            <li> this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is...</li>
            <li> Sure glad it was still available.</li>

            <li> It folds up nicely and works great for my daily use at home.</li>
            <li> I used it myself again for 2 weeks and loved it so much that I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this dryer; it is light, strong, and the retractable cord works much better than the last one I had.</li>
            <li> When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  </li>
            <li> Love this one...handle works, cord retracts just fine /</li>
            <li> and it works fine on the dog.  :)</li>
            <li> The blower itself works fine, but I bought it for the retractable cord, which is more a pain than a gain.</li>
            <li> I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  </li>
            <li> Very good and efficient quiet too.</li>
            <li> But what I like best is the low setting which is fantastic for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It would probably be best to spend a little more to get a better quality dryer than to replace this one a couple time a year.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s compact, powerful and the folding handle/retractable cord are great little features that make it ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers I have found for the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> I also have Carpel Tunnel and appreciate this is a light weight dryer compared to most.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer in hotels before but never have I experienced a dryer that is this loud.</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> Fortunately we travel more by ground</li>
            <li> /&gt;This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great for my young daughter to use.</li>
            <li> It works better than any hair dryer she has ever had but its dirt cheap</li>
            <li> It is light and love the retractible cord.</li>
            <li> Great dryer except that the retractable cord stops completely retracting.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I really wanted this to be a good review.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I came home and searched for it til I found it.  </li>

            <li> Used this hair dryer at a hotel and loved it so much, I bought one for home.</li>
            <li> I tried this blow dryer at a Hyatt hotel and loved it so much I ordered as soon as I finished blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this blow dryer so much, I bought my daughter one for her college dorm, and she loves it too.  </li>
            <li> This Ion hair dryer had NONE of those issues; so when I returned home I looked it up on the internet and was delighted to find it reasonably priced and bought it.  </li>

            <li> i was looking to spend less than 20 $ on it, for the money, it&#x27;s okay, but it is not the best.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer is powerful yet light and we love the retractable cord!</li>
            <li> I had originally used this at a hotel and loved it so much, that when I got home from vacation, I got online and bought it!</li>

            <li> I always press the retract button with one thumb and feed the cord with my other hand to remove any twists and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Way cool!</li>
            <li> Due to our bathroom layout, a dryer with a retractable cors and folding handle works best.  </li>
            <li> really cool!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most user friendly dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day, and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still, but the motor just died.  </li>
            <li> I use the cool button for drying my nail polish!</li>
            <li> This dryer is full size AND retractable/folding!</li>

            <li> Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  </li>

            <li> So compact that it fits easily in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> I want handle to fold, cord retract and put away in a drawer easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used,, my 19 year old daughter likes it so much that I&#x27;m having to order another one today,,</li>

            <li> Bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Powerful, nice grip, light and not too noisy.</li>
            <li> STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  </li>
            <li> Strong and compact</li>
            <li> I have not had chance to use it allot, but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> you can get a ionic ceramic dryer with a high wattage that doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp, makes your hair look good , folds, retracts cord, and doesn&#x27;t cost $200, what is there to think about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a portable hair dryer it is ok, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> The heat is consistent and quick, and the air flow if good.  </li>
            <li> and I love the cool button.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own the first time, and now when I press the button to retract, I have to help the cord go in.  </li>
            <li> We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!</li>
            <li> I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago</li>
            <li> Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> If you want to blow dry your hair quickly, this hair dryer is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed, I wrote down the name of the dryer and searched for it on line.  </li>
            <li> It is hands down the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used in my life</li>
            <li> This is a very good hairdryer -- doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a full size hair dryer made by the same company, and they&#x27;re both very good quality hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> the end was when the folding handle just quit holding in place, thus a good time to get a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 years and the cord still retracts just fine.</li>
            <li> - it dries my hair efficiently and the cord retracts fine.</li>

            <li> Easy to get the hair styled, light weight.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve already had some issues with the retractable cord, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> handle is awesome as well (takes up less space when storing)  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The retractable cord and folding handle work fine.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> My hair feels a lot softer and not burnt, so the lower heat seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li> Still works fine.</li>
            <li> Home use is fine and it&#x27;s compact because of the retractable cord and folding handle.  </li>

            <li> Light weight, easy to use and compact.  </li>
            <li> Excellent First  Introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable</li>
            <li> and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something light and easy to store, hence the foldable handle and retractable cords.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t pack my own dyer as it&#x27;s large and bulky, and had to use the hotel dryer.</li>
            <li> It was the best little hair dryer ever....loved it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect little size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel</li>
            <li> Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush.</li>
            <li> The best, hands down!</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional.</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge improvement in my hair.  </li>
            <li> wanted to replace my huge hairdryer with something&lt;br /&gt;smaller</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I liked it so much when I used at our hotel on vacation in April.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hairdryer that leaves my hair so smooth at the ends.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is cheap</li>
            <li> I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer regularly for 8 months now and it is a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer at a hotel and liked it so much i took a picture of it</li>
            <li> Still happy with the way it dries my hair, but have found the same problem others have with the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li> The retracting cord works smoothly, too.</li>
            <li> More importantly it&#x27;s Powerful ...</li>
            <li> At this price, I&#x27;ll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  </li>
            <li> The hair-dryer has a softer sound to it, so it doesn&#x27;t disturb any one in the house.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability -- an asset for storage and travel.</li>
            <li> CHEAPLY MADE, THE CORD WOULD NOT FULLY RETRACT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUSH IT IN</li>
            <li> I have to say this blow-dryer is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I suppose it all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for in a dryer, but I would say overall, this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li> the retractable cord is a great convenience in my tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer, however the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size and light weight of of this dryer.</li>
            <li> Then one day I&#x27;m using it and it makes that godawful sound again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for it compactness hoping it would be light for carrying to the gym.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and works so well and</li>
            <li> Bought it primarily  for the retractable cord feature.  </li>
            <li> When you held it, you could feel how cheaply made it was.  </li>
            <li> It is a fabulous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Compact &amp; light.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is so smooth and works well.</li>
            <li> Its not to big, and great to take with you on the go.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars based on the fantastic warranty and customer service.</li>
            <li> I have had it now for several years and it is still working great.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I ordered one online.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey CHI and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle.</li>
            <li> cord did not retract smoothly or reliably.  </li>
            <li> Tons of power and comfortable to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much I came home and ordered one.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> Overall - I think this is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I found my hair was silky and smooth</li>
            <li> If you dont have space for a regular one, this is great.</li>
            <li> It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  </li>
            <li> Cant believe I found such a great affordable blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer staying at a JWMarriott and liked it so much I had to find it and purchase for myself.  </li>
            <li> but I returned it because I couldn&#x27;t find a curling diffuser to fit</li>
            <li> Also it folds up so it fit in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Found this gem in a hotel in Savannah and liked it so much I took a photo and found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Completly died after one month of light use.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this powerful hairdryer and the compact design is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> It depends what features are important to you.  </li>
            <li> Ionic  feature makes hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it so much</li>
            <li> The light weight, retractable cord and folding handle is what sold me.</li>
            <li> Over all still like the fact it will fit in my bath drawer regardless.</li>
            <li> was light weight and compact.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There was such a noticeable difference my boyfriend even commented on how great my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I keep this in and nothing else would fit.</li>
            <li> so I need to pack light.</li>
            <li> Also was not as light as I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than not retracting, but there&#x27;s a good 8 inches left after its retracted.  </li>
            <li> Although larger and heavier than most folding dryer&#x27;s,the price was good</li>
            <li> and so far the quality has been good also.</li>
            <li> Yep, its loud, but it works, and it works good.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly without drying it out and the retractable cord and folding handle makes it easy to pack and easy to store.  </li>
            <li> The product is really good, the hair becomes shine and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Conair 1875 Ionic and this and this Andis is far superior to it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Thanks Andis for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military.</li>
            <li> She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  </li>
            <li> well made, blows good a solid hair dryer, would buy again, glad to have found this.</li>
            <li> Good price, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This manufacturer was familiar to me because I groom my dog with their fine clippers.  </li>
            <li> Tried this at a hotel when I was out of town on business - looked it right away, since I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to control air flow switch cool air blast button are a plus.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and compact.</li>
            <li> its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful.</li>
            <li> The force of the air blowing is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful</li>
            <li> It is very powerful.</li>
            <li> The main feature of this dryer that I find most appealing is the power.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, dry fly away hair.  </li>
            <li> Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair fast and the cool feature is nice.</li>
            <li> It has a Medium speed which is rare, and the Cool setting, which I love.</li>
            <li> Made packing super easy.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable.</li>
            <li> We used this hair dryer in the hotel in New Mexico and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> like I had used a serum and best of all, my hair dried so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  </li>
            <li> When it came, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for use at home everyday!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s powerful!</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer in a hotel and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It fits our small bathroom perfectly and create a neat organized drawer with the retractable cord.    </li>
            <li> So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I saved the original packaging and it says there is a 60 month warranty</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it after my first use.  </li>
            <li> have very fine hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t get too hot but dries it quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered it when I got home and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently!</li>
            <li> Well worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> Deducted a star from my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> So far it meets all of her expectations and we&#x27;re very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Works ok, still noisy and gets too hot to touch</li>
            <li> That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not as warm as my normal one</li>
            <li> Originally saw this hair dryer in a Hyatt House hotel...</li>
            <li> Great for travel and does not fry my long hair like the hotel dryers.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair dryer, but ti&#x27;s powerful!  </li>
            <li> Great power yet small and with the retractable cord very easy to store.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is medium size, easy to hold and not awkward feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed by how powerfully and quickly it dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast, isn&#x27;t too loud, my hair looks great all day.</li>
            <li> Despite having a foldable handle and retractable cord, the hair dryer is built very well and doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as many $20 portable hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Only had my dryer for a month but so far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  </li>
            <li> Works well, good power, able to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li> powerful, folds up and the cord retractor is strong.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very nicely using the focused tip; has 2 heat levels plus a cool dry; is light weight; has a retractable cord and folds up.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter&#x27;s college dorm room with limited space.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, which is good for my incredibly thick hair, but it&#x27;s great to have the cooling button on it.  </li>
            <li> I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  </li>
            <li> Very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> The reason &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; can blow circuit breakers.  </li>
            <li> I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it.</li>
            <li> My wife is the one who uses it the most, and she found it to be large and cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special there, but it dries</li>
            <li> The price was right and it is compact which she loves!</li>
            <li> Price was right, too!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get super hot but very powerful!</li>
            <li> I first used this blowdryer at a hotel and liked it so much I looked for it online.</li>
            <li> and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  </li>
            <li> Last week the barrel got bright orange like a flame thrower again</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers, but this one is really a good product.  </li>
            <li> Works great, cord retracts as expected.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and has the feature of retractable cord; however, it doesn&#x27;t always work smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Use the cool shot button at the end of drying so as to set the style.</li>
            <li> (so you will have the wire hanging outside), but its power was really good compared to the price..</li>
            <li> I have a full sized one for home</li>
            <li> and I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the full sized version.</li>
            <li> It was convenient for travel and did a good job, just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I like that it has the cool shot option.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t have the cool temp option</li>
            <li> Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> However, this dryer has 3 settings - Hi, Med, Lo - and a cool button.  </li>
            <li> It also has a cool blast button, but I don&#x27;t use that.</li>
            <li> I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews</li>
            <li> It is also true about the manufacturer&#x27;s return policy.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s almost a full size hair dryer</li>
            <li> and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy.</li>
            <li> I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst</li>
            <li> However I do wish for a slimmer/lighter aluminum frame blower with ultra quite and powerful motor, and a smooth retractable frame mechanism, using variable heat/speed adjustment.</li>
            <li> This is a good dryer, especially for travel use.  </li>
            <li> Waited for it to cool off and threw it away.</li>
            <li> but because it folds, it travels very well with the power you can&#x27;t get from most</li>
            <li> Changing the switch setting did not make a difference, it continued to run at full speed.  </li>
            <li> Fair price including the extra for shipping.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as frizzy and full of flyaways (though it&#x27;s been moist where i&#x27;m at).</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it so much</li>
            <li> Needed to wait to cool off.</li>
            <li> and she simply said she loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full sized dryer that happens to fold and has a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> It has a good solid feel and heft.</li>
            <li> Is good but is not for travell is big</li>
            <li> It works well when it works, however its only good for 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li> I love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology, which I really need for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Besides the weight, it is full size in length as well, which just happens to fold.    </li>
            <li> It is good just too big.</li>
            <li> The dryer works really well, and I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This will be the best $20 you&#x27;ve spent in a long time; plus, I was able to get free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Aim, blow, cool blast</li>
            <li> MY HAIR WAS SO FULL OF BODY AND SHINY--</li>
            <li> We have a home full of blow dryers, every bathroom has one</li>
            <li> Retractable cord and it folds, even though it is full size and full power.</li>
            <li> Nice power &amp; doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair like my old dryer did.</li>
            <li> The heat settings are high-medium-low, plus there&#x27;s a cool button for a shot of cool air when you&#x27;re styling.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer is powerful and leaves hair feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t always retract well, but good enough.  </li>
            <li> I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is perfect for thick hair.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s absolute favorite hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted more speeds as it turns out.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Cool shot&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t come out as cool as I would like.  </li>
            <li> the cool setting works</li>
            <li> I like the 3 speeds plus the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  </li>
            <li> Good hair dryer especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> nice size, color and not heavy weight.</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant and many hotels I stay in have this hair dryer</li>
            <li> It does fold up but it is a full size hair dryer.</li>
            <li> She loved hers, so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, compacts well, retractable cord works but could use a tiny bit of help now and again.</li>
            <li> It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad value at all.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have found it to have good temperature and it leaves hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it more manageable than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair)</li>
            <li> It easily folds up and the cord retracts to a nice short length.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tried it yet during the humid summer months when my hair frizzes out, right now my hair is unbelievably smooth after drying.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this one due to the great reviews and price.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Other than the cord retraction issue, it is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very compact, great for travelling, and the best part is that it actually works despite its small size!</li>
            <li> I gave it a try the other day and was so happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The reasonable price and great performance are the features that me coming back to this brand.</li>
            <li> Quick drying</li>
            <li> Product dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  </li>
            <li> this is a good product, especially for the price - quite powerful, i like the folding handle and retractable cord</li>
            <li> It dries your hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been super lucky with mine.  </li>
            <li> But it drys quick</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can keep the frizzies out, and my hair dries quickly without drying out.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, although slightly bigger than some of the mini blowdryers it stays compact because of the retractably cord and folding handle, and you get all the power of a standard blow dryer and ionic technology</li>
            <li> If the cord doesn&#x27;t go in the first time, pull it all the way out, make sure its not twisted, and try it again.  </li>
            <li> This thing dries my hair super quick.</li>
            <li> Luckily my voltage transformer did not burn out</li>
            <li> Yet, it dries as quickly as any hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord was a selling point for me, and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a super buy at the price .</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and is lightweight and the retractable cord is a plus.  </li>
            <li> Although I do have to admit it&#x27;s definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually.</li>
            <li> We bought this after using one at a high end hotel and are quite pleased.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is light and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the folding handle and retractable cord ( neither of which has caused me any trouble) but what most impresses me is how quickly it dries my hair, even my daughter who has enough hair for 10 people was impressed with it&#x27;s speed of drying her hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t just find products and fall in love like this, but as I was doing my hair</li>
            <li> This is the only ceramic, ionic blow dryer with a retractable cord that I could find on the market and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very hot but has a lot of power which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud, either, which I like, and the ions actually make my hair feel so much smoother afterwards, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is a huge plus, the folding neck is a plus, I really just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that even though I ordered 2 items separately on the same say, they both arrived as promised and in one box.</li>
            <li> loved that it had the ionic ceramic features exactly like my full size Andis hair dryer I use regularly at home.</li>
            <li> The settings are also good - 3 varieties that dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already</li>
            <li> Light weight, and folds easily for storage and has a good &#x27;balance&#x27; for my small hand.</li>
            <li> I really needed a new dryer and I&#x27;m glad I picked this one!</li>
            <li> well, this may not be the most powerful dryer on the market, but i highly recommend it because: &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using my new dryer.</li>
            <li> Because of size and weight, it&#x27;s not well-suited for travel, and the retractable cord does not fully retract, but from reviews I&#x27;ve read, this type of mechanism is problematic more often than not - you just live with the fickle function when you choose a model with both a retractable cord and a folding handle.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, although a tad heavy, but works like a full size dryer.  </li>
            <li> Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer for someone who wants a compact, easy to use hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Retractable cord and folding handle are very convenient and easy to store.  </li>
            <li> Still a pretty good price, but I won&#x27;t buy the same item for fear that it will break again.</li>
            <li> Plus, as promised, this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy.</li>
            <li> My hair also is smoother looking after drying.  Very convenient as it has the retractable cord and folds for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it.</li>
            <li> Easy to store and very affordable.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  </li>
            <li> , the air velocity is higher, the hair dries quicker and better and at the end of the day the hair feels much smoother and silkier than ever</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it is fast, not too hot and saves me time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and drys my hair quickly without &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Also I wish that the cool shot would correspond to low/medium/high, but even though I have the dryer on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; the pressure comes out higher for the cool shot.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> This one was at or very near the top.</li>
            <li> +&#x27;s are that it&#x27;s simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord &amp; has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  </li>
            <li> I like the different settings, and the high setting it very effective.   </li>
            <li> I used the dryer the first time and my hair felt like silk!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  </li>
            <li> I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer and when I plugged it in for the first time, it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom!</li>
            <li> This was my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother - spend a little more and get a much better quality for your money!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much smoother after drying it!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was needing and wanting !</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem.</li>
            <li> Light weight, not too loud and easy on the hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to take with me and dries my hair fast!</li>
            <li> Also great if you’re tight on space.</li>
            <li> The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> It really dries my hair quickly, which helps with the frizz!</li>
            <li> The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!</li>
            <li> I had been using a travel hairdryer and liked that it was compact, yet powerful enough to get the job done quickly.    </li>
            <li> Great little folding hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great little dryer.</li>
            <li> I used one of these at a Marriott once, and thought it was a great little dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Great device for it&#x27;s little size.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, not to loud and cord retracts just fine.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t be available then, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing</li>
            <li> Wow, it is huge ... and not just huge for a &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; ...</li>
            <li> Great size, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It came out straight and smooth</li>
            <li> The handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes, so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes.</li>
            <li> Great for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li> I had no hair product on my hair, just freshly shampooed.  </li>
            <li> It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a dryer, but I liked this one enough after my hotel test-drive that I will be purchasing one immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 2012:</li>
            <li> and I did not use the hair dryer more than 5 or 6 times, it has stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  </li>
            <li> The wind is never too powerful.</li>
            <li> The air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter.  </li>
            <li> It is quite powerful and ionic.  </li>
            <li> Almost good enough to replace my actual blow dryer (which to be fair is about 3 years old).    </li>
            <li> It has lots of power, more than my old full-size one.</li>
            <li> Nice unit when it works, but none of them last over a year.  </li>
            <li> You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t worth me packaging and going to post office etc</li>
            <li> My own hairdryer finally gave out</li>
            <li> Extremely useful to have the retractable cable.</li>
            <li> Its powerful, the cord retracts, and the handle folds...</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size.  </li>
            <li> Used this product at a Courtyard Marriott and was surprised to find it better than my home hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  </li>
            <li> Works well on low setting too, and  folds nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> a hotel, I used this blow dryer and was amazed at how powerful it was.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself is lightweight yet delivers a powerful performance.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was nice enough to replace the dryer at no charge, just after the return policy expired.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s powerful and</li>
            <li> Now, I cannot seem to get it to completely retract - maybe 5 inches at most.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and compact,excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it was an effective hair dryer, but there are several that work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a powerful hair dryer and found this at a resort.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out</li>
            <li> Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful .</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s definitely a quality product -- what&#x27;s nice is that, unlike some of those clunky heavier types, it is still quite lightweight and a  &#x27;breeze&#x27; to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, yet portable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is so powerful.</li>
            <li> well worth it.  </li>
            <li> but it is powerful</li>
            <li> Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability.</li>
            <li> It gets good and hot to dry my hair</li>
            <li> Small size easy storage and does the job fairly well and with</li>
            <li> I usually do not believe negative reviews if there are many, many, many more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hot, but dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> My hair dries super fast and with ZERO frizz!</li>
            <li> very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick!</li>
            <li> retractible cord, folds for packing, dries very well, affordable and salon friendly</li>
            <li> My other dryer has been retired, for good.</li>
            <li> read other reviews also, seems like a good deal but not worth it if it breaks this quickly and easily!!</li>
            <li> The cord retraction has to be \\&quot;helped\\&quot; right at the end, but that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t reading the description quite right when I ordered this dryer, I was hoping it had 2 levels of power plus 3 temps.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    </li>
            <li> was right.  </li>
            <li> Died right after the return period expired.</li>
            <li> I went home, found it on Amazon, and ordered one right away.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li> It broke right away.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and we are very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> I bought a T3 hair dryer over a year ago, and it broke after about 15 uses (it made a funny sound and stopped working without being damaged), so I will never spend that much money on a hair dryer again</li>
            <li> This is great - powerful but small.  </li>
            <li> On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image)</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage.</li>
            <li> The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there.</li>
            <li> Told the BF how much I loved it and he ended up going to the hotel on one of his next trips and they sold him a new one from housekeeping right from the hotel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, retract cord and high powered.</li>
            <li> it gets it&#x27;s thoroughly dry, I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the replacement - the Babylisspro TT for only a little more $ - looks nicer, feels nicer, works nicer, and is lighter.</li>
            <li> a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  </li>
            <li> Great price, sturdy, dries my thick shoulder-length hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that powerful and my girls would most likely kill this pretty quick.</li>
            <li> We like the new unit fine.</li>
            <li> so great that I took it out of the carry on and began using it in place of my usual blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cool setting very often</li>
            <li> I wanted something small and it has been great.</li>
            <li> Great for a small apartment.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice long cord.  </li>
            <li> I use the medium setting and find it more than adequate to dry my hair fairly quickly</li>
            <li> Is is easy to hold and has a blast of air that easily dries long hair.</li>
            <li> It was so good that I wrote down the model</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a former hairdresser, and has long been loyal to Conair dryers, but this one had great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s an exceptional dryer for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for something a little more durable, even if it ends up costing a bit more.</li>
            <li> A good dryer, I must admit I don&#x27;t find anything particularly different about this Ionic dryer as compared to other dryers (e.g., I can&#x27;t say my hair is shinier or more manageable).</li>
            <li> I was looking at other hair dryers, and 10$ more, 20$ more-- didnt seem to be much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Note that the retractable cord didn&#x27;t work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> overall, great dryer at a terrific price!</li>
            <li> my waist length hair super fast,..</li>
            <li> This is a great looking and functioning item that is essential in every home--especially ones with smaller bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> I think this dryer is a great deal for the money, especially with the added features of the retractable cord, folding handle and multiple speed settings.  </li>
            <li> And it literally does not dry for more than 5 minutes because it over heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This being said, this particular dryer&#x27;s cord only retracts &#x27;most&#x27; of the way, leaving a 6&amp;#34; tail and the plug hanging free to dangle and tangle.</li>
            <li> It dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud.</li>
            <li> The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying.</li>
            <li> This dryer is shaped for optimal delivery of air, and the airflow volume feels as powerful at altitude as most similarly priced consumer hair dryers at sea level.</li>
            <li> It has lots of power and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I am beginning to try to find time to go back and voice feedback on the items I use most in my household.</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good dryer I retired my old one</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had spent more time reading them!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and since I am use to hairdryers being a bit loud, this one was not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer very much.  </li>
            <li> Your effort will be very much</li>
            <li> The price for this hairdryer is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and so far she likes it fine.</li>
            <li> It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Still, I believe I got my money&#x27;s worth with this very decent Andis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm enough to dry the hair but minimizes the stress and damage that the heat of most dryers inflicts.  </li>
            <li> the handle does not &#x27;lock&#x27; into the extended position, so it was a little tricky trying to hold the hair dryer in a good position to use it.  </li>
            <li> This blowdryer is everything I was looking for; affordable, compactable (but beware, it&#x27;s not a dinky little thing), durable and of course, good at drying hair.     </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s  a good little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great hair dryer with 3 speeds, which is super hard to find!  </li>
            <li> Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting?</li>
            <li> Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn&#x27;t stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use.</li>
            <li> Good value, strong air flow , and enough heat for a fast dry.</li>
            <li> While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  </li>
            <li> What sucked was that it broke within the first week of owning it.  </li>
            <li> When I went to pull it out of the wall to check my outlet, the adapter was so hot it burned my hand, and the plastic had started to melt.</li>
            <li> Definitely way better than using those hair scorchers attached to hotel bathroom walls,</li>
            <li> has three speeds unlike most dryers that only have two settings.</li>
            <li> I find the medium and low settings to lack the heat, and sometimes want to finish my hair with lower fan speed with more heat.</li>
            <li> First used this hair dryer when staying at a motel &amp; had to have it.  </li>
            <li> Not too much to say; it works well and is powerful.</li>
            <li> My first unit was purchased in April, before traveling to China for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Most hairdryers will last a couple years.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the weight of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> its bigger than I thought but better that what I had.</li>
            <li> I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li> So we took a photo and found the exact model on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t aware that it</li>
            <li> I love my ANDIS Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer, I throw it in my travel bag, it has all the power of a bigger, heavier dryer.    </li>
            <li> This was the first one I have seen with a retractable cord, which is what first attracted me.  </li>
            <li> I had tried this one without the retracting cord at a hotel and liked its more quiet and fast drying on my long hair.</li>
            <li> The air is never too hot.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at Four Seasons Hualalai in Kona.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason.  </li>
            <li> First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  </li>
            <li> I was also interested in trying a ceramic dryer to see if it made a difference in hair health</li>
            <li> The first model I received stopped retracting the cord within a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and the cord still retracts (most of the way, but not quite all the way).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one of those last more than a year.</li>
            <li> THE HANDLE FOLDS &amp; IT DRYS VERY WELL!  </li>
            <li> Bigger than most travel size blow dryers but</li>
            <li> It had the hot, electric smell.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  </li>
            <li> Lastly I think the product could be improved with a more ergonomic handle.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to &amp;#34;mix and match&amp;#34; speeds and heat settings, but that&#x27;s not possible.</li>
            <li> And it was reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Even on the highest setting it&#x27;s not too hot.</li>
            <li> First saw at hotel in San Diego.  </li>
            <li> I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not feeling the ionic part of the dryer, I had a different brand before that worked way better.</li>
            <li> After the first day of using this hair dryer, I knew I had to have it.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> But this is a first.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not retract all the way.  </li>
            <li> On top of that the retraction mechanisim stopped working after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Oh, .. it also dries your hair fast!</li>
            <li> First tried this item at a hotel.</li>
            <li> Generally pleased with the dryer, but cord occasionally does not fully retract.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it in an upscale day spa in Chicago.  </li>
            <li> First the cord retraction mechanism stopped working a year ago.</li>
            <li> Not too loud, dries hair quickly, relatively light weight to hold and like the cord retraction feature.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer work exactly like it was described.</li>
            <li> This is the first Andis hair dryer I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I thought it should come with more separate low heat styling controls.</li>
            <li> She really likes it!</li>
            <li> The volume of air his higher</li>
            <li> I bought my first one in May 2012 and it blew up in Dec 2012.  </li>
            <li> For years I have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country &amp; Caribbean.  </li>
            <li> The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  </li>
            <li> The first arrived with a cord that would not retract.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not so hot that it fries my hair, yet</li>
            <li> Also, after using it for several weeks&lt;br /&gt;the cord retracts better.</li>
            <li> instead of just the hot.  </li>
            <li> I would surely recommend this if you are looking for a daily use Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that an ionic, ceramic hair dryer could make that much difference!  </li>
            <li> I first tried this dryer when in a hotel in SLC Utah, while traveling on business.</li>
            <li> , I WAS READY FOR STICKER SHOCK!)</li>
            <li> AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be smaller, for travel, but it is ok.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord stopped retracting after the first use</li>
            <li> So now I have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord, leaving about 1/3 hanging out.  </li>
            <li> The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair.</li>
            <li> My first purchase broke after just two weeks</li>
            <li> , the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  </li>
            <li> and compact.&lt;br /&gt;just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 7-8 years.  </li>
            <li> I first encountered this hair dryer while using one at a hotel.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Con:  sometimes gets too hot</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my other(identical to this one) because it was damaged during travel (gotta love the airlines)  </li>
            <li> saw this in a hotel first.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I really do love this but gave it 4 starts b/c the &amp;#34;push to retract&amp;#34; button pops out often enough when I pull the cord to plug it</li>
            <li> -the idea is novel!&lt;br /&gt;The hot setting is really hot and</li>
            <li> However when I took it to my Eastern Europe tour, it burned out on the first day &amp; even blew the fuse of my hotel room.</li>
            <li> The only way I was able to shut it off was to pull the power cord.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s ever had:  \\&quot;fast and powerful</li>
            <li> Teen daughters love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted three years</li>
            <li> The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!</li>
            <li> It does not get too hot and ruin your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer that I don&#x27;t have to do this with.</li>
            <li> Be aware: You&#x27;re paying for the label, not the performance.</li>
            <li> Very compact in size, but dries like a champ!</li>
            <li> Had problems with retraceable cord at first, but now it works every time.</li>
            <li> I gave a 4 stars because the dryer is not that hot.</li>
            <li> First tried this at a Hyatt Hotel.</li>
            <li> I replaced the first one under warranty after about 9 months.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered this hair dryer six years ago when I stayed at a hotel in West Palm Beach, FL.  </li>
            <li> First hotel</li>
            <li> Powerful, but gentle.  A+++</li>
            <li> It broke within the first week.  </li>
            <li> Still, a good, but heavy, dryer.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the slide button for the temperature control had more of a lip and/or moved a little more easily, on mine</li>
            <li> For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you&#x27;ll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway).</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I took down the model number and brand name.</li>
            <li> Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels &amp; B&amp;B&#x27;s have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse).</li>
            <li> The thing that annoys me the most is the handle which is square and not super comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of noisy, but does dry hair fast</li>
            <li> Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long, otherwise very nice</li>
            <li> Folds up to just the right size, the retractable cord is convenient, and it works very well without overdrying.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and there&#x27;s no way to change that at high speed</li>
            <li> It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a bit heavy and large but has good power</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much she started using it as her everyday hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is only for 120V and would not be good for international travel.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not quiet but the noise is so much more tolerable compared to some dryers that has whistling noise or just super loud.  </li>
            <li> and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).  </li>
            <li> We had such good hair the entire time!</li>
            <li> Powerful, lots of fan settings, cold air button, and best of all, a retractable cord!</li>
            <li> She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer so much I have an extra one in my guest bathroom!</li>
            <li> Good airflow, a little on the heavy side but great to dry your hair quickly without too much heat!  </li>
            <li> It made my hair less frizzy for sure!</li>
            <li> As she had been in the market for a new one and could not find a suitable one at the big box retailers, I went on to Amazon immediately and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Then right after the return window closed, the retractable cord became more than tricky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  </li>
            <li> This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting.</li>
            <li> I had decided to try it because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i hope your experience is as positive as mine.</li>
            <li> I almost never review items and when I do, they are positive.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> : I wanted to pass along some positive feedback about Andis, the seller.  </li>
            <li> Amazon made ordering and returning a positive customer experience.</li>
            <li> Friends &amp; family that use it also notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li> Worked very well when I first received it.</li>
            <li> Fast drying with lots of shine - I was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5-star hotel I stayed at -</li>
            <li> I notice that it is foldable, drys fast, and not too hot--</li>
            <li> handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  </li>
            <li> We loved it so much that we bought a second one recently when another spare hair dryer we had in the guest room went</li>
            <li> Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died.</li>
            <li> This is a full sized, professional sort of dryer...</li>
            <li> so not sure how good it is yet.</li>
            <li> it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  </li>
            <li> Wrote down the name/model # and immediately came home and ordered one for my own travels.  </li>
            <li> This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn&#x27;t get so hot that I feel like it&#x27;s trying to bake my hair rather than dry it.</li>
            <li> Several reviews mentioned that it broke easily</li>
            <li> It has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it soft and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> When my old Revlon finally bit the dust, I started my online hair dryer research and was amazed to learn that this great hair dryer was available at such a low price.</li>
            <li> I liked the folding feature of the dryer which takes up less space than others.  </li>
            <li> Started making super loud noise and burning smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like my last blow dryer, easy to store with retractable cord.</li>
            <li> They dry works ok for the price.</li>
            <li> This dryer drys quickly and leaves soft and shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy and the button which retracts the cord is effecting except on the last inch or two at times.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong after daily use.  </li>
            <li> We have been using these Andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LIMITED SPACE IN THE BATHROOM AND LOVE THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE STYLES FOR THAT REASON.  </li>
            <li> IT IS RATHER LARGE.</li>
            <li> It had all the requirements I wanted except way too large.  </li>
            <li> I have two large ones already.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my &#x27;home&#x27; hair dryer &amp; that is why I returned it.</li>
            <li> Great dryer 3 speeds slow cool button retractable cord and fold up for travel whats left to say ?</li>
            <li> folds,&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer is a good quality and dries my thick hair pretty fast and gives a&lt;br /&gt;silkier texture.</li>
            <li> Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working one morning when my hair was only halfway dry.  </li>
            <li> 3mo, holding up strong and traveled to UK and back very well.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer at a hotel in Columbus and loved it because my hair dried quickly, was not overheated in the process, and was so smooth I barely needed to use my flat iron at all to style it.</li>
            <li> Fine, now it&#x27;s a regular drier.</li>
            <li> Works fine especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to spend a little more this time and get something of higher quality!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically it is a decent, no frills dryer that does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my short, thick hair and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The opening where the air blows out is so large, that you really need the attachment to get targeted air.  </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavier than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> It is so worth it to spend a little more for ceramic technology.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> The dryer seemed to dry my hair at about the same speed as any other dryer, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed with its ceramic or ionic features, even though I think my hair may have been just a wee bit smoother.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!</li>
            <li> This is the only dryer I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my hair puff out and get huge.</li>
            <li> the ionic technology completely renders my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The cord does not retract very well.</li>
            <li> Expected more drying power.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell that it helps the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them for gifts and the recipients seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> My hair dries in record time and is very silky.</li>
            <li> It is light and on the quiet side.</li>
            <li> I still have to use a flatiron to get a really \\&quot;finished\\</li>
            <li> The motor makes a quiet humming sound, but that&#x27;s it.    </li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast this blow dryer works.  </li>
            <li> I do really like the folding feature and retractable cord.</li>
            <li> They make it so much easier to store in a bathroom vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> much cleaner look in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> However, the fan really puts out the air.</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual was going on; it just died.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I very like it.</li>
            <li> and I wear it straight.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> the noise level is just so high, make you deaf!</li>
            <li> It provides ionic drying which makes you hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works really well.  </li>
            <li> plus it has a couple features that really sold me on it ,  1st</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight!</li>
            <li> I bought another one and now I am more careful.</li>
            <li> I really like that it has 3 \\&quot;speeds.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I really like retractable cords for my hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It makes them so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy and has a powerful airstream.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord.</li>
            <li> but I never seemed to see much benefit from that, either.    </li>
            <li> And it works FAST.</li>
            <li> (I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and</li>
            <li> This thing blows out so much air</li>
            <li> not 100% as powerful as my old hair dryer, but its so compact and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> really well&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Fast drying.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord was really tricky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the size as much as the weight.</li>
            <li> it dries hair fast with lots of shine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a hair dryer - how much does quality really matter?</li>
            <li> thanks....</li>
            <li> brought it overseas and it was too much voltage for europe.  </li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Like it but not too much</li>
            <li> Really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> , you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality you get.  </li>
            <li> The cord retractor started not working very well then quit altogether.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know anything about hair dryers</li>
            <li> but this works a lot better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> VERY CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li> I would say that I got my money&#x27;s worth out of a seven year old product.  </li>
            <li> so we don&#x27;t worry much about suitcase space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  </li>
            <li> I used this product lightly, however the cord retractor broke after the button fell off and now the power switch doesn&#x27;t operate properly</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  </li>
            <li> disappointing because when it worked it worked great!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very compact and the cord is retractable.</li>
            <li> so treat it gently</li>
            <li> Blow drying is so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I am really picky about blow dryers and my hair, so I am not being frivolous here.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause too much frizz.  </li>
            <li> Really like the results</li>
            <li> Very durable</li>
            <li> I only buy ionic hair dryers, as they make your hair really smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried to brush out the lint buildup on the filter but that doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> You gotta expect some noise with that much power.</li>
            <li> It drys your hair fast too.</li>
            <li> If I had not removed the tags from the cord, I would absolutely return it.</li>
            <li> (that incidentally cost 3x as much).  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it has a retractable cord and it folds up...</li>
            <li> The air blows out very forcefully, but doesn&#x27;t seem to feel too &amp;#34;burney.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I buy them 2 at a time because I abuse mine so much.  </li>
            <li> For a compact dryer it really has a lot of power and that is what I need to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> This model is very like the one in the hotel.</li>
            <li> I like the retractable cord and the folding handle; these make storing it much easier.</li>
            <li> Thus, I can stop worrying about too much heat, but still get plenty of air flow.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I returned this hair dryer because, from the very beginning, the cord didn&#x27;t retract.</li>
            <li> but I really do like it.</li>
            <li> It is stronger but nothing that really made me go &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works very well having 3 speeds , even heat and the retractable cord and fold up feature</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the 3 settings for air temperature .</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband who doesn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li> vey well and is very rugged.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> In addition, that handle wasn&#x27;t very ergonomic...</li>
            <li> I will go with another brand that really backs their products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy.</li>
            <li> I thought I may of overpaid for just a hair dryer - but this product works very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but the heat is gentle</li>
            <li> This works very well for a travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord, and folding handle, though, are the real pluses that save the day.</li>
            <li> and it works very well,  </li>
            <li> the vents around the cone distribute the air delivered to the hair so it doesn&#x27;t blow around as much.</li>
            <li> so much I bought one.</li>
            <li> and I really like the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> very compact.</li>
            <li> Very compact.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> I really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> She really wanted one</li>
            <li> Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel.</li>
            <li> but I have very thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep it though, the retractable cord is a nice function, not present on my current dryer.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s kind of bulky and round.  </li>
            <li> ; button occasionally to blow cool air to hair when it get&#x27;s too hot.  </li>
            <li> But compared to many dryers I have tried many do not have the power behind it like this one.</li>
            <li> My last retractable cord dryer had more heat settings than this one, so I do miss the old one.  </li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer for everyday &amp; travel.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> We actually used this in a hotel and loved it so much we wrote down exactly what it was and ordered one for home.</li>
            <li> This leaves the large wall plug and a significant length of cord, about enough to wrap around the body and handle 1.5 times.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and folds into itself...takes up minimal space in your luggage yet, very powerful!  </li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when the new one worked exactly five times...then quit.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City.</li>
            <li> : The low, medium and high work fine.</li>
            <li> Based upon other reviews I expected a really great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> long cord that easily retracts without whipping into things or your face.</li>
            <li> My other gym mates love this and use mine while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to get a new one that quickly.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for travel, and dry my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> And I will conider the a large full sized dryer when I get a larger restroom.    </li>
            <li> Only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but for travel purposes, it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
            <li> the ther is it doesn&#x27;t make her hais as static as other blow dryers..</li>
            <li> only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won&#x27;t retract sometimes, but the dryer is still powerful &amp; works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Due to the folding handle, retractable cord, the fact that it is ionic, as well as all of the raving reviews, I thought I would love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> more moving parts usually equals more likely to break).  </li>
            <li> but it takes significantly longer than the one I left at home.  </li>
            <li> The warranty only covers 12 months from original purchase date</li>
            <li> The cord is also nearly a completely loss, the spring loaded retraction only pulls about half the cord in and you can&#x27;t even forcibly shove more than 3/4 of the cord into it.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd times it did the same , but I was able to dry most of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry</li>
            <li> The high isn&#x27;t very high either.</li>
            <li> There is a real difference from the old style dryers - namely the air coming out is not as hot</li>
            <li> It works so much faster than my older one.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair</li>
            <li> word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is smaller than my old one, and fits easily into the drawer.  </li>
            <li> My wife has an abundant, curly head of hair, and when her dryer took its last breath, I looked for a replacement with both ionic and heat sink (ceramic) qualities to efficiently dry her hair without damaging it.  </li>
            <li> The downside is that I don&#x27;t really see a difference in it drying my hair any more efficiently than the blow dryer I had previous.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair and this hair dryer does a great job of getting my hair dry FAST without making me feel like I&#x27;m scorching my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair</li>
            <li> Dries your hair a lot quicker, hair is super smooth and less frizzy!  </li>
            <li> In December, I decided to buy another one for my carry on---same make and model, figuring the first one died early because of the China experience.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is pretty good for a college dorm; it&#x27;s small, the cord is retractable, and the handle folds to make the item seem smaller when you&#x27;re not using it.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the \\&quot;retractable\\&quot; cord is completely misleading.</li>
            <li> It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> They are only partly true...</li>
            <li> It is actually only 3 air speeds + a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty loud</li>
            <li> The only difference in settings between my full sized one and</li>
            <li> Just know that this is a pretty loud blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment!</li>
            <li> I just bought this one because of the reviews, but its nice, not too small but...</li>
            <li> The cool setting actually works.</li>
            <li> We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it&#x27;s a full size</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad for the price, wish it were quieter.</li>
            <li> For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer.</li>
            <li> there is a cool button that cools your hair down no matter what setting you have it on, and 3rd it has a foldable handle who could ask for more..</li>
            <li> Love that it has a retractablr cord and that it folds down.  </li>
            <li> This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part of this dryer is the design for compact storage - not only does the handle fold in, but the cord retracts - especiallly nice if you are constantly stuffing your dryer in a small drawer.</li>
            <li> It has 3 heat settings (low, medium, and high) and a cool setting.</li>
            <li> Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    </li>
            <li> This fabulous little dryer is also a great size for travel, or simply taking up less space in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Ditch the fancy dryers and go for this one.</li>
            <li> More powerful than some of the other larger hair dryers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to travel dryer as it dries my hair so much faster than my non-travel dryer.</li>
            <li> It worked fine maybe the first half dozen times</li>
            <li> but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point</li>
            <li> I decided to try the ionic/ceramic technology to see if it would work better and be less damaging.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord and that the dryer folds in half.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair with more air and less heat.</li>
            <li> but the cord doesn&#x27;t retract much more than half way.  </li>
            <li> The retracting cord on the Andis works much better than my previous dryer and does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; when retracting.  </li>
            <li> And for the money is a decent buy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s retractable wire is another plus.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer mainly because of the 3 heat settings.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than dryers that are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should.</li>
            <li> A decent dryer for the price (maybe).</li>
            <li> I sent it back for a refund which Amazon quickly honored.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit heavy and kind of loud.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I was using it when suddenly the barrel got bright orange like it was on fire.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I always have a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; hair dryer, so I dusted that off &amp; used it.  </li>
            <li> First, the cord is pretty short.</li>
            <li> I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and</li>
            <li> Particularly, she loves the cord retract.  </li>
            <li> but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend&#x27;s house since it works so well.</li>
            <li> This replace an earlier model that has stood up well over many years, but finally quit.</li>
            <li> but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this particular dryer again.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought</li>
            <li> Although I do love this dryer they seem to last only one year or so.</li>
            <li> a nice change from my old one which dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Works better than my more expensive dryers.</li>
            <li> seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused.  </li>
            <li> It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc.</li>
            <li> When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very loud!  </li>
            <li> Works great for its intended use, especially for how small it is!</li>
            <li> Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  </li>
            <li> However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I use high.  </li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s on high heat though, so don&#x27;t let that deter you if you don&#x27;t like that.)  </li>
            <li> We highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for curly-hair individuals.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Tried this hair dryer in a high class hotel.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market, I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price, I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It was a high end hotel that we stayed in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had high end</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for the Andis</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> 3 speeds with 1 temp each (you can&#x27;t go medium heat, high speed, for example -</li>
            <li> , it truly was FABULOUS!!!!i would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;ve had it for 10 months the switch is stuck on high and won&#x27;t budge</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars (instead of two) because it does work well even if it is stuck on high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review.</li>
            <li> Way too loud and large for travel.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord can be a little finicky at times, but is still better than having to wrap it each time.  </li>
            <li> A little noisier than most though</li>
            <li> $200 hair dryers and have no recollection of them being even remotely better than this little baby.  </li>
            <li> I wish the dryer itself was a little more portable for travel</li>
            <li> I know that the cord retracts into the handle but if the handle were a little narrower, it would make gripping it easier for someone with smallish hands like myself.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what a competent little hair dryer</li>
            <li> main objection is that it is much too loud and for that reason alone I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> , just be aware that the cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way, it only retracts to a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works better than the large one I have and is so small</li>
            <li> Lite weight, easy to handle and performs extremely well.  </li>
            <li> can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it about 6 weeks now and so far, so good, but that one little glitch is what prompted me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not too loud and dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  </li>
            <li> So far it is all that it promised works well, and is very compacted</li>
            <li> When it is closed (folded, for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase)</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the old one we had.  </li>
            <li> The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers.</li>
            <li> My old dryer was much louder.</li>
            <li> She does not use it everyday at home as it is mostly a back-up.  </li>
            <li> A bit of a nuisance that spoils overall satisfaction, but still worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy which is better than flimsy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the size of a standard blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I like the way it folds up, but the cord rarely retracts all the way without spending 5 minutes pulling it out and pressing the retract button and pushing it back into the handle.</li>
            <li> Plenty powerful enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok dryer for the gym and not recommended for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great styling my hair, and it&#x27;s really thick and fairly long.</li>
            <li> The only downside was that it is not all that powerful.  </li>
            <li> I had a perfectly good hair dryer but got tired of coiling/wrapping the cord around the handle or something every time I put it away.</li>
            <li> When it was fairly new the hair dryer switch refused to go the the high position.  </li>
            <li> never going back to normal hair dryer again!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not extremely powerful, which isn&#x27;t great because I have a lot of hair to dry which takes awhile, but it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Most options that do never seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> The folding handle is more important to me because of the limited storage space in my small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s old Andis finally gave up, and I luckily found another one on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and dry hair fast.</li>
            <li> Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less.</li>
            <li> It is light and drys thick hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the retractable cord of this dryer the most, the dryer itself is very loud and heavy, everytime</li>
            <li> Now I have a new blow dryer that I won&#x27;t be using, normally</li>
            <li> Now I have to stand right next to the outlet because the cord won&#x27;t pull out.</li>
            <li> Andis kindly replaced it anyway, but less than 3 months later, the new one has stopped producing heat.  </li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly, but not near as wuickly as it did at the hotel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Did a quick search online and found it through Amazon, bought it right away and have been using it everyday since.</li>
            <li> It has replaced my at-home hair dryer because it blows as hard, if not harder, than my nice one at home but is much lighter to hold and easier to store.  </li>
            <li> I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes</li>
            <li> Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  </li>
            <li> Has to be turned up on high for actual hot air.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t like changing to a new hairdryer if that ever happens.</li>
            <li> Now...back to looking for a new dryer.....</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve thrown it away and will buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I returned it and Amazon sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t happen every time I used it, so I dealt with it, knowing it was time to go shopping for a new hairdryer already.</li>
            <li> I need to get a new blowdryer....</li>
            <li> My wife needed a new hair dryer, so I did some online review checking.</li>
            <li> We can live with that.  </li>
            <li> They sent out two new hairdryers within days.  </li>
            <li> I needed to buy a new hair dryer for my spare bathroom for guests coming into town over Christmas.</li>
            <li> Bought it for our new camper.</li>
            <li> New one is for guests.</li>
            <li> So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel.</li>
            <li> That should come to about the cost of buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one.</li>
            <li> That said, pumpkin seems content with her new dryer.</li>
            <li> I needed a new blower at that time and found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry just fine, however I never dry on the high speed...</li>
            <li> I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark.  </li>
            <li> the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Does dry hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky.</li>
            <li> The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I&#x27;m not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  </li>
            <li> My old hair dryer was eight years old - it got very hot, but it still didn&#x27;t dry my hair very well, and I could smell burning hair when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!</li>
            <li> but it sounds like a leaf blower on high, louder even than my old monster.  </li>
            <li> So I went online and ordered one to replace my very loud one at home.</li>
            <li> however it is very loud</li>
            <li> It is loud when it is up on high, but given that it dries my hair faster, its not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It blows plenty of air and gets hot enough to dry her hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It fits in my small hand with the cool, blast button in the right place.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as hot as some of the other hairdryers I&#x27;ve used over the years; I mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li> Right away I was disappointed to see it didn&#x27;t have separate settings for temperature (cool, warm, hot) and air flow (low, medium, high).</li>
            <li> Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.</li>
            <li> Takes up much less room in their bathroom than a full size dryer and is much quieter.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and this dryer works pretty quickly to flatten it out and make it smooth.</li>
            <li> On medium heat the dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough when styling.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually pretty big.</li>
            <li> While using it, there came a loud cracking sound as some piece of the internal workings broke and the fragments subsequently rattled around inside noisily wreaking havoc.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first for my daughter &amp; myself in 2007, and the second for her in 2009 to take to college.</li>
            <li> It drys just fine, retracts as it&#x27;s supposed to and takes up less space which is the point, isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li> The second arrived ok but the cord stopped retracting after 4mths and now I am back to having the same type of hairdryers I used to have.  </li>
            <li> Not only is 1875 watts plenty hot</li>
            <li> It overheated the first day (in spite of the proper converter and adapter), so it didn&#x27;t get used again until returning to the states.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find it so affordable!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, works well, inexpensive ... and my first one lasted three years with virtually daily use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently.</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently.</li>
            <li> More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of Andis before seeing the reviews on Amazon, but this dryer is just in a different league from the &#x27;recognizable&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li> Looked first at a couple local retailers but did not find it.</li>
            <li> I first heard of Andis hair dryers when we stayed at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this I have a feeling this dryer will last.</li>
            <li> Compared to the two other folding handle, retractable cord hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, the Andis RC-2 is more solidly built.</li>
            <li> Not extremely loud either but powerful.</li>
            <li> And like other reviewers have said, it is on the larger side for &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; but that is okay for me.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers, and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough, but I like the power!</li>
            <li> My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago</li>
            <li> However, after 30 days the coils started burning red hot</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and dry in very short order with this dryer, so I highly recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is really easy to take on the go.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels smooth and shiny, not weighted down.</li>
            <li> Pretty powerful little machine too.</li>
            <li> Before I bought the second one I purchased a much more expensive one which was actually nowhere as nice as this-</li>
            <li> Use it pretty much every day and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it so far.</li>
            <li> Other than the retracting cord - which is cool - this is a pretty basic dryer.</li>
            <li> so I am now out of luck as far as getting a new one.</li>
            <li> I can almost blow dry and go now, my hair is so calm.  </li>
            <li> I do not notice any better performance due to the ceramic feature and I have noticed less static and frizz with other ceramic models.  </li>
            <li> The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  </li>
            <li> It should be much smaller in size with the same quality &amp; cool shot.</li>
            <li> So since mine is pretty old, I can&#x27;t vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  </li>
            <li> Plugged the Andis back in the next day, the switch was on \\&quot;off\\&quot;, yet the dryer was running at full speed.  </li>
            <li> it folds up for compact storage and possibly travel, though it&#x27;s larger than a true travel-sized dryer.</li>
            <li> This was my first Ionic dryer, and it dried my hair very well and quickly (although I have short hair).  </li>
            <li> The cold shot is nice and cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty large and heavy dryer, so I really like the retractable cord and the folding handle for travel and storage.</li>
            <li> one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel \\&quot;manly\\&quot; in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer</li>
            <li> I tried it in other outlets, waited for it to cool off, etc.</li>
            <li> I use on high which dries my hair just as fast as my regular hair dryer at home and the cold shot works great.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> &quot; it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but since it works so quickly, the weight does not bother me much.</li>
            <li> I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather lug something a little heavy that&#x27;s going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  </li>
            <li> Waited a few days, plugged it in, and it was fine.      </li>
            <li> This is starting to overheat and not dry properly after about 14 months of light (but daily)use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad on the heavy side, but that&#x27;s fine for us.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, I can say the drier is fine BUT</li>
            <li> We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply.</li>
            <li> There are 2 heat/speed settings on this which means that if you don&#x27;t want high heat you can&#x27;t use high speed and if you don&#x27;t want low speed you can&#x27;t get medium heat.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer a separate low, medium, high switch for temperature from the low,medium, high for the fan.  </li>
            <li> Dryer is good but after only having it a short time the retractable cord does not work like it should it only retracts half way.</li>
            <li> it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one, and a big plus is it didn&#x27;t sound loudly as my old one.  </li>
            <li> Just a little big but okay</li>
            <li> Keep the filter at the back vacuumed from time to time and the air volume will stay very high.</li>
            <li> It works great but is heavy and a little big.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that the retractable cord is a little touchy at times - I always make sure to keep it straight when retracting, but the cord still occasionally has issues retracting all the way in.</li>
            <li> I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy enough to quide it gently with the other hand when you press the retract button - keeps it from snaping back.  </li>
            <li> I keep it clear of lint</li>
            <li> It seems to me it should be done before to give the cord a clear path.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that you cannot remove the filter cover and easily clean it</li>
            <li> I also found it to be much louder and much heavier than I&#x27;d expected.  </li>
            <li> But not really portable, or light enough to be a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace an old one that my wife had.  </li>
            <li> I must be the last human being on earth to discover that the ceramic, ionic technology is available on low and moderate-priced hair dryers.</li>
            <li> and it has completely lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> It does leave our hair soft and shiny as my Ion did.  </li>
            <li> It has to be directly on one of the settings or the blowdryer</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the retractable cord much as so many reviewers complained of it breaking.</li>
            <li> I got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t missed the old one for a minute.</li>
            <li> a year later, the blowdryer still works very well.</li>
            <li> One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It make our hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with it so far.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer was a replacement gift for another traveling style dryer and so far has lived up to all expectations.  </li>
            <li> But that does not present much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say the retractable cord stopped working after a week, but I&#x27;ve had absolutely no trouble and it&#x27;s been a couple of months.</li>
            <li> On the con side, the hairdryer is bulky and heavier than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Dead after 7 months of light use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> my old 1875w hairdryer&#x27;s cords always getting in the way in the cabinet</li>
            <li> /&gt;People said this dryer was loud, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to getting up in the morning and getting ready now.  </li>
            <li> The cord does not retract completely and has to be pushed in by hand &lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> the loudness doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears like my old ones.</li>
            <li> Seriously, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am on Amazon looking for a replacement after this device burned out completely...</li>
            <li> it was a $75 plus professional dryer.</li>
            <li> button that&#x27;s a completely separate trigger however, so</li>
            <li> However,  it is starting out very well.  </li>
            <li> Over a month later, and she&#x27;s already told me twice how much</li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction, and we just saw the same hairdryer at a hotel.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s kinda loud.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago, and used it 5 times before it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> just too loud.  </li>
            <li> I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently</li>
            <li> *DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Really loud though</li>
            <li> Use this one over my old one all the time now even though I specifically bought it for travel.  </li>
            <li> Only much louder.  </li>
            <li> second unit and really like the quality and service</li>
            <li> We replaced an old one that broke when it was dropped.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I bought it early December, so</li>
            <li> husband complains that it is too loud.</li>
            <li> This product has the power and feel of a professional hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy and it folds for compactness.  </li>
            <li> Multiple power options, and the highest dries hair fast.</li>
            <li> The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li> Surprised to see the Andis is heavier, bulkier abd</li>
            <li> the cord doesnt retract as completely as the ConAir model.  </li>
            <li> It drys my hair faster than my old dryer did..</li>
            <li> I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  </li>
            <li> I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I&#x27;m bying the same one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old hair dryer that&#x27;s retracting feature wasn&#x27;t working after 6 years.  </li>
            <li> were it much lighter weight and smaller.</li>
            <li> Quiet, love the retractable core not real lite, hope that will be a sign it will last.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Ionic 1875, which was on</li>
            <li> I have soft hair after using this dryer everytime</li>
            <li> then it stores completely.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a ittle too loud.  </li>
            <li> Bought one which stopped working (loud grinding noise)</li>
            <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t completely coil up inside of it, there is some hanging out, so that&#x27;s something that might annoy people, if they expect it to coil all the way up to the plug end.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft, and it dries your hair in just minutes.</li>
            <li> The dryer is also loud.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I bought this for the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> Nice dryer, but auto retractable cord only works a few times before it stops going all the way back into the handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it has shut off once or twice on its own.  </li>
            <li> My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don&#x27;t retract.</li>
            <li> Also, as she&#x27;s getting older, I wanted one that wasn&#x27;t super heavy.  </li>
            <li> I Love the retractable cord feature, except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase.  </li>
            <li> Once again, not perfect, but for size it&#x27;s as good as it</li>
            <li> and it was love for my naturally thick, somewhat frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> very fine blond hair and dryers usually leave it electrified, especially in cooler weather.  </li>
            <li> The cool shot, when held down works fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not very small.  </li>
            <li> Great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms!</li>
            <li> It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the strong plastic smell when I first opened the box.</li>
            <li> made the right buying decisions and would like to give back by writting reviews which I hope would benefit the next person.    </li>
            <li> The handle is square, which I thought wasn&#x27;t a big deal when I read the other reviews, but it isn&#x27;t as comfortable as my old one.    </li>
            <li> also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!</li>
            <li> Overall ,heat and power is not any better than several other dryers out there.</li>
            <li> The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  </li>
            <li> Small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> I used this first in a hotel and thought it blew my hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> It also folds in half despite being a full power blow dryer.</li>
            <li> There are some articles that indicate \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryers do not dry hair faster than normal hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but I am confident it will last long enough to fulfill</li>
            <li> I love the speed with which it dries my very long hair to a slight dampness.</li>
            <li> My previous folding dryer was a little smaller, which was nice, but it didn&#x27;t have nearly as much power; I&#x27;ll take the power over the space, thank you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow as hot as my older dryers, but it dries my hair fast and with less sweating on my part!!  </li>
            <li> I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; option cools down quickly.</li>
            <li> Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again.</li>
            <li> So I normally use the low speed, which is plenty fast for my short hairdo.      </li>
            <li> My hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume.</li>
            <li> It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> , you need to know that this is a &#x27;small&#x27; dryer, and it will be louder and less powerful then a full sized dryer, but it is very useable for its \\&quot;small\\&quot; size.  </li>
            <li> The Andis is powerful and dried my hair quickly on the medium and low settings, but it left me with frizz all over.</li>
            <li> I have very thick  long hair and found this to be a good dryer.</li>
            <li> but I use it on &#x27;high&#x27; and the motor blows the air hard enough that I can dry my hair in only about 5-7 minutes which is good.     </li>
            <li> I was looking for something small enough to fit into my cosmetic bag and it does!</li>
            <li> It has at least as much power as the full size dryer I am replacing.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer (mainly for the gym).</li>
            <li> The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  </li>
            <li> : Before I got this unit, I bought one from Save-On with the exact same spec but a different brand.</li>
            <li> retractable function broke on the older one recently.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first one 4 years ago &amp; recently decided to buy another one as a back up.</li>
            <li> To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The retractable cord didn&#x27;t really work so well after the first few months.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought as the first blew up in Uk- different voltage.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s older dryer had finally had it and</li>
            <li> From the very first time I used this dryer, the cord wouldn&#x27;t retract all the way-it left about a foot loose.</li>
            <li> Andis deserves high marks for a decent enough product, but definitely rates a &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; for quality control.</li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer - small, fast, keeps frizz down -</li>
            <li> The dryer is not very loud either, it&#x27;s a reasonable noise level.</li>
            <li> I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend the dryer and would have given it 5 stars but for the noise level.</li>
            <li> but if I did I would want there to be different levels (high it</li>
            <li> Instead there was just one setting that consisted of low, medium, and high.</li>
            <li> The fan speed on &#x27;high&#x27; is about what you would get on &#x27;low.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> The dryer does not seem to blow very hot air compared to my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this dryer would live up to it&#x27;s reviews and now the return window is closed.</li>
            <li> This item is a little smaller than my last hair dryer, but the power makes up for any shortness in the top.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it was a little more quiet...</li>
            <li> I usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit</li>
            <li> Usually these don&#x27;t work as well as my own, but this one literally cut my drying time in half, leaving my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> There was no burning smell or popping sound which usually happens when a hair dryer is about to die.  </li>
            <li> and I needed a dryer for traveling that was compact to fit into a small case.</li>
            <li> It was a little noisier and a little heavier than some, but it folded up into a tidy, compact package and</li>
            <li> this one are that the full sized one has two switches, one to set speed and the other to set heat, while this only has the one switch.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and it dried my very thick hair quickly without it being super frizzy.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but it&#x27;s heavy and big.  </li>
            <li> Really quick to dry my long hair.</li>
            <li> At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  </li>
            <li> but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built&#x3D;in converters in their hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li> I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power.</li>
            <li> I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> We sent it back and got a new one from this buyer promptly</li>
            <li> It is only 1 month new.</li>
            <li> My husband has used the same travel hair dryer for 15 years and had a new dryer on his wish list.  </li>
            <li> It dries her hair very fast and doesn&#x27;t melt your hair like other blow dryers can.</li>
            <li> It cut my drying time by more than half compared with my former \\&quot;professional\\&quot; grade more expensive blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> It also worked very well to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I actually used this in a very upscale hotel on a recent vacation.</li>
            <li> However, mine was a rare anomaly because it overheated and the opening started to contort slightly like it was melting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a more expensive dryer for every day at-home use, but would highly recommend this dryer for traveling!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll last as long as the first one.  </li>
            <li> The reasonable price made the decision to buy the same model simple</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier than the comparable Sharper Image model, so I find it less useful for travel than that one.</li>
            <li> this dryer at a couple of high end hotels.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to dry hair faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds.</li>
            <li> I have limited space and really like how the cord retracts.</li>
            <li> This is the only blow dryer that does not make my hair frizzy and makes it soooo soft!</li>
            <li> Other hair dryers don&#x27;t seem to put out as much hot air</li>
            <li> But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won&#x27;t do it for you.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
            <li> A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s quite large &amp;  I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> A slightly narrower handle would be nice for small hands.</li>
            <li> I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  </li>
            <li> The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don&#x27;t have any frizz problems.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts.</li>
            <li> I do like the Andis brand, not sure if I would buy this particular one again because of the temp/air flow issue, but it is definitely well made and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Andis customer service is good and they offered to replace it if I send the broken one back at my expense, but shipping will be half the cost of a new dryer.  </li>
            <li> After 11 months, the high and medium settings quit working and only low is still operational.</li>
            <li> I do especially like the THREE settings low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li> it would only work on low speed and not on high.</li>
            <li> I love the size but it was too loud in the high setting and sadly doesn&#x27;t provide enough heat on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> well too.&lt;br /&gt;The tip comes off for a general drying or keep it on for concentrated-area drying and it is included</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works well so far as the drying aspect of it, but the retractable cord only retracts some of the time.  </li>
            <li> It is not quiet but a lot quieter than my old Ion.  </li>
            <li> I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  </li>
            <li> (my old dryer only had about a 2-3 inch slack).  </li>
            <li> I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting.</li>
            <li> I just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer after using the same one in a hotel, and being surprised by the power.  </li>
            <li> I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This dryer is far bigger and heavier than a travel dryer should be.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer earlier this year, when my old hairdryer conked out on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Bigger than my old one</li>
            <li> If you pull away when you are drying your hair, it will partly retract, but it just takes getting used to your surroundings and pulling it out far enough to start with.  </li>
            <li> Took a picture of it and a year later, when my old one stopped working, I immediately looked this one up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much heavier than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is.</li>
            <li> My 16yr old daughter asked me to order her another, she loves it over the larger one in the upstairs bathroom.</li>
            <li> One has lasted 5+ years with near daily use.</li>
            <li> I put it in my guest bathroom for now and went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> It barely gets the job done</li>
            <li> And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas for the sole reason to get her OUT of my bathroom and away from using my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Within about another 9 months the second dryer&#x27;s retractable cord would not retract completely.  </li>
            <li> its slightly big, but not heavy that its aches my hand of anything.</li>
            <li> And unfortunately I barely missed the return window.  </li>
            <li> It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is a powerful hair dryer but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> (I figured it would break if I retracted it everyday) and I rarely folded it.  </li>
            <li> This dryer has a retractable cord, which is nice, but not when it fails to retract, which it did.</li>
            <li> Bought for home, still love but wish it was a little less bulky.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited.</li>
            <li> The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down.</li>
            <li> it managed to dry my hair in high humidity.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works extremely well in all aspects, except that its size is quite large to be used as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> (I have dry curly hair and really want a low speed and a medium speed.)  </li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly her hair dried......</li>
            <li> I mean huge.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past</li>
            <li> Provides just the right amount of heat therefore, no over dried hair or friz.  </li>
            <li> The air temperature is not super hot</li>
            <li> super small</li>
            <li> But I returned it because the retracting mechanism feels and sounds like it won&#x27;t last long, and it just looks a little too cheap.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair so soft and shiny, not dull and brittle like other dryers.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s unrealistic, but I believe a blow dryer should work for more than a few months, especially if the first four months&#x27; worth of use are limited to time on the road.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because aside from that, I liked the settings and it is quieter than most blow dryers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  </li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that it&#x27;s a bit loud and a little cumbersome as a travel dryer (for travel I would recommend the Andis Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the sound and use the smaller dryer for travel myself.  </li>
            <li> A little heavier than I thought it would be but much quieter than my old Conair</li>
            <li> My other dryers lasted much longer than this one.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost of shipping it back to the company since I don&#x27;t know if they will actually send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn&#x27;t gotten a good solid workout like ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and looked in local stores for a compact powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This thing is SO fantastic, seriously.</li>
            <li> I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  </li>
            <li> I used to have such problem with the back/motor part of my old dryer sucking in my hair that got tangled and finally burned out the motor, but this dryer does not suck my hair in!!</li>
            <li> THEN...in the big fat middle of trip to visit friends it burned out completely.</li>
            <li> After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  </li>
            <li> it really dries my thick hair fast.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer does not dry out my hair...</li>
            <li> enough / produced boiling lava hot air that damaged my hair unless I held down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room.</li>
            <li> This has a single low, medium, high for temp+fan, with a push button to allow for no heat, just blown air.  </li>
            <li> This new dryer dries my hair in about 1/3 the time it used to take, and it leaves my hair soft and laying down..</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my earlier one because it was heavy, bulky and loud, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much oomph.</li>
            <li> not long after I purchased it for fear that it would get stuck while retracted into the dryer which started to happen.  </li>
            <li> Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  </li>
            <li> This dryer fell short of expectation as the cord barely retracted from the get go.  </li>
            <li> When my existing dryer burned out not long afterward, I went looking for Andis on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nervous because even though this hair dryer dried my hair faster (you should blot before using it though), better and softer than the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; one that I&#x27;d been using, other reviewers have mentioned their ones shutting off and overheating, and I&#x27;m wondering how long mine will last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a little heavier than the one I replaced; however, it drys quickly, not hot to the touch, and the retractable cord is nice even though it needs a little help retracting at times.  </li>
            <li> This item packs a powerful charge however after just four months of use ( no more than three times a month)</li>
            <li> Thank god my outlet shut off, and thank god the whole thing didn&#x27;t burn my house down.</li>
            <li> I even have to spray my hair while holding it down because it has too much body.  </li>
            <li> The handle folds, but doesn&#x27;t really fold down quite all the way or against the body, so</li>
            <li> Compared to my past dryer that lasted 10 yrs, I&#x27;d say this one was not the best quality, but it&#x27;s also not super expensive, so the buyer will have to weigh the cost vs. the quality...</li>
            <li> I have a small counter space and this dryer doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, but you sure get a lot of quality out of this little machine.    </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s just due to my hair&#x27;s particular quirks and not because the hairdryer is inadequate.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair much faster than my previous ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make as much noise as my previous one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real sure if I notice much difference with frizz.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dry in minutes and soft.  </li>
            <li> My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  </li>
            <li> Both are still going strong, although she dropped hers on the tile bathroom floor at school and the cord \\&quot;retract\\&quot; button got broken.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick - it dries it just fine, but it is a frizzy mess when its done no matter how much product I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, if for nothing other than the low price!</li>
            <li> All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  </li>
            <li> The airflow is moderate but not great and the settings are limited to basically high and medium with a cool shot.</li>
            <li> The little air diffuser doesn&#x27;t stay on which really burns me as I have to keep picking up and putting on.....</li>
            <li> It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus.</li>
            <li> But it takes up a little too much room in the luggage.</li>
            <li> My problem was that it only lasted for 2 years, and I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches.</li>
            <li> The dryer didn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my short hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> For once, I ignored other reviewers and hoped that I would be one of the lucky few who got a working retractor.  </li>
            <li> Due to his current hair \\&quot;style\\&quot; (short on the sides, missing on the top),  each use was for less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little \\&quot;fatter\\&quot; than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t write reviews (can&#x27;t seem to find the time), but it took me so long to finally find a hair dryer that I like that</li>
            <li> With the dryer set on high, I can hold my open palm less than 2 inches from the nozzle and not get burned.</li>
            <li> I returned the broken hair dryer and received a new replacement hair dryer exactly one week later.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair &amp; always dreaded using the cheaply hotel dryers because they took FOREVER to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old one that was still working but was taking too long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Although the dryer is small, the wind is so strong that my hair is dried so quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  </li>
            <li> It usually took me a long time to dry my hair with my old dryer which was heavy, plus the cord got tangled, and the high heat, which I need, often got too hot.  </li>
            <li> it feels and sounds like I&#x27;m running my vacuum</li>
            <li> I dropped my last full-sized ionic hair dryer in the toilet, so I have been using the Andis on a daily basis now.  </li>
            <li> Still a bit heavy for me, but the ionic hairdryer makes a big difference from the older one.</li>
            <li> I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ya its loud but not louder than any other hair dryer what dryer isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought it and put it aside until my other dryer that was 10 years old died( about 3 months ago).  </li>
            <li> Personally I&#x27;d rather spend my money on a high-end flat iron and salon products.</li>
            <li> so larger flat iron and brushes are not needed so the space is not of concern to me.</li>
            <li> I have fine &amp; thick hair and this product has cut down 50% of drying time.  </li>
            <li> Similar to what other reviewers have said, I found this hairdryer at a hotel (Wyndham) and it dried my hair very fast</li>
            <li> Bought it for light home use and travel so not sure how it would hold up with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I usually use it on low or medium and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Size is not too small or too large.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth, so it&#x27;s hard to handle when I have hair product on my hands.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    </li>
            <li> This dryer is not only large and heavy for a portable, the cord was broken right out of the box.</li>
            <li> it blows hard and gets hot, which my hair requires to get the curl out.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and the fact that folds and has a retractable cord makes it easy to store in a small space.  </li>
            <li> I returned it because my wife said it was too loud, heavy and does not dry her hair.  </li>
            <li> The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.)</li>
            <li> I used this at a hotel once and fell in love because it only took a few minutes to dry my very long, very thick hair (which normally takes a ton of time with any other dryer I&#x27;ve bought).  </li>
            <li> While I know small appliances aren&#x27;t made for long term use anymore, think I&#x27;ll go back to something much simplier to replace it.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer very convenient to use in my small bathroom or if I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> but I probably use mine for about 20 minutes a day straight if not more.  </li>
            <li> I will admit that this is very convenient in that it folds, is small and has a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Now we&#x27;ll just have to see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one.</li>
            <li> this aspect of the product did not last long...</li>
            <li> This one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal.  </li>
            <li> You never know how long a hair dryer will last.</li>
            <li> Someone said its does not last long as the ones that cost $100</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use a curling iron or flat iron to give me body or control my frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Because of the rounded edges, it does not sit on a flat surface well and mine has fallen and gotten chipped over the years</li>
            <li> and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> *BUYERS BE WARE, THIS DRYER DOES NOT LAST LONG</li>
            <li> Outside of that, I&#x27;m looking forwards to using this product for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> While the cord did stop retracting a long time ago, it only started losing motor power this week.</li>
            <li> The noise level is less than other hairdryers, and we believe the Andis brand will give us long trouble free performance.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s rather loud, and the cord isn&#x27;t entirely retractable, and it&#x27;s frankly a little underpowered -</li>
            <li> Overall, I definitely recommend it over other similar priced ones!</li>
            <li> I have been using my new hair dryer for a few months now.</li>
            <li> And it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to have less statics compare to my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> hair dryers do not have enough power to get it dry</li>
            <li> only disappointment is that I thought there were more heat settings - the product description says 3 heat/air speeds.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and gross.</li>
            <li> Havent tried it yet because I only dry my hair in winter</li>
            <li> Less than 10 months old</li>
            <li> I actually have time to dry my hair before leaving the house even when i&#x27;m running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the compact, lightweight design and 3 different heat settings &amp; cold shot.</li>
            <li> It blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Actual product looks bigger than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I do not think that it is too heavy, or has a short cord, or too loud.  </li>
            <li> I recently was medically retired from the military.</li>
            <li> I am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design I would think.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m notorious for showering at night simply so that I don&#x27;t have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings, but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick, simple thing.</li>
            <li> &quot;      Needless to say, the hair dryer is now in the trash, and I&#x27;m on the hunt yet AGAIN for a hair dryer that gets hot enough to straighten my naturally curly hair, but doesn&#x27;t overheat itself or blow itself up.  </li>
            <li> It is not light, and not small.</li>
            <li> While it is not huge, it is not a small travel-sized blowdryer either.      </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, it produces a slight &amp;#34;burning plastic&amp;#34; smell, but never overheated.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the lightest, but it dries my long hair so quickly, that my hand doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it.  </li>
            <li> Neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers.</li>
            <li> When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The low is quite low and not noisy (compared to other hairdryers we had before).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than my other hair dryer AND it folds, but has the same output..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive models (both Andis models and other manufacturers)</li>
            <li> I only blow dry my hair enough to get it from wet to damp, but compared to 100% air-drying my hair, it seems my hair is silkier when I use this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same hot pink Conair blow-dryer for about 3 years and it takes at least 20 mins to get my hair completely dry.</li>
            <li> A little loud</li>
            <li> while a little loud...</li>
            <li> Retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one, and I feel like I have less frizz after drying my hair with this one, probably because it has the diffuser at the end.</li>
            <li> Only negative: the back end sieve fills up w/dust and hard to clean...</li>
            <li> I dry my hair in 5 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment I can make is that it&#x27;s very LOUD!</li>
            <li> Major complaint, which others have noted, is that the retractable cord (which I&#x27;ve only used for traveling), barely works with my helping it along.  </li>
            <li> (and my hair seems less frizzy than with other dryers), but it is simply too loud</li>
            <li> It is too bad I really liked the idea.</li>
            <li> Some people complained the cord did not retract very well.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;m most unhappy with is the cord.  </li>
            <li> Small and convenient, however heat seems low and hairdryer is rather loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not powerful enough to use daily, folks - I brought it with me to Japan (with adapters) and worked</li>
            <li> One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never buying another dryer brand/model as long as this one is in production.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s not very durable.</li>
            <li> the cord was way too long and got in the way.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as my Conair that died after 15 or so years.</li>
            <li> This item was larger than expected.  </li>
            <li> On the pro side, I find the Andis RC-2 hairdryer is not as harsh as my old one was when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I cant say how long the cord retract works.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this product again and don&#x27;t expect that for a long time.</li>
            <li> Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   </li>
            <li> Expected to be smaller</li>
            <li> no longer smell burning hair, but the speed at which my hair dries is only minimally faster.  </li>
            <li> A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I have long hair with wave to it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak for the long term dependability</li>
            <li> A bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected this to happen eventually although I was hoping that it would be later rather than sooner.  </li>
            <li> We tried to figure out how long we&#x27;d had it</li>
            <li> and she said as long as she can remember.  </li>
            <li> and I am typing with wet hair, as it only worked for about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be quite a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> (Of course, the warranty had long expired).</li>
            <li> but it is larger and heavier than I expected</li>
            <li> I went with this product because It had a long retractable cord,</li>
            <li> Slightly bigger than I expected, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I do have trouble from time to time with getting the cord to contract completely.</li>
            <li> so I spent a lot of time shopping around and finally landed on this because it&#x27;s ceramic.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t that long</li>
            <li> My hair is almost 3&#x27; long, straight and fairly thick.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy thick hair</li>
            <li> The cord retracts really well, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is actually a little less frizzy with</li>
            <li> I actually wrote down all the information pertaining to the hairdryer and ordered it as soon as I got back home.  </li>
            <li> After several years and very little use, the black finish became very sticky, so I don&#x27;t use it now.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time!</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that I dry straight every day -</li>
            <li> This is not too heavy and does a better job for my (thin, tends to frizz) hair than other dryers.  </li>
            <li> After my hair dryer of 10 years died, I was looking to replace with something new that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, functional and Ceremic!</li>
            <li> Not happy right now.</li>
            <li> The only con I can find is that the back end where there is a mesh screen or dust collector, does NOT appear to be removable, so as dust bills up, it will be a bit awkward to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It lasted a little over a year and a half, which is decent for the $20 I paid.</li>
            <li> It has the same 1875 watt rating as our other dryers.</li>
            <li> Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip.</li>
            <li> and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom.</li>
            <li> This one performs as well as any of the other low cost models we&#x27;ve owned but it died 8 months into our use.</li>
            <li> First one from amazon warehouse deals was broken, so I spent the extra $5.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very long.</li>
            <li> The cord is very short, but considering I&#x27;m standing in a very wet locker room</li>
            <li> On high heat dryer blows hair so hard you cannot style the hair, it just frizzes.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry on medium.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry my hair quicker</li>
            <li> It helps to use the attachment since it concentrates the airflow and helps to dry hair quicker and reduce frizziness.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the unit must dry their hair sufficiently.</li>
            <li> - it takes me 20 minutes every morning to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes about  10 minutes to dry with this product.</li>
            <li> and I can never get it dry</li>
            <li> it can take up to 7 hours if I let it dry natually.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I can totally dry my shoulder-length hair in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 3-4 minutes max.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me: likes to dry her hair, doesn&#x27;t like to burn her head.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does dry hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I still manage to get my hair dry</li>
            <li> and it takes quite a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Using this to dry my hair after swimming at lunch.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BLOW DRY</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping the air was stronger so my hair would dry faster.  </li>
            <li> I thought it did dry my hair faster --</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair</li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair in comfort.  </li>
            <li> And I need to dry my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turned back on without any resets, but repeatedly stayed on for only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least this one dries decently.</li>
            <li> I would have returned it if I could, but I bought it as back-up in case my old one broke, and too late by the time I actually opened it and tried it out.</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is that it does not have a direct enough defusser.</li>
            <li> Cord still retracts and dries my thick hair fast with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> It is a loud little bugger however!  </li>
            <li> This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS HAIRDRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A HYATT HOTEL IN DENVER COLORADO, AND THE RESULTS WERE UNBELIEVABLE!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer even though I had recently bought a Revlon that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about because it was too large and quite loud.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but it has limited heated selection.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the fact that the cord does not easily retract all the way, leaving several inches of cord not stored in the handle.</li>
            <li> all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  </li>
            <li> But at low temp the dryer blows less air, and at high temp it blasts my hair making it hard to style.</li>
            <li> My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn&#x27;t induce that unpleasant state.</li>
            <li> not powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was broken and had to be returned.</li>
            <li> I liked the retractable cord for ease of storage, but was disappointed that one morning (without any warning signs)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it leaves my straight, normally shiny hair looking dry and frizzy, unlike my previous two Revlon ionic blow dryers.</li>
            <li> the fan comes loose from the stem that holds it all together.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button.  </li>
            <li> While the handle folds down and the cord theoretically has spring loaded retraction into the handle</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the retractable cord sticks sometimes.</li>
            <li> Found this dryer to be very heavy and completely stopped working after 30 days.</li>
            <li> Overall, it did what it was supposed to do, although I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference over the job the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; $10 dryers I used to buy from the drugstore, before they became such complicated and expensive things.</li>
            <li> I can get my entire head done in almost less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product Sept. 2014; less than 9 months later it is no longer working and</li>
            <li> yet it dries in about the same amount of time or less.  </li>
            <li> Would prefer a hair dryer that weighed less and was smaller.</li>
            <li> However, it did not last nearly as long as it should have - only a few months before the cord stopping retracting and less than a year before it burnt up.</li>
            <li> Works in half the time as a standard dryer and my hair is not as frizzy.</li>
            <li> so overall exposure is probably less</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it does not come with attachments like a diffuser, which I typically like to use.</li>
            <li> Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning.</li>
            <li> Actual weight of this dryer is almost 1 and a half pounds, and measures 10&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The other models that retract and have a hook were designed for the hotel industry and not available to the general public other than on ebay or in lots of 12!</li>
            <li> I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  </li>
            <li> A little bigger than I thought it would be, but works greats.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord is a plus, although it sometimes requires a little push/pull but always ends up going back in.  </li>
            <li> My hair was completely dry in under 10 minutes, and the air was not painfully hot.</li>
            <li> The folding handle did a little to make it smaller, but not much.</li>
            <li> It could not be worse for travel as it is actually quite large and extremely heavy.  </li>
            <li> Let me mention that I typically need to dry my hair in sections to get it dry</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer.</li>
            <li> so I am careful when storing it, but I bought it on sale and it came with a 36 month warranty</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really worried.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not.  </li>
            <li> With the attachment on, it&#x27;s actually larger than my everyday dryer.  </li>
            <li> I ordered from Australia so expected a 220-240 volt model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Be careful...</li>
            <li> Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it&#x27;s a heck of a dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, not real noisy, and</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only reason I hesitated from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit heavy (because of the ceramic core, I suppose).  </li>
            <li> I too has some trouble with the cord not fully retracting after a very short time owning it.</li>
            <li> the last few inches.  </li>
            <li> It came just a few days later.</li>
            <li> The dryer is heavier than I expected and the retractable cord is a joke.  </li>
            <li> not very practical.  </li>
            <li> It is big and heavy.</li>
            <li> All features work as expected.</li>
            <li> it does not weigh much and her arms do get tired.</li>
            <li> (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife&#x27;s hair is wet?)  </li>
            <li> This dryer is to heavy to be a travel dryer, and to big.</li>
            <li> I used to always buy expensive dryers that ended up not being powerful</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair softer but for me thA means its harder to manage.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died.</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer</li>
            <li> Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The part that should fully retract did not, after 30 seconds of CAREFUL use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything I throw out after a few months of use deserves only one star.  </li>
            <li> (if you let it zip closed</li>
            <li> Not really a problem.  </li>
            <li> The 1st time after few minutes, it obviously tripped it&#x27;s safety mechanism, because it just  hummed.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer and the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> We are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested.</li>
            <li> It was just as heavy as the big dryer I use at home.</li>
            <li> Cord retracts as expected.  </li>
            <li> This morning my second one was completely dead.  </li>
            <li> Purchased several of these a few years ago.</li>
            <li> When my hair was wet.</li>
            <li> Now I am expected to pay $6.50 in shipment cost ( on a $20.00 product) to return it  for repair.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money,</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as I was enjoying my new dryer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very heavy hair dryer and the entire process took at least twice as long and with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Still works decently well but that sucks!</li>
            <li> I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer performs great, but the switch failure was annoying.</li>
            <li> Hair dry is not worth the money....</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the speed and heat settings are not separate i.e they are controlled with one sliding switch, low speed&#x3D;low heat, high speed&#x3D;high heat.  </li>
            <li> Now on my second Andis RC-2, there&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s possible without a serious caveat factored in.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;heat is not strong, it takes long to dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  </li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted</li>
            <li> The only benefit is that the handle folds up so it takes a little less packing space.    </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord can only retract half way after a few months.</li>
            <li> It dries hair faster than any other product I have ever used and makes the hair shiny.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews for this product, I was sold on it.  </li>
            <li> So I kept it for myself because the size is comparable to other blowdryers I have used.  </li>
            <li> I keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic, expensive one in my bedroom, I much prefer this one!</li>
            <li> I have had other retractable hair dryers that did not have a problem retracting (until I broke off the button...)</li>
            <li> The other day (now about 6 months ago)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have believed the other reviewers about the size/weight of this dryer.</li>
            <li> Most disappointed since I can&#x27;t even try it out....</li>
            <li> (he forgot his old one had broken and said that it only went on for a few seconds before it would turn off.  </li>
            <li> With every other hair dryer I have ever had</li>
            <li> Bought this together with the other Andis Tourmaline model.</li>
            <li> Even other Andis blow dryers can&#x27;t touch the performance of this one.</li>
            <li> No problems to speak of, other than noisy.</li>
            <li> wish it had a cool setting or \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button.</li>
            <li> I have used similar Andis dryers in the past without problem, this one was a dud.</li>
            <li> I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element.</li>
            <li> It gets daily use if not more.</li>
            <li> I noticed it seemed to be running hotter than usual until it just stopped while in middle of drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it at any other setting.  </li>
            <li> I spent the money on this P.O.S.!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this and have it sent to her as a gift.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to risk</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I learned about the 5-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t retract extremely well sometimes</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews...</li>
            <li> No comparison to any other hand hair dryer.</li>
            <li> my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other blow dryer stopped working</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I would care one way or the other</li>
            <li> perhaps that is due to me pairing up this dryer with a hair paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However when we revived it the retractable cord button didn&#x27;t work other than that this is one of the strongest hair dryers we ever used.</li>
            <li> I think it works as well as the other blow dryer I was using</li>
            <li> Only negative I see, and it is a small one, is that the no-slip grip actually peals off after a few uses and you are left with a shiny handle.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they&#x27;ve simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  </li>
            <li> I read through the other reviews which say the retractable cord quits after awhile</li>
            <li> Every other dryer that I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> The other two don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but as other reviewers have stated, it is not a travel size dryer.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t mind it and has gotten used to the weight.</li>
            <li> drys my hair faster than any other one I have had.  </li>
            <li> It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!  </li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t burn your scalp like other dryers.</li>
            <li> would auto shutoff due to overheating.</li>
            <li> The air seems \\&quot;softer\\&quot;, which also means that it takes a little longer to dry.    </li>
            <li> not dry and dull like the rest of the hairdryers I have used.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, dull hair with no body at all.  </li>
            <li> I assumed it would be expensive, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for only $20.</li>
            <li> I wash and dry my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> I live at altitude in Colorado, and hair dryers can feel rather weak because there is less air to push through.</li>
            <li> Other hair dryers I&#x27;ve had normally last for at least 18-24 months.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on my thick, hard to dry hair without excessive heat.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than expected</li>
            <li> and I am 40 years old with a very thick set of hair.</li>
            <li> Like the feel of it in my hand, and puts out less heat than my other one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and thick and after a half an hour it still wouldn&#x27;t be dry.</li>
            <li> Powerfull and small, takes up little room and out preforms much larger and cumbersome units.</li>
            <li> The settings are either too low or too hard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s last legs from years of hard work.</li>
            <li> A little heavy and hard to blow the back with a round brush and hold onto at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I only used it a few times but it was honestly not something I noticed and given that it took half the time to dry my hair, even with the humidity</li>
            <li> I was using an ionic dryer before this and was used to just average performance.  </li>
            <li> The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed.</li>
            <li> The noise is average, but could be quieter.  </li>
            <li> But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint would be the location of the release button for the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying how loud or not powerful or easily broken this is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for at least five years and we&#x27;ve traveled extensively.</li>
            <li> not worth your money</li>
            <li> Only negative - it isn&#x27;t dual voltage</li>
            <li> That was my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I have used my Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord for at least three times a week since I got it, but it has been only about a month since it arrived!  </li>
            <li> This dryer is average size nothing compact about it..</li>
            <li> We both have thick hair and use it almost daily.  </li>
            <li> Goodbye, good riddance to the worst hairdryer I have ever had!</li>
            <li> I am convinced it has helped control my thick, coarse</li>
            <li> It is now March 2014 and only the slow speed works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time.</li>
            <li> The down side to this dryer is the SIZE.  </li>
            <li> It smoothes the fizzies and folds down compactly to store when done.  </li>
            <li> I wrote down the brand name of the blow-dryer and bought it on amazon.com the day I got home from my trip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After having the opportunity of using the Andis 80020 Ionic at a Marriott, I decided to hunt it down.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet.</li>
            <li> There is around 8\\&quot; of cord remaining after holding the button down to</li>
            <li> I wrote down the brand and model and set out to find one when I got home.  </li>
            <li> Cut drying time down without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> so I turn it down to med.</li>
            <li> I like it because it cuts down her prep time.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s never once overheated or shut down, etc.)</li>
            <li> The cord was hanging down and my puppies chewed it to pieces.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> It has traveled across the country 3 times and has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I also noticed after I purchased it, it went down in price.</li>
            <li> On the down side:  Heavy (probably because of the cord retracting mechanism, which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with), handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed because I bought this product based solely on the retractable cord but other than that the dryer works fine</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the folding handle or retractable cord features because other reviews mentioned having trouble with them.  </li>
            <li> had one for a few years and bought another to replace it and put the other in the guest bedroom.</li>
            <li> Some other reviews have mentioned that the dryer is heavy-</li>
            <li> &amp; I can mount on the wall folded in half w/no cord.</li>
            <li> It cut my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is rather heavy; I didn&#x27;t notice it in the hotel, but now at home it does seem a bit weighty.</li>
            <li> Folding in half does save some space as well.  </li>
            <li> Amazed it&#x27;s less than $20.</li>
            <li> It cuts the drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is subject to fraying, or it may just stop retracting.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a month and a half</li>
            <li> My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use.</li>
            <li> Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don&#x27;t like this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Ionic dryers do dryer faster, and with less heat</li>
            <li> The only negative I have to say about it is that the handle is really heavy.  </li>
            <li> It seems the smell is less noticeable each time I use it.</li>
            <li> After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  </li>
            <li> However, it won&#x27;t turn on less than 1 year after I got it.  </li>
            <li> I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems.  </li>
            <li> It was alot quiter and dries her hair in half the time, and lighter.    </li>
            <li> My hair dries in less time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that it is heavy to hold after a while.</li>
            <li> Ceramic ion drive and folding handle and retractable cord at half the cost of Conaire.</li>
            <li> Purchased this travel iron after my previous one burned up.  </li>
            <li> after less than two years use.</li>
            <li> I mean I thought it was a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Had it two and a half months.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I would recommend others to buy it if they&#x27;re looking for a hair dryer for less money.</li>
            <li> I like the folding handle as well - takes up less space under the cabinet.  </li>
            <li> but heat isn&#x27;t adjustable--lower speed means less heat.</li>
            <li> Had for less than a month before it died.  </li>
            <li> The fan runs, but the housing has separated where the silver part and black part meet, leaving a crack that allows strands of hair to be sucked into the fan/heater assembly.</li>
            <li> it folds in half.</li>
            <li> I went online and ordered immediately... paid half what she paid through retail store.</li>
            <li> The part that folds in half does it all the time now like it&#x27;s worn out or something</li>
            <li> Cuts my morning routine in half and my hair is way smoother since I bought this.</li>
            <li> This one retracts only so far which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and it dries it in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> My previous hairdryer had three of these features, but it was heavier and did not have the folding handle.  </li>
            <li> less than a month after expiration of the 1-year warranty.  </li>
            <li> that what I had used previously.  </li>
            <li> My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> But that is relatively minor complaint for a $20 hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but this us not true</li>
            <li> Just absolutely not the hair dryer for you if you have small hands or arthritis.</li>
            <li> This dryer was not as small as I expected it to be .  </li>
            <li> We just moved to a smaller place with a tiny bathroom and the old monster dryer with the long twisted cord wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full-sized hair dryer that I keep at home.</li>
            <li> It drys my long, thick hair in record time.</li>
            <li> A little noisy, not like my previous pro dryer, but it drys my hair.</li>
            <li> The little black piece that is shown in the pic does not a diffuser</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to dry.  </li>
            <li> -Very heavy, and thus not very portable which defeats my intended purpose</li>
            <li> In any event, its a very minor complaint.    </li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> It dried my hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that takes forever to  dry.  </li>
            <li> The handle is also clumsy to hold, especially for someone with small hands.  </li>
            <li> for the wife to travel a little bulky for travel</li>
            <li> My son and I share this little dryer.  </li>
            <li> Handy/powerful little blower that I keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night.  </li>
            <li> For travel, the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet.</li>
            <li> I realized I don&#x27;t even have to use my straightener after to reduce the frizz that I usually get with my other blo-dryer.</li>
            <li> No more than any other dryer.  </li>
            <li> Maybe should of been a little lighter in weight.</li>
            <li> I am a little paranoid of a fire.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair but it is a little bit too noisy .</li>
            <li> Discovered this little gem in a hotel in NYC.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a little heavier</li>
            <li> Anyways, a month or so after the folding mechanism failed, it started making a really weird sound like something was being chopped up inside of the hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This thing is still great even though it has a kinda awkward handle, but that&#x27;s what allows it to fold, so it is a necessary evil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, so might consider something lighter if traveling.  </li>
            <li> I would like to review it again after a few months or a year to see how it works then.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit heavy and bulky</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters have been using it everyday and it works well.  </li>
            <li> So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  </li>
            <li> Product just decided to stop working after a few years.</li>
            <li> However, after a few weeks of use it broke.  </li>
            <li> It has been dropped a few times too.</li>
            <li> It would turn on and work for a few seconds and then overheat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s slightly heavy.</li>
            <li> It was to heavy for her.</li>
            <li> For me it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I started to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t bring it on vacation and have been so busy since returning, haven&#x27;t had a chance to follow up on it.</li>
            <li> also heavy</li>
            <li> AND I REPLACED THEM EVERY FEW MONTHS...</li>
            <li> I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that....</li>
            <li> Broke within a few weeks from date of purchase.</li>
            <li> although heavy.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by others, it is heavy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t ergonomic &amp; it&#x27;s heavy.  </li>
            <li> now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a messy cord on my counter.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money, and shipping costs as well.</li>
            <li> And, as some reviewers noted, it did seem surprisingly heavy for a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Recommend it for everyday and travels with you too.</li>
            <li> Did not realize it would be that heavy as I wanted to use it when I trave since it folds up.  </li>
            <li> My husband has no issues and even he thinks it&#x27;s too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Now, 4 months later, NONE of the cord retracts-which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing this item DON&#x27;T waste your money.  </li>
            <li> And, it isn&#x27;t at all heavy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and use it everyday</li>
            <li> waste your money.  </li>
            <li> if I blow-dry it everyday.</li>
            <li> Bulky and heavy, the cord doesn&#x27;t fully retract into the unit.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use my metal Round brush or any products.</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;ve been using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda heavy</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Its not that heavy that you can bring it with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> But after 8 months of everyday use with no problems, it started to overheat in 2 to 5 seconds (glow) and</li>
            <li> It folds down and fits perfectly in my small bathroom cabinet.  </li>
            <li> The Andis RC-2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer died after less than 6 months!  </li>
            <li> The other problem is the cord that becomes twisted and then won&#x27;t retract properly without taking time and untwisting it.  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries my thick hair in about half the time of my previous dryer.  </li>
            <li> Folds and retractable cord keeps it from being the usual mess and bulk item with no lose in hair drying power</li>
            <li> Other users complained of the item&#x27;s durability.</li>
            <li> My daughters, who have lots of hair, use it and don&#x27;t complain about it being low power, which is saying something, coming from dramatic teenagers...</li>
            <li> Then a few months later, the mechanism that allows you to fold the hairdryer in half, totally failed.</li>
            <li> My hair dries nicely, easily, no fuss.  </li>
            <li> It also helps tame my frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Quicker to dry my extraordinarily thick hair!  </li>
            <li> So the bad news is that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would prefer.  </li>
            <li> I tend to burn out the motor- and be careful because there has been a few times that when the motor burns out it has made an awful sound and started to smoke.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that small, and quite heavy.</li>
            <li> I can deal with this, but what I hate is the &#x27;cool&#x27; touch button, which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies.</li>
            <li> For some reason the blowers on name brand hair dryers I have gotten in the past are weak and it takes longer than it should to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my thick medium-length slightly wavy frizzy hair looking sleek and sassy in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Price was at least $20 less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I get really tired when I dry all my hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry 3-4 x wk for just a couple of minutes each time (I have really thin hair), so this hairdryer was not \\&quot;overworked\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> One is extremely think, one average thickness, one very thick and mine as stated extraordinarily thick.</li>
            <li> Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!</li>
            <li> Disappointing to say the least as that was one of the reasons I chose this dryer in particular.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small travel size hair dryer and when I received this one it is heavy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I used the travel dryer as my usual dryer just to save space in my bathroom drawers.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I would use this for travel though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for five years and have used it everyday!</li>
            <li> So after months of just holding it open with my hand, it&#x27;s now making some scary noises inside.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how small it is when folded up.</li>
            <li> when it gave out I ordered another one this past February.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid that feature may weaken its integrity, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.    </li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t have the patience to blow-dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s no better than the crappy one at the gym.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy to lug into manhattan every day for the gym!</li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed no more frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it worked after that, I let it go.</li>
            <li> Not many folding full-size dryers out there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works well</li>
            <li> like I have had in the past (and can&#x27;t find)</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a small one to tuck in the overnight bag, think again.  </li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t like pulling the trigger when your head gets hot, you might be disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this hair dyer at a Hyatt and Ritz Carlton in the past, but never tried to order one for my home.</li>
            <li> it fold up small and the cord retracts into the dryer at the push of a button.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure I have ever had a hand held dryer which did not.</li>
            <li> I like the way it folds up quite small, the cord retracts well and it feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small, sleek size.  </li>
            <li> After just 18 months of ordinary use by two people, something broke today inside the dryer.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> But when I purchased it, I found it is no better than any Conair appliance.  </li>
            <li> Have read a few negative reviews and figured customers got a lemon  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reducing the rating by 2 stars because the power switch failed and the only way to turn off the dryer is to unplug it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times.</li>
            <li> for a woman with smaller hands, it is difficult to grip the handle.  </li>
            <li> This item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make hair all dried out !</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> And it has an unbelievable 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> He wanted a small, easy-to-carry dryer.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> VERY HEAVY - seems to work well but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for travel.</li>
            <li> Sorry to have such a negative experience to share.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since I purchased it as a Christmas gift for a family member long before Christmas, I was not able to return it to Amazon</li>
            <li> This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase.</li>
            <li> wife was  looking forward to it so disappointed really.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for travel, but I can&#x27;t comment on performance.</li>
            <li> MY LONG HAIR WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES !</li>
            <li> it does look a little weak there.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this hair dryer less than a year ago and it is already broken.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate when you buy something because of all of the positive reviews</li>
            <li> When it did work, it dried my hair (thick &amp; wavy) in about 5 minutes!  </li>
            <li> THE HANDLE WAS HARD TO FOLD.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 5 of these.  </li>
            <li> icky.</li>
            <li> Seems they have an common problem of the fan blades breaking or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding out that this is a common problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never own one again</li>
            <li> The negative</li>
            <li> From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the return window closed within a month,</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it because at least it is fold-able.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews were negative on this.  </li>
            <li> Purchase this in February...loved it until it stopped working 6 weeks late.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair, and it&#x27;s gone from chin length to an inch or so below my shoulders since I bought it.     </li>
            <li> , I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> Forced to replace it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slow.</li>
            <li> I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  </li>
            <li> Even my BF noticed that my hair was straighter than I usually get it (and I didn&#x27;t even use a flatiron!), and that is with 90 degree heat and humidity too.  </li>
            <li> Small and convenient!</li>
            <li> I mean that.</li>
            <li> AND the cold shot doesn&#x27;t slow down to the point of almost being off, like other travel hair dryers!!!</li>
            <li> I guess I will do it the old fashioned way and wrap the cord :(</li>
            <li> I wanted a very small hair dryer for my suit case.  </li>
            <li> but this was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows.</li>
            <li> This is my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I am not at all disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> As some reviewers mentioned, the handle isn&#x27;t ergonomic, but I don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable or hard to hold onto, and I have relatively small hands.</li>
            <li> I think this was related to the switch going bad.</li>
            <li> It arrived and I opened it and was shocked at how big it was.  </li>
            <li> You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;push to retract\\&quot; did not work 100%, but I did not expect it to (dumb idea).  </li>
            <li> I had a Conair folding dryer for years, but the hinge became weak.  </li>
            <li> Dumb construction.</li>
            <li> I used it once where the air flow was so weak</li>
            <li> In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  </li>
            <li> However, the entire dryer is bulky and the retratable cord went down soon, which is very annoying....</li>
            <li> Could be worse, at least it still runs!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough to push up with my thumb.  </li>
            <li> We all have very thick shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy/curly hair that dries out</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to yank my hair out, and no more burning smell!!</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS DEAD!!!  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a hairdryer with a retractable cord, which prevents dealing with twisted cords.  </li>
            <li> every* time, and the GFI plug is not huge and awkward to handle.  </li>
            <li> Cord winding was broken after I bought in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I hate that the back does not remove for cleaning the screen and expect this will also shorten the hairdryer&#x27;s life.    </li>
            <li> (even when i try to help push it into the unit), which is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, approximately one month after purchase, the retractable cord does not rewind all the way.  </li>
            <li> It broke the third time I used it piece of crap</li>
            <li> But this time it sounded worse, so I pulled it away from my head so I could take a look at the thing</li>
            <li> It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan</li>
            <li> I was tired of using crummy hotel dryers and even the hand dryers at the gym</li>
            <li> NOT NOT NOT HAPPY...</li>
            <li> We had an issue with my moms hairdryer, it sounded like there was a broken piece inside.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get at it to see what is broken.</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace a ConAir cord retractable, folding handle hairdryer that was purchased approximately 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get much worse.  </li>
            <li> Just something to be mindful of if using this when traveling in a hotel with thin walls.</li>
            <li> Just not great quality.  </li>
            <li> It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with it, especially for this price.</li>
            <li> The cord gets twisted and then will not retract all the way.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the dryer at all.</li>
            <li> The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    </li>
            <li> Ive had this for over 6 months, and the cable retraction is not working as well because the cable is all twisted within the cable (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 2012 &amp; this shouldn&#x27;t be difficult technology.</li>
            <li> This is not an expensive hair dryer</li>
            <li> The cord rewind is absurd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate (and I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars) because it dries my hair well</li>
            <li> Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Is something wrong with my hair dryer?</li>
            <li> The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say Andis is NOT on my list of replacement brands.</li>
            <li> 4 star because it is difficult to position it in a space saving position on the counter.</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer in an expensive hotel and had to buy one for home.</li>
            <li> so I was sorry that it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed.</li>
            <li> We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it just died on me...overheats.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mere $20 price tag.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after about 4 months, the dryer has completed died..</li>
            <li> I hate twisted cords and the trouble they cause when you try to pull a hairdryer out of a drawer.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known there was something wrong with it when 2 weeks of using it, the cord would not retract all the way.  </li>
            <li> For $19.99 you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It made a weird nose and wouldn&#x27;t turn on</li>
            <li> The retracting feature on the cord failed within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry....</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!  </li>
            <li> Too bad the quality is so poor.  </li>
            <li> The disappointment is the cord retraction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in an awkward loaction on the body of the dryer</li>
            <li> I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this one!</li>
            <li> I was mad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> (&amp;#34;Ceramic&amp;#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; in the pantheon of absurd &amp;#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&amp;#34; labels!)</li>
            <li> It became impossible to retract.</li>
            <li> AFTER READING SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS</li>
            <li> i hang it on my wall and everyone sees the ugly cord dangling.</li>
            <li> At this point, I was so incredibly frustrated I wanted to chuck it out the window.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sick of</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the retracting cord.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But I wish it still retracted. :(</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> Disappointed to see the technology hasnt improved.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out it was not after receiving the product.</li>
            <li> Infuriating!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This does not impact its use, its just annoying.    </li>
            <li> Annoying.  </li>
            <li> Before I used to hate it.  </li>
            <li> The cord did not retract well into the base.</li>
            <li> What a pile of crap.</li>
            <li> This was a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> the cord does not fully retract - making it worthless</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in product and amazon</li>
            <li> Bye-Bye bad hair days!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product Ive ordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Literally the worst blowdryer.</li>
            <li> It is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> They make worst products.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product was horrible.  </li>
            <li> But the worst feature was the retractable cord.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well, good power, able to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li> A great hair dryer.  Excellent features, and very attractive.</li>
            <li> The cord does not retract very well.</li>
            <li> On high heat dryer blows hair so hard you cannot style the hair, it just frizzes. On medium heat the dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot enough when styling. It takes forever to dry on medium. In my opinion this unit is best as a blow &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34;, not a styler.</li>
            <li> My wife used one of these at a hotel we stayed in; she loves the way it doesn&#x27;t damage her hair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 5 of these.  My daughter&#x27;s old Andis finally gave up, and I luckily found another one on Amazon.com.  I keep one in my house, one in my motorhome, and one in our spare bathroom for when the kids visit.  This hairdryer is medium size, easy to hold and not awkward feeling.  I hope they haver stop making them, which is why I like to have extras becuase I won&#x27;t like changing to a new hairdryer if that ever happens.</li>
            <li> Good retractable cord.&lt;br /&gt;Light and foldable, easy to carry and good for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Noise level low and acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  It seems to dry my hair quicker</li>
            <li> It is powerful and has the feature of retractable cord; however, it doesn&#x27;t always work smoothly.  The cord gets twisted and then will not retract all the way. Its also somewhat larger than i had hoped since it is to be a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a travel blow dryer. it&#x27;s actually pretty big. I would never pack this and travel with it.It&#x27;s also pretty heavy. Awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This dryer did a great job of drying quickly and produced a great sheen without causing frizzies.  It was a little noisier and a little heavier than some, but it folded up into a tidy, compact package and the cord retraction mechanism worked well.  What sucked was that it broke within the first week of owning it.  While using it, there came a loud cracking sound as some piece of the internal workings broke and the fragments subsequently rattled around inside noisily wreaking havoc.  Andis deserves high marks for a decent enough product, but definitely rates a &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; for quality control.</li>
            <li> Discovered this hair dryer while traveling in Barcelona, Spain. Lite weight, easy to handle and performs extremely well.  Provides just the right amount of heat therefore, no over dried hair or friz.  Use the cool shot button at the end of drying so as to set the style.</li>
            <li> for the wife to travel a little bulky for travel</li>
            <li> Expected more drying power.  It&#x27;s heavy, so might consider something lighter if traveling.  Can&#x27;t really tell that it helps the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp;#34;bang for the buck&amp;#34;!  Only negative: the back end sieve fills up w/dust and hard to clean...</li>
            <li> I actually used this in a very upscale hotel on a recent vacation. I loved it so much I took down the model number and brand name. It dries hair faster than any other product I have ever used and makes the hair shiny. Best hair dryer I ever purchased. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love that this hairdryer folds up, and cord retracts.  It has great power for the price and size.  I had used this hair dryer at a hotel, so I knew I would like it.  It really dries my hair quickly, which helps with the frizz!</li>
            <li> After a week of using this hairdryer, I started noticing a burning plastic smell when I used it. Then one day it just shut off. When I went to pull it out of the wall to check my outlet, the adapter was so hot it burned my hand, and the plastic had started to melt. Thank god my outlet shut off, and thank god the whole thing didn&#x27;t burn my house down.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I liked it so much when I used at our hotel on vacation in April. I&#x27;ve had it 3 months and am still delighted with it. It dries my hair very nicely using the focused tip; has 2 heat levels plus a cool dry; is light weight; has a retractable cord and folds up. Several reviews mentioned that it broke easily so I am careful when storing it, but I bought it on sale and it came with a 36 month warranty so I&#x27;m not really worried. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for such a great price. Hearts well, folds even better! Impressed.   UPDATE...   After using it maybe once a month (4-5 times since purchase) the retractable cord no longer works. Very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product. Still works decently well but that sucks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after using one on a trip.  The hair dryer works well so far as the drying aspect of it, but the retractable cord only retracts some of the time.  This does not impact its use, its just annoying.    I would recommend this dryer for someone who wants a compact, easy to use hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the folding handle, retractable cord and compact design. However, mine was a rare anomaly because it overheated and the opening started to contort slightly like it was melting. Had to return, but I will buy another one, because I don&#x27;t think this was the norm.</li>
            <li> The folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer.  Plenty of power and yet easy to store.  Definitely a good buy.  Have used it for about 6 months and works great.&lt;br /&gt;2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like the design of this hairdryer.  I bought 2 of them for gifts and the recipients seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> Pro: Retractable cord and folding handle are very convenient and easy to store.  Not too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Actual product looks bigger than what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product has some nice features. I have purchased two of them for different bathrooms in my home.  I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark.  I may buy another one just because I like this dryer but I definitely know what to expect now.</li>
            <li> Way too loud and large for travel. Returned it as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> This is a good travel hair dryer.  Definitely way better than using those hair scorchers attached to hotel bathroom walls, but it&#x27;s not on par with something you would want to use every day.  It helps to use the attachment since it concentrates the airflow and helps to dry hair quicker and reduce frizziness.    It folds up and packs nicely.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 years and the cord still retracts just fine.</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews.  Received dryer today.  Pulled out cord.  Pushed button to retract.  Nothing.  Tried to coax it back in and could only push it part way.  Returning it to Amazon.  And, am going to avoid Andis products.  If they want to enter the low end market, they should make a product that  works.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth. And you can&#x27;t beat the price either. I&#x27;m never buying another dryer brand/model as long as this one is in production.</li>
            <li> We have two of these hair dryers - I bought the first for my daughter &amp; myself in 2007, and the second for her in 2009 to take to college. Both are still going strong, although she dropped hers on the tile bathroom floor at school and the cord \\&quot;retract\\&quot; button got broken. She doesn&#x27;t care - she just folds the handle in and wraps the cord around the dryer when she has to pack it.  The 2007 dryer still works great - it dries my hair efficiently and the cord retracts fine. For those reviewers complaining about the retractable cord not working properly, I would suggest that you NOT let it retract with twists in the cord. I always press the retract button with one thumb and feed the cord with my other hand to remove any twists and it works perfectly.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it&#x27;s a bit loud and a little cumbersome as a travel dryer (for travel I would recommend the Andis Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the sound and use the smaller dryer for travel myself.  Overall, I would highly recommend the dryer and would have given it 5 stars but for the noise level.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace an old one that my wife had.  She likes the fact that it has a folding handle and can be used on trips etc.  She does not use it everyday at home as it is mostly a back-up.  I would like to review it again after a few months or a year to see how it works then.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember why I sent this back, but I think it was because it did not fold up closely enough. ML</li>
            <li> It takes some precision switching fr hot to cool &amp; vise-versa, otherwise it&#x27;s great &amp; I can mount on the wall folded in half w/no cord.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before purchasing but figured for [...] bucks how can you get hurt.  It drys just fine, retracts as it&#x27;s supposed to and takes up less space which is the point, isn&#x27;t it?  Am going to buy another one for travel.</li>
            <li> The best hairdryer that I have ever had. I love thait has three speeds unlike most dryers that only have two settings.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was broken and had to be returned. The second arrived ok but the cord stopped retracting after 4mths and now I am back to having the same type of hairdryers I used to have.  Not impressed with the dryer at all.</li>
            <li> Okay, I haven&#x27;t owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years, but I must say, this one is exactly perfect and has everything I would ever want in a hair dryer.  It has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it soft and frizz-free.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer in  a hotel and fell in love. It is light and drys thick hair quickly. It cut my drying time in half.  Way cool!</li>
            <li> I am downgrading the number of starts I gave this hair dryer.  It works great and I like the folding handle, however, the retractable cord does not work very good.  It does not retract without helping it along.  It is designed not to retract all the way, which leaves about 8 inches of the cord dangling.  Seems like they could have made it retract more than that.      I am really enjoying my new hair dryer.  The folding handle works great and with the retractable cord, it is easy to store and does not take a lot of room. The hair dryer itself works great also.</li>
            <li> I was using an ionic dryer before this and was used to just average performance.  I used the dryer the first time and my hair felt like silk!  I had no hair product on my hair, just freshly shampooed.  I was amazed!  I love this dryer!  The cord retraction has to be \\&quot;helped\\&quot; right at the end, but that&#x27;s not an issue for me.  The folding handle is more important to me because of the limited storage space in my small bathroom.  I&#x27;ll never buy a different dryer in the future - always an Andis Ionic Ceramic!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use. Still a pretty good price, but I won&#x27;t buy the same item for fear that it will break again.</li>
            <li> This item I bought for my girlfriend... She liked it a lot, however after some usage, the retractable cord stopped working (so you will have the wire hanging outside), but its power was really good compared to the price.. Once I bought, I have seen that this product is bigger than what it looks like, so  if you are thinking on buying it for traveling purposes, DON&#x27;T!!  This is to be kept at your own bathroom, but otherwise it is really good... &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> The retractable cord and folding feature along with the power this dryer produces, make it a great deal. My hair dries in record time and is very silky. The only downside is the heat/speed settings.  I find the medium and low settings to lack the heat, and sometimes want to finish my hair with lower fan speed with more heat. For the money, this is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> First used this hair dryer when staying at a motel &amp; had to have it.  I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say; it works well and is powerful. Retractable cord is great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After struggling with Conair hair dryers, this one is such an improvement.  Lighter weight, better balanced, cord retracts *every* time, and the GFI plug is not huge and awkward to handle.  My only wish is that the slide button for the temperature control had more of a lip and/or moved a little more easily, on mine it&#x27;s tough to push up with my thumb.  But that is relatively minor complaint for a $20 hair dryer.  One note on retractable cord: it leaves about 9&amp;#34; or so exposed so it is never 100% retracted.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. It is light and on the quiet side. The retractable cord is great. My hair has not looked better from drying with this product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i dislike the hair dryer and i was overcharged for it; 38.50 by hairproducts.com.  icky. the reason i dislike it is simple: a retractable cord should retract. it simply doesn&#x27;t retract.  i hang it on my wall and everyone sees the ugly cord dangling.</li>
            <li> I must be the last human being on earth to discover that the ceramic, ionic technology is available on low and moderate-priced hair dryers. I used one of these dryers on a recent business trip to Phoenix. When my old Revlon finally bit the dust, I started my online hair dryer research and was amazed to learn that this great hair dryer was available at such a low price. I&#x27;ve had it about 6 weeks and it has completely lived up to my expectations. It keeps my thick medium-length slightly wavy frizzy hair looking sleek and sassy in 5-10 minutes. I still have to use a flatiron to get a really \\&quot;finished\\&quot; look most days, but I think that&#x27;s just due to my hair&#x27;s particular quirks and not because the hairdryer is inadequate. My only complaint is that it is rather heavy; I didn&#x27;t notice it in the hotel, but now at home it does seem a bit weighty. Other than that, it&#x27;s an exceptional dryer for the money.</li>
            <li> I had a perfectly good hair dryer but got tired of coiling/wrapping the cord around the handle or something every time I put it away. I bought the Andis because it has not only the retracting cord but also the folding handle, and space is at a premium in my place.    The dryer itself does a good job. Not only is 1875 watts plenty hot but I use it on &#x27;high&#x27; and the motor blows the air hard enough that I can dry my hair in only about 5-7 minutes which is good.     The disappointment is the cord retraction. It worked fine maybe the first half dozen times I used the dryer, and then suddenly it stopped short. It still retracts but stops with about 6\\&quot; of what it used to retract, still out. Add that to the length that was never intended to be retracted, and voila, I&#x27;m dealing with cord again - the one reason I bought the thing to avoid!    Since the heater, motor, and handle still work, I&#x27;m keeping it till I can find something better. I had never heard of Andis before this and I wonder if it&#x27;s just an off brand...? At any rate, do NOT buy this if the cord retraction is what&#x27;s gotten your attention.</li>
            <li> We just moved to a smaller place with a tiny bathroom and the old monster dryer with the long twisted cord wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  I love the retractable cord, although it doesn&#x27;t always completly retract each time.  Folding in half does save some space as well.  From the reviews I was hoping for reasonably quiet but it sounds like a leaf blower on high, louder even than my old monster.  Overall, not bad for the price, wish it were quieter.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I really wanted this to be a good review. Now on my second Andis RC-2, there&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s possible without a serious caveat factored in.    My first unit was purchased in April, before traveling to China for two weeks. It overheated the first day (in spite of the proper converter and adapter), so it didn&#x27;t get used again until returning to the states. For seven months, it ran great---so great that I took it out of the carry on and began using it in place of my usual blow dryer. Then, POOF! One day, it just quit. The motor hums, but that&#x27;s all.    In December, I decided to buy another one for my carry on---same make and model, figuring the first one died early because of the China experience. Imagine my surprise when the new one worked exactly five times...then quit. Same problem. The motor makes a quiet humming sound, but that&#x27;s it.    Maybe it&#x27;s unrealistic, but I believe a blow dryer should work for more than a few months, especially if the first four months&#x27; worth of use are limited to time on the road. It&#x27;s a nice little dryer when it works, but my experience has been that \\&quot;when it works\\&quot; can be iffy at best.    Sorry to have such a negative experience to share. Now...back to looking for a new dryer.....</li>
            <li> bought for grandaughter</li>
            <li> The blow dryer works fine but unfortunitely the diffuser attachment cracked off already.  Called customer service for a replacement and I was told I had to send back the entire blow dryer - hassle!  So, holding it together with tape.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast this blow dryer works.  I can get my entire head done in almost less than 5 minutes.  The retractable cord is great for storage as well.  My sister-in-law used it once and she was impressed as well.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had an Ion folding arm travel dryer that needed to be replaced so I purchased this.  I used the travel dryer as my usual dryer just to save space in my bathroom drawers.  This one is a bit bigger.  I am not sure I would use this for travel though.  I like the folding arm and retractable cord.  It is not quiet but a lot quieter than my old Ion.  It has 3 speeds which is nice.  My daughters (5 and 2) use medium and I use high.  We all have very thick shoulder length hair.  It does leave our hair soft and shiny as my Ion did.  Good purchase and price.  I have only had it a week so I can&#x27;t comment on durability yet.</li>
            <li> I saw this hair dryer in Ritz Carlton Hotel, tried and loved it. I then searched amazon and found it. Amazed it&#x27;s less than $20. Easy to get the hair styled, light weight. I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t reading the description quite right when I ordered this dryer, I was hoping it had 2 levels of power plus 3 temps. But at low temp the dryer blows less air, and at high temp it blasts my hair making it hard to style. So I just use the medium setting - medium heat/medium air flow. I do really like the folding feature and retractable cord. They make it so much easier to store in a bathroom vanity drawer. It is not lightweight so don&#x27;t buy it if you are looking for a lightweight travel dryer. It&#x27;s more of a space-saver in the bathroom rather than the suitcase! I do like the Andis brand, not sure if I would buy this particular one again because of the temp/air flow issue, but it is definitely well made and worth the money.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews for this product, I was sold on it.  It sounded light and compact, and perfect as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I knew immediately upon opening the package that I would not be able to give it to her.  While it is not huge, it is not a small travel-sized blowdryer either.      So I kept it for myself because the size is comparable to other blowdryers I have used.  The thing that annoys me the most is the handle which is square and not super comfortable.  The Off/Low/Medium/High switch is fickle too.  It has to be directly on one of the settings or the blowdryer won&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s not a big problem, but it is an annoyance.  Although the blowdryer dries my hair just fine, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer, but auto retractable cord only works a few times before it stops going all the way back into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mine that part of it, the dryer works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on Spring Break and it was great! It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast. I have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes. It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer. The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually. I keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic, expensive one in my bedroom, I much prefer this one!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is relatively quiet. However, the cord does not retract all the way that it should. I have had other retractable hair dryers that did not have a problem retracting (until I broke off the button...) It&#x27;s better than not retracting, but there&#x27;s a good 8 inches left after its retracted.  ________________  Jan 2011  The hairdryer died on me.  Most hairdryers will last a couple years. This only lasted 7 months.</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer at a hotel and loved it -- had to order -- great price -- great travel hair dryer folds nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for five years and have used it everyday! It&#x27;s still working like new!&lt;br /&gt;It retracts nicely and fits great into my bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> Great little folding hair dryer.  I was looking for something small enough to fit into my cosmetic bag and it does!</li>
            <li> Great ceramic blow dryer, arrived promptly, entirely satisfied!</li>
            <li> We used a hairdryer like this in a hotel.  It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  We love it.  It cuts the drying time in half.  It folds for traveling and has a retractable cord.  We love it!</li>
            <li> Good Quality Good Price.&lt;br /&gt;Love the retractable cord&lt;br /&gt;Tried this dryer at a couple of high end hotels.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to dry hair faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It&#x27;s been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you&#x27;ll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it&#x27;s as good as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It&#x27;s fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it&#x27;s a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it&#x27;s definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer. I have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and I have long hair. It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all. I bought this one to put in my gym bag and I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as the full sized version. I highly recommend this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Pretty good hair dryer.  I have thick, curly hair that I dry straight every day - so most travel dryers won&#x27;t do the trick at all.  After reading all the reviews I decided to give this one a try.  The 1875 watts is great - it blows hard and gets hot, which my hair requires to get the curl out.  (That&#x27;s on high heat though, so don&#x27;t let that deter you if you don&#x27;t like that.)  The down side to this dryer is the SIZE.  I read it in the reviews, but for whatever reason decided that since it&#x27;s categorized as a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; dryer, it must be smaller...but it&#x27;s really not.  The opening where the air blows out is so large, that you really need the attachment to get targeted air.  With the attachment on, it&#x27;s actually larger than my everyday dryer.  The only benefit is that the handle folds up so it takes a little less packing space.    So - if you need power, it&#x27;s the best \\&quot;travel\\&quot; dryer I&#x27;ve found.  If you need \\&quot;small\\&quot;...keep looking. :)</li>
            <li> After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a lot of power, 3 speeds and, best of all a retractable cord. Hangs on a hook under by vanity counter, out of sight. Price was at least $20 less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the retracting cord.  Why can&#x27;t engineers build enough horsepower in the retractor to always allow the cord to retract fully?  Where&#x27;s the safety factor?  Charge the extra $3 per unit and upgrade the retract mechanism.  How many of you have wives and daughters that have to sit there and play with the darn thing to get the cord all the way in?  Otherwise, the unit must dry their hair sufficiently.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer does a fantastic job. It dries hair quickly without getting too hot. It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but since it works so quickly, the weight does not bother me much. The only problem is that it&#x27;s not very durable. I&#x27;m about to purchase my third one of these in about four years. The retractable cord is subject to fraying, or it may just stop retracting. Also, on the one I&#x27;m replacing, the screw that holds it open (\\&quot;unfolded\\&quot;) popped out. It&#x27;s stripped and won&#x27;t go back in. So after months of just holding it open with my hand, it&#x27;s now making some scary noises inside. So I&#x27;ve thrown it away and will buy a new one. The reasonable price and great performance are the features that me coming back to this brand.</li>
            <li> First used this blow dryer at a Four Seasons hotel in Hawaii and LOVED it!  Wrote down the name/model # and immediately came home and ordered one for my own travels.  The retractable cord and folding handle are nice for traveling, but the best part about this \\&quot;travel-friendly\\&quot; blow dryer is that it&#x27;s got great power without it being so hot that you have to worry about the heat burning your hair. I&#x27;ve got a more expensive dryer for every day at-home use, but would highly recommend this dryer for traveling!</li>
            <li> I ordered from Australia so expected a 220-240 volt model. I was sent a 130 volt model which when plugged-in went bang.&lt;br /&gt;So cannot review obviously.&lt;br /&gt;When I went back to check the voltage it wasn&#x27;t readily obvious what it was. It took quite a bit of searching to find out I had bought something unusable in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was  looking forward to it so disappointed really.</li>
            <li> We visit my brother in another state for several weeks at a time and we keep items there so we do not need to lug them back and forth when traveling there. We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply. This hair dryer fit the bill. IT IS RATHER LARGE. But it does fold up and the cord does retract. Despite its size, it still fits the bin that we use to keep our stuff there. It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair. The only con I can find is that the back end where there is a mesh screen or dust collector, does NOT appear to be removable, so as dust bills up, it will be a bit awkward to clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller hairdryer to take with me while traveling and this is perfect! I couldn&#x27;t believe how small it is when folded up. Only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but for travel purposes, it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love the look and feel of this hair dryer. A little heavier than I thought it would be but much quieter than my old Conair and I am pleased with the results.  Folds and packs well for travel and I like the retractable cord. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel!  I literally ordered one from my hotel room, immediately after using the dryer.  Works really well! Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.  Great space saver.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is pretty good for a college dorm; it&#x27;s small, the cord is retractable, and the handle folds to make the item seem smaller when you&#x27;re not using it.  Overall, it&#x27;s not extremely powerful, which isn&#x27;t great because I have a lot of hair to dry which takes awhile, but it does get the job done.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I&#x27;ve already had some issues with the retractable cord, but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer while on vacation and loved it. I like everything about it except, I&#x27;d like a longer cord. I especially like the way the cord retracts so you don&#x27;t have it lying around on the counter. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This dryer might work wonderfully.  I wouldn&#x27;t know.  It arrived and I opened it and was shocked at how big it was.  Much larger than the photo or specs indicated.  Not suitable for travel, but I can&#x27;t comment on performance.</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer for the 2 years it lasted. I didn&#x27;t use the retractable cord much as so many reviewers complained of it breaking. My problem was that it only lasted for 2 years, and I have thin, fine hair so it wasn&#x27;t like I burned the thing up. It was convenient for travel and did a good job, just didn&#x27;t last. So here I am looking to buy another hair dryer again. I&#x27;ll try something else this time. Hopefully all hair dryers are not built to be disposable!</li>
            <li> We bought this after using one at a high end hotel and are quite pleased. The heat settings are very good and it folds easily for storage.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the fact that the cord does not easily retract all the way, leaving several inches of cord not stored in the handle.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best I have ever owned. I do not think that it is too heavy, or has a short cord, or too loud.  It all worked out for me. The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz. It held my style in place.  I gave it 5 stars because I am am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> Have used this hair dryer for more than 2 weeks. It works pretty well. It has enough heat for the different settings. It seems to have less statics compare to my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn&#x27;t gotten a good solid workout like ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn&#x27;t weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn&#x27;t the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have believed the other reviewers about the size/weight of this dryer. It weighs the same as my Conair dryer (weighed on a postal scale)  it&#x27;s basically the same size. I won&#x27;t be using it as a travel dryer. I&#x27;m going to keep it though, the retractable cord is a nice function, not present on my current dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been getting this dryer for 5 yrs each  time I get it I love it more.  I have now got my sisters using it.</li>
            <li> Since I am using this on almost a daily basis (to take to and from the gym) I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  I like that it has the cool shot option.  I ended up getting the Baby Bliss travel dryer because it is about 1/2 the weight and I really like it.  However, it doesn&#x27;t have the cool temp option so I&#x27;m hanging onto this one for backup.</li>
            <li> Quick drying and I love the cool button.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer 6 months ago. I have very long and thick hair - it takes me 20 minutes every morning to blow dry my hair. I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord. The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches. Not a big deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Am very happy with the Andis hair dryer I purchased.  I   ordered two.  Had tried it in a Marriott Hotel, &amp; it is  the best dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this little hair dryer! I got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It has at least as much power as the full size dryer I am replacing. I haven&#x27;t missed the old one for a minute. Plus, as promised, this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a compact travel dryer and what drew me to this one was the retractable cord and folding capability.  Based on the reviews I thought it would work well for travel. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the weight of the dryer.  Probably the heaviest hairdryer I&#x27;ve owned. I plan to keep it and use it at home, but now I still have to find a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer!  I went on vacation and there was one in my room.  I loved it so much I came home and searched for it til I found it.  Amazon had the best price for this model.  When it came, I was not disappointed.  If you like your dryer to have a lot of force to it, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I love the retractable cord on this hair dryer and the folding handle, which is great for travel.  Also a plus is the ease in which the controls work.</li>
            <li> have been using now for 2 weeks. good quality, blows plenty  of hot air. the cord winds well into the dryer</li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the \\&quot;retractable\\&quot; cord is completely misleading. It stopped retracting on its own after I used it twice. With that said, the folding handle still makes it easy to store. Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> This is ok. its bigger than I thought but better that what I had. Like the retractable cord and folding handle and the hanging hook. much cleaner look in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised. No muse and no fuse. Just a perfect buying experience. I would recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hairdryer that leaves my hair so smooth at the ends. I discovered it in a hotel and had to make it mine:)</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer (mainly for the gym). It turns out, that it works better than the one I keep at home. I have fairly thick hair, and it&#x27;s gone from chin length to an inch or so below my shoulders since I bought it.     Pros:  -Dries my hair very quickly  -Retractable cord is awesome (don&#x27;t need to deal with winding it around the dryer)  -Folding handle is awesome as well (takes up less space when storing)  -Not bulky     Cons:  -Very heavy, and thus not very portable which defeats my intended purpose</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning. Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability. I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold. Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> The best dryer ever....</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is cheap&lt;br /&gt;-received it last week and it seems to work fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-cord does not retract all the way&lt;br /&gt;-handle is not ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;-larger than my most travel hair dryers I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> coiling mechanism broke only after a couple of uses out of it.  I, too, saw these at hotels and thought they worked well.  I got a conair one instead and it works much better.</li>
            <li> It smoothes the fizzies and folds down compactly to store when done.  It has three speeds instead of two, so doesn&#x27;t blow too furiously at lowest setting, which makes it easier to style my hair (doesn&#x27;t blow it off of the styling brush).</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li> The best dryer I have!</li>
            <li> We discovered this dryer while staying at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. We loved it. So we took a photo and found the exact model on Amazon. We purchased two of them and love them. It has the same 1875 watt rating as our other dryers. However, the fan really puts out the air. We highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> powerful, folds up and the cord retractor is strong.</li>
            <li> I first used this blowdryer at a hotel and liked it so much I looked for it online. I was pleasantly surprised to find it so affordable! This blowdryer is light and dries my hair very fast. It cut my drying time by more than half compared with my former \\&quot;professional\\&quot; grade more expensive blowdryer. I timed it and dried my fine, wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes (I also used the Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush). The retractable cord prevents cord tangles and extra cord weight. This blowdryer is easy to use and a great value for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/25/12&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year later, the blowdryer still works very well. Nothing broke and I enjoyed it all year. Today I took off one star, however, because the dryer doesn&#x27;t come with enough options: no styling nozzle or difuser. The settings are also very basic. So I did buy a new blowdryer (from a different brand) for not much more money than ths one, in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds. Still, I believe I got my money&#x27;s worth with this very decent Andis.</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair dryer when I stayed at the Hyatt and I found it online. That was about 4 years ago and I have not seperated with it since. This is the only blow dryer that does not make my hair frizzy and makes it soooo soft! I highly recommend it for curly-hair individuals.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!! This is NOT a 220V hair dryer!  I searched this website for a 220V hair dryer and this was included in the results.  I ordered it, shipped it overseas, paid duties, etc. only to find out that it is NOT a 220V hair dryer!  Most disappointed since I can&#x27;t even try it out....</li>
            <li> My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.</li>
            <li> Due to our bathroom layout, a dryer with a retractable cors and folding handle works best.  I bought one of these three years ago.  It was used almost daily by my husband.  Due to his current hair \\&quot;style\\&quot; (short on the sides, missing on the top),  each use was for less than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it stopped working (just wouldn&#x27;t turn on), I looked for another model, but this was the only one with both the handle and cord features.  Easy decision. I ordered another and put it in his cabinet.  The next day he tried it (he forgot his old one had broken and said that it only went on for a few seconds before it would turn off.  It turned back on without any resets, but repeatedly stayed on for only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I dug out the box from the recycling and returned it to Amazon.  Two days later, the third one was in his cabinet.  Three weeks later, Dryer #3 is working fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically it is a decent, no frills dryer that does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Product dries hair quickly. Although larger and heavier than most folding dryer&#x27;s,the price was good and so far the quality has been good also.</li>
            <li> This is my second Andis, it worked so well when it gave out I ordered another one this past February.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll last as long as the first one.  A great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer works great and love that it folds up, however, the cord retracted on it&#x27;s own the first time, and now when I press the button to retract, I have to help the cord go in.  I still like the product just wish the cord feature worked better (which was one of the reasons I purchased this model).</li>
            <li> One of the best travel hairdryers I have ever used! Excellent for styling with cool button as well as speedy drying capability. Perfect for use at home everyday!</li>
            <li> Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working one morning when my hair was only halfway dry.  I tried it in other outlets, waited for it to cool off, etc. but it was not going to revive.  Nothing unusual was going on; it just died.</li>
            <li> Perfect size...fits great in my gym bag. Love the retractable cord and it&#x27;s powerful!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after having it in my hotel room in Disney! I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine. Love the retractable cord. My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather. My style held even in the Florida heat. So, I came home and ordered one. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful...</li>
            <li> Ive had this for over 6 months, and the cable retraction is not working as well because the cable is all twisted within the cable (if that makes sense). Still retracts, but nowhere as good as when it was first purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a 4 star product but I gave it a 3 star as it is a &#x27;travel&#x27; hair dryer. It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button. Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels &amp; B&amp;B&#x27;s have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse). It is not a critical item in travel. It should be much smaller in size with the same quality &amp; cool shot. It&#x27;s 2012 &amp; this shouldn&#x27;t be difficult technology.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  I ordered one for myself as soon as I returned home.  Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure I can&#x27;t style it properly.  Medium works great for me.  Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  As others have mentioned, be careful not to pull the cord out too far, as mine stopped retracting after 18 months.  With almost 3 years of daily use, it finally died.  I immediately ordered another one.  At this price, one every 3 years is a bargain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and dry hair fast. Overall it&#x27;s a good hair dryer. Good for using at home but not for travel.</li>
            <li> Works fine especially for the price.  The retractable cord worked once but after that I can force feed and it will go back into the handle.  If your specifically looking for a hair dryer with a retractable cord, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there is no heat setting on a low speed.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was all it was advertised to be.  It is very easy to use and light weight.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer. The cord could inside for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don&#x27;t like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great little dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that&#x27;s hard to dry.  This blow dryer dries my hair quickly and I loved the retractable cord.  It was a great blow dryer till it stopped working 3 months after I bought it.   Now what?</li>
            <li> I used this dryer for four days while staying at a Hyatt hotel. I was immediately impressed by how powerfully and quickly it dried my hair.  The retractable cord was an instant hit with me as well; the cord on my current dryer is presently tangled up all over my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit heavy and bulky (I wasn&#x27;t aware that it folded).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a dryer, but I liked this one enough after my hotel test-drive that I will be purchasing one immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 2012: So, I&#x27;ve used this daily for a year. A good dryer, I must admit I don&#x27;t find anything particularly different about this Ionic dryer as compared to other dryers (e.g., I can&#x27;t say my hair is shinier or more manageable). Still, a good, but heavy, dryer. I&#x27;m still enjoying that retractable cord!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any reason to say this one isn&#x27;t value for buy. Actually, I very like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my wife. We travel a lot and this fits in her make up bag.  She is very happy with its size and performance.</li>
            <li> Like it but the cord needs assistance retracting and could have more power.</li>
            <li> I once recommended this dryer and should have changed my review years ago. The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed. I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way. I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again. I no longer possess this product and could not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my ANDIS Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer, I throw it in my travel bag, it has all the power of a bigger, heavier dryer.    I love the retracting cord and folding feature, it stores neatly at home as well.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer regularly for 8 months now and it is a great deal for the money. The retractable cord and folding handle work fine. This is my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I am not at all disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Based upon other reviews I expected a really great hair dryer.  I have naturally curly hair and I wear it straight.  This hair dryer actually caused a lot of frizzing, rather than the&lt;br /&gt;ionic smoothness that I was expecting.  It&#x27;s also a very heavy hair dryer and the entire process took at least twice as long and with my old hair dryer. I really can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My son and I share this little dryer.  We both have thick hair and use it almost daily.  For the price, the three speeds, the cool button, the retractable cord it is great.  It make our hair feel so soft.  We love it and again for the price you cannot beat it.  A good value buy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last 2 weeks. And for the money is a decent buy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s retractable wire is another plus. cannot comment on the longevity for now.</li>
            <li> The best feature is the power of this blow dryer. My hair is almost 3&#x27; long, straight and fairly thick. It takes about  10 minutes to dry with this product. However, it did stop working after 29 months but having only paid $19.99,  that&#x27;s an amortized investment of $.70 per month. Not a bad value at all. Its compact size and retractable power cord  make storage a breeze. Replaced it with a 2175 Watt Conair Blackbird which is weaker and more cumbersome. Will be  returning it and buying this blow dryer again.</li>
            <li> Very good and efficient quiet too.</li>
            <li> i took it to costa rica with my, easy to travel with, great and quick dryer! it managed to dry my hair in high humidity.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel.  I love the way it doesn&#x27;t use a lot of heat.  I also loved the way my hair looked after using this product, the ends of my hair did not look fried.  After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Cord winding was broken after I bought in two weeks.  Dryer is still working.</li>
            <li> this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is... the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.If it had some ridges that might have helped. And it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using my new hair dryer for a few months now. I bought it because of the folding handle and retractable cord ( neither of which has caused me any trouble) but what most impresses me is how quickly it dries my hair, even my daughter who has enough hair for 10 people was impressed with it&#x27;s speed of drying her hair.</li>
            <li> Handy/powerful little blower that I keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night.  Perfect that it folds as it maybe gets used once a month.  No problem with the retractable cord yet but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point</li>
            <li> This dryer is perfect for travel.  It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  It is perfect for me.  I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don&#x27;t have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don&#x27;t seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with the cord and it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this 5 months ago, and it croaked. Just like that,it starting to smell burned (w/o smoke) and then it stopped. It wasn&#x27;t the socket, it was the dryer.  Too bad--it was a good price and it when it worked, it worked well. The best part about it was the retractable cord....next!  Go for a brand name like Conair or Sasson.  Their dryers last.</li>
            <li> Sooo I went to Colorado Springs and stayed at the Broadmoor... This hairdryer was in the rooms. Its Ion technology dries my hair so quickly! Its also great because it makes my hair appear to be shiny-- not dry and dull like the rest of the hairdryers I have used. In addition, its retractable cord and folding style is great for taking on the go!! Totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I chose this model hair dryer because it was one of just a couple of models with a retractable cord AND a hook for hanging.  I&#x27;ve had it for just over 1 month. The other models that retract and have a hook were designed for the hotel industry and not available to the general public other than on ebay or in lots of 12! It seems hair dryer manufacturers must presume if yout want a cord that retracts, you intend to store the hair dryer in a drawer. In my case, I have a hook inside the vanity cabinet with an electrical outlet in the cabinet. I want to remove excess cord when not in use. Also, I did not need a folding handle and I am afraid that feature may weaken its integrity, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.    The airflow is moderate but not great and the settings are limited to basically high and medium with a cool shot. I do not notice any better performance due to the ceramic feature and I have noticed less static and frizz with other ceramic models.  The noise is average, but could be quieter.  I hate that the back does not remove for cleaning the screen and expect this will also shorten the hairdryer&#x27;s life.    All in all it drys hair and stores conveniently and was not very expensive, but its not the perfect dryer by any means.</li>
            <li> I liked the dryer itself but the retractable cord no longer works.  It&#x27;s one of the reasons I purchased the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> although the handle can be folded, but it&#x27;s still too big to carry around when you travel,&lt;br /&gt;heat is not strong, it takes long to dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;and the noise level is just so high, make you deaf!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel, but I like it so well that I&#x27;ve been using it for my regular one.  I like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered, but it doesn&#x27;t always retract as easily as it should.  I sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle, but to me, it&#x27;s a tolerable hassle (especially for the price point).  The dryer is very powerful.  I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it&#x27;s a heck of a dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have had this over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong after daily use.  Love this thing!</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick blonde hair. Usually I don&#x27;t have the patience to blow-dry my hair. I have been using the same hot pink Conair blow-dryer for about 3 years and it takes at least 20 mins to get my hair completely dry. I used this Andis product at a hotel I stayed in in NYC and loved it! It dried my hair in less than 10 minutes. I wrote down the brand name of the blow-dryer and bought it on amazon.com the day I got home from my trip.&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended it to all of my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Purchased only three weeks ago and I did not use the hair dryer more than 5 or 6 times, it has stopped working completely.  The cord does retract properly when the handle is fully extended and I thought that would be a nice feature, but the handle does not &#x27;lock&#x27; into the extended position, so it was a little tricky trying to hold the hair dryer in a good position to use it.  The lower cost was attractive, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used ionic hairdryers for the last couple of years. Ionic dryers do dryer faster, and with less heat so they are easier on your hair. This was the first one I have seen with a retractable cord, which is what first attracted me.  Be careful not to pull the cord out to far or it doesn&#x27;t retract well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a great little dryer, at a great price.  I say two very enthusiastic thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Cord no longer retracts.</li>
            <li> I tried this blow dryer elsewhere and loved it! It is easy to use with convenient button location. It provides ionic drying which makes you hair very shiny. It has a retractable cord, so when I am done, I retract the cord and tuck it between my wall and medicine cabinet. It also folds in half despite being a full power blow dryer. I like my own dryer when I travel so my hair comes out just right. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works really well.  The only negative I have to say about it is that the handle is really heavy.  I had a different brand dryer that had the folding handle and automatic cord, but it was lighter weight.  However, this dryer has 3 settings - Hi, Med, Lo - and a cool button.  All and all I am very happy with it.  I am sure I will get used to the heaviness the more I use it.  Also, the cord still hangs out about 7 inches once it retracts.  (my old dryer only had about a 2-3 inch slack).  I would recommend this dryer mainly because of the 3 heat settings.  NOTE:  The first few times I used it, it produces a slight &amp;#34;burning plastic&amp;#34; smell, but never overheated.  It seems the smell is less noticeable each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  I have not been disappointed.  It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, especially for the price - quite powerful, i like the folding handle and retractable cord and it doesn&#x27;t eat my hair.  My only complaint is it has shut off once or twice on its own.  It came back on after a minute, but it makes me wonder about its longevity.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer at a hotel and liked it so much i took a picture of it so I could order one. The price was right and it dried my very thick hair quickly without it being super frizzy.</li>
            <li> OMG you have to get this hair dryer it is a god send I have very wavy thick hair and I can never get it dry it can take up to 7 hours if I let it dry natually.&lt;br /&gt;Most hair dryers do not have enough power to get it dry but the Andis is so much more plus it has a couple features that really sold me on it ,  1st it&#x27;s the retractable cord that in it&#x27;s self is a value , 2nd there is a cool button that cools your hair down no matter what setting you have it on, and 3rd it has a foldable handle who could ask for more..&lt;br /&gt;For me this is the best hair dryer I have ever bought this is a great deal so don&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer very much.  The only thing is the retractable cord does need help to go in.</li>
            <li> Hyatt and Marriott Hotels use this Hair Dryer and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;Just a great product, reliability, functional, fast drying and&lt;br /&gt;gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> I had tried this one without the retracting cord at a hotel and liked its more quiet and fast drying on my long hair. So I went online and ordered one to replace my very loud one at home. The retracting cord is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don&#x27;t use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don&#x27;t bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn&#x27;t clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; or \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing.  Being \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won&#x27;t have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length.</li>
            <li> We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed.  The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly.  Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It&#x27;s better than dryers that are much more expensive.  Now we&#x27;ll just have to see how long they last.</li>
            <li> After having the opportunity of using the Andis 80020 Ionic at a Marriott, I decided to hunt it down. It is amazing.  Lightweight, compact and dries my hair in no time.  It folds which makes it a plus for vacation travel.  I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought this together with the other Andis Tourmaline model. This one is for my daughter. The hairdryer is powerful yet light and we love the retractable cord! It stores away neatly in the bathroom cabinet. We have been using these Andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong. I have never heard of this brand until I used this in a luxury hotel - I was so impressed with the performance and design of the item that I searched for it online when we got home. For the price, design and performance, this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting. Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should. Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn&#x27;t stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, works well, inexpensive ... and my first one lasted three years with virtually daily use. Personally I&#x27;d rather spend my money on a high-end flat iron and salon products.</li>
            <li> Searched for this dryer after trying it in a hotel and loving how great my hair looked.  Still happy with the way it dries my hair, but have found the same problem others have with the retractable cord.  It worked great for a month and now will not retract.  A bit of a nuisance that spoils overall satisfaction, but still worth buying.</li>
            <li> Great traveling Hair Dryer.  I used this when I went to Florida last month and it was so nice how it folds and the retractable cord was great instead of wining it around the Handle.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s smaller than I was used to however it is perfect in size and the feature of it collapsing is Great for travel. I would definitely recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The best, hands down! My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight! I use this in conjuction with the revo styler, resolve or lavei shampoo. I also use sleek look or sleeking conditioner. Then I finish sparingly with my own version of Ojon oil.    Even other Andis blow dryers can&#x27;t touch the performance of this one. Neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife to put in her gym bag; so she wouldn&#x27;t have to pack and unpack the one from home all the time. She likes the Andis better than the one she has at home. It blows plenty of air and gets hot enough to dry her hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Yep, its loud, but it works, and it works good. It dries your hair fast and the cool feature is nice. No problems to speak of, other than noisy.</li>
            <li> It was nice while the retractable cord worked, but that stopped working after 2 months. Now I have to stand right next to the outlet because the cord won&#x27;t pull out.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it&#x27;s a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you&#x27;re not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn&#x27;t get it back together. I bought another one and now I am more careful.</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently. I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it. It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle. I really like that it has 3 \\&quot;speeds.\\&quot; It also has a cool blast button, but I don&#x27;t use that. It is also quite quiet for a hair dryer. One of the best features is the retractable cord. Now I don&#x27;t have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet. I bought this dryer even though I had recently bought a Revlon that I wasn&#x27;t crazy about because it was too large and quite loud. Very happy with this! I hope it lasts as long as my Conair that died after 15 or so years.</li>
            <li> I really like retractable cords for my hair dryers. It makes them so much easier to use.  I have been using a Conair 1875 model for many, many years and got great use out of them.  I decided to try this one due to the great reviews and price.  It&#x27;s been a great decision.      I&#x27;ve had this Andis model for 6 months now and I can safely say that it is a bit better because it is quieter.  I have had no problems with it so far.  My wife and daughters have been using it everyday and it works well.  It stores easily in a cabinet under the bathroom sink with no hassles of a tangled cord when it travels from one room to another.  It seems to be holding up well and the price is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the prices. The retractable wire is great and saves space under my sink. Folding is also added bonus. It&#x27;s not the quietest hair dryer but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that with something that&#x27;s Priced at this level</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer in a hotel and immediately ordered it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s not too hot, but dries hair quickly.  I have had it for several weeks now and am still very happy.  Cord still retracts, everything is working well.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this blow dryer.  I just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one and I can see a huge improvement in my hair.  It dries quickly and stores nicely.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product at Four Seasons Hualalai in Kona.  I just loved everything about it so bought 2 on line and then 2 more wanting to share this with my close friends and sister.  And delievery time was speedy so got to owning my own hairdryer ASAP.  My hair dries faster and feels fuller..Thank You!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer after using the same one in a hotel, and being surprised by the power.  It dries my hair much faster than my previous ionic dryer.  I haven&#x27;t been using the folding handle or retractable cord features because other reviews mentioned having trouble with them.  I figured I&#x27;d save those features when I&#x27;m traveling with the hair dryer and need them.  The dryer is smaller than my old one, and fits easily into the drawer.  As some reviewers mentioned, the handle isn&#x27;t ergonomic, but I don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable or hard to hold onto, and I have relatively small hands. All in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, \\&quot;The product sucks!\\&quot;  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer&#x27;s return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn&#x27;t planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn&#x27;t have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer in a hotel and fell in love with it. It dries my hair quickly without drying it out and the retractable cord and folding handle makes it easy to pack and easy to store.  The quick cool shots of air are great too!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tested this hair dryer at a Ritz Carlton and loved it - didn&#x27;t even unpack my own.  I ordered one upon my return and have been using it daily for over a month.  My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  This dryer is fantastic!  The retracting cord works smoothly, too.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s almost a full size hair dryer BUT it does fold and the cord retracts.  More importantly it&#x27;s Powerful ... More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  AND the cold shot doesn&#x27;t slow down to the point of almost being off, like other travel hair dryers!!! Annoying.  But not on this one.  Of course I&#x27;d prefer a lighter dryer with the same features but until then this one fits the bill.  I&#x27;d rather lug something a little heavy that&#x27;s going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  At this price, I&#x27;ll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip. I like the ion technology, it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies. I also like that it has THREE settings for blowing. Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush. The retractable cord made is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer on the market. Not too loud and dries hair fast. I should have bought 2</li>
            <li> This is the best hairdryer EVER. Not heavy and has a powerful airstream.</li>
            <li> Tried this hair dryer in a high class hotel.  Loved the power of the blower.  For some reason the blowers on name brand hair dryers I have gotten in the past are weak and it takes longer than it should to dry my hair.  Inspite of its smaller size, it packs a lot of punch.    And the folding and retractable cord feature is a nice added bonus.      The only complaint would be the location of the release button for the retractable cord.  It&#x27;s in an awkward loaction on the body of the dryer but I suppose that couldn&#x27;t be helped.  In any event, its a very minor complaint.    If you are in the market, I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The Andis RC-2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half! I leave the dryer on my dressing table without retracting the cord.  For travel, the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem.  I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  A great value for the job that it does!!</li>
            <li> Product just decided to stop working after a few years. Never dropped it and kept it in good condition. I&#x27;m guessing maybe the thing overheated?</li>
            <li> light weight, effective hairdryer. like the folding handle for travel and storage purposes. retractable cord nice feature. wish it had a cool setting or \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button. overall, great dryer at a terrific price!</li>
            <li> I used one of these hairdryers at a resort we went to.  I actually wrote down all the information pertaining to the hairdryer and ordered it as soon as I got back home.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason.  When it did work, it dried my hair (thick &amp; wavy) in about 5 minutes!  I also loved the retractable cord.  When unfolded, this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it.  However, it won&#x27;t turn on less than 1 year after I got it.  I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems.  This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted.  I am giving it two stars because it didn&#x27;t last.  (while it worked, I&#x27;d give it a 5)</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer with plenty of power, however not recommended if the selling feature for you is the retractable cord as this aspect of the product did not last long...(maybe a dozen times if that).  Otherwise, recommended, great price for a great product (I&#x27;ve had it nearly 3 months at this point and will update if it breaks within a year).</li>
            <li> Great little dryer and perfect when traveling</li>
            <li> First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  Bought one for home and love it.  Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer while staying at a Marriott hotel and loved it.  My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store.  I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly her hair dried......</li>
            <li> Just what the wife ordered</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair. Quicker to dry my extraordinarily thick hair!  Compact and convenient.  I have 3 grown daughters who upon visiting have asked where I got it.  Guess what? Three more happy customers!  All three have varied thickness of hair too.  One is extremely think, one average thickness, one very thick and mine as stated extraordinarily thick. Love this hairdryer!</li>
            <li> The dryer works OK but I bought it for the retractable cord. It works some of the time and almost never fully retracts.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked well for a few weeks, and I was impressed with the speed I could dry my hair and the softness from the Ionic stuff.  However, after a few weeks of use it broke.  It over-heated and then the off switch wouldn&#x27;t work, so whenever it was plugged in, it was on!  Very disappointed, as I was enjoying my new dryer!</li>
            <li> I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised. At home I had the Sharper image 1875W quiet Ionic hair dryer and this is what I am comparing it to. I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we&#x27;re still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place. Almost 10 years, not bad at all!</li>
            <li> Heavier and larger than I thought so probably wouldn&#x27;t travel with it. The cord rewind is absurd. You basically have to push it in. The high isn&#x27;t very high either. A decent dryer for the price (maybe).</li>
            <li> The hair dryer was a replacement gift for another traveling style dryer and so far has lived up to all expectations.  Plus, the order and delivery were done in a timely manner...</li>
            <li> Love this one...handle works, cord retracts just fine / dries my waist length hair super fast,.. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> The hair-dryer cord comes in handy. Now I don&#x27;t need to make sure the cord isn&#x27;t touched by water. The hair-dryer has a softer sound to it, so it doesn&#x27;t disturb any one in the house.</li>
            <li> The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down. I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!</li>
            <li> The main feature of this dryer that I find most appealing is the power.  The air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter.  I also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability -- an asset for storage and travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great looking and functioning item that is essential in every home--especially ones with smaller bathrooms.  I gave it four stars instead of five because the cord does not retract all the way.  But that does not present much of a problem.  Shipping was fast and we are very satisfied overall. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This dryer has a retracable handle which makes it nice to store or take on trips. I Iove it! Made great Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> I first found this hair dryer while staying at Mariott hotel and LOVED IT.  I always bring my own with me on trips but this time I never used it.  Great power yet small and with the retractable cord very easy to store.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and upon arrival the dryer stopped working. It would turn on and work for a few seconds and then overheat. Not pleased with this purchase. I have used similar Andis dryers in the past without problem, this one was a dud.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly. I used this dryer at a very nice resort hotel and have been hoping to find the model number and this is the one. Good value</li>
            <li> Use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I used this blow dryer at the Four Seasons.  It is quite powerful and ionic.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it extremely easy to store or take with you on trips.</li>
            <li> ONE MONTH AFTER RECEIVING IT, AND OF COURSE AFTER THE 30 DAY RETURN POLICY HAD EXPIRED, THIS HAIR DRYER STOPPED WORKING.  CHEAPLY MADE, THE CORD WOULD NOT FULLY RETRACT, YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUSH IT IN AND EVEN THEN IT WOULD NOT GO ALL THE WAY.  THE HANDLE WAS HARD TO FOLD.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer so I&#x27;d have to stop depending on hotels and people I stay with. I tried it out in my apartment and it is really great. Almost good enough to replace my actual blow dryer (which to be fair is about 3 years old).    Very compact, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice hairdryer.  The cord is longer than I thought it would be.  Dries hair quickly and since I am use to hairdryers being a bit loud, this one was not bad at all.  Compact, nice fold up handle.  Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have had many blow-dryers. I was looking to replace my earlier one because it was heavy, bulky and loud, but didn&#x27;t seem to have much oomph. It was an ionic dryer but I never seemed to see much benefit from that, either.    What attracted me to the Andis was: compact size, foldable handle and retractable cord. I was also interested in trying a ceramic dryer to see if it made a difference in hair health/shine.    I have to say this blow-dryer is FANTASTIC. It has lots of power, more than my old full-size one. And it works FAST. I can totally dry my shoulder-length hair in about 3 minutes. My hair has lots of shine afterwards, too.    Hands down the best dryer I have ever had. I have a small counter space and this dryer doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room, but you sure get a lot of quality out of this little machine.    I had never heard of Andis before seeing the reviews on Amazon, but this dryer is just in a different league from the &#x27;recognizable&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is everything I was looking for; affordable, compactable (but beware, it&#x27;s not a dinky little thing), durable and of course, good at drying hair.     The one problem I had with it was the retractable cord (the only reason it doesn&#x27;t get all 5 stars from me). The first model I received stopped retracting the cord within a day. I returned it and Amazon sent me a new one. I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and the cord still retracts (most of the way, but not quite all the way). The blowdryer still works great though.     I like the different settings, and the high setting it very effective.   I don&#x27;t use the cool setting very often but if I did I would want there to be different levels (high it the only option).     My previous folding dryer was a little smaller, which was nice, but it didn&#x27;t have nearly as much power; I&#x27;ll take the power over the space, thank you. I suppose it all depends on what you&#x27;re looking for in a dryer, but I would say overall, this is a great buy. You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to beat the price.</li>
            <li> Light weight, and folds easily for storage and has a good &#x27;balance&#x27; for my small hand. Doesn&#x27;t make as much noise as my previous one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while ago so that I could take it on the road with me (when I was working as a flight attendant).&lt;br /&gt;This blowdryer is really good! So good that I use it all the time at home now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to return this hair dryer. It&#x27;s unfortunate (and I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars) because it dries my hair well (and my hair seems less frizzy than with other dryers), but it is simply too loud (I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and the cord keeps getting stuck (even when i try to help push it into the unit), which is frustrating. Overall, I&#x27;m bummed that this one didn&#x27;t work out...</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews but I had to for this hair dryer. I bought three of these after using it at a hotel for me and my mom and sister. First of all the price is amazing for what you get! I am someone that drys my hair every day so I need a good hair dryer. This thing blows out so much air, I have never had a hair dryer like this. Ya its loud but not louder than any other hair dryer what dryer isn&#x27;t. Its great for traveling with too because it folds and the retractable cord. You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this one! I am buying another soon just in case this one goes out in the future.</li>
            <li> First used one of these in a hotel, and loved it.. the retractable cord gets stuck , but still love it</li>
            <li> It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I&#x27;m not buying this model ever again.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries my thick hair in about half the time of my previous dryer.  My hair also is smoother looking after drying.  Very convenient as it has the retractable cord and folds for easy storage.  This is the best dryer I have ever had.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Andis Ionic Hair Dryer has alot of power in drying your hair quick!  The controls and the retractable cord works great.  What&#x27;s best is the folding handle which doesn&#x27;t take up much space but it&#x27;s slightly heavy.</li>
            <li> dries hair in minutes!! confinent!!</li>
            <li> Unlike some hairdryer&#x27;s that claim to be quiet and not blast your eardrums...This one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal.  Lightweight and folds up when you need to travel.  Great design on the retractable cord..which once you have this you won&#x27;t be able to ever buy one without this feature.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer.  I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  So since mine is pretty old, I can&#x27;t vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  I&#x27;ve been super lucky with mine.  It gets daily use if not more. I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be. My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don&#x27;t retract. I keep it clear of lint and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  I hope everyone has the excellent experience I have had.  Everytime I look at a Revlon or Conair hair dryer, I cringe. I&#x27;ve never had one of those last more than a year. After 10 years, I would purchase this product again, but mine just doesn&#x27;t want to die just yet!</li>
            <li> Used this at a Hyatt Resort in CA.  I immediately bought one through Amazon on the stop.  works great ad is compact.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S THE PERFECT SIZE.  A GREAT WEIGHT.  RETRACTABLE!  THE HANDLE FOLDS &amp; IT DRYS VERY WELL!  BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!  AFTER READING SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY IT BUT I&#x27;M SURE GLAD I DID!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money. Bigger than most travel size blow dryers but the folding handle is still a great feature and still helps with space. The three speeds is a bonus too. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say the retractable cord stopped working after a week, but I&#x27;ve had absolutely no trouble and it&#x27;s been a couple of months. I&#x27;m wondering if those people are retracting the cord before or after they fold the handle.  It seems to me it should be done before to give the cord a clear path.  All in all a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer to travel with!  Lightweight and folds into itself...takes up minimal space in your luggage yet, very powerful!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product Sept. 2014; less than 9 months later it is no longer working and beyond it&#x27;s 30 day warranty.</li>
            <li> Every day I used to dread blow drying my hair. It&#x27;s long and thick and after a half an hour it still wouldn&#x27;t be dry. This hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 3-4 minutes max. It has totally changed my life. I have bought one more just to have on hand. You never know how long a hair dryer will last.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and I have used it&lt;br /&gt;everyday since with no problems.  It is easy to fold when we travel and&lt;br /&gt;love the fact that the cord retracts.  I decided to go ahead and order a&lt;br /&gt;second one to have on hand when this one goes out because with my luck&lt;br /&gt;it wouldn&#x27;t be available then, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City. Works great. Very powerful &amp; I like the retractable cord,very nice . Would recommend highly.Great price also.</li>
            <li> The item purchased arrived  a whole lot sooner then stated and in excellent condition</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had! Including the 100 dollar ones. Compact and light and easy to store I wish I had purchased this six months ago!</li>
            <li> Purshased in May 2008 and has been reliable until this morning when the motor gave out. Did not even last two years which seems like a short life span.  I noticed it seemed to be running hotter than usual until it just stopped while in middle of drying my hair.  I liked the folding feature of the dryer which takes up less space than others.  I gave up on using the retractable cord not long after I purchased it for fear that it would get stuck while retracted into the dryer which started to happen.  I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This item was larger than expected.  Length &amp; height were as represented, but the blower itself was \\&quot;fat\\&quot;.  My wife is the one who uses it the most, and she found it to be large and cumbersome.  Having said that, it appears to be well made.  The noise level is less than other hairdryers, and we believe the Andis brand will give us long trouble free performance.  But, this is not a travel hair dryer... home duty only.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this hairdryer and have to say they were all spot-on.  I had been using a travel hairdryer and liked that it was compact, yet powerful enough to get the job done quickly.    On the pro side, I find the Andis RC-2 hairdryer is not as harsh as my old one was when drying my hair.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as dry/frayed looking.  The air seems \\&quot;softer\\&quot;, which also means that it takes a little longer to dry.    On the con side, the hairdryer is bulky and heavier than my old one.  The retractable cord component works most times, but does need some help and has gotten stuck a couple of times (I&#x27;ve had the hairdryer a month now).  The handle is square, which I thought wasn&#x27;t a big deal when I read the other reviews, but it isn&#x27;t as comfortable as my old one.    It&#x27;ll do for now, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Today, I decided to start write reviews for Items I&#x27;ve bought and used, because I want to thank the people that have helped me made the right buying decisions and would like to give back by writting reviews which I hope would benefit the next person.    I got the this blow drywer for my wife. I&#x27;ve read some reviews saying how loud or not powerful or easily broken this is...They are only partly true...so here is my view.    Loudness, Power, Weight: Before I got this unit, I bought one from Save-On with the exact same spec but a different brand. I returned it because my wife said it was too loud, heavy and does not dry her hair.  So I got this one for her to try(Praise to Amazon return policy), and my wife loves it. It was alot quiter and dries her hair in half the time, and lighter.    So here is what I think, you need to know that this is a &#x27;small&#x27; dryer, and it will be louder and less powerful then a full sized dryer, but it is very useable for its \\&quot;small\\&quot; size.  It fits our small bathroom perfectly and create a neat organized drawer with the retractable cord.    Someone said its does not last long as the ones that cost $100+, well, if it did break, I&#x27;ll just grab another one for $20. And I will conider the a large full sized dryer when I get a larger restroom.    There is definetely room for improvement, but consider its price, I think this is excellent unit. However I do wish for a slimmer/lighter aluminum frame blower with ultra quite and powerful motor, and a smooth retractable frame mechanism, using variable heat/speed adjustment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not the best. i was looking to spend less than 20 $ on it, for the money, it&#x27;s okay, but it is not the best.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not only large and heavy for a portable, the cord was broken right out of the box. When pulled out, it wouldn&#x27;t stay pulled out. Returned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer and when I plugged it in for the first time, it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom! I had not even turned the hair dryer on! It had the hot, electric smell. I sent it back for a refund which Amazon quickly honored. I will not try this brand again.</li>
            <li> Replaced it because there was no difference between the heat settings.  The dryer didn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my short hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it included the retractable cord. It works great. The folding handle is also a plus. Also good power</li>
            <li> This item is a little smaller than my last hair dryer, but the power makes up for any shortness in the top.  My hair dries in less time.</li>
            <li> This is a good dryer, especially for travel use.  The only complaint that I have is that it is heavy to hold after a while.</li>
            <li> Dead after 7 months of light use. Guarantee is for one year, but you have to pay to ship it back... AND include $6.50 to pay for the shipping back to you. RIP OFF!</li>
            <li> I have ordered 3 or 4 of these hair dryers in the last couple of years.  Seems they have an common problem of the fan blades breaking or the fan comes loose from the stem that holds it all together.  The reason I know this as I have disassembled the units after the noise developes and found the problems on all of them and it was the same.  The other problem is the cord that becomes twisted and then won&#x27;t retract properly without taking time and untwisting it.  Nice unit when it works, but none of them last over a year.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Now looking at different manufacturers and models.</li>
            <li> POWERFUL AND NOT EXPENSIVE, IT&#x27;S THE PERFECT SIZE,LOVE IT</li>
            <li> not 100% as powerful as my old hair dryer, but its so compact and gets the job done.  My hair feels a lot softer and not burnt, so the lower heat seems to be fine.  Ive only had it a month, so I cant say how long the cord retract works.  For $20, if it lasts a year its better than the competition.  I was looking at other hair dryers, and 10$ more, 20$ more-- didnt seem to be much of a difference.  Not until you go to $100+, and when your comparing a 100$ hair dryer to a 20$ one, the 20$ one is the hairdryer to go with.  Update: retractable cord doesn&#x27;t always fully retract. Still works fine. I would have liked an easier to clean one but this works. I use my shop vac to demolish the lint in the rear fan. For the price it&#x27;s still a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Amazing performance. Sleek design. Comfortable to handle. Convenient retractable cord and folding handle for storage. A perfect little dryer for a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers I have found for the money I spent.  I have pretty thick hair and this hair dryer does a great job of getting my hair dry FAST without making me feel like I&#x27;m scorching my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent investment if you&#x27;re like me: likes to dry her hair, doesn&#x27;t like to burn her head.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  It dries quickly, not real noisy, and the retractable cord is a great convenience in my tiny bathroom.</li>
            <li> I dropped my last full-sized ionic hair dryer in the toilet, so I have been using the Andis on a daily basis now.  It works just as well or better and leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny.  I highly recommend it, if for nothing other than the low price!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I received this for Christmas 2006 and it stopped working the beginning of April.  I really liked it but it just died.  I&#x27;m finding out that this is a common problem.  It would probably be best to spend a little more to get a better quality dryer than to replace this one a couple time a year.</li>
            <li> This dryer does a wonderful job of styling at the lowest temperature and speed, a feature I like very much.  I haven&#x27;t used it at any other setting.  The retractable cord is a welcome feature.  Feels solid in the hand.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more compact, for traveling. Just a little big but okay</li>
            <li> Had this product for several years and wore it out. Sure glad it was still available. Does the job better than most.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer, however the retractable cord doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.</li>
            <li> I purchase this dryer after trying one at a hotel. My husband said, we have got to get one of these \\&quot;Andis\\&quot;. I have very thick  long hair and found this to be a good dryer. I also have Carpel Tunnel and appreciate this is a light weight dryer compared to most. I will buy this product again and don&#x27;t expect that for a long time.</li>
            <li> I just used this blo-dryer at the JW Marriott in downtown LA and I LOVE it. I am buying one today. Normally I don&#x27;t just find products and fall in love like this, but as I was doing my hair I realized I don&#x27;t even have to use my straightener after to reduce the frizz that I usually get with my other blo-dryer. Great product. And such a bonus that it can be neatly put away.</li>
            <li> I like the fact this dryer is light which is great however it is very loud and I have to use earplugs because of the noise level.  It does a great job drying and styling hair.  I have used this dryer in hotels before but never have I experienced a dryer that is this loud.</li>
            <li> I wanted and purchased this one because of it is ceramic with a retractalbe.  However, the entire dryer is bulky and the retratable cord went down soon, which is very annoying....</li>
            <li> It dries my hair great.  Unfortunately, approximately one month after purchase, the retractable cord does not rewind all the way.  I have 3 and 1/2 inches of cord that no longer rewinds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this hair dryer. If I need to use the retractable cord feature, I manually wind the cord before storing but most of the time, I store without retracting the cord.</li>
            <li> Saw this blow dryer in a hotel, and had to have one. the retractable cord is nice and the size is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Ceramic ion drive and folding handle and retractable cord at half the cost of Conaire. Seems quieter and more flow too ...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife a year ago as a travel hair dryer. She loved it so much she started using it as her everyday hair dryer. We loved it so much that we bought a second one recently when another spare hair dryer we had in the guest room went bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;Compact.&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord&lt;br /&gt;Drys really well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The retractable function broke on the older one recently.  We don&#x27;t care though since we use that in the guest room. Only reason this thing got 4 vs 5 stars</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  I love it!!  It&#x27;s lightweight, has a retractable cord and folds.  Great for travel or storage!  I&#x27;m on my 2nd one and bought a 3rd to keep \\&quot;just in case\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece. It was to heavy for her. Returned it and am looking for a lighter one.</li>
            <li> I think this dryer is a great deal for the money, especially with the added features of the retractable cord, folding handle and multiple speed settings.  This was my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I was not disappointed.  There is a real difference from the old style dryers - namely the air coming out is not as hot yet it dries in about the same amount of time or less.  While I haven&#x27;t tried it yet during the humid summer months when my hair frizzes out, right now my hair is unbelievably smooth after drying.  I like to use this dryer with my Solia straightener which is also takes away every ounce of frizz.  Where were these amazing hair products when I was a teenager??</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s  a good little hair dryer.  It doesn&#x27;t blow as hot as my older dryers, but it dries my hair fast and with less sweating on my part!!  The retractable cord is kind of sluggish &amp; doesn&#x27;t retract all the way.  But it&#x27;s still an improvement over regular cords that were always getting tangled up with my curling iron cord. The folding handle definitely makes it easier to pack.  I&#x27;m not real sure if I notice much difference with frizz. Maybe a little better. The only negative comment I can make is that it&#x27;s very LOUD!</li>
            <li> Pros:   &lt;br /&gt;1. This blow dryer is great for the price.  Just don&#x27;t expect a $100+ ionic dryer.  You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple. &lt;br /&gt;2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a \\&quot;mid-size\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;1.  Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   &lt;br /&gt;2.  Very loud!  I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  It&#x27;s loud.  &lt;br /&gt;3.  The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: &lt;br /&gt;Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  No more than any other dryer.  It&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The second time I used the hair dryer, it stopped mid-drying and never worked again!  A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> A gift no feedback from recipient.</li>
            <li> I used this first in a hotel and thought it blew my hair dry faster.  Bought for home, still love but wish it was a little less bulky.  A little heavy and hard to blow the back with a round brush and hold onto at the same time.  But it drys quick and I still like.  Love the retractable plug.</li>
            <li> Dave&#x27;s wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sick of my old 1875w hairdryer&#x27;s cords always getting in the way in the cabinet so I ditched it for a folding model with a retractable cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People said this dryer was loud, but I didn&#x27;t find that to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well and I&#x27;m happy with it, just be aware that the cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way, it only retracts to a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, much better than what I had and it works great!</li>
            <li> I like the compact size and light weight of of this dryer. And my hair is noticeably smoother!&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that I thought there were more heat settings - the product description says 3 heat/air speeds. It is actually only 3 air speeds + a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> This is the only ceramic, ionic blow dryer with a retractable cord that I could find on the market and I am very pleased with it.  My fiance loves it because the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled or clutter up the bathroom counter.  I love it because it&#x27;s a great size and performs well-- drying hair very quickly.  The only reason I hesitated from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit heavy (because of the ceramic core, I suppose).  Lastly I think the product could be improved with a more ergonomic handle.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I thought it would be, but works greats.  I wish the cord sinched(?) in more, though.</li>
            <li> I love the retracting cord and that the handle folds so it&#x27;s more compact.  What I found to be misleading is that the description says that there are 3 heat settings and 3 speed settings.  The truth is that there are 3 total settings. When you select the slowest speed, you also get the lowest heat, medium speed gives you medium heat, and obviously the fastest speed also gives you the highest heat. I thought I would be able to &amp;#34;mix and match&amp;#34; speeds and heat settings, but that&#x27;s not possible.</li>
            <li> very good product &amp; priced right.</li>
            <li> Picked this out after using it in a hotel. I&#x27;ve had it in 3 or 4 hotels since then. It has a Medium speed which is rare, and the Cool setting, which I love. And it was reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was recommended to me by a coworker after I commented on how nice her hair looks. Sturdy construction, retractable cord, great price, and my hair looks much better with this blow dryer than others in the same price range.</li>
            <li> The product is really good, the hair becomes shine and soft. The only problem (which is a big one for me, since I have a lot of hair) is that it is heavier  than I exoected and I get really tired when I dry all my hair.</li>
            <li> Good looking and powerful foldable blow dryer! We like it when we use it at the hotel and ordered it here!</li>
            <li> I like the retractable cord the most and the folding handle.  The product has a nice drying speed and heat.</li>
            <li> She loves it. Folds and retractable cord keeps it from being the usual mess and bulk item with no lose in hair drying power</li>
            <li> This dryer is far bigger and heavier than a travel dryer should be. Plus, it&#x27;s no better than the crappy one at the gym.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. Since this is a travel, folding hair dryer it should be 110/220 dual voltage and it is NOT. For me it is a waste of money. It is also very bulky and extremely heavy. I&#x27;m ready to throw it out. UGH!!!</li>
            <li> I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn&#x27;t worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!</li>
            <li> We used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores so I ordered it from amazon.  After we got it my husband told me to order another one for a back up and I somehow made two orders.  I let my daughter use one and we still have one put up for a back up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a travel blow dryer that only blows &amp;#34;luke warm&amp;#34; air, then this is the one to get. But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won&#x27;t do it for you.</li>
            <li> Used this hairdryer in a hotel on vacation and loved it so much I had to order one for home as soon as I got back!  Doesn&#x27;t have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> We love this.  Fast drying. Retractable cord.  Got one just like we saw and liked in a hotel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t retract. Very cheaply made. I returned the prodcut.</li>
            <li> not powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li> First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it. My own hairdryer finally gave out so I had the opportunity to buy this, very happy with it. Retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one, and I feel like I have less frizz after drying my hair with this one, probably because it has the diffuser at the end. Even on the highest setting it&#x27;s not too hot.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer. That feature only worked marginally well for about four weeks and thereafter stopped working at all. If you are looking for a retractable cord to save space, don&#x27;t even consider this product. I have three operative dryers at home. This was to be for my motor home. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It broke the third time I used it piece of crap</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer earlier this year, when my old hairdryer conked out on me. Right away I was disappointed to see it didn&#x27;t have separate settings for temperature (cool, warm, hot) and air flow (low, medium, high). Instead there was just one setting that consisted of low, medium, and high. The high setting was warm at best. But, I did like the construction of it, so I decided to give it a try. The retractable cord was really tricky. That was another &amp;#34;Hmm...&amp;#34;. After a few weeks I started to get used to it. Then right after the return window closed, the retractable cord became more than tricky. It became impossible to retract. Then a few months later, the mechanism that allows you to fold the hairdryer in half, totally failed. So every time I would use it, it would be flopping around, if I didn&#x27;t hold it where it folds over. At this point, I was so incredibly frustrated I wanted to chuck it out the window. I was mad I spent the money on this P.O.S.! I had decided to try it because of all of the positive reviews on Amazon. (Ugh. Don&#x27;t you hate when you buy something because of all of the positive reviews and it turns out to be a piece of junk?!?) Anyways, a month or so after the folding mechanism failed, it started making a really weird sound like something was being chopped up inside of the hairdryer. It didn&#x27;t happen every time I used it, so I dealt with it, knowing it was time to go shopping for a new hairdryer already. Then one day I&#x27;m using it and it makes that godawful sound again. But this time it sounded worse, so I pulled it away from my head so I could take a look at the thing and the inside was starting to catch fire! I stopped it and unplugged it. Waited for it to cool off and threw it away. Goodbye, good riddance to the worst hairdryer I have ever had! PFFT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer for the money - quick drying time but it&#x27;s a bit heavy and kind of loud.  I bought it for travel but because of the weight, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that.  Home use is fine and it&#x27;s compact because of the retractable cord and folding handle.  I have another Andis dryer and believe Andis makes a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for at least five years and we&#x27;ve traveled extensively. I dropped it on the counter and broke the handle and decided I would try to find another. I am convinced it has helped control my thick, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you can get a ionic ceramic dryer with a high wattage that doesn&#x27;t burn your scalp, makes your hair look good , folds, retracts cord, and doesn&#x27;t cost $200, what is there to think about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s pretty loud but what dryer isn&#x27;t? No, it&#x27;s not a mini dryer but because it folds, it travels very well with the power you can&#x27;t get from most minis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line, I&#x27;m buying it again!</li>
            <li> In May 2008, I stayed at a nice hotel in Philly that had this hair dryer.  I used it, loved it, came home &amp; ordered it from Amazon.  The \\&quot;push to retract\\&quot; did not work 100%, but I did not expect it to (dumb idea).  Loved the dryer, did a great job on my hair.  A few weeks ago I was using it when suddenly the barrel got bright orange like it was on fire.  I turned the dryer off &amp; unplugged it.  Luckily I always have a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; hair dryer, so I dusted that off &amp; used it.  Plugged the Andis back in the next day, the switch was on \\&quot;off\\&quot;, yet the dryer was running at full speed.  Changing the switch setting did not make a difference, it continued to run at full speed.  I had to unplug it to get it to stop running.  Waited a few days, plugged it in, and it was fine.      Last week the barrel got bright orange like a flame thrower again and I had the same problem with it running on \\&quot;high\\&quot; even though the switch said \\&quot;off.\\&quot;      Needless to say, the hair dryer is now in the trash, and I&#x27;m on the hunt yet AGAIN for a hair dryer that gets hot enough to straighten my naturally curly hair, but doesn&#x27;t overheat itself or blow itself up.  It&#x27;s not rocket science.</li>
            <li> love everything about it</li>
            <li> I have had no problems and have used it for a week. Nice Airflow; and the retractable cord is easy to manage when I put it away.</li>
            <li> had one for a few years and bought another to replace it and put the other in the guest bedroom. its great and light and portable.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.  First saw at hotel in San Diego.  I had to have it.  Amazon had it the cheapest on the internet. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A couple of things to think about before buying this dryer. First, the cord is pretty short. It&#x27;s about 3 feet, and 1/3 of it does not retract (by design); so, about a foot of the cord hanging even when you are not using the dryer. Second, the there&#x27;s no temperature setting, and the temperature is very low. If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it. For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer. This dryer is now in the guess bathroom.</li>
            <li> Had it over a year, gets used about twice per week, for about 30 min a time. Retractable cord is nice and folding mechanism seems durable.  Pretty powerful little machine too. Bought it for light home use and travel so not sure how it would hold up with everyday use. Just the basics on this one, with one attachment for directed air flow. If your hair requires more, perhaps look elsewhere. If you need just a simple dryer to keep around, this is it.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great buy.  Talk about power...I love it.</li>
            <li> I like the folding handle; saves space.  Expected to be smaller but since it folds,&lt;br /&gt;The hairdryer is a good quality and dries my thick hair pretty fast and gives a&lt;br /&gt;silkier texture.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this hair dryer less than a year ago and it is already broken.  The retractable cord stopped fully retracting after about 4 months. After 11 months, the high and medium settings quit working and only low is still operational. I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I bought this for it compactness hoping it would be light for carrying to the gym. I returned this product because it was actually heavier compared to my regular size hair dryer. I don&#x27;t care about the size as much as the weight. It&#x27;s too heavy to lug into manhattan every day for the gym! I would not recommend this for gym use if you are looking to lighten up your gym bag.</li>
            <li> Fast drying with lots of shine - I was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5-star hotel I stayed at - it dries hair fast with lots of shine.</li>
            <li> We got this for a trip and it was great because it had a folding handle and retractable cord. Made packing super easy. It got real hot and I recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer.</li>
            <li> but it is not as compact as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to replace my huge hairdryer with something&lt;br /&gt;smaller and this ended up being the same size as the one I had.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s Ionic and supposed to not leave your hair frizzy but&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I got to try this while staying at a Grand Hyatt, but I wish I had used the Babyliss travel dryer I brought with me. The Andis is powerful and dried my hair quickly on the medium and low settings, but it left me with frizz all over. Won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> I like the retractable cord of this dryer the most, the dryer itself is very loud and heavy, everytime I dry my hair it feels and sounds like I&#x27;m running my vacuum cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;It does dry hair-but I&#x27;m not feeling the ionic part of the dryer, I had a different brand before that worked way better. At least this one dries decently. I am going to keep using it, but probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Baltimore, MD, and used this hair dryer. After the first day of using this hair dryer, I knew I had to have it.  Immediately I noticed no more frizzy hair.  I have very thin, fine, dull hair with no body at all.  I no longer have to use a curling iron or flat iron to give me body or control my frizzy hair.  The even better part is I now have tons of body.  No kidding.. I even have to spray my hair while holding it down because it has too much body.  I ordered this dryer the day I came back from Maryland, and I have been using it ever since. In fact, I just ordered my second one for back up.  I dont think I will ever be able to do my hair with out this hair dryer ever again!  I actually look forward to getting up in the morning and getting ready now.  Before I used to hate it.  Bye-Bye bad hair days!!!</li>
            <li> Good dryer for the money, I guess. I too has some trouble with the cord not fully retracting after a very short time owning it. Overall, it did what it was supposed to do, although I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference over the job the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; $10 dryers I used to buy from the drugstore, before they became such complicated and expensive things. This is starting to overheat and not dry properly after about 14 months of light (but daily)use. While I know small appliances aren&#x27;t made for long term use anymore, think I&#x27;ll go back to something much simplier to replace it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel. This is exactly what we were looking for. It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> After using this hair dryer at a Marriott on our way home, she just had to have one.  Compact, variable heat and blower settings, just what she wanted.  Fair price including the extra for shipping.  She&#x27;s quite pleased and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.  Even the retractable cord is neat.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!!!! Hair dries quicker and is so convenient to travel with!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hair dryer.  Handle folds as advertised and cord retract works.  Fits nicely into a travel bag.  Price performance is excellent and recommend as a good value worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This thing is still going almost a year later</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  It&#x27;s amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this at a hotel I was staying at and couldnt believe how much I liked it.  As soon as I got home, I got online and ordered it.  I have had MANY dryers before this, but this is the best and the best price.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have many fancy and expensive hair dryer but I fell in love with this one when I was staying in the ritz carlton hotel. I notice that it is foldable, drys fast, and not too hot--just everything i needed for a hair dryer. So I ordered this one from amazon and I have been using this for years, still works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this hair dryer! It&#x27;s light weight and works so well and the retracting cord is a nice bonus plus the dryer folds up nicely. The price is incredible too. A great buy! When this one gives out, if ever, I will buy another.</li>
            <li> I found this hair dryer to be much bigger then anticipated.  The cord does not retract completely and has to be pushed in by hand &lt;br /&gt;for the last few inches.  It is heavy and the handle is very bulky.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer was eight years old - it got very hot, but it still didn&#x27;t dry my hair very well, and I could smell burning hair when I used it.  I decided to try the ionic/ceramic technology to see if it would work better and be less damaging. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I no longer smell burning hair, but the speed at which my hair dries is only minimally faster.  My favorite part of this dryer is the design for compact storage - not only does the handle fold in, but the cord retracts - especiallly nice if you are constantly stuffing your dryer in a small drawer.</li>
            <li> this dryer is so much better than the two revlons i used before. it&#x27;s just a hair dryer - how much does quality really matter? well, this may not be the most powerful dryer on the market, but i highly recommend it because: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as frizzy and full of flyaways (though it&#x27;s been moist where i&#x27;m at). &lt;br /&gt;- the loudness doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears like my old ones. &lt;br /&gt;- the retractable cord is very handy since you should not leave your dryer plugged in. &lt;br /&gt;- it folds up for compact storage and possibly travel, though it&#x27;s larger than a true travel-sized dryer. &lt;br /&gt;- (this is the best part.) I used to have such problem with the back/motor part of my old dryer sucking in my hair that got tangled and finally burned out the motor, but this dryer does not suck my hair in!! i don&#x27;t have to yank my hair out, and no more burning smell!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;and the price is excellent. i hope your experience is as positive as mine.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. I tried it in on of hotels, liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment. Powerful, nice grip, light and not too noisy. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after using one at a Marriott hotel. Ordering online was great and I received the hair dryer within one week which was perfect since I was going on vacation and wanted to take it with me. I love the retractable cord and that the dryer folds in half. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, within two weeks of receiving it, and the night before I went away, the switch on the dryer stopped working properly. It only works in the low position. Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t bring it on vacation and have been so busy since returning, haven&#x27;t had a chance to follow up on it. Great idea, just wish it worked out better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this travel iron after my previous one burned up.  This one is compact and I love the retractable cord.  I have VERY thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer.  I bought my first one 4 years ago &amp; recently decided to buy another one as a back up.</li>
            <li> just like we use when we travel (Mariott uses these)</li>
            <li> We were staying in a hotel in DC. The hotel furnished an Andis dryer with retractable cord. I enjoyed using it so much so I ordered one as soon as we returned home. It came just a few days later. Im very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I usually do not believe negative reviews if there are many, many, many more positive reviews. However, I wish I had with this blowdryer. I almost never review items and when I do, they are positive. But this is a first. This is the worst product Ive ordered on Amazon. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. Literally the worst blowdryer. Isn&#x27;t it a travelling blowdryer? I took it to south america, a week after I&#x27;d bought it, and it overheated and shut off. Needed to wait to cool off. Now its been maybe 2 months? And it literally does not dry for more than 5 minutes because it over heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HORRIBLE blow dryer. Seriously, do not waste your money. It is the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. Get one at the pharmacy for $5 more and you will be better off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to get a new blowdryer....thanks....</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and I ask her if she liked it and she simply said she loved it. I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and the ther is it doesn&#x27;t make her hais as static as other blow dryers..</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Andis dryer broke within a day (different models). They make worst products. The back piece broke off and went inside of the dryer. Started making super loud noise and burning smell. Not even retractable.</li>
            <li> Dryer itself works well.  I like the 3 speeds but only use 2 of them.  The dryer is heavier than I expected and the retractable cord is a joke.  First of all, it does not retract all the way.  There is around 8\\&quot; of cord remaining after holding the button down to it&#x27;s fullest extent.  On top of that the retraction mechanisim stopped working after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  It folds and has a retractible cord.  It is easy to store and great for vacationing.  Oh, .. it also dries your hair fast!</li>
            <li> VERY HEAVY - seems to work well but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for travel.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer died after less than 6 months!  It works only on low now!  Don&#x27;t bother - spend a little more and get a much better quality for your money!</li>
            <li> not very small.  not very practical.  big in my suitcase.  brought it overseas and it was too much voltage for europe.  broke my adapter.  not sure if it worked after that, I let it go.</li>
            <li> First tried this item at a hotel. I received compliments on my hair. It also has a nice long cord.  I got one for myself and gave one as a give.</li>
            <li> Dryer is good but after only having it a short time the retractable cord does not work like it should it only retracts half way.</li>
            <li> great for the price. This is my 3rd dryer like this. The cord stops retracting over time but great dryer for the price</li>
            <li> On time and working well.</li>
            <li> I came across this hair dryer at a Hyatt hotel and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair) leaving it looking shinny.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  I&#x27;m no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter but it works great for us ... also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!</li>
            <li> Louder and much bigger than I thought. This is not compact. FYI</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. I have long hair with wave to it. This is the only dryer I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my hair puff out and get huge. I dry my hair in 5 minutes flat. That&#x27;s amazing! I love how it compacts for easy storage. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and gross. It&#x27;s as if I let it air dry. GREAT!</li>
            <li> Have had the Andis for about 6 months with daily use.  Bought it primarily  for the retractable cord feature.  Generally pleased with the dryer, but cord occasionally does not fully retract.  My fix is to unplug the dryer, fully extend the cord, and then let it retract keeping the cord from twisting...works for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like my last blow dryer, easy to store with retractable cord. It has a number of settings as well. Great buy! Got great rating from Good Morning America. (The reason I bought it).</li>
            <li> Saw this at first in a great hotel and ordered right when I got home.  love the wattage , the look,&lt;br /&gt;the compactness and easy storage!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this in a health club so I bought one. It is excellent although I can&#x27;t explain why.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product was horrible.  When you held it, you could feel how cheaply made it was.  I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I used this product in a hotel on vacation. I loved it so much, that is why I purchased this one. It is a fabulous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So far it is all that it promised works well, and is very compacted would I recommend it Yes.. very pleased...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and so far she likes it fine. The price was right and it is compact which she loves! I would recommend it for the price!</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these (one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place too). They pack well and are wonderful. Very convenient for travel, and dry my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Good blower. A little loud but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had, love the ease of cord retraction.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer - especially for the price.  Love the fold up handle and retracting cord.  I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for good quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer at a hotel and had to have one!  It&#x27;s light weight, retract cord and high powered.</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer at a hotel and loved it so much, I bought one for home. I have long hair and have found it to have good temperature and it leaves hair smooth. Also compact for storage.</li>
            <li> I love it. Dries fast, isn&#x27;t too loud, my hair looks great all day. The retractable cord is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Like it but not too much</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft. I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem. Must have been a fluke, but it was very easy to return!</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer for drying hair.  I&#x27;ll never own one again that does NOT have a retractable cord. This being said, this particular dryer&#x27;s cord only retracts &#x27;most&#x27; of the way, leaving a 6&amp;#34; tail and the plug hanging free to dangle and tangle. I was hoping for &amp;#34;FULLY RETRACTABLE&amp;#34;, which this is NOT.</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer--easy to carry and take with me on the go. Great so far. Really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome blow drier.  I&#x27;m going to buy it and give it to my girlfriends for gifts, you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality you get.  I first tried it in an upscale day spa in Chicago.  I had to call the place to find out the brand and model because that was the best hair day of my life to date.  Now my hair is shiny and frizz-free every day.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Love the idea and it worked for awhile.  The cord retractor started not working very well then quit altogether.  I bought as a travel piece since I travel with my job but if I can&#x27;t retract the cord then it is just the same as the one I have at home...bulky.  Tried to take it apart to fix the retractor and well...that wasn&#x27;t an easy task and I couldn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> I am on Amazon looking for a replacement after this device burned out completely...after less than two years use. First the cord retraction mechanism stopped working a year ago. Then the on/off switch stopped working six months ago. I had to use the breaker mechanism on the plug to turn it in and off. THEN...in the big fat middle of trip to visit friends it burned out completely. Needless to say Andis is NOT on my list of replacement brands. One more thing. I bought it thinking it would be handy for traveling. NO! It is big and heavy.</li>
            <li> The dryer works well. All settings are correct. I love the retractable cord. It is a bit heavy which is better than flimsy</li>
            <li> Easy to store and very affordable. Powerfull and small, takes up little room and out preforms much larger and cumbersome units.</li>
            <li> My wife needed a new hair dryer, so I did some online review checking. This one was at or very near the top. Good price, quick delivery. Would have given five stars if it were a bit smaller. Folding handle and retractable cord help.</li>
            <li> The air coming out of dryer is room temperature at best and the cord rewind does not work. The cord only rewinds part of the way.&lt;br /&gt;The only feature left to work is the folding handle.  That works fine.</li>
            <li> Best light weight powerful hair dryer i have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord, the compact size, and the power are awesome! So is the price! It just needs a proper nozzle!</li>
            <li> Extremely useful to have the retractable cable. I don&#x27;t really know anything about hair dryers but this works a lot better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I tried this blow dryer at a Hyatt hotel and loved it so much I ordered as soon as I finished blow drying my hair. When I looked the blow dryer up, I thought I was going to find out it was a $75 plus professional dryer. I was ecstatic to find out it was only $20! I would HIGLY recommend this blow dryer for this price point. Not too loud, dries hair quickly, relatively light weight to hold and like the cord retraction feature.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the retractable cord.  It is a powerful hair dryer but not too heavy.  I also purchased the Scalpmaster Hair Dryer Holder so I could keep it on my counter top.  I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I had owned and used this hair dryer for years and was very happy with it&#x27;s size and ease of use.  The reasonable price made the decision to buy the same model simple</li>
            <li> Its powerful, the cord retracts, and the handle folds... what more do I want? I mean I thought it was a little smaller. It&#x27;s pretty much the size of a standard blow dryer. It lives in my gym bag and gets thrown into my car every morning to go to the gym with me, then to work, then home, and then repeat. I&#x27;ve had it about 3 months now I think and it&#x27;s still working fine. The cord retracts really well, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is actually a little less frizzy with I use this blow dryer than my more expensive one at home (not substantially but just noticeable for me).</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair dryer at an upscale hotel in  Boston and took a photo of it with my phone to remember to research it. I am pleased with my purchase, it is lightweight and travels well.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer work exactly like it was described. All features work as expected. Comfortable to hold, not to loud and cord retracts just fine. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> While the handle folds down and the cord theoretically has spring loaded retraction into the handle, that&#x27;s all that makes this portable.  I have a full size hair dryer made by the same company, and they&#x27;re both very good quality hair dryers.  The heat is consistent and quick, and the air flow if good.  The only difference in settings between my full sized one and this one are that the full sized one has two switches, one to set speed and the other to set heat, while this only has the one switch.  There are 2 heat/speed settings on this which means that if you don&#x27;t want high heat you can&#x27;t use high speed and if you don&#x27;t want low speed you can&#x27;t get medium heat.  There is a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button that&#x27;s a completely separate trigger however, so you can set whatever speed you want if you don&#x27;t want heat and just hold the trigger the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For portability the main body of the head is like a slightly reduced version of their non-portable blow dryer.  That means it&#x27;s kind of bulky and round.  The handle folds, but doesn&#x27;t really fold down quite all the way or against the body, so while you won&#x27;t have an L-shaped thing in your luggage, you also don&#x27;t have a nice compact bathroom appliance.  The cord is also nearly a completely loss, the spring loaded retraction only pulls about half the cord in and you can&#x27;t even forcibly shove more than 3/4 of the cord into it.  This leaves the large wall plug and a significant length of cord, about enough to wrap around the body and handle 1.5 times.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is HUGE!  I was expecting a travel sized dryer.  This is not it.  It&#x27;s a full sized dryer that happens to fold and has a retractable cord.  If you want something for traveling, buy a different hair dryer!  I cannot say how well it worked since I returned it without using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Great Value. I love to retractable cord- folding aspects of this dryer. I put I&#x27;d away neatly in a drawer / out of sight .</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MULTIPLES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  I KEEP ONE IN EACH BATHROOM AND A SPARE IN THE LINEN CLOSET FOR REPLACEMENT USE!  VERY CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li> I love the folding handle &amp; retractable cord. Compact &amp; light. Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first Andis hair dryer I have ever tried.  My Conair folding hair dryer kept collapsing on me. I would say that I got my money&#x27;s worth out of a seven year old product.  On to the Andis hair dryer.  It has a good solid feel and heft. It does seem to give me a better drying experience.  I have fine, dry fly away hair.  When I use this dryer,  it makes my hair more manageable.  Only time will tell regarding the longevity of this product.  However,  it is starting out very well.  This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer was received right on schedule and it made my daughter very happy.  it does not weigh much and her arms do get tired.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small travel size hair dryer and when I received this one it is heavy and hard to use. It is a very good hair dryer but not what I expecting/</li>
            <li> Works well, I wish that it were quieter. The retractable cord component works great. Have had it for about a month and have never used a product from this brand before so I can&#x27;t speak for the long term dependability but so far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, if you wait, the best will come to you. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. My hair dries in a matter of seconds, no kidding ! However the retractable cord feature &amp;#34; does not work &amp;#34;. But that&#x27;s ok !  It is foldable. And I am glad I purchased the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875 Ceramic Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but it&#x27;s heavy and big.  Would prefer a hair dryer that weighed less and was smaller. It&#x27;s too big and heavy to take on trips (it takes up too much space in a carry on bag).</li>
            <li> This little dryer is really easy to take on the go.  It gets really hot, which is good for my incredibly thick hair, but it&#x27;s great to have the cooling button on it.  It is a loud little bugger however!  Anyway, it&#x27;s a good purchase.  I&#x27;ve used it several dozen times on trips in the States and in Europe and it&#x27;s served its purpose.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mom.  She specifically requested one with a retractable cord, because I&#x27;d bought her one before and she liked not having the cord strewn about.  She&#x27;s a former hairdresser, and has long been loyal to Conair dryers, but this one had great reviews.  Also, she is prone to frizzy hair, but does not use any type of hair product.  Also, as she&#x27;s getting older, I wanted one that wasn&#x27;t super heavy.  After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this and have it sent to her as a gift.  Over a month later, and she&#x27;s already told me twice how much she loves this blow dryer.  She says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever owned and would purchases it again, if/when this one wears out.  Based on mom&#x27;s raves, I&#x27;d say it sounds like a 5 star dryer!</li>
            <li> This manufacturer was familiar to me because I groom my dog with their fine clippers.  I had a Conair folding dryer for years, but the hinge became weak.  Not many folding full-size dryers out there.  This RC-2 is absolutely the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  The ionic business is no gimmick.  I have very fine blond hair and dryers usually leave it electrified, especially in cooler weather.  This new dryer dries my hair in about 1/3 the time it used to take, and it leaves my hair soft and laying down.. The retractable cord is a huge plus!  That&#x27;s an uncommon feature, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this one!</li>
            <li> Hard to find a hairdryer with a retractable cord, which prevents dealing with twisted cords.  Has plenty of air and heat and was an excellent price on Amazon.  Very sturdy construction, and we just saw the same hairdryer at a hotel.</li>
            <li> Like this hairdryer.  Folds compactly and the retractable cord is nice.  Also use the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button occasionally to blow cool air to hair when it get&#x27;s too hot.  The negative - it&#x27;s kinda loud.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is huge ... and not just huge for a &amp;#34;portable&amp;#34; ... I mean huge.  Now maybe it&#x27;s because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don&#x27;t worry much about suitcase space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn&#x27;t a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don&#x27;t whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife&#x27;s hair is wet?)  The &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I&#x27;m not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you&#x27;re in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don&#x27;t know if it tells you that in the manual but it&#x27;s always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li> The Handle is too big for me also heavy but I like folding handle ,retractable  code and affordable price! So I gotta  say it&#x27;s ok !</li>
            <li> After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  The included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast.  I loved this blow dryer so much, I bought my daughter one for her college dorm, and she loves it too.  Thank you Andis!</li>
            <li> I thought it should come with more separate low heat styling controls. The cord did not retract well into the base. Maybe should of been a little lighter in weight. still all in all worked well enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Is good but is not for travell is big i don like the size in the description said is for travel but this us not true</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these in 5 years, they fall apart one way or another. I will in no way buy a 4th.</li>
            <li> I tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home.  The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.</li>
            <li> Broke after 1 and 1/2 months. Just stopped in the middle of drying my hair. read other reviews also, seems like a good deal but not worth it if it breaks this quickly and easily!!</li>
            <li> I had used it once in a hotel.  I like it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one, and a big plus is it didn&#x27;t sound loudly as my old one.  Yes, it&#x27;s just as what I want.  Then I rushed online, and ordered it.  It&#x27;s been 4 months since, it&#x27;s still working good.  Love it.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this works OK for a while but everything seems to break eventually. I used this product lightly, however the cord retractor broke after the button fell off and now the power switch doesn&#x27;t operate properly so I have to unplug it to turn it off. Also, it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Small and convenient, however heat seems low and hairdryer is rather loud.</li>
            <li> The wife says to give this dryer 5 stars. She really likes it!</li>
            <li> I really liked the cord retractor and the ability to fold the handle for storage.  It also worked very well to dry hair.  However, it did not last nearly as long as it should have - only a few months before the cord stopping retracting and less than a year before it burnt up.</li>
            <li> This hair drying is great for travel. Perfect size!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer with 3 speeds, which is super hard to find!  (I have dry curly hair and really want a low speed and a medium speed.)  Also folds for travel and has removable concentrator attachment.</li>
            <li> I sent this hair dryer back because the cord didn&#x27;t retract all the way. Nice hair dryer &amp; good heat volume. It was also too big for a travel hair dryer which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dual voltage travel this is not the one. I&#x27;m not sure if it works well, I returned it because it wasn&#x27;t dual.</li>
            <li> Quality hair dryer still working years later.  Because of the rounded edges, it does not sit on a flat surface well and mine has fallen and gotten chipped over the years but it still works.</li>
            <li> Bigger than my old one but I like that the cord self-stores and it works fine on the dog.  :)</li>
            <li> I like this style of hair dryers. The cord does retract as it should but leaves a good 18 inches hanging. The dryer does not seem to blow very hot air compared to my previous dryer. The settings just seem to adjust the speed of the fan. I still manage to get my hair dry and perhaps the cooler temperature will prevent me from damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the 3 speeds. The retractable cord is so smooth and works well.</li>
            <li> I like the way it folds up, but the cord rarely retracts all the way without spending 5 minutes pulling it out and pressing the retract button and pushing it back into the handle. The blower itself works fine, but I bought it for the retractable cord, which is more a pain than a gain.</li>
            <li> Works great for its intended use, especially for how small it is!</li>
            <li> Great dryer 3 speeds slow cool button retractable cord and fold up for travel whats left to say ? oh yeah it&#x27;s 1999</li>
            <li> This was a requested item for my daughter for Christmas. I don&#x27;t use this so I can&#x27;t comment on them personally. I have not heard from her as to whether she doesn&#x27;t like this so that is a plus. Please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review. I&#x27;m always glad when I can shop on Amazon for anything it saves me time, gas, and delivery issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago, and used it 5 times before it stopped working completely.  Unfortunately the return window closed within a month, so I can&#x27;t even get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;Its not worth your money - keep looking for a better product!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a little heavier than the one I replaced; however, it drys quickly, not hot to the touch, and the retractable cord is nice even though it needs a little help retracting at times.  That said, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair that takes forever to  dry.  Used this dryer twice at the Hyatt and decided I had to have it.  I love it.  It speeds up my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Went on a trip to Key West and this hair dryer was in our Hotel room.  As soon as i returned from vacation, I ordered one and I love it!  I do especially like the THREE settings low, medium and high.  It is very lightweight.  Glad I saw it and was able to order one for myself.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriends dad for his birthday.  He loved it, the cord retracts great, and it works great.  Its not to big, and great to take with you on the go.  Plus it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a travel hairdryer.  This is the ONLY hairdryer that I could find that had the retractable cord.  That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  No buttons etc.  It does stay in place when using it.  Super duper drying power!&lt;br /&gt;Product Dimensions: 4.1 x 8.1 x 6.1 inches ; 1.6 pounds&lt;br /&gt;That said it is bigger and heavier than I wanted for travel but getting smaller like I have had in the past (and can&#x27;t find) didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  I am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design I would think.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, its a great dryer and the best I have found for travel and function.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Conair 1875 Ionic and this and this Andis is far superior to it. The volume of air his higher, the air velocity is higher, the hair dries quicker and better and at the end of the day the hair feels much smoother and silkier than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;A 4 star because it is difficult to position it in a space saving position on the counter. This does not apply in situations where the user hangs it by the provided loop.</li>
            <li> The concept of this hair dryer is great - retractable cord, folds for travel, ceramic technology, etc.  It works well when it works, however its only good for 6 months to a year.  I bought my first one in May 2012 and it blew up in Dec 2012.  Bought a replacement in Dec 2012 and this one just blew up in Jan 2014.  Blew up &#x3D; POP, fizzle, smoke.  I like the hair dryer, but there&#x27;s an obvious trend I&#x27;m not willing to risk anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** After reading some of the other reviews, I learned about the 5-year warranty.  I contacted Andis, and all I had to do was send in my Amazon receipt.  They sent out two new hairdryers within days.  I am happily using the hair dryer again and have a spare.  I upgraded from 3 to 4 stars based on the fantastic warranty and customer service.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom so it&#x27;s really great to have the cord just rewind inside teh blower .. good heat and good feel too</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size.  For years I have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country &amp; Caribbean.  I have really long, thick hair &amp; always dreaded using the cheaply hotel dryers because they took FOREVER to dry my hair. This one worked like a charm time &amp; time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I looked it up &amp; couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was. I ordered 1 for my house &amp; 2 for my beach house. Had them almost 2 years now &amp; they still work great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won&#x27;t retract sometimes, but the dryer is still powerful &amp; works like a charm!</li>
            <li> If you want to blow dry your hair quickly, this hair dryer is excellent.  Also compact and has a retractable cord.  I have had it now for several years and it is still working great.</li>
            <li> She loves it.  Particularly, she loves the cord retract.  We took it on our cruise and it worked quite nicely.  Dries hair quickly.  Sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer in an expensive hotel and had to buy one for home. Love retractable cord. Good power. Fits nicely in drawer since it folds.</li>
            <li> I USED ANOTHER BRAND FOR YEARS...AND I REPLACED THEM EVERY FEW MONTHS...NEVER HELD UP.  I HAVE LIMITED SPACE IN THE BATHROOM AND LOVE THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE STYLES FOR THAT REASON.  I DISCOVERED THIS ANDIS BRAND VERSION AT A HOTEL (FIVE STAR) AND SEARCHED IT OUT AND FOUND IT AT AMAZON.  I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH IT ... IT HAS ALREADY OUTLASTED THE CONAIR VERSIONS...ONLY REASON I DIDN&#x27;T GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS FOR A CERAMIC IONIC DRYER...IT LEAVES HAIR QUITE FRIZZY!  IF YOU NEED THE COMPACTEDNESS OF THIS DRYER....IT&#x27;S THE BEST ONE AROUND.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks since my purchase.  This dryer does well with drying quickly &amp; being relatively kind to your hair; powerful for its size.  Major complaint, which others have noted, is that the retractable cord (which I&#x27;ve only used for traveling), barely works with my helping it along.  Also, wish that this model came with dual voltage for international travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered two.  The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  I didn&#x27;t even try to plug in the second one.  It had features that I liked so I was sorry that it didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on &#x27;high&#x27; is about what you would get on &#x27;low.&#x27;  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using it in a Hotel in New York, it&#x27;s awesome, I have really thick hair and it&#x27;s not so hot that it fries my hair, yet it gets it&#x27;s thoroughly dry, I love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews. It periodically shut off until finally this week it stopped working completely. After only 4 months, a hair dryer should not stop working. Definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It was the best little hair dryer ever....loved it.  Unfortunately it just died on me...overheats.  Had it two and a half months.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing because when it worked it worked great!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I like the fact that it has three settings. The low is quite low and not noisy (compared to other hairdryers we had before).</li>
            <li> Great for travel, although a tad heavy, but works like a full size dryer.  I like the retractable cord, but it does take a bit of getting used to.  If you pull away when you are drying your hair, it will partly retract, but it just takes getting used to your surroundings and pulling it out far enough to start with.  No big deal.  I am very impressed with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great. We actually used this in a hotel and loved it so much we wrote down exactly what it was and ordered one for home. Very happy...and the price is great!</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!  I used one in a hotel while I was on vacation. I liked it so much I ordered one online. It gets good and hot to dry my hair, it&#x27;s very compact and the cord is retractable. Great features!!!</li>
            <li> I read reviews before purchasing the dryer. Some people complained the cord did not retract very well.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the dryer opened and the retractable cord works better. Also, after using it for several weeks&lt;br /&gt;the cord retracts better.</li>
            <li> Used this product at a Courtyard Marriott and was surprised to find it better than my home hair dryer.  I have thick hair. It usually took me a long time to dry my hair with my old dryer which was heavy, plus the cord got tangled, and the high heat, which I need, often got too hot.  This Ion hair dryer had NONE of those issues; so when I returned home I looked it up on the internet and was delighted to find it reasonably priced and bought it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and love it.</li>
            <li> Just wht I was looking for. Great product.</li>
            <li> The cord doesn&#x27;t retract extremely well sometimes but otherwise its been great.  Small size easy storage and does the job fairly well and with the 5 year warranty seems like a good buy.  Just keep the BOX for warranty.</li>
            <li> I like Andis hair dryers a lot.  This version has a retractable chord and a folding handle.  Great for my daughter&#x27;s college dorm room with limited space.  Great for travel.  I would give it 5 stars, but it has limited heated selection.  Wish it had a warm setting...instead of just the hot.  Other than that, it is a nice, powerful, convenient dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a good ceramic hair dryer for the money.  The retractable cord is a bonus.  Don&#x27;t expect a $20 dryer to last forever so treat it gently and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> We like this dryer a lot.  It&#x27;s a tad on the heavy side, but that&#x27;s fine for us.  There&#x27;s a button to retract the cord on the side of the dryer which works well.  The three power settings and &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button provide plenty of flexibility for power and heat.  It is only for 120V and would not be good for international travel.</li>
            <li> I had one for a year or two, but I dropped it.  So, I ordered the same one.  Pretty much perfect.  Note that the retractable cord didn&#x27;t work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  Really good dryer.</li>
            <li> We have 3 of these, one in each bathroom. They are great and hold up to moderate usage very good.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!! Very powerful and compact. Retractable cord is my favorite feature.</li>
            <li> My husband and I used this dryer at the Ritz-Carlton Naples!  We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. At home, I use a CHI that I have had for about ten years. It still works perfectly but it is a beast. I was tired of using crummy hotel dryers and even the hand dryers at the gym so I started looking for a compact model and this really fits the bill at a great price. Keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey CHI and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have had!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hairdryer. It gets very hot, works perfect and the retractable cord is a plus. The Hyatt hotels have recently gone through renovation and began storing these hairdryers in the room under their trademark name &amp;#34;Helen of Troy&amp;#34;. The price for this hairdryer is very reasonable. It also stores well as the cord is retractable and the body folds over. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was my first Ionic dryer, and it dried my hair very well and quickly (although I have short hair).  I only had two problems with it, but these were enough for me to return it:    --Its size when folded up is a bit too big for travel.  I fly frequently, and the space in my luggage is precious.  This took up about the same space as a pair of shoes.  --The cord did not retract smoothly or reliably.  I would often have to pull it out again in order to have it retract fully.    Good concept, but unfortunately it&#x27;s going back!</li>
            <li> This is a great portable hair dryer.  My hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers, but this one is really a good product.  I love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology, which I really need for my hair.  I can keep the frizzies out, and my hair dries quickly without drying out.  Blow drying is so much easier.  I am really picky about blow dryers and my hair, so I am not being frivolous here.  This dryer is a keeper! So convenient for travel!</li>
            <li> Great dryer.  Love the retractable cord and the power of the dryer.  A bit bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> After only 2-3 times of using the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord, the retractable cord no longer retracts on it&#x27;s own.  I must push in the handle manually, while pushing in the button on the body in order to get to retract.    This is not a light-weight blow dryer.  So if you are looking for a small one to tuck in the overnight bag, think again.  Besides the weight, it is full size in length as well, which just happens to fold.    It seems to dry just fine, however I never dry on the high speed... just too loud.  So I normally use the low speed, which is plenty fast for my short hairdo.      The price was fine and it arrived timely; just as it appeared in the photo shown on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li> Good value, strong air flow , and enough heat for a fast dry.</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer for the money!!! Works well on low setting too, and  folds nicely for travel. Love the cord goes inside.</li>
            <li> Great size, not too heavy. I use on high which dries my hair just as fast as my regular hair dryer at home and the cold shot works great.</li>
            <li> This dryer worked well when I got it, but it didn&#x27;t last. I was very disappointed with it, especially for this price.</li>
            <li> This item is very great for its price. I would recommend others to buy it if they&#x27;re looking for a hair dryer for less money. It also came in time, maybe in 5 days. Normally, 3-5 days delivery is great for me.</li>
            <li> This dryer is to heavy to be a travel dryer, and to big. When you travel, you don&#x27;t want a lot of weight.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  Tons of power and comfortable to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord is also a nice touch</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I used this dryer when I stayed at the Hyatt and decided to order one for myself</li>
            <li> I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently and it is still working great. I love the way the cord retracts and how the unit folds. It is great for travel but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend&#x27;s house since it works so well. My hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full-sized hair dryer that I keep at home.</li>
            <li> and does its job good. I would surely recommend this if you are looking for a daily use Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> I used to always buy expensive dryers that ended up not being powerful enough / produced boiling lava hot air that damaged my hair unless I held down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button almost the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;At a hotel, I used this blow dryer and was amazed at how powerful it was. My hair was completely dry in under 10 minutes, and the air was not painfully hot. This fabulous little dryer is also a great size for travel, or simply taking up less space in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Ditch the fancy dryers and go for this one. I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, but I am confident it will last long enough to fulfill it&#x27;s mere $20 price tag.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months. Cord still retracts and dries my thick hair fast with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> This is the best travel dryer I have used, and I have bought many. Only negative - it isn&#x27;t dual voltage so it won&#x27;t work in countries with 240 volt wiring.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not quiet but the noise is so much more tolerable compared to some dryers that has whistling noise or just super loud.  I love that it is foldable and retractable - makes it easier for storage and for traveling.</li>
            <li> I returned it. It is good just too big. I noticed hotels have it mounted on the walls I just needed a smaller item myself.</li>
            <li> I used one of these at a Marriott once, and thought it was a great little dryer. It folds up nicely and works great for my daily use at home. Temperature and blowing options are perfect for me. I literally have no complaints, especially for a $20 product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to buy expensive haircare products but after a stay at a hotel, I fell in love with the blow dryer in the rooms.  I wrote down the brand and model and set out to find one when I got home.  Amazon was the only place that was still selling this model.  I almost bought 2 in case they go out of production but I guess I&#x27;ll just use this one and hope it lasts forever, lol.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Doesn&#x27;t cause too much frizz.  Love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because it is fast, not too hot and saves me time.</li>
            <li> ***DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY** I used this blow dryer at a hotel, and fell in love with it..  I loved it so much, I decided to order one of my own.. This blow dryer was working fine for about 2 months. Then I noticed it started fading out.. Needless to say, after about 4 months, the dryer has completed died.. So I had to revert back to the blow dryer I&#x27;ve have for about two years.. Which by the way, still works.. ***BUYERS BE WARE, THIS DRYER DOES NOT LAST LONG*****</li>
            <li> Best Hair Dryer -- I know have two, one for home and one for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for about six months and it&#x27;s goes off and on while I&#x27;m using it. Then today after the dryer had been off for over an hour it started humming as if it were &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; on. Can&#x27;t return because it doesn&#x27;t fall withing amazons return time!!! NOT NOT NOT HAPPY... DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I travel for work a lot and many of the hotels where I stay provide the Andis Ionic ceramic hair dryer in the rooms.  Really like the results so I decided to order one for home.  Light weight, not too loud and easy on the hair.  For the price, I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> They dry works ok for the price. Really loud though</li>
            <li> This replace an earlier model that has stood up well over many years, but finally quit.</li>
            <li> I used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much I came home and ordered one.  It works so much faster than my older one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer to replace one that I had owned for 13 years.  It is so worth it to spend a little more for ceramic technology.  My hair is so much smoother after drying it!!  I can almost blow dry and go now, my hair is so calm.  The retractable cord can be a little finicky at times, but is still better than having to wrap it each time.  I like the folding handle as well - takes up less space under the cabinet.  This is a great dryer for the $$!!</li>
            <li> It dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud. Also there are 2 speeds but heat isn&#x27;t adjustable--lower speed means less heat.</li>
            <li> Used one at a Ritz and was impressed so we use them at home now. I like the cord retraction. I hate twisted cords and the trouble they cause when you try to pull a hairdryer out of a drawer. Plenty powerful enough. Keep the filter at the back vacuumed from time to time and the air volume will stay very high. They don&#x27;t have a temperature setting though. You can press a trigger to disconnect the heater while the air is blowing. That works fine for me but if you don&#x27;t like pulling the trigger when your head gets hot, you might be disappointed in that. Otherwise, I think this beats everything else out there for the price.</li>
            <li> I had use one many times in Hotels, when I found out I could order one,I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;I love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great, I am glad I buy two.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer will take the abuse of flying 20&#x27; through the air and smashing me in the head! Very durable and she likes the retracting cord!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very long.</li>
            <li> Works well.  A little noisier than most though but otherwise has good power.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer. Works in half the time as a standard dryer and my hair is not as frizzy. Fits nice in the vanity drawer and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Great power and portability! Size is not too small or too large.  I would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife used this hair dryer at the Heathman Hotel in Portland and had to buy them for our VRBO  in Bend Or. Our VRBO 304450 incase you want to try the hair dryers!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer because it was the one in a recent hotel stay. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot but has a lot of power which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I Love the retractable cord feature, except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase.  I guess I will do it the old fashioned way and wrap the cord :(</li>
            <li> The settings are either too low or too hard. Wish it had option on temperature.  It&#x27;s warm but sometimes like a hotter one. It does leave your hair softer but for me thA means its harder to manage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for travel. As in, only occasional use. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year but have only actually used it a handful of times. This weekend I brought it on a trip. I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again. Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died. What a pile of crap. Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair dryer after trying it at a hotel.  I immediately noticed a difference in my hair not being as frizzie or \\&quot;fly away.\\&quot;  I had no idea that an ionic, ceramic hair dryer could make that much difference!  It&#x27;s a pretty large and heavy dryer, so I really like the retractable cord and the folding handle for travel and storage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this hair dyer at a Hyatt and Ritz Carlton in the past, but never tried to order one for my home. They always worked great in the hotel. I needed to buy a new hair dryer for my spare bathroom for guests coming into town over Christmas. I used it myself again for 2 weeks and loved it so much that I ordered 2 more. My husband even said it was a great buy. I only buy ionic hair dryers, as they make your hair really smooth. The dryer works really well, and I love the retractable cord. I love the size, the color, and the foldability. I bought a T3 hair dryer over a year ago, and it broke after about 15 uses (it made a funny sound and stopped working without being damaged), so I will never spend that much money on a hair dryer again (I was able to get my money refunded). I highly recommend this hair dryer. This will be the best $20 you&#x27;ve spent in a long time; plus, I was able to get free shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them!  This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost.  While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase.  But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord.  Too bad the quality is so poor.  STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  There are too many reviews like this one.</li>
            <li> After using this hair dryer model in a hotel and being very pleased with it, I found it on Amazon and bought one for myself.  I was very happy with it up until it just stopped working after only 8 months of use.  I took very good care of the hair dryer:  I did not use the retractable cord feature (I figured it would break if I retracted it everyday) and I rarely folded it.  I thought it was odd that you cannot remove the filter cover and easily clean it so I don&#x27;t know if that contributed to its short lifespan.  I tried to brush out the lint buildup on the filter but that doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Other hair dryers I&#x27;ve had normally last for at least 18-24 months.  This hair dryer all of a sudden just wouldn&#x27;t come on one day.  There was no burning smell or popping sound which usually happens when a hair dryer is about to die.  I saved the original packaging and it says there is a 60 month warranty but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost of shipping it back to the company since I don&#x27;t know if they will actually send me a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/24/13: I wanted to pass along some positive feedback about Andis, the seller.  I returned the broken hair dryer and received a new replacement hair dryer exactly one week later. I was pleasantly surprised to get a new one that quickly. I shipped it back via the USPS for $7.48 so I thought it was worthwhile making the return.</li>
            <li> Had for less than a month before it died.  Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that....just it&#x27;s compact size and retractable cord.  It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this dryer when in a hotel in SLC Utah, while traveling on business. I have really thick hair and it takes quite a while to dry. I didn&#x27;t pack my own dyer as it&#x27;s large and bulky, and had to use the hotel dryer. Usually these don&#x27;t work as well as my own, but this one literally cut my drying time in half, leaving my hair soft and shiny! I LOVED it. I took a picture of it with my phone to remind myself to look it up when I got home. I assumed it would be expensive, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for only $20. I absolutely love this blow dryer - it&#x27;s compact, powerful and the folding handle/retractable cord are great little features that make it ideal for traveling. I have recommended it to friends and will continue to!</li>
            <li> I bought this to take with me when I travel as the one I had used before did not have the Ionic thing.  I had not even tried it out for myself when my grandson took it and uses it every day.  He raves about it, so I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight hairdryer.  Use this one over my old one all the time now even though I specifically bought it for travel.  Like the feel of it in my hand, and puts out less heat than my other one.  I recommend this dryer.  Does a great job on my short, thick hair and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair dryer while on a vacation with my husband. It was a high end hotel that we stayed in. I was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional. The retractable cord is a bonus. It&#x27;s not the quietest hair dryer but, it isn&#x27;t obnoxious, either. You gotta expect some noise with that much power. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer for traving. it fold up small and the cord retracts into the dryer at the push of a button. It drys my long, thick hair in record time. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a beautiful, luxury hotel in Newport, RI. and it was love for my naturally thick, somewhat frizzy hair.  It came out straight and smooth and oh so shiny.  I knew I wanted one.  Told the BF how much I loved it and he ended up going to the hotel on one of his next trips and they sold him a new one from housekeeping right from the hotel.  That was almost two years ago and it&#x27;s still &#x27;all that&#x27; in my book.  Retractable cord still retracts like a champ.  My hair dries nicely, easily, no fuss.  The weight seems fine to me.  I&#x27;ve had high end $200 hair dryers and have no recollection of them being even remotely better than this little baby.  For the price, this is a steal.</li>
            <li> I love the folding handle and retractable cord. It drys your hair fast too. I wish the dryer itself was a little more portable for travel but it is still very nice!</li>
            <li> This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  If you are looking for a great, no-nonsense chord at a nice price, then get this one.</li>
            <li> I got this for traveling.  It&#x27;s smaller than my other hair dryer AND it folds, but has the same output.. Only much louder.  Just know that this is a pretty loud blow dryer.  Great for my purpose and works very well.</li>
            <li> The retracting cable feature stopped working on me after a year. The dryer still works great after every day use.</li>
            <li> Broke within a few weeks from date of purchase. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It is quite larger and heavier than I anticipated. I know that the cord retracts into the handle but if the handle were a little narrower, it would make gripping it easier for someone with smallish hands like myself.  Other than that it is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer seems perfectly good. It&#x27;s heavier than the comparable Sharper Image model, so I find it less useful for travel than that one.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage. It&#x27;s powerful and drys my hair quickly without &amp;#34;frying&amp;#34; it. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive models (both Andis models and other manufacturers) but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and its compact!!</li>
            <li> Retractable cord broke in 2 weeks, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Using this to dry my hair after swimming at lunch.  Works well.  The cord is very short, but considering I&#x27;m standing in a very wet locker room I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> Love this !!! Exactly what I was needing and wanting ! It&#x27;s fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel</li>
            <li> A little noisy, not like my previous pro dryer, but it drys my hair. The little air diffuser doesn&#x27;t stay on which really burns me as I have to keep picking up and putting on.....there&#x27;s nothing to keep it connected. Dumb construction.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hair Dryer. I liked it so much I bought another one for traveling. Great Value!</li>
            <li> Works better than the large one I have and is so small</li>
            <li> Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally so I deduced that it is dual voltage). Amazon shipped this item to Singapore (220volts). Once I tried it on, it fried my adaptor plug, and the hairdyer stopped working too after 2 seconds. Such a dissapointment!</li>
            <li> Used one in a Marriott hotel and loved it. Took a picture of it and a year later, when my old one stopped working, I immediately looked this one up. It has great power (or not). It fits in my small hand with the cool, blast button in the right place. It folds up easily and is compact on my bathroom counter. Aim, blow, cool blast and I&#x27;ve got my poof, just where I want it! Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this Hair Dryer!</li>
            <li> second unit and really like the quality and service</li>
            <li> Use it daily, works great and I can bring it anywhere with me!</li>
            <li> Overall - I think this is a great hair dryer. Despite having a foldable handle and retractable cord, the hair dryer is built very well and doesn&#x27;t feel as cheap as many $20 portable hair dryers. It&#x27;s not too loud, either, which I like, and the ions actually make my hair feel so much smoother afterwards, which is awesome. My only issue is that the retractable cord is a little touchy at times - I always make sure to keep it straight when retracting, but the cord still occasionally has issues retracting all the way in. Outside of that, I&#x27;m looking forwards to using this product for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> My mother and I wanted to buy these after having used them in a really nice hotel in Boulder, Colorado. We loved this product because of the retractable cord, the fold-able nozzle, the compact size and the strength of the airflow. We had an issue with my moms hairdryer, it sounded like there was a broken piece inside. We sent it back and got a new one from this buyer promptly and the replacement was great! I have really enjoyed this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer, but it&#x27;s just not well suited for a man&#x27;s use - especially in the gym.  I had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months.  It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  It&#x27;s also much heavier than I expected it to be.  I decided to go with a model with a comb and brush attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution concerning the folding handle on this unit.  The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle and it pinched the heck out of me.  I still have a sore spot on my finger a week later.  Be careful when opening.</li>
            <li> Due to the folding handle, retractable cord, the fact that it is ionic, as well as all of the raving reviews, I thought I would love this blow dryer.  It looks nice, the handle opens and folds easily, the retractable cord works well. Sounds great, huh? Unfortunately, it leaves my straight, normally shiny hair looking dry and frizzy, unlike my previous two Revlon ionic blow dryers. If I had not removed the tags from the cord, I would absolutely return it. Now I have a new blow dryer that I won&#x27;t be using, normally</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t write reviews (can&#x27;t seem to find the time), but it took me so long to finally find a hair dryer that I like that I wanted to put this up in case it helps someone else.  This is the best hair dryer I have ever had.  It isn&#x27;t the lightest, but it dries my long hair so quickly, that my hand doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it.  I have had it for under 6 months, but I am buying a second one to keep in my suitcase.  My cord still retracts, but it does need &amp;#34;coaxing.&amp;#34;  But I didn&#x27;t buy it for the retracting cord feature, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me.  My hair is smooth and dry in very short order with this dryer, so I highly recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I just got back from vacation and this was the dryer in the hotel room... it was AMAZING!  I have unruly wavy hair and this dryer worked faster and better than mine at home (that incidentally cost 3x as much).  Even my BF noticed that my hair was straighter than I usually get it (and I didn&#x27;t even use a flatiron!), and that is with 90 degree heat and humidity too.  I&#x27;m considering purchasing the professional model because I was so impressed by this one (and more moving parts usually equals more likely to break).  Some other reviews have mentioned that the dryer is heavy- I only used it a few times but it was honestly not something I noticed and given that it took half the time to dry my hair, even with the humidity, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fair trade.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer, although heavy. Cord was no longer retractable after only 2 mos. of use. Disappointing to say the least as that was one of the reasons I chose this dryer in particular. Drat!</li>
            <li> When it was fairly new the hair dryer switch refused to go the the high position.  Unfortunately, since I purchased it as a Christmas gift for a family member long before Christmas, I was not able to return it to Amazon so I had to pay almost the cost of the hair dryer in shipping fees to return it to the manufacturer.  I just received the warranty replacement unit.  The hair dryer performs great, but the switch failure was annoying.</li>
            <li> Quite noisy compared to others we have had. Retraction cord has to be jiggled in order to retract.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is wonderful.  The air power is good and it does a nice job drying your hair.  As mentioned by others, it is heavy.  The handle is also clumsy to hold, especially for someone with small hands.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My main objection is that it is much too loud and for that reason alone I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I came across this hairdryer when I stayed at a hotel.  I fell in love with it after my first use.  I found my hair was silky and smooth like I had used a serum and best of all, my hair dried so quickly.  I really like the fact that it has a retractable cord and it folds up...really cool!  I am very impressed with Andis.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS HAIRDRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A HYATT HOTEL IN DENVER COLORADO, AND THE RESULTS WERE UNBELIEVABLE!!  THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BLOW DRY MY LONG HAIR WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES !MY HAIR WAS SO FULL OF BODY AND SHINY--I DIDN&#x27;T CARE WHAT THE PRICE WAS TO GET ONE (AND FIGURING THE HYATT USED IT, I WAS READY FOR STICKER SHOCK!) I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I FOUND IT ON AMAZON FOR $19.00. IT IS SO WORTH EVERY DOLLAR--I HAVE TOLD AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE (AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I&#x27;M CRAZY!)THE ADDED BONUS IS THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE--I HAVE HIT THE LOTTERY!</li>
            <li> The product arrived and it is fine  We replaced an old one that broke when it was dropped.  We like the new unit fine.</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about six months and I love it. Easy to use, and I love the &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> long cord that easily retracts without whipping into things or your face. Perfect for travel, although slightly bigger than some of the mini blowdryers it stays compact because of the retractably cord and folding handle, and you get all the power of a standard blow dryer and ionic technology</li>
            <li> If you dont have space for a regular one, this is great. I thought it was going to be smaller, for travel, but it is ok. Havent tried it yet because I only dry my hair in winter</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  It is kind to my thinning hair (I&#x27;m 65+) and easy to handle.  I love the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I had a hair dryer with a retractable cord back in the mid 80s and I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement to love as much as I loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service. This is an excellent hair dryer that gives a good flow of air. I don&#x27;t like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn&#x27;t get so hot that I feel like it&#x27;s trying to bake my hair rather than dry it. The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying. It has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good-sized grip. My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn&#x27;t induce that unpleasant state. I had high expectations for the Andis RC-2 Ionic1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely buy it again! The highest speed is great! Even though I have short hair I&#x27;m sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just as described.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product was misrepresented since it was listed in the travel dryers.  It is the size of any \\&quot;large\\&quot; dryer and I needed a dryer for traveling that was compact to fit into a small case. It had all the requirements I wanted except way too large.  I have two large ones already.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;IT WAS NOT COMPACT\\&quot;  That was my only complaint.  I sent it back of course.</li>
            <li> I used one of these at the Marriot, and I loved it so much that I had to have one!  Love the power that it has and the folding handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer after trying it at a hotel we stayed at.  Love the way it folds up and is easy to transport and store. Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Loved it!!  Found this product in a hotel in Florida and when I returned home I had to have it. Looked first at a couple local retailers but did not find it. Did a quick search online and found it through Amazon, bought it right away and have been using it everyday since. Great product and will order another one if something happens to this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer because when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, they stocked one in the room and I really liked it - so when I got home I ordered one for myself.  In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  I would wait several minutes to see if it would work again, but it didn&#x27;t until I kept blowing on it.  Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  I was going to blow on it, but decided I didn&#x27;t want to risk it blowing up in my hand.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t get too hot but dries it quickly. My hair has body and shine and looks healthy. The retractable cord is great. Sometimes you have to untwist the cord for it to retract smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I have 1 at home and 1 at the cabin and mine have all lasted for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Great dryer at a great price.</li>
            <li> Worked great until it didn&#x27;t... I liked the retractable cord for ease of storage, but was disappointed that one morning (without any warning signs) it just didn&#x27;t work! I blow dry 3-4 x wk for just a couple of minutes each time (I have really thin hair), so this hairdryer was not \\&quot;overworked\\&quot;... Compared to my past dryer that lasted 10 yrs, I&#x27;d say this one was not the best quality, but it&#x27;s also not super expensive, so the buyer will have to weigh the cost vs. the quality...</li>
            <li> Nice quality.  Power cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way but enough for my needs.  I may just need to work with it more to fix that.</li>
            <li> Three stars for the price and relatively quiet ionic technology.  This dryer fell short of expectation as the cord barely retracted from the get go.  It is a third bigger than my current ionic hair dryer (different brand).  I bought two of these but returned both because the cord did not work and the size was too big for me.  Amazon made ordering and returning a positive customer experience.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer seemed great at first, but it just stopped working after about 6 months.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I tried this blow dryer at a hotel and loved it. I ordered it when I got home and was not disappointed. This blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently!</li>
            <li> I was able to \\&quot;test drive\\&quot; this hair dryer at La bellaserra hotel in Paso Robles.  It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  Leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time!</li>
            <li> It lasted a little over a year and a half, which is decent for the $20 I paid. The fan runs, but the housing has separated where the silver part and black part meet, leaving a crack that allows strands of hair to be sucked into the fan/heater assembly. I&#x27;m looking for something a little more durable, even if it ends up costing a bit more. It does reduce frizz! Travels well domestically within the US, but is not a dual-voltage dryer.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works and is easily portable.&lt;br /&gt;It been taken to many places since I bought it&lt;br /&gt;and my wife - who is fussy about stuff like this -&lt;br /&gt;adores it!</li>
            <li> Like others that have reviewed, I had used this hair dryer at the Cosmpolitan Hotel in Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;Took a photo with my phone so I could order one when I got home.&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of hair and it does a great job and has the benefit&lt;br /&gt;of folding and retractable cord.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer bc I was looking for a compact dryer with a retractable cord and handle. This is exactly what I wanted. The grip is matte so it gives a nice grip, it folds to make the dryer smaller. The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer very convenient to use in my small bathroom or if I&#x27;m traveling. The settings are also good - 3 varieties that dry my hair quickly. The dryer is not very loud either, it&#x27;s a reasonable noise level.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer! It&#x27;s the most user friendly dryer I have ever used. It is well made &amp; dries hair very nicely, without burning it. I love the retractable cord. The blow dryer folds shut so it&#x27;s easier to store.  Cant believe I found such a great affordable blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Hair dry is not worth the money....mine has quit working after only a year, using it maybe 2 or 3 times a week. The hairdryer does not turn off unless unplugged and when it is on it only lasts about 10 seconds then turns off.  Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Was a gift. They loved it.</li>
            <li> We have a home full of blow dryers, every bathroom has one and we keep our travel bags stocked with them as well.  This one performs as well as any of the other low cost models we&#x27;ve owned but it died 8 months into our use.</li>
            <li> Great price for so much power. The retractable cord is a helpful feature. Easily straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> retractable cord doesn&#x27;t always retract but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that. &lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the way it dries my hair.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever purchased!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this dryer; it is light, strong, and the retractable cord works much better than the last one I had. It is also not overly bulky. I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Got one for my brother for his birthday also!  Two for the price of one on Amazon!!    We are amazed and awed with the improvement in texture and shine of our hair.  IT travels GREAT also!    Thanks Andis for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> We used this hair dryer in the hotel in New Mexico and fell in love with it! Retractable cord and it folds, even though it is full size and full power. There is also a hook for easy storage all around. 3 speed settings and the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button make this the best hair dryer we&#x27;ve ever used.  Great price here on Amazon as well!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this hair dryer.  I have a small bathroom and the fact that folds and has a retractable cord makes it easy to store in a small space.  The hair dryer itself is lightweight yet delivers a powerful performance.  Well worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> VERY nice dryer. Larger sized travel. Nice power &amp; doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair like my old dryer did. Happier with a full-sized travel than the compact ones... dries hair faster &amp; without the frizz!</li>
            <li> This dryer&#x27;s retractable cord is wonderful for keeping clutter out of the bathroom or wherever you store your dryer when not in use. The heat settings are high-medium-low, plus there&#x27;s a cool button for a shot of cool air when you&#x27;re styling.  But what I like best is the low setting which is fantastic for my fine hair.  It&#x27;s warm enough to dry the hair but minimizes the stress and damage that the heat of most dryers inflicts.  Word to the wise to prolong the life of the cord, it&#x27;s easy enough to quide it gently with the other hand when you press the retract button - keeps it from snaping back.  Overall an excellent choice for an all-purpose dryer and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Found this dryer to be very heavy and completely stopped working after 30 days. Amazon was nice enough to replace the dryer at no charge, just after the return policy expired.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord stopped retracting after the first use so I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right. But it&#x27;s powerful and I like that it folds in half. So now I just wrap the cord around it. But I wish it still retracted. :(</li>
            <li> Works great, cord retracts as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer because I wanted a compact, easily portable dryer for travel &amp; the idea of a retractable cord was appealing.  It is NOT compact.  In fact, it&#x27;s quite large &amp;  I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough.  It isn&#x27;t ergonomic &amp; it&#x27;s heavy.  I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer &amp;  I am thrilled with it.  I have shoulder-length fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good hairdryer for travel and okay for every day it&#x27;s not the best driver I&#x27;ve ever used but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is powerful and leaves hair feeling smooth.  I would highly recommend it.  I order several for my daughters, too.</li>
            <li> The plug broke after one month.  Now I have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on, then it keeps turning off.  An electrician checked the electrical circuit, which is OK. It is definitely the plug on the hair dryer.  If I move it around in the outlet, the hair dryer will turn on and off and on...  It was a Christmas present I bought it early December, so now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy this hair dryer!!!!  Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Best hotel dryer I have ever used ( I travel a lot ), so I purchased one for myself.  Love it!  I have had no problems in the year+ that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer.  A family member had one and I liked the airflow.  I went online and ordered immediately... paid half what she paid through retail store.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer for an upcoming trip and wanted something compact yet efficient.  After several uses, the cord stopped retracting all the way, and instead, only goes in about 2/3 of the total length.  I expected this to happen eventually although I was hoping that it would be later rather than sooner.  So now I have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord, leaving about 1/3 hanging out.  Other than the cord retraction issue, it is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> This is the best, fastest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. Unbelievable. Used it in a Marriott a month ago, ordered on-line and I&#x27;m thrilled. No comparison to any other hand hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It&#x27;s a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Retractable cord works great. Blowing power is great. Light and easy to store. Bought it for our new camper.</li>
            <li> Great dryer, dries hair very fast &amp; retractable cord is perfect! I only wish it was a little more quiet...</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great.  My first purchase broke after just two weeks, the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off.  My replacement however has been fine.  Drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky.  It is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does a very fine job of dryng my hair. However, I am not sure I have ever had a hand held dryer which did not. The reason I purchased this dryer was for its retractability. This feature worked great for about a month. Now, I cannot seem to get it to completely retract - maybe 5 inches at most. It is too bad I really liked the idea.</li>
            <li> Since we moved south, we have had many guests.  Finally, we decided to just &amp;#34;outfit&amp;#34; the guest bathroom.  All of our friends who use this hair dryer comment about how nice it is.  Apparently, it&#x27;s a hit!</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law asked for this hairdryer for Christmas. Very handy for all the travel she does. She is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I selected this hair dryer after using the same one at a Hyatt. I like the way it folds up quite small, the cord retracts well and it feels sturdy. I have long, thick, wavy hair and this dryer works pretty quickly to flatten it out and make it smooth. The air blows out very forcefully, but doesn&#x27;t seem to feel too &amp;#34;burney.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!</li>
            <li> All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  I love the retractable cord and it&#x27;s small, sleek size.  Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  My husband loves the sleek design and the compactability.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  I was so impressed with it that I had to have one of my own.</li>
            <li> I came across this hairdryer when I was staying in a hotel and I just loved it.  I buy them 2 at a time because I abuse mine so much.  For a compact dryer it really has a lot of power and that is what I need to style my hair.  I do have to say they do wear out in like 4 months time but I probably use mine for about 20 minutes a day straight if not more.  I tend to burn out the motor- and be careful because there has been a few times that when the motor burns out it has made an awful sound and started to smoke.  But compared to many dryers I have tried many do not have the power behind it like this one.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for a month and it just won&#x27;t work anymore.  It will not turn on at all.  I should&#x27;ve known there was something wrong with it when 2 weeks of using it, the cord would not retract all the way.  Too bad, because aside from that, I liked the settings and it is quieter than most blow dryers I have used in the past.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I have not used a hair dryer in years. I finally broke down and looked in local stores for a compact powerful hair dryer. Never found one so I went online and found what I was looking for immediately. I got this item and I am so happy with the way it works and certainly very happy with the features. I love that it folds up and that the cord retracts. I love the speed with which it dries my very long hair to a slight dampness.</li>
            <li> Update 4/5/14: After just 18 months of ordinary use by two people, something broke today inside the dryer. Can&#x27;t get at it to see what is broken. Forced to replace it. Can&#x27;t tell if it has a 1-year or a 5-year warranty. Can&#x27;t tell how to make good on a warranty if it&#x27;s a 5-year. Not happy right now. Went out to buy a $10 model at Wal-Mart just to have something while I consider whether to purchase the same model again. Deducted a star from my original review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: I first heard of Andis hair dryers when we stayed at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. I liked the shorter profile of it. When my existing dryer burned out not long afterward, I went looking for Andis on Amazon. This model is very like the one in the hotel. I like the retractable cord and the folding handle; these make storing it much easier. It has 3 speeds but no heat differences. Thus, I can stop worrying about too much heat, but still get plenty of air flow. For $19.99 you really can&#x27;t go wrong. A slightly narrower handle would be nice for small hands. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  Easy to use and store.  I don&#x27;t like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button.  We had stayed at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington DC and this was the dryer they have in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).  My hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel \\&quot;manly\\&quot; in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side. A great investment.</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer staying at a JWMarriott and liked it so much I had to find it and purchase for myself.  It leaves your hair so soft and shiny, not dull and brittle like other dryers.  Also, the retractable cord and folding handle are so nice for storage.  Would definitely recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this style however it is somewhat heavy for my taste.  I used a similar one at a hotel....</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel purposes and it has exceeded my expectations. When folded up, this hair dryer fits in the smallest places and isn&#x27;t bulky at all. This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried. The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is.</li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer - small, fast, keeps frizz down - but I returned it because I couldn&#x27;t find a curling diffuser to fit (FYI, the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; diffusers are not really universal).</li>
            <li> I only blow dry my hair enough to get it from wet to damp, but compared to 100% air-drying my hair, it seems my hair is silkier when I use this dryer.</li>
            <li> I returned it and it was somewhat costly as I had to pay return postage.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of a retractable cord so I don&#x27;t have a messy cord on my counter. The cord doesn&#x27;t always retract well, but good enough.  I also like that it folds up in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband complains that it is too loud. (But so is he!)</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to take with me to the gym but may end up keeping it at home. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Like the size and shape.  The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn&#x27;t work.  Didn&#x27;t last long, otherwise very nice</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is just what I wanted. It easily folds up and the cord retracts to a nice short length. I wanted something small and it has been great. Use it pretty much every day and haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it so far. It has 3 heat settings (low, medium, and high) and a cool setting. I usually use it on low or medium and it works really well.</li>
            <li> After continual use, the cord eventuall stops retracting all the way and that is a disappointment.  Dryer itself works great but we purchased this because of the retracting cord.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.Powerful and compact,excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted a retracting cord, and so many reviews RAVED about the dryer itself.  After using it for a few weeks, I can say the drier is fine BUT&lt;br /&gt;1) 3 speeds with 1 temp each (you can&#x27;t go medium heat, high speed, for example - it&#x27;s low/low, med/med, or high/high&lt;br /&gt;2) the cord doesn&#x27;t fully retract, even with some jiggling.  It retracts enough for my purposes (I leave it plugged in under my sink, and drop the unit in a basket)&lt;br /&gt;3) it&#x27;s kind of noisy, but does dry hair fast so overall exposure is probably less</li>
            <li> Love it, nice size now I need one with dual voltage for traveling overseas.</li>
            <li> We just received the package and opened it. My husband tried out the retractable cord and it doesn&#x27;t retract. Waste of time and money, and shipping costs as well.</li>
            <li> Best Hair Dryer I have ever used!  I bought 4!  I found this hair dryer at a very nice hotel and had to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I did a good amount of research before buying this dryer.  After all the ones I looked at, this one seemed to have all the features I was looking for.  I used this dryer one time.  When I tried to retract the cord, it kept getting stuck so I had to push it back in until it finally wouldn&#x27;t go any further.  It left quite a bit of cord hanging out.  The dryer seemed to dry my hair at about the same speed as any other dryer, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed with its ceramic or ionic features, even though I think my hair may have been just a wee bit smoother.  I also found it to be much louder and much heavier than I&#x27;d expected.  I would not buy this particular dryer again.</li>
            <li> we purchased these after using in a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;great and compact.&lt;br /&gt;just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.</li>
            <li> Similar to what other reviewers have said, I found this hairdryer at a hotel (Wyndham) and it dried my hair very fast and I had to have it.  But when I purchased it, I found it is no better than any Conair appliance.  For a portable hair dryer it is ok, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> great  I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  I bought one for myself and now my hair looks good all of the time.  thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my second one I have owned.  The first one lasted 7-8 years.  It made a weird nose and wouldn&#x27;t turn on so I threw it out. I am a little paranoid of a fire.  This dryer drys quickly and leaves soft and shiny hair.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My other blow dryer stopped working and I had been looking for a retractable one. This is just what I was looking for: Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I returned this hair dryer because, from the very beginning, the cord didn&#x27;t retract. And, as some reviewers noted, it did seem surprisingly heavy for a travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really do love this dryer.  It folds down and fits perfectly in my small bathroom cabinet.  The cord retracting feature is very nice.  Didn&#x27;t think I would care one way or the other but I really do like it.</li>
            <li> I first encountered this hair dryer while using one at a hotel.  I was so impressed, I wrote down the name of the dryer and searched for it on line.  I bought this unit from Amazon and used it for several years.  It finally saw its last day.  I immediately went back to Amazon and purchased another one.  I received it within 2 days and am once again content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  retractible cord, folds for packing, dries very well, affordable and salon friendly&lt;br /&gt;Con:  sometimes gets too hot</li>
            <li> So disappointed! Scrutinized the reviews before ordering this and totally disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The low, medium and high work fine. The cool shot, when held down works fine.&lt;br /&gt;It does fold without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Thank goodness I decided to err on the side of caution and test this out as soon as I took it out of the box. The retractable cord DOES NOT RETRACT ALL THE WAY! There is a good 7&amp;#34; of cord that can not be retracted because of a stopper that can not be moved or removed. The part that should fully retract did not, after 30 seconds of CAREFUL use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no diffuser. The little black piece that is shown in the pic does not a diffuser make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered yesterday and returning today, enough said.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is perfect for thick hair. The handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes, so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes. Great design.</li>
            <li> Best dryer ever.  I finally had to replace my other(identical to this one) because it was damaged during travel (gotta love the airlines)  Looked until I found the same one.  Recommend it for everyday and travels with you too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok dryer for the gym and not recommended for everyday use. It&#x27;s not that powerful and my girls would most likely kill this pretty quick.</li>
            <li> THE BEST TRAVEL BLOWDRYER&lt;br /&gt;just got back from vacation, used this BLOWDRYER , it truly was FABULOUS!!!!i would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. The last one I had lasted me five years.</li>
            <li> Our Andis 1875 just had its funeral. My 16yr old daughter asked me to order her another, she loves it over the larger one in the upstairs bathroom. We tried to figure out how long we&#x27;d had it and she said as long as she can remember.  While the cord did stop retracting a long time ago, it only started losing motor power this week. I wasn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;d still be available, so my daughter will be happy to know she can get a replacement. I always liked this model for travel.</li>
            <li> A hair dryer is a hair dryer!  I replaced my old one that was still working but was taking too long to dry my hair.  I bought this hoping the air was stronger so my hair would dry faster.  It is stronger but nothing that really made me go &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;.  It is a nice dryer and I like the retractable cord, though it doesn&#x27;t go in all the way.  The price is great.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair with more air and less heat. Also it folds up so it fit in the drawer. I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li> We recently stayed at  Ritz Carlton and thie is the dryer they provide in room. I noticed a difference in drying my hair and came home and purchased one. Easy to control air flow switch cool air blast button are a plus. Cut drying time down without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> My last retractable cord dryer had more heat settings than this one, so I do miss the old one.  This one is okay.  There are some articles that indicate \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryers do not dry hair faster than normal hair dryers.  I thought it did dry my hair faster -- perhaps that is due to me pairing up this dryer with a hair paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the retractable cord... I would occasionally have problems getting the cord into the last dryer I had, as I occasionally have problems with this one.  If the cord doesn&#x27;t go in the first time, pull it all the way out, make sure its not twisted, and try it again.  I often have to push the last inch or cord in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2013: I&#x27;ve changed my mind about this product.  Anything I throw out after a few months of use deserves only one star.  I finally got fed up with trying to work the cord back into the device, and was concerned that the cord was actually starting to fray.  I purchased a Conair dryer with retractable cord (that I don&#x27;t have to fight with) and heat control settings.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works good drys hair fast. However when we revived it the retractable cord button didn&#x27;t work other than that this is one of the strongest hair dryers we ever used.</li>
            <li> This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting. I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was in the hotel room on my honeymoon and both my husband &amp; I fell in love. We had such good hair the entire time! As soon as we arrived home I logged online &amp; purchased one for us to have at home!</li>
            <li> This product has the power and feel of a professional hair dryer.  It is not heavy and it folds for compactness.  The retractable cord is a plus, although it sometimes requires a little push/pull but always ends up going back in.  That being said, it&#x27;s still the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve had many over the years.</li>
            <li> this has met all my expectations.  very happy with product</li>
            <li> I liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working. The retractable cord didn&#x27;t really work so well after the first few months. You had to push it in.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer.  It works great but is heavy and a little big.  Did not realize it would be that heavy as I wanted to use it when I trave since it folds up.  Will have to see how well it works to pack it.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it, happy wife happy life!!!</li>
            <li> Wife swears that there is magic in the Ceramic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tells me all Hyatt Hotels have them in their rooms...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I know?</li>
            <li> Great little hairdryer. This is the second one I bought as the first blew up in Uk- different voltage. Before I bought the second one I purchased a much more expensive one which was actually nowhere as nice as this- hence my order of a second one. .</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact.  What I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very compact, great for travelling, and the best part is that it actually works despite its small size! Plenty of pressure and heat to get the job done. The only downside is that it does not come with attachments like a diffuser, which I typically like to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer.  Light weight, easy to use and compact.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!! Great value for the money.  I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power.</li>
            <li> I put this in my gym bag and the features make this perfect with folding and retractable cord. Love it.</li>
            <li> I should have read through more of the reviews.  This is definitely NOT the hair dryer you want if you have arthritis. :-(  My husband has no issues and even he thinks it&#x27;s too heavy.  It blows great.  No complaints there.  Just absolutely not the hair dryer for you if you have small hands or arthritis.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair but it is a little bit too noisy .</li>
            <li> Other users complained of the item&#x27;s durability. It&#x27;s not powerful enough to use daily, folks - I brought it with me to Japan (with adapters) and worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that it had the ionic ceramic features exactly like my full size Andis hair dryer I use regularly at home. Thanks for a great product, I had many a good hair days :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for travel!</li>
            <li> This dryer works as well as any 1875 watt hairdryer and the price was right.  The main reason I bought it was for the retractable cord.  From the very first time I used this dryer, the cord wouldn&#x27;t retract all the way-it left about a foot loose. Could never find the time to return it (my fault). Now, 4 months later, NONE of the cord retracts-which is frustrating.  Had I seen this review- I would NOT have purchased this dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer for the price &amp; the fact that it was Ionic.  For me the retractable cord &amp; folding is an added bonus.  Honestly - this blow dryer doesn&#x27;t work any better than another one I could have purchased in the super market.  My hair is very thick - it dries it just fine, but it is a frizzy mess when its done no matter how much product I put in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy a better blowdryer.  This one is moving the the guest bath....</li>
            <li> I think it works as well as the other blow dryer I was using but I still like it and don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> nice retractable cord</li>
            <li> Found this gem in a hotel in Savannah and liked it so much I took a photo and found it on Amazon.  Bought two, one for each bathroom.</li>
            <li> Excellent First  Introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable and it is.  One has lasted 5+ years with near daily use. New one is for guests. Have read a few negative reviews and figured customers got a lemon  It happens!</li>
            <li> I loved this hair dryer. Then the cord stopped retracting and a screw popped out.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Strong and compact</li>
            <li> Great Hair dryer!  The air temperature is not super hot so it will not damage your hair. The force of the air blowing is very powerful. This is the 3rd Andis hair dryer I have purchased. Although I do love this dryer they seem to last only one year or so.</li>
            <li> I needed a 2nd dryer to leave at a 2nd residence.  I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built&#x3D;in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  A number of hotels like Marriott buy this Andis, and others that look almost identical, to place in their rooms.  One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one</li>
            <li> Loved this dryer for the first month. Completly died after one month of light use. Avoid at all cost. Died right after the return period expired.</li>
            <li> I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it. So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel. YES!  My daughter and I seem to want to use it at the same time, so I ordered another one so we wouldn&#x27;t have to fight over it in the mornings. :-) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After my hair dryer of 10 years died, I was looking to replace with something new that wasn&#x27;t too heavy, functional and Ceremic! Get this hair dryer! It is hands down the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used in my life and I am 40 years old with a very thick set of hair. It made my hair less frizzy for sure! Great product!!! This is a bargain compared to the quality you get out of this product!</li>
            <li> Tried this at a hotel when I was out of town on business - looked it right away, since I fell in love with it. Couldn&#x27;t believe it was only $19.95!!!  Better than buying at a store!!!</li>
            <li> Love this powerful hairdryer and the compact design is a bonus.  It does not have heat settings but that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> This is great for my young daughter to use.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works very well having 3 speeds , even heat and the retractable cord and fold up feature make it easy to stow.  Only negative I see, and it is a small one, is that the no-slip grip actually peals off after a few uses and you are left with a shiny handle.  Not really a problem.  I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Powerful, lots of fan settings, cold air button, and best of all, a retractable cord! I like the folding handle for traveling, too.Great product. I can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer over a year ago to take on a Europe trip and I am still using it today.  It folds up nice and compact and has a lot of power.  It gets very hot and there&#x27;s no way to change that at high speed but I don&#x27;t mind.  It has replaced my at-home hair dryer because it blows as hard, if not harder, than my nice one at home but is much lighter to hold and easier to store.  I love it.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing this item DON&#x27;T waste your money.  I bought it and put it aside until my other dryer that was 10 years old died( about 3 months ago).  I have use it 3, yes 3 times.  The 1st time after few minutes, it obviously tripped it&#x27;s safety mechanism, because it just  hummed.  The 2nd times it did the same , but I was able to dry most of my hair.  I just used it for the 3rd time and I am typing with wet hair, as it only worked for about 2 minutes.  JUNK!</li>
            <li> Really nice  Hair dryer. Is for a gift and I&#x27;m sure she will love it. I like the way the handle folds.</li>
            <li> iItried this product at a hotel and wanted it.  Is is easy to hold and has a blast of air that easily dries long hair.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging. I like the temperature settings, the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside. Mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair. Some dryers don&#x27;t feel like they are correctly made for holding. This one does. I would recomend this hair dryer to everyone. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy item. It&#x27;s ideal for travel, heat temp&#x27;s ample, speed levels good. I highly recommend this product. gender~female~age~70~czp</li>
            <li> It works very well on my thick, hard to dry hair without excessive heat. Plus, it has the added benefit of folding to a easily storable size with a retractable to throw in a draw or a suitcase.  I wish I would have found this dryer years ago.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gives off a toxic like smell when used.  Probably some chemical in the plastic since it&#x27;s manufactured in China.  Don&#x27;t even think of buying this!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s absolute favorite hairdryer. She tried on at the Ritz Carlton in Truckee, CA and loved it. We bought one from Amazon that day!</li>
            <li> I discovered this in a hotel and fell in love with the power! It&#x27;s the perfect little size and I&#x27;ve never had issues with the retractable cord or the folding handle. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I live at altitude in Colorado, and hair dryers can feel rather weak because there is less air to push through. This dryer is shaped for optimal delivery of air, and the airflow volume feels as powerful at altitude as most similarly priced consumer hair dryers at sea level. The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer packable for travel. I&#x27;ve been happy with this dryer for 9 months until today. I&#x27;m reducing the rating by 2 stars because the power switch failed and the only way to turn off the dryer is to unplug it. Could be worse, at least it still runs!</li>
            <li> My mother used this in a hilton and loved it so she came home and asked me to purchase it for her.  Small and convenient!</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  I have limited space and really like how the cord retracts.</li>
            <li> Stayed at a hotel that had this specific dryer. It worked so well, I ordered it from amazon before I even returned home for the trip!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair dryer that could fold, chord retracts, good quality. Most options that do never seem to last very long. From the first time I used this I have a feeling this dryer will last. If you know what quality feels like, this is it. And, it isn&#x27;t at all heavy. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer and the price is well worth it. Excellent packaging and turn around, as well.</li>
            <li> Great BEST WORT 1T&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Have had it for about 2 years. Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price. All things considered it is a great product.</li>
            <li> saw this in a hotel first.  Wife loved it.  It works better than any hair dryer she has ever had but its dirt cheap</li>
            <li> I really like the 3 settings for air temperature . The Folding Handle and Retractable Cord make it great for travel.  I like it so much I’m using it as my every day hair dryer.  Also great if you’re tight on space.</li>
            <li> Need I say more? From a guy who can simply shake his head and get the same results, my wife has owned numerous (trust me here) hair blowers and she actually loves this one. Smart design, great price and superior service.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works extremely well in all aspects, except that its size is quite large to be used as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> My last hair dryer was an Andis and I bought an Andis again because I was so impressed with their quality.  So compact that it fits easily in my suitcase. You feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos.  Great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms!</li>
            <li> Works fine. Okay for traveling. I expected it to be quite a bit smaller. This is a full sized, professional sort of dryer...</li>
            <li> for my wife, the best hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li> loved it - just as I thought it would be like</li>
            <li> I really wanted more speeds as it turns out. Not very powerful. I gave it to my husband who doesn&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li> Great blowdryer! Multiple power options, and the highest dries hair fast. &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; option cools down quickly. Cord retracts well and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> First one from amazon warehouse deals was broken, so I spent the extra $5.  Works vey well and is very rugged.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer and bought it for travel.  It works so well I have been using it every day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer! I bought one for myself and others as gifts after trying this at a Marriott hotel. It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can&#x27;t beat that! It is light and love the retractible cord. After a while you have to push the cord in yourself but I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and use it everyday so it is definitely durable. I wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers but if your looking for an inexpensive but reliable product, this is it!</li>
            <li> Does dry hair quickly.  &amp;#34;Cool shot&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t come out as cool as I would like.  Also I wish that the cool shot would correspond to low/medium/high, but even though I have the dryer on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; the pressure comes out higher for the cool shot.</li>
            <li> I bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided I must have it.  I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  Did I mention the retractable cord, another feature that I love!  I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> Love love love the power. A little heavier than expected</li>
            <li> I have fine &amp; thick hair and this product has cut down 50% of drying time.  It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip. I&#x27;m not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times. The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.</li>
            <li> I needed a hairdryer just to have it, because lets say I use it twice a year. I just bought this one because of the reviews, but its nice, not too small but...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nervous because even though this hair dryer dried my hair faster (you should blot before using it though), better and softer than the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; one that I&#x27;d been using, other reviewers have mentioned their ones shutting off and overheating, and I&#x27;m wondering how long mine will last. But I&#x27;ll buy another one, should mine act up.</li>
            <li> This dryer conked out after I had it only four months. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it&#x27;s retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I&#x27;ve replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they&#x27;ve simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I&#x27;d caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer&#x27;s lifespan.  I&#x27;ve now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace a ConAir cord retractable, folding handle hairdryer that was purchased approximately 15 years ago.  Disappointed to see the technology hasnt improved.  Surprised to see the Andis is heavier, bulkier abd the cord doesnt retract as completely as the ConAir model.  If I had held it, seen it....wouldnt have purchased it. Doubt it will give me the mileage that the ConAir model provided me.</li>
            <li> I really do love this but gave it 4 starts b/c the &amp;#34;push to retract&amp;#34; button pops out often enough when I pull the cord to plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;The cord retracts as it should and it folds nicely to store under the sink -the idea is novel!&lt;br /&gt;The hot setting is really hot and the cool setting works well too.&lt;br /&gt;The tip comes off for a general drying or keep it on for concentrated-area drying and it is included but it is not a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It works.  Thats about it.  I used this at a hotel once and fell in love because it only took a few minutes to dry my very long, very thick hair (which normally takes a ton of time with any other dryer I&#x27;ve bought).  It dries fairly quickly, but not near as wuickly as it did at the hotel.  The cord has gotten &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; and wont retract anymore, I&#x27;ve tried everything. The part that folds in half does it all the time now like it&#x27;s worn out or something and Ive only had this thing since maybe August?  Wouldnt recommend wasting the money.  I put it in my guest bathroom for now and went back to my old one.</li>
            <li> This thing dries my hair super quick. Cuts my morning routine in half and my hair is way smoother since I bought this. Doesn&#x27;t get super hot but very powerful!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after using an Andis hair dryer at a Hilton Hotel.  While this ended up being a slightly different model, I still am very happy with it.  It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it more manageable than my old hair dryer.  (It was neither Ionic or Ceramic, so maybe it has something to do with that).  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer and went to Thailand without trying it out. When I tried the dryer in Thialand it would only work on low speed and not on high.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading a review somewhere that this was a good travel dryer.  It could not be worse for travel as it is actually quite large and extremely heavy.  In addition, that handle wasn&#x27;t very ergonomic... for a woman with smaller hands, it is difficult to grip the handle.  When you grip the handle, your hands are over the controls and the dryer inadvertently turns on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Keep looking!</li>
            <li> The dryer does a good job as a dryer.  The retracting feature on the cord failed within a couple of months.  Andis warranty requires that the buyer pays for shipping it in, plus $6.50 to cover their handling.  That should come to about the cost of buying a new one.  Which I won&#x27;t.  I will go with another brand that really backs their products.</li>
            <li> I too bought this after using one in an upscale hotel. I have very thick, wavy/curly hair that dries out if I blow-dry it everyday. This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like the others and it folds up real nice for packing and storing in the drawer. The only concern I have is the retractable cord has a couple of times gotten hung up and not retracted properly. I&#x27;ve only had it about 6 weeks now and so far, so good, but that one little glitch is what prompted me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> First discovered this at a hotel we were staying at and was impressed by the output so much that we ordered one before we checked out.</li>
            <li> Good quality travel hair dryer. Love that it has a retractablr cord and that it folds down.  Great to have!</li>
            <li> This dryer on low blows perfectly with my diffuser for shortish curly looks.&lt;br /&gt;Folding handle is great for travel. Lightweight</li>
            <li> This Hair Dryer popped up when I searched for dual voltages hair dryer. I was disappointed to find out it was not after receiving the product. I decided to keep it because at least it is fold-able. However when I took it to my Eastern Europe tour, it burned out on the first day &amp; even blew the fuse of my hotel room. Hotel electrician had to come to re-set my room&#x27;s fuse at 11 PM. Luckily my voltage transformer did not burn out so I had no problem keep on charging my cell phone &amp; my tablet for the rest of the tour; otherwise my trip would be totally ruined.</li>
            <li> It has worked perfectly over the last year or so since I bought it. I wanted a collapsible dryer for traveling &amp; conserve space for storing at home.  I leave the cord extended since I know it could be a problem in time. That doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little heavier than I would have liked.  I like the fact that it gets the static air out of my hair with the ionic button.</li>
            <li> We first experienced this dryer in a hotel. Went home and ordered two of them. With folding handle and retractable cord this is a very good travel dryer is addition to being great at home.</li>
            <li> Nice size, good weight, excellent airflow. Great styling my hair, and it&#x27;s really thick and fairly long. Retractable cord is a plus.</li>
            <li> This thing is SO fantastic, seriously. I&#x27;m tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one. It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a dryer. I&#x27;m notorious for showering at night simply so that I don&#x27;t have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings, but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick, simple thing. The retractable cord is a huge plus, the folding neck is a plus, I really just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this dryer. Especially for the price! BUY IT.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for wife... she loves it lots of power and heat. for the price good its a good buy and folds and packs away real nicely in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Compared to the two other folding handle, retractable cord hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, the Andis RC-2 is more solidly built. When folding the handles on the others, they creaked and flexed, but the Andis closes smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its performance is excellent. With the dryer set on high, I can hold my open palm less than 2 inches from the nozzle and not get burned. Yet, it dries as quickly as any hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I wanted a very small hair dryer for my suit case.  That&#x27;s what I searched for.  This is the size of a regular dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this model for the retractable cord and folding handle.  After using it 2-3 times/week for the last 2 1/2 months, the cord has frayed in one place and it has stopped retracting.  On the plus side, it was an effective hair dryer, but there are several that work as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,&lt;br /&gt;I used it today, and it made my hair nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seems nicer than I thought it would be for $20.00</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer in a hotel in Washington, DC, and was so pleased with it that i ordered one for myself. It is a wonderful hairdryer that leaves my hair very soft and silky....a nice change from my old one which dried out my hair. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using my new dryer.It drys my hair faster than my old dryer did..</li>
            <li> This ceramic, ionic blow dryer is great.  It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick. Its the only one its size that has a retractable cord. I love its size/ performance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problems with the way the hairdryer work &amp; I love the folding handle but the cord doesn&#x27;t retract much more than half way.  I have a larger hairdryer that retracts the cord to about 6&amp;#34;. This dryer leaves over 2&#x27; of cord that still has to be wound up outside the handle.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!!</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and has a great retractable power cord. I purchased after reading the overwhelmingly good reviews. After 8 months of use, it started to heat up beyond its highest heat setting and wouldn&#x27;t shut off at off position. The only way I was able to shut it off was to pull the power cord. I gave it a break and used it the next day, and it did the same with the heat cycle. Just as I was going to go and shut it off, everything stopped working. I was really hoping this dryer would live up to it&#x27;s reviews and now the return window is closed.</li>
            <li> ON time and as promised. Works great. Had never heard of brand before, but would buy again.</li>
            <li> the best compact hair dryer I ever own, great for vacation travel.</li>
            <li> I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  So far it meets all of her expectations and we&#x27;re very satisfied.  We are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested.</li>
            <li> my wife says it&#x27;s the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever had:  \\&quot;fast and powerful I love it\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted a travel dryer and thought the folding and retractable cord would make it ideal. The folding handle did a little to make it smaller, but not much. It was just as heavy as the big dryer I use at home. But the worst feature was the retractable cord. It was barely 3 feet long. It almost couldn&#x27;t reach across the bathroom counter let alone to the back of my head. It was basically unusable so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I love the size but it was too loud in the high setting and sadly doesn&#x27;t provide enough heat on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has all the features I want: retractable cord, powerful, folds up, cool botton and attractive.  I bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day, and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still, but the motor just died.  I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I&#x27;m bying the same one again.</li>
            <li> It works for what I need it to do which is for travel. I like the 3 speeds plus the cool shot button. Not extremely loud either but powerful. I read through the other reviews which say the retractable cord quits after awhile so I will just expect that to happen. If it does, I will just wrap the cord around it. And like other reviewers have said, it is on the larger side for &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; but that is okay for me. I have shorter (pixie length) hair now so larger flat iron and brushes are not needed so the space is not of concern to me. I wanted a good product and I think this works for what I need.</li>
            <li> So the bad news is that it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would prefer.  It barely gets the job done and I&#x27;m a guy w/ short thinning hair.  I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/ this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The +&#x27;s are that it&#x27;s simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord &amp; has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is my backup dryer now, since it is still working and travels well.</li>
            <li> Works ok, still noisy and gets too hot to touch but it does the job and it was a good deal</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old hair dryer that&#x27;s retracting feature wasn&#x27;t working after 6 years.  This one retracts only so far which is disappointing.  It is a nice dryer beyond that.  It depends what features are important to you.  I want handle to fold, cord retract and put away in a drawer easily.</li>
            <li> Teen daughters love this hair dryer.  Takes up much less room in their bathroom than a full size dryer and is much quieter.</li>
            <li> Discovered this little gem in a hotel in NYC. Dries hair without leaving frizz or fly-aways. Folding handle makes it convenient for storing and travel.</li>
            <li> Really quick to dry my long hair.</li>
            <li> It worked well for several months, but then the inside started glowing red and sparks were going off inside of it. This makes the hair dryer lose power every couple of minutes. Also, the retractable cord stopped working.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the old one we had.  My husband loves it, especially the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Dries your hair a lot quicker, hair is super smooth and less frizzy!  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> No sales puffing with this product.  It performs exactly as marketed and fits into small spaces.  The retractable cord was a selling point for me, and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly.  I would have no reservation recommending this unit.</li>
            <li> Only had my dryer for a month but so far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  Ionic  feature makes hair smooth.  Seems to be built sturdy.  Folding handle retractable cord work well.  It it holds up it&#x27;s a super buy at the price .</li>
            <li> Other than the retracting cord - which is cool - this is a pretty basic dryer. But I returned it because the retracting mechanism feels and sounds like it won&#x27;t last long, and it just looks a little too cheap. I&#x27;m happy with the replacement - the Babylisspro TT for only a little more $ - looks nicer, feels nicer, works nicer, and is lighter.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers, and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be hot enough, but I like the power!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer because of the retractable cord.  I found it in a hotel in Las Vegas and purchased it as soon as I got home.  My first one lasted three years and I liked it so much I ordered my second one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a powerful hair dryer and found this at a resort.  I was happy that I found it online and it was so reasonable.  I like the retraactable cord and hope it lasts.  Some of the reviews were negative on this.  It leaves my hair dry in minutes and soft.  More powerful than some of the other larger hair dryers I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I have used my Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord for at least three times a week since I got it, but it has been only about a month since it arrived!  That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little \\&quot;fatter\\&quot; than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as advertised.  Dries my hair quickly, folds up nicely and neatly. The retractable cord is great. It&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hairdryer for over a year and I absolutely love it. Drys for hair quickly and is perfect for traveling! Plus it comes with a 5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well but it is larger and heavier than I expected and my hair seems to get caught in it a bit. I would have liked it better were it much lighter weight and smaller.</li>
            <li> Everything I want in a hair dryer.  Used the same model in a hotel I stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I used this product at a Marriott Hotel and loved it. It has multiple settings, a directed air flow and seems to add volume to my hair. The retractable cord and folding handle are great for storage and travel. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room. Has a nice quiet sound and drys my hair very nicely.  Also the retractable cord it great so you don&#x27;t have alot of cord that you have to wind up. This item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home.</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to store (love the retracing cord and fold up handle), saves space, beautifully designed and has great power, it is inexpensive, what more could you ask for?  If it doesn&#x27;t last I will be back to adjust the review. It is only 1 month new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used,, my 19 year old daughter likes it so much that I&#x27;m having to order another one today,,</li>
            <li> After using this for almost a year I decided to leave my product review. This item packs a powerful charge however after just four months of use ( no more than three times a month) the retractable cord stop retracting. A little disappointed because I bought this product based solely on the retractable cord but other than that the dryer works fine I have long fine hair and it dries it in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> This is a very good hairdryer -- doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  But it takes up a little too much room in the luggage.</li>
            <li> Still a bit heavy for me, but the ionic hairdryer makes a big difference from the older one. And, this retractable cord doesn&#x27;t twist around - love that. It folds for easy packing, the price is very good.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Had this hair dryer in a hotel, loved it and came home to search for it. The light weight, retractable cord and folding handle is what sold me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about blow dryers, and this one makes me happy!  I love the size, the cord auto-retract, and the three speeds.  My other dryer has been retired, for good.</li>
            <li> Bulky and heavy, the cord doesn&#x27;t fully retract into the unit.  The power switch broke on the third use so I couldn&#x27;t shut it off and had  to unplug while running.  Returned.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Cord retracts as expected.  Fairly compact.</li>
            <li> Works better than my more expensive dryers.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer at a hotel in Columbus and loved it because my hair dried quickly, was not overheated in the process, and was so smooth I barely needed to use my flat iron at all to style it. I went home, found it on Amazon, and ordered one right away.  It is the best performing dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews.  It wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused.  The thing I&#x27;m most unhappy with is the cord.  I always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because I can&#x27;t stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer.  Every other dryer that I&#x27;ve had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out.  This dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging.  It is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day.  I&#x27;m still deciding if I should return it or not.</li>
            <li> Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry</li>
            <li> I was having problems with my dryer almost burning my hair. Used this dryer at a hotel in Charleston, SC and saw visible results in one day. Just didn&#x27;t know where to find it so Googled the brand &amp; found it on Amazon. Was amazed that it was so inexpensive. Ordered one and am so pleased will order two more this Spring - one for my home up north &amp; one for my husband.</li>
            <li> nice size, color and not heavy weight. It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy. It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair. Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful . Very happy with that.</li>
            <li> a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  I used this model at the Four Seasons Santa Barbara, and was able to locate it on Amazon.  I ordered one for each of my bathrooms!</li>
            <li> Love this !!! Doesn&#x27;t make hair all dried out !</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of its compact size and retractable cord but the retracting mechanism stopped working after 2 weeks.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It did not work in Europe. Every hotel in the US has a hair dryer. Why would I carry this with me? However we need it in Europe when we travel. Garbage!</li>
            <li> I know you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous.  I liked the retractable cord and the folding handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  This morning my second one was completely dead.  And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  It doesn&#x27;t get much worse.  I&#x27;m not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is simply not reliable.  I shouldn&#x27;t have tried it twice.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This dryer is average size nothing compact about it.. And it&#x27;s not as warm as my normal one but it does fold up and I love the cord I usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair so I turn it down to med.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer in a hotel in Hawaii.  I liked it so well I ordered it.  Very happy with it.  Works as well as my sisters $200 dryer.</li>
            <li> i love this new blowdryer, it&#x27;s just as it described and was a very good price. i got it on time, too !</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for traveling after reading some of the reviews.  I thought the retractable cord would allow more room in my carry on bag too.  I did not use the dryer so I can&#x27;t review how well it works.  The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my &#x27;home&#x27; hair dryer &amp; that is why I returned it.</li>
            <li> I did love this hair dryer.  Ordered it in Jul 2013.  It is now March 2014 and only the slow speed works.  The other two don&#x27;t. I know hair dryers are a somewhat disposable item.  But come on, didn&#x27;t even last a year?</li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant and many hotels I stay in have this hair dryer and I LOVE it! I had to order one for home!!</li>
            <li> The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past</li>
            <li> Dryer works great. Cord would not go all the way to the stop after just a couple of uses. Over all still like the fact it will fit in my bath drawer regardless.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer but as other reviewers have stated, it is not a travel size dryer. It does fold up but it is a full size hair dryer. The retractable cord is nice, when it works but it seems to get stuck some times.</li>
            <li> Purchased several of these a few years ago. Gave one as a gift and my wife kept one. She loved hers, so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement. My wife likes the size, power and temperature of this hair dryer and rates it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something light and easy to store, hence the foldable handle and retractable cords. It is not light, and not small. The retractable cord can only retract half way after a few months. Other than that, I don&#x27;t mind it and has gotten used to the weight. Still on the lookout for my dream hair dryer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: retract the cord before folding the handle, cord will not retract otherwise.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it had 4 features I wanted:  1) It is ionic, 2) it has a folding handle, 3) it has a retractable cord and 4) it has three heat settings.  My previous hairdryer had three of these features, but it was heavier and did not have the folding handle.  The retracting cord on the Andis works much better than my previous dryer and does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; when retracting.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement hairdryer for my dorm for the one I left at home after the holiday vacation... I went with this product because It had a long retractable cord, was light weight and compact.  I did get all of that from this product.  The only downside was that it is not all that powerful.  It does dry my hair but it takes significantly longer than the one I left at home.  Still a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife after trying this brand at PALA Casino Hotel. Dries her hair qucikly. She likes it. I like it because it cuts down her prep time. Great value.</li>
            <li> I thought I may of overpaid for just a hair dryer - but this product works very well.  It is effecient &amp; drys hair quickly and makes my hair shine!  Friends &amp; family that use it also notice a positive difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad heavier than I would like but I love the retractable cord and the fact that it folds and fits easily in my vanity drawer. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be an excellent hairdryer that has managed to withstand many years of use without a problem. (it&#x27;s never once overheated or shut down, etc.) Although it&#x27;s definitely a quality product -- what&#x27;s nice is that, unlike some of those clunky heavier types, it is still quite lightweight and a  &#x27;breeze&#x27; to use. I use the medium setting and find it more than adequate to dry my hair fairly quickly</li>
            <li> This is the perfect blow dryer!&lt;br /&gt;It drys my hair faster than any other one I have had.  It does not get too hot and ruin your hair.  I love the retractable cord</li>
            <li> I purchased this blowdryer from Amazon and it only lasted 1 year and I only used it every 2 - days!  Junk - don&#x27;t buy it.  The retractable cord did not work after a while too but I could have lived with that...</li>
            <li> Ordered it online as ssonas I returned.  I love the retractable feature. It is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The cord was hanging down and my puppies chewed it to pieces. Used one time what a was of my money</li>
            <li> Works great.  Retractable cord is a plus.  However, now that I&#x27;ve had it for 10 months the switch is stuck on high and won&#x27;t budge so I have no control over the power.  Infuriating!  I gave it three stars (instead of two) because it does work well even if it is stuck on high.  THAT WAS YESTERDAY!!!!  TODAY I WENT TO USE IT AND IT WAS DEAD!!!  Less than 10 months old and it needs to be replaced.  Ridiculous!!  One good thing?  The retractable cord still works.  Whoopee...</li>
            <li> Originally saw this hair dryer in a Hyatt House hotel...Good airflow, a little on the heavy side but great to dry your hair quickly without too much heat!  Keeping it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!  I stayed in a hotel in NYC and this is the hair dryer they had in the bathroom. It was so good that I wrote down the model so I could order it when I got home.  It dries well, folds up perfectly to fit in my cabinet, and the cord even pulls in so I can easily store it or pack it.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband.  He loves it, which this model came with attachments.</li>
            <li> Quiet, love the retractable core not real lite, hope that will be a sign it will last. but not bulky. A plus for me</li>
            <li> Excellent product... I´m loving it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for christmas.. she hasent opened it yet so not sure how good it is yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas for the sole reason to get her OUT of my bathroom and away from using my hair dryer. I checked the reviews and thought i&#x27;d give this a try. I love the fact that its a good size yet super light weight. Retractable cord and folding handle make it great to store. I gave it a try the other day and was so happy with the results. My hair dries super fast and with ZERO frizz! I didn&#x27;t have to use my metal Round brush or any products. Let me mention that I typically need to dry my hair in sections to get it dry and it takes forever. This is the first hair dryer that I don&#x27;t have to do this with. I actually have time to dry my hair before leaving the house even when i&#x27;m running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was such a noticeable difference my boyfriend even commented on how great my hair looked. I going to have to replace my Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer with Cord Reel and get one of these for my self. I had it for a year and it works but not like the Andis model.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer for everyday &amp; travel.&lt;br /&gt;Has on-going problems with the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This was a piece of crap.  I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I&#x27;d have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it.  The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died.  I left it in a trash can in Paris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> It works fine. Slightly bigger than I expected, but not a deal breaker. It doesn&#x27;t feel as hot as some of the other hairdryers I&#x27;ve used over the years; I mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it&#x27;s rather loud, and the cord isn&#x27;t entirely retractable, and it&#x27;s frankly a little underpowered - it&#x27;s slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I&#x27;ve used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You&#x27;re paying for the label, not the performance. (&amp;#34;Ceramic&amp;#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; in the pantheon of absurd &amp;#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&amp;#34; labels!) I don&#x27;t hate it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great. It has lots of power and dries super fast. A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked great while it lasted.  Only buy it if you are looking for one that collapses and has a retractable cord for travel.  Otherwise, you are much better off getting something else</li>
            <li> I bought this to use when travelling because of it&#x27;s compact size. But it works so well I&#x27;ve been using it everyday.  The cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect -- not too hot and not too cool. I added the attachment and found it performs better with it on. Has great power and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or staticy. The only complaint I have is the strong plastic smell when I first opened the box. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and I don&#x27;t smell it anymore. I really do love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> On my second try here.  Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  If this one doesn&#x27;t last longer, there won&#x27;t be a third.</li>
            <li> Dries great.  Good price.  I will buy it again if when I need another.</li>
            <li> This is great - powerful but small.  I have a drawer I keep this in and nothing else would fit. With the folding handle and cord storage PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Not too heavy. Love the retractable cord.  Feel good knowing it is ionizing and ceramic for the safety of my hair.</li>
            <li> We cruise a lot, and this blow dryer is perfect. It&#x27;s powerful, yet portable.&lt;br /&gt;I love the folding handle. What a space saver. Thank you</li>
            <li> Light weight, storable and wonderful.  I am not retracting the cord it does look a little weak there. I keep this on a shelf next to my reading chair and I can dry my hair in comfort.  I did not expect to notice anything from the Ionic feature but I do, silkier hair is a good thing.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s older dryer had finally had it and the end was when the folding handle just quit holding in place, thus a good time to get a new dryer.  Now my wife is one of those who does not just run out and replace something, even when it is somewhat of a pain to utilized, so I took it upon myself to find her a replacement -- a good one!  And, this one fits the bill perfectly.  Lots of power, every sturdy and she loves the retractable cord.  Great choice in dryers and a good price point.  Very pleased with this purchase.  W&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Power and great tangle proof retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This dryer has a retractable cord, which is nice, but not when it fails to retract, which it did. After several years and very little use, the black finish became very sticky, so I don&#x27;t use it now. The best feature was a button to turn off the heat. Can&#x27;t recommend this dryer though.</li>
            <li> The collapsible handle, the stow away cord, the power of the motor, all these features make this hair dryer really great. Price was right, too!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn&#x27;t even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....</li>
            <li> My wife has an abundant, curly head of hair, and when her dryer took its last breath, I looked for a replacement with both ionic and heat sink (ceramic) qualities to efficiently dry her hair without damaging it.  Because of size and weight, it&#x27;s not well-suited for travel, and the retractable cord does not fully retract, but from reviews I&#x27;ve read, this type of mechanism is problematic more often than not - you just live with the fickle function when you choose a model with both a retractable cord and a folding handle.  That said, pumpkin seems content with her new dryer.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I am beginning to try to find time to go back and voice feedback on the items I use most in my household. I bought this to replace my old Ionic 1875, which was on it&#x27;s last legs from years of hard work. I am wishing that  I had bought a different dryer. The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there. I can deal with this, but what I hate is the &#x27;cool&#x27; touch button, which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies. My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny. But on this dryer, pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel. Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting? It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!  I would have returned it if I could, but I bought it as back-up in case my old one broke, and too late by the time I actually opened it and tried it out. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> First used this at a hotel and loved it.  Does not make my hair frizzy!</li>
            <li> Excellent Hair Dryer! The stores do not carry a compact folding retractable dryer like this one!</li>
            <li> The dryer dries my hair quickly and has a good length cord.  My only disappointment is that the speed and heat settings are not separate i.e they are controlled with one sliding switch, low speed&#x3D;low heat, high speed&#x3D;high heat.  I was very pleased that even though I ordered 2 items separately on the same say, they both arrived as promised and in one box.</li>
            <li> This is the same hair dryer used in the Guest Rooms at the Mauna Lani Hotel on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Wife loved the unit there and asked for one at home. She got it a week ago and she is very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very powerful but the heat is gentle so it won&#x27;t burn your scalp like other dryers.Also it&#x27;s a little heavier so it seems to be built better.The only down side is that the retractable cord sticks sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair dryer for about a year now. No problems at all. It has traveled across the country 3 times and has never let me down. It works great and I like how the handle folds and cord retracts. I use it everyday! I have no complaints with this hair dryer and I love it!</li>
            <li> Outstanding hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord and the collapsible neck for storage purposes.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and does not fry my long hair like the hotel dryers.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. It&#x27;s kinda heavy it really dries my thick hair fast.  The cold shot is nice and cool.</li>
            <li> nice sound, and has a lot of power. The cord retracts smoothly and folds easily.  Dries my hair in a few minutes.  I use the cool button for drying my nail polish!</li>
            <li> This works very well for a travel blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Folds up to just the right size, the retractable cord is convenient, and it works very well without overdrying.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a separate low, medium, high switch for temperature from the low,medium, high for the fan.  This has a single low, medium, high for temp+fan, with a push button to allow for no heat, just blown air.  The retractable cord, and folding handle, though, are the real pluses that save the day.</li>
            <li> I really needed a new dryer and I&#x27;m glad I picked this one! It has great power and I like the folding handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while and it works very well,  It&#x27;s compact for storing.  I do have trouble from time to time with getting the cord to contract completely.</li>
            <li> Very compact in size, but dries like a champ! Had problems with retraceable cord at first, but now it works every time.</li>
            <li> I used this blower last year when I stayed at a Marriott Hotel.  I needed a new blower at that time and found it on Amazon.  It works fine and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> great dryer... I just wish the cord wen further up into the retractable handle.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is so powerful. Although the dryer is small, the wind is so strong that my hair is dried so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Really like this product.</li>
            <li> well made, blows good a solid hair dryer, would buy again, glad to have found this. fastt shipment.handle folds easily</li>
            <li> daughter loved this for christmas.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer does not dry out my hair...while a little loud...I have soft hair after using this dryer everytime</li>
            <li> I walk to the gym in the morning so I need to pack light. This was very easily transportable. The handle is easy and the button which retracts the cord is effecting except on the last inch or two at times. My other gym mates love this and use mine while I&#x27;m getting ready. The cool setting actually works. Great device for it&#x27;s little size. I reccommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price, sturdy, dries my thick shoulder-length hair quickly.  Not a quiet device, but well worth it.  Hair feels smooth and shiny, not weighted down.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair dryer, but ti&#x27;s powerful!  It&#x27;s pretty easy to take with me and dries my hair fast!</li>
            <li> I love the compact, lightweight design and 3 different heat settings &amp; cold shot. Great for a small apartment. I&#x27;ve been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far. Attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition. Only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth, so it&#x27;s hard to handle when I have hair product on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Andis Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer for years.  My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago so I replaced it with their newest model (1875W) at that time. Seeing I have had good performance with this dryer I decided to buy a back-up.</li>
            <li> Saw one in Vegas hotel, had to have one.  Retractable cord is awesome if you&#x27;re one to store dryer after each use.</li>
            <li> I love it because it retracts and folds. Its not that heavy that you can bring it with you when you travel. My hair dries quickly. I gave a 4 stars because the dryer is not that hot.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, I have noticed my hair is slightly better (softer), although I wouldn&#x27;t say revolutionary. It is nice to have the folding handle..Overall, I definitely recommend it over other similar priced ones!</li>
            <li> First tried this at a Hyatt Hotel. Loved it and now I own my own. Great for travel or everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great dryer except that the retractable cord stops completely retracting.  I replaced the first one under warranty after about 9 months.  Within about another 9 months the second dryer&#x27;s retractable cord would not retract completely.  I followed the directions as to how to retract the cord.  The warranty only covers 12 months from original purchase date so I am now out of luck as far as getting a new one.</li>
            <li> This is not too heavy and does a better job for my (thin, tends to frizz) hair than other dryers.  It has good strong power but the vents around the cone distribute the air delivered to the hair so it doesn&#x27;t blow around as much.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine. Good price, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is awesome! I read many reviews about it online. And I am so glad I listened and bought this. You will not be sorry....it&#x27;s great! It heats up, has a retractable cord and folds for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who has had issues with blow dryers melting her fine-textured hair. She loves this one! It dries her hair very fast and doesn&#x27;t melt your hair like other blow dryers can. The retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. If you&#x27;re in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever used!  I bought it b/c I used it at a hotel and I love it!  I have had it for about a month and it works great.  It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a hair dryer that is great for your hair,!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best blow dryers we have purchased.  I am going to buy another one to keep in our travel bag.</li>
            <li> Works great, as I work out before work 4 times a week which requires me to shower and get ready at the gym. This is my new go to travel dryer as it dries my hair so much faster than my non-travel dryer. It is loud when it is up on high, but given that it dries my hair faster, its not a deal breaker. Just something to be mindful of if using this when traveling in a hotel with thin walls.</li>
            <li> I have not had chance to use it allot, but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> I had a much smaller dryer that finally died so I spent a lot of time shopping around and finally landed on this because it&#x27;s ceramic. It&#x27;s not as portable as my last one but I am very pleased in its quietness. It pushes a lot of air and has a lot of power. And it has an unbelievable 5 year warranty. Great buy for the bucks!</li>
            <li> its slightly big, but not heavy that its aches my hand of anything. the ionic technology completely renders my hair soft and smooth. never going back to normal hair dryer again!!! just discovered this, have to buy travel size as well. but this product is good.</li>
            <li> 3mo, holding up strong and traveled to UK and back very well. Cord sometimes does&#x27;t retract all the way into dryer so u just need to play with it a bit then it stores completely.</li>
            <li> I wash and dry my hair everyday.  I used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it!  I&#x27;ve been searching for a good hair dryer that didn&#x27;t break the bank for years.  My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft.  My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  The retractable cord is great.  And, I love the folding handle for travel.</li>
            <li> We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it&#x27;s a full size but you are able to fold the handle.  It&#x27;s really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  The retractable cord is also great esp. for travel.</li>
            <li> This thing is still great even though it has a kinda awkward handle, but that&#x27;s what allows it to fold, so it is a necessary evil. Never had a device with a retractable cord work so well either. If you want a compact well drying hair dryer, this is a no brainer. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Ritz Carlton hotel provides these hair dryers. After staying at one of their hotels I loved the hair dryer so much I bought one.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer because I stayed at a Marriott (Hilton?) in Providence, Rhode Island, and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with. I didn&#x27;t think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth. I didn&#x27;t realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning. When my hair was wet. And I need to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows. I mean that. It puts out an impressive amount of heated air. The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you&#x27;d expect. The heat is nice. Nothing special there, but it dries hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever owned a hair dryer I&#x27;ve liked more. Granted, this is only my third one ever, but still, not too shabby.</li>
            <li> This product came up in a search for travel hair dryers.  It is NOT a travel hair dryer.  On the down side:  Heavy (probably because of the cord retracting mechanism, which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with), handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick.  The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers. And it&#x27;s a ittle too loud.  On the good side: Does a truly fine job of drying and styling hair, and I really like the results. The price is fair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this dryer.  She saId it would reduce frizzies.  It has and I am pleased.  I like the way it folds up for traveling.  I will get great use of it.</li>
            <li> Actual weight of this dryer is almost 1 and a half pounds, and measures 10&amp;#34; x 7.5&amp;#34;. I was looking for something smaller and lighter, and eventually opted for the Conair 1875-watt with folding handle.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a bit heavy and large but has good power and I really like the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is awesome and the airflow is good. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This dryer was not as small as I expected it to be .  Also was not as light as I wanted.</li>
            <li> very compact. Ideal for traveling.</li>
            <li> great to have for travel&lt;br /&gt;not super small but it is powerful</li>
            <li> This dryer is full size AND retractable/folding! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this - especially sine it folds up &amp; the cod is retractable</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product. Very compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that small, and quite heavy. It works reall well! But not really portable, or light enough to be a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Always loved these when staying at Marriotts.  Bought one which stopped working (loud grinding noise) less than a month after expiration of the 1-year warranty.  Andis kindly replaced it anyway, but less than 3 months later, the new one has stopped producing heat.  Andis customer service is good and they offered to replace it if I send the broken one back at my expense, but shipping will be half the cost of a new dryer.  I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This is the type of dryer I saw in a lot of Marriott hotels.  The cord doesn&#x27;t completely coil up inside of it, there is some hanging out, so that&#x27;s something that might annoy people, if they expect it to coil all the way up to the plug end.  The folding handle is nice, too, if you want to travel with it.  My daughters, who have lots of hair, use it and don&#x27;t complain about it being low power, which is saying something, coming from dramatic teenagers...</li>
            <li> Purchase this in February...loved it until it stopped working 6 weeks late. Now I am expected to pay $6.50 in shipment cost ( on a $20.00 product) to return it  for repair. Very disappointed in product and amazon</li>
            <li> I first discovered this hair dryer six years ago when I stayed at a hotel in West Palm Beach, FL.  When I returned to Ohio I made a point of purchasing this dryer.  I found it on Amazon and bought two; one for my husband and one for myself.  I have been very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  Over time the cord no longer retracts and dryers start to plug up--regardless of cleaning, so each of us are on our second dryer in six years.</li>
            <li> I used this blow dryer at a hotel, and loved it.  It leaves your hair so soft, and it dries your hair in just minutes. It is very powerful. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I never realized that there is a difference in hair dryers. I would just buy the cheapest until it burned up. Now I have one that&#x27;s quick and has that great cool button. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy blow dryer. We will use it in our Barber Shop. Great Quality.</li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord!</li>
            <li> Good price, blow strong. Not too big.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I had originally used this at a hotel and loved it so much, that when I got home from vacation, I got online and bought it!</li>
            <li> the cord does not fully retract - making it worthless</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it.  I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better that what I had used previously.  Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  I highly recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  I really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer.  My old dryer was much louder.</li>
            <li> I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord.  First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out.  Second hotel, same thing.  I didn&#x27;t use it the rest of our trip.  I tried it again when we got home.  As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked.  In the trash it went.  Big waste of money,</li>
            <li> I liked the dryer and I may buy another. But after 8 months of everyday use with no problems, it started to overheat in 2 to 5 seconds (glow) and would auto shutoff due to overheating. I think this was related to the switch going bad. The dryer is also loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, compacts well, retractable cord works but could use a tiny bit of help now and again.</li>
            <li> A Marriott Residence Inn in NH had this product in their rooms.  We were very impressed the performance as well with the folding handle and retractable cord.  Perfect for travel.  My wife who is very particular with hair dryers, (takes her own on trips even though every hotel has them) loved it.  As she had been in the market for a new one and could not find a suitable one at the big box retailers, I went on to Amazon immediately and ordered it.  It arrived before we returned.  It has now been about a month and she is very much impressed with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I recently stayed in a high-end hotel, and this is the hairdryer that was in my room.  After using it just once, I had to buy one for myself whatever the cost.  When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn&#x27;t too loud.  It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Like the size, retractable cord and how the unit fols nicely!  Biggest complaint is that it does not have a direct enough defusser. Hair blows all over when trying to style with a brush. Overall ,heat and power is not any better than several other dryers out there.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is great.  It blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer.  It also helps tame my frizzy hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Product. I have used one just like this at our Athletic club and looked it up on Amazon after my last hair dryer blew up on me. I was pleased to find it for such a great price. I also noticed after I purchased it, it went down in price. Buy this, you will be happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I tried one at a hotel and loved it.  It dries quickly and is lightweight and the retractable cord is a plus.  However, after 30 days the coils started burning red hot and then it just overheated and stopped working.  My hair isn&#x27;t that long so I don&#x27;t think it was overused.  Just not great quality.  And unfortunately I barely missed the return window.  I&#x27;m going to spend a little more this time and get something of higher quality!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to take on vacation.  It has a folding handle and retractable cord.  It&#x27;s such a good dryer I retired my old one and this is now my full-time dryer.  Powerful, but gentle.  A+++</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace one I use at home.  It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  These 2 features alone make it great for travel!</li>
            <li> Naturally, I bought this for the retractable cord.  It broke within the first week.  For once, I ignored other reviewers and hoped that I would be one of the lucky few who got a working retractor.  It broke right away.  Although it is OK, it is not one that I would have selected just as a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage. I love this dryer and so glad I bought it. So nice.</li>
            <li> My husband has used the same travel hair dryer for 15 years and had a new dryer on his wish list.  He wanted a small, easy-to-carry dryer.  Searched Amazon and found the perfect gift for him.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. For me, it is the perfect size and it does the job well of drying my hair and blow outs!</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive hairdryer it fills my needs. I use it when I travel, I would love for it to be&lt;br /&gt;a bit smaller and lighter, but that may not be possible considering the existing features.</li>
            <li> My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it.  Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel. You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to. But women are like that.........blah blah blah complain blah blah.....&lt;br /&gt;If you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky. I think a nuclear bomb would be easier to work on.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer so much I have an extra one in my guest bathroom!</li>
            <li> I will admit that this is very convenient in that it folds, is small and has a retractable cord. The downside is that I don&#x27;t really see a difference in it drying my hair any more efficiently than the blow dryer I had previous. I gave it 4 stars for convenience, but took one off for the drying capabilities.</li>
            <li> Works well for what i need it. Nothing fancy. Has to be turned up on high for actual hot air.</li>
            <li> Great dryer.....but I have very thin/fine hair so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way</li>
    </ol>
