            <li>As for now, I will happily continue using this one until it dies</li>
            <li>Great for the price as I have used blades all my life.</li>
            <li>Blades still shave closer but this is great to save time.</li>
            <li>not the best razor in outstanding but good for the price</li>
            <li>this is a very very good razor to have , if you want a  good shave this is it :)</li>
            <li>and it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good shipping time.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been playing around with them at Best Buy when I go in, and the SensoTouch 2d and 3d razors seem really compelling after trying this one out.</li>
            <li>outstanding razor!  </li>
            <li>It has nice battery life, good qulity :)</li>
            <li>Nice grip.</li>
            <li>even better than the 3 head razors.</li>
            <li>Now I can get a closer and more conformable shave.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It is light weight and effective.</li>
            <li>He said he is enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I tried this unit, and if I could &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to another unit from Philips Norelco without the full cost difference, I would in a heartbeat.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the raZor performance</li>
            <li>Cuts nice clean without skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;probably best item for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;had</li>
            <li>Great 1st razor for my 14yr old son.  </li>
            <li>The Body groomer works wonderfully and I saw another reviewer mention using it on their neck, and as it seems to cause less irritation on the softer skins, it may work for me like it did that person.  </li>
            <li>Cheap waterproof and it works</li>
            <li>This is his first shaving kit and he love it.</li>
            <li>I choose this because it is the most affordable fast charging shaver.</li>
            <li>So far my skin is adapting fairly well to my first electric razor, though my lower neck still shows irritation for a day or two after shaving.(I&#x27;ve been trying to shave every 2-3 days depending on my skins irritation level)  </li>
            <li>It may be difficult to keep a longer beard using JUST this, but for a nice, clean, pain free shave its great.</li>
            <li>However, this one unlike many older models can&#x27;t be used while being charged.</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;d say is the lack of a storage unit/base thing, would could essentially be an issue for people wanting a super nice and tidy bathroom</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price listed on here.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco YS524/44 Is a nice overall trimmer set.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>My first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to try out an electric razor for the first time.</li>
            <li>so many functions，but only will be used for shaving beards</li>
            <li>Got this based off of the other reviews of people who said that it was essentially the best one for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Really likes it.</li>
            <li>Charge fast, shave fast.</li>
            <li>and I can say they weren&#x27;t lying, haha.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it would have been nice if they had actually had some type of indication of what length of hair is too long to be successful with the rotary heads.  </li>
            <li>I like this new shaver</li>
            <li>When the battery dies, it is time to discard it for a new one.</li>
            <li>i order Philips Norelco YS524/44 Click and Style Shaver as new item&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also make the body of the shaver a little smaller to make it more ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>And this is NOT made clear on the Amazon product description page.</li>
            <li>Overall works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used two of the heads on this, and I think my first shave would have gone smoother if I had used the style head first to trim down my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not down rating this device for the irritation, as I&#x27;ve struggled with razor burn in that area my whole life to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t shave but maybe once ever other week to avoid issues.  </li>
            <li>I am worried that when it gets older, the head will pop off since there is not much holding it on.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is great！ My husband likes it very much.</li>
            <li> It has nice battery life, good qulity :)</li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave all the hairs off your face and it doesn&#x27;t leave a close shave at all. I regret buying it...</li>
            <li> I have never owned a three head shaver by Norelco, but I have owned two pervious shavers with two heads and that is what I was looking for in this case.  I like this new shaver and it does a good job.  If I was going to design it myself, I wouldn&#x27;t have the interchangable heads since I don&#x27;t need the other attachments.  I am worried that when it gets older, the head will pop off since there is not much holding it on.  I would also make the body of the shaver a little smaller to make it more ergonomic.  My shavers last me about 10 to 12 years each so I will see how this holds up over time.</li>
            <li> I like it very much it replaces my other one that I had</li>
            <li> loved it! even better than the 3 head razors.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice shave wet or dry. Battery lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;probably best item for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;had a cheaper norelco that didn&#x27;t have the wet option. Now I can get a closer and more conformable shave.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, philips norelco the best shaver in the market. The charge last a really long time..the price is great. Good shipping time.</li>
            <li> Cheap waterproof and it works</li>
            <li> Very good product! Cuts nice clean without skin irritation. I LIKE IT!</li>
            <li> Good product! Quality just as philips got us used to. Lots of funcionalities all of them work perfectly! Recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my dad as a Christmas gift. We have been using Philips razors for years. However, this one unlike many older models can&#x27;t be used while being charged. When the battery dies, it is time to discard it for a new one. I am not happy about this since it feels like a marketing scheme. And this is NOT made clear on the Amazon product description page. He is thinking about returning it and I don&#x27;t blame him.</li>
            <li> No complaints whatsoever.  Does what it says and holds a charge for over a week when used to maintain beard stubble as I do.</li>
            <li> works great for the price.</li>
            <li> Great 1st razor for my 14yr old son.  A few drops of Shave Secret along w/the standard shave head &amp; no irritation.  The adjustable head works great for sideburns &amp; goatees (my husband always seems to want to borrow)</li>
            <li> outstanding razor!  couldn&#x27;t believe how good it was!  love it</li>
            <li> this is a very very good razor to have , if you want a  good shave this is it :)</li>
            <li> I bought for bfs xmas gift. Really likes it. It is light weight and effective. He has not tried the other attachments yet but simple enough to change, just pull off-do not twist.</li>
            <li> Overall works very well. It may be difficult to keep a longer beard using JUST this, but for a nice, clean, pain free shave its great.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my friend. This is his first shaving kit and he love it. He said he is enjoying it.</li>
            <li> not the best razor in outstanding but good for the price</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrible I don&#x27;t think it would even shave peach fuss. When I used it I taught I may have left a blade guard in it but there was no guard its just no good. I would had returned  it but packing was tossed with  Christmas wrappings.</li>
            <li> i order Philips Norelco YS524/44 Click and Style Shaver as new item&lt;br /&gt;i just received it was opened before also it used i found short hair inside machine</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy another electric. they work for some but not for me.</li>
            <li> This review is after using this device for about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used two of the heads on this, and I think my first shave would have gone smoother if I had used the style head first to trim down my facial hair.  My only complaint is that it would have been nice if they had actually had some type of indication of what length of hair is too long to be successful with the rotary heads.  So far my skin is adapting fairly well to my first electric razor, though my lower neck still shows irritation for a day or two after shaving.(I&#x27;ve been trying to shave every 2-3 days depending on my skins irritation level)  I&#x27;m not down rating this device for the irritation, as I&#x27;ve struggled with razor burn in that area my whole life to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t shave but maybe once ever other week to avoid issues.  The Body groomer works wonderfully and I saw another reviewer mention using it on their neck, and as it seems to cause less irritation on the softer skins, it may work for me like it did that person.  I&#x27;m very glad I tried this unit, and if I could &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to another unit from Philips Norelco without the full cost difference, I would in a heartbeat.  As for now, I will happily continue using this one until it dies or I convince my wife to let me get the next one up, I&#x27;ve been playing around with them at Best Buy when I go in, and the SensoTouch 2d and 3d razors seem really compelling after trying this one out.</li>
            <li> Charge fast, shave fast. Nice grip. I choose this because it is the most affordable fast charging shaver. Do remember to get the $10 coupon.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver. Got this based off of the other reviews of people who said that it was essentially the best one for sensitive skin and I can say they weren&#x27;t lying, haha. Saw this in a Wallgreens the other day and was surprised it was something like $30-$40 more expensive! Definitely worth the price listed on here. The only issue I&#x27;d say is the lack of a storage unit/base thing, would could essentially be an issue for people wanting a super nice and tidy bathroom I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking to try out an electric razor for the first time.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco YS524/44 Is a nice overall trimmer set. Grooming blades perform quiet well. The Twin-Blade Rotary unit is not as close a shave as Norelco&#x27;s Triple - Blade trimmers are, but suffice in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the raZor performance</li>
            <li> Great for the price as I have used blades all my life. Blades still shave closer but this is great to save time.</li>
            <li> so many functions，but only will be used for shaving beards</li>
