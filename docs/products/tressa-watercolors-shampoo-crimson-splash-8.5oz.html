    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It was a perfect replacement, almost identical to the discontinued prodtuct.</li>
            <li>You can always wash with warm water but any colored redhead should know to stay away from that as the color will wash out like there is no tomorrow!!!..</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the color outcome and it smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain too!</li>
            <li>Here is how you make it work the best.</li>
            <li>Using both will help preserve your hair, but I find that the conditioners give the best results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews, EVER, but this product deserves a great review.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo, color is evenly deposited and add&#x27;s a great depth of color.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This color depositing shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>I had tried it before, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The  First Bottle of Tressa Was great!</li>
            <li>I am soooo glad to have found this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found watercolors!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Going off the first bottle I had, that shampoo is good &amp; smells great.</li>
            <li>My review comes with a couple caveats: I do have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go the full six weeks between color, but I can make it a good four weeks before I see a majority of the color fading.</li>
            <li>so beware :)</li>
            <li>and/or since my hair has been processed so many times, it is damaged.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Then, I wrap my hair in a towel and make sure most of the water is extracted.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li>and I feel like rinsing more</li>
            <li>A beautiful red that I am madly in love with.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my color and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair stays looking bright and vibrant for weeks.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is a great investment.</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair, which is brunette with a red undertone.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, the more you massage, the more it lathers.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used to keep my red hair vibrant.</li>
            <li>The color deposited is super bright and vivid and lasts a shampoo or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>salon is a Redken one for the most part, but my stylist uses Tressa Xtremers bright red to get a \\&quot;pop\\&quot; of fun...and these are a total pain in the neck to keep bright.</li>
            <li>my hair always looks vibrate and never looks faded,looks like the first day i colored it,you just shampoo your hair with this and your hair always looks colored shiny and healthy too.</li>
            <li>Helps keep color rich.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is clean just using tressa alone).</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this product since it&#x27;s the direct compliment to what my stylist already uses to color my hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my fair as red as the day I colored it.</li>
            <li>Then I will finish my shower, leaving tressa on my hair for about 5 minutes then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>It really works - way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The first time I dyed my hair, I purchased a Redken color-lasting shampoo, but my color faded very quickly and my ends turned to a copper-brown color.</li>
            <li>BEST PRODUCT EVER TO KEEP YOUR RED, RED!!</li>
            <li>pretty good color depositing shampoo, better than other ones that i&#x27;ve used, just wish it was darker, its lighter than what my dye color one is</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your color last, it also lathers up nicely and smells good.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>And my hair never tangles (I could completely skip brushing most of the time).</li>
            <li>I loved the hot pink peekaboos in my hair but they started fading fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>My color is rich, vibrant red, and looks absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, this shampoo made my hair extremely dry!</li>
            <li>The color washes out very fast.  </li>
            <li>My color is still intact and looks like how it did when i first got it colored.</li>
            <li>Love this product helps me hold on to my red for longer!</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a better red shampoo that I have found</li>
            <li>I could see the difference after the first shampoo.</li>
            <li>No weird smell to this either.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this stuff would deposit more red than it did!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love my bright red hair, but the maintenance is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I found this very drying to my hair.  </li>
            <li>These conditioners not only moisturize colored hair, but they also lightly deposit color with each wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Twice a week, I mix it with L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Shampoo (a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner is key) and</li>
            <li>So I have naturally brown hair, which at the time was dyed/bleached blonde (most of it)</li>
            <li>The Redken shampoo didn&#x27;t lather much and it felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my hair, not only that,</li>
            <li>when in the shower, wash your hair with your regular shampoo to get your hair squeaky clean</li>
            <li>It is a true red highlighter for a brunette</li>
            <li>Keeps my dyed bright red/magenta hair very vibrant but leaves a film im not happy with</li>
            <li>Loved that it helps my red from fading but it dries my hair out very much, so I bought a clear sulfate free shampoo to mix it with and it works very well, plus it makes it last longer only having to use half as much.</li>
            <li>So deciding I want to keep my luscious red locks, I found the reviews on this product to be convincing enough to buy this product.</li>
            <li>My main (mane?)</li>
            <li>I use it once a week (maybe twice if I&#x27;m feeling vibrant), mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with a color protecting shampoo and let it sit for 5 minutes, and then rinse.</li>
            <li>If you have reddish hair this shampoo will pump it up and keep it vibrant</li>
            <li>This keeps your hair vibrant and helps you go longer in between touch-ups.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This has become my number one must have product, I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Tressa&#x27;s Crimson Red helps keep it fresh for longer than the week it takes it to fade normally.</li>
            <li>Nice lather and the color definitely helps boost my deep red color.</li>
            <li>Just be aware, the shampoo can stain your nails and hands with a tint as well (not a big deal to me), but that shows you how well it deposits color.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say whether it extended my color or not because this is the first time I&#x27;ve gone red.</li>
            <li>You will find your hair is vibrant and by using this method, you will find your hair color lasts vibrantly until your next visit to your hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Color is vivid and it really allows me to keep up the red between colorings at the salon --</li>
            <li>and my red ends are still very vibrant because of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li>Even when I mixed it with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on dry ends, but cleanses my oily scalp.</li>
            <li>It really does work and it deposits red color back into your hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was more of a pinkish red, similar to the &amp;#34;Black Coffee&amp;#34; color, it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I expected.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because half the shampoo was missing.</li>
            <li>I went red after being blonde all summer/fall &amp; was hoping this wash would help keep my red vibrant in between salon visits.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its my and the product together, but it really did work and worked extremely well.</li>
            <li>I went back to my natural hair color since I couldn&#x27;t keep up the red.</li>
            <li>The crimson shampoo keeps my hair red for much longer than with other shampoos</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be prepared to be covered in red, though, and also note that this product does stain if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>If your not careful and wash your hands immediately wit soap after putting it on your hands will turn red.</li>
            <li>I recently just dyed my dark brown hair a cherry red and after the first week the color already faded almost back to the regular color.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to buy when I run out and highly recommend it to anyone with colored dark red hair.</li>

            <li> I recently just dyed my dark brown hair a cherry red and after the first week the color already faded almost back to the regular color.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to buy when I run out and highly recommend it to anyone with colored dark red hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m naturally medium to dark brown and get violet red</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can make a red mess in the shower if you are not careful, but it has not stained anything, not even my towels (the red color washes off my white towels).</li>
            <li> I tried it when the red started to fade into a weird red copper (which was not the original color) and ta-da</li>
            <li> The downside to doing this and washing in cold water is that it does not wash all the conditioner out, leaving my hair feeling a little greasy, but that is what the dry shampoo powder is good for.</li>
            <li> I also make sure to use COLD water when I wash</li>
            <li> Red/Auburn is one of the most difficult hair colors to maintain over time, Tressa Watercolors gives your hair color a boost, adding to the longevity of your hair color, making trips to the salon less</li>
            <li> For maintenance, I use Tressa Crimson Red mixed with a little bit of my Pureology shampoo...and then one or two times a week, just to freshen it up, I use it by itself (not mixing with Pureology).</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair red for years and reds fade faster than any other color.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that my hair felt really dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I had my hair colored a dark red about a month ago and have washed my hair about 5 times since (I use dry shampoo powder in between).</li>
            <li> I add a little bit to my pureology shampoo when I wash my hair and it helps to freshen my color back up.</li>
            <li> Along with this purchase, I bought the Pureology Reviving Red Reflective Conditioner, which I mix a little in with the shampoo to lessen the dryness.</li>
            <li> A few weeks in, and the color is dull and ready for a re-do.&lt;br /&gt;I read about Tressa Watercolors online.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and had to lighten my ends to get a red ombre.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Redken RED Conditioner until I couldn&#x27;t find anyone selling the discontinued product a few years after Redken took it off the market.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a few weeks</li>
            <li> color is dark brown/auburn and this shampoo adds a hint of red to the dark brown and a hint of pink to the lighter highlighted pieces.</li>
            <li> This may be due to one of two reasons: the shampoo itself is drying</li>
            <li> The color lasts about a week (I shampoo every other day).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to try some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with staining, like some of the other reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> red is so hard to maintain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dye my hair every 4 weeks and red is a really hard color to keep from fading.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with dyed red hair knows how hard it is to keep up.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the other \\&quot;color\\&quot; shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I ended up mixing this color with the black coffee to offset the pinkish tint.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> Tressa Watercolors adds a slight, but noticeable, hue to my hair.</li>
            <li> It has been a little over one month</li>
            <li> Some of the dryness might be from dying my hair but it definitely seemed worse after using this.</li>
            <li> I was told red is hard to maintain, but not that hard!</li>
            <li> Too much money and not good enough results:(</li>
            <li> Staining on skin is usually gone by the time you&#x27;re getting out of the shower.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My review comes with a couple caveats: I do have very fine hair AND I am two salon visits from having been blonde all last year (my hair is still porous from that). The shampoo was more of a pinkish red, similar to the &amp;#34;Black Coffee&amp;#34; color, it wasn&#x27;t as dark as I expected. It turned my red pinkish-red. Again, this may have been because my hair is still porous from being blonde. I ended up mixing this color with the black coffee to offset the pinkish tint. Most importantly, this shampoo made my hair extremely dry! It was unrecognizable.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the smell of the shampoo though. Also, didn&#x27;t have any issues w/it staining my shower.</li>
            <li> I had tried it before, and I love it!  It is a true red highlighter for a brunette</li>
            <li> I bought it as a replacement to a shampoo that was discontinued. It was a perfect replacement, almost identical to the discontinued prodtuct. I don&#x27;t even notice the difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair red for about 8 years now, and have tried several color deposition shampoos. Aside from the now-discontinued Artec red, this is the only one that has ever worked. I add a little bit to my pureology shampoo when I wash my hair and it helps to freshen my color back up. No more weird, dull purple color for me! Plus using it in addition to he pureology doubles the lifetime of my bottle of pureology and this stuff is way cheaper.</li>
            <li> For maintenance, I use Tressa Crimson Red mixed with a little bit of my Pureology shampoo...and then one or two times a week, just to freshen it up, I use it by itself (not mixing with Pureology). Color is vivid and it really allows me to keep up the red between colorings at the salon -- red is so hard to maintain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My salon is a Redken one for the most part, but my stylist uses Tressa Xtremers bright red to get a \\&quot;pop\\&quot; of fun...and these are a total pain in the neck to keep bright. Tressa&#x27;s Crimson Red helps keep it fresh for longer than the week it takes it to fade normally. I can&#x27;t go the full six weeks between color, but I can make it a good four weeks before I see a majority of the color fading. Definitely keeps the rest of my red fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m naturally medium to dark brown and get violet red every six weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Redken RED Conditioner until I couldn&#x27;t find anyone selling the discontinued product a few years after Redken took it off the market. I was thrilled to find this product since it&#x27;s the direct compliment to what my stylist already uses to color my hair. The color deposited is super bright and vivid and lasts a shampoo or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to be covered in red, though, and also note that this product does stain if you&#x27;re not careful. Grout between your tiles especially needs to be rinsed immediately to avoid any permanent discoloration. Staining on skin is usually gone by the time you&#x27;re getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Got this from my hairstylist and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the store.  The crimson shampoo keeps my hair red for much longer than with other shampoos</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, EVER, but this product deserves a great review. I recently just dyed my dark brown hair a cherry red and after the first week the color already faded almost back to the regular color. I was told red is hard to maintain, but not that hard! I purchased this shampoo after toning my hair once again, and since then every time I use the product it looks like I just came back from the salon for maintenance. No lie, this shampoo works wonders. I use it once a week by itself, and once with Matrix bio shampoo mixed into it to help maintain the color. I saw some reviews saying it stains the tub and hands and I have not had that problem at all. So overall I give this product 5+++ stars!</li>
            <li> very messy in the shower so beware :)&lt;br /&gt;but hey beauty over powers having what looks like a murder scene in your shower</li>
            <li> It really does work and it deposits red color back into your hair. I have very dark hair and had to lighten my ends to get a red ombre. The first time I dyed my hair, I purchased a Redken color-lasting shampoo, but my color faded very quickly and my ends turned to a copper-brown color. I went back an recolored my hair and immediately bought this shampoo. It has been a little over one month and my red ends are still very vibrant because of this shampoo. Not only does it make your color last, it also lathers up nicely and smells good. The Redken shampoo didn&#x27;t lather much and it felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my hair, not only that, but I read the ingredients and it had sulfates. Tressa Watercolors has no sulfates at all!!! I would highly recommend this shampoo, it is worth every penny. The only downside is that it can make a red mess in the shower if you are not careful, but it has not stained anything, not even my towels (the red color washes off my white towels).</li>
            <li> This color depositing shampoo is amazing! I had my hair colored a dark red about a month ago and have washed my hair about 5 times since (I use dry shampoo powder in between). My color is still intact and looks like how it did when i first got it colored. I also make sure to use COLD water when I wash and i wash in the sink to prevent the shampoo from staining the tub. Just be aware, the shampoo can stain your nails and hands with a tint as well (not a big deal to me), but that shows you how well it deposits color. After washing, it does leave my hair dry, unfortunately. This may be due to one of two reasons: the shampoo itself is drying and/or since my hair has been processed so many times, it is damaged. Along with this purchase, I bought the Pureology Reviving Red Reflective Conditioner, which I mix a little in with the shampoo to lessen the dryness. The downside to doing this and washing in cold water is that it does not wash all the conditioner out, leaving my hair feeling a little greasy, but that is what the dry shampoo powder is good for. You can always wash with warm water but any colored redhead should know to stay away from that as the color will wash out like there is no tomorrow!!!..Overall, this product is a great investment. I will definitely continue to buy when I run out and highly recommend it to anyone with colored dark red hair.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money. I am very happy with the color outcome and it smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain too!</li>
            <li> I went red after being blonde all summer/fall &amp; was hoping this wash would help keep my red vibrant in between salon visits. This does not wash in your hair evenly &amp; left my hair streaky in areas. Not a good look at all. I threw it away I was so mad!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the Watercolors shampoo (crimson) to me. I only gave it a few weeks and I can&#x27;t say whether it extended my color or not because this is the first time I&#x27;ve gone red. What I can say is that my hair felt really dry after using it. Even while rinsing, my hair tangled. And my hair never tangles (I could completely skip brushing most of the time). Some of the dryness might be from dying my hair but it definitely seemed worse after using this. Even when I mixed it with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> my hair always looks vibrate and never looks faded,looks like the first day i colored it,you just shampoo your hair with this and your hair always looks colored shiny and healthy too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used to keep my red hair vibrant. A must buy for anyone with red hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this shampoo, people ask me if I&#x27;ve redyed my hair. It&#x27;s a must have for redheads.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my color and is easy to use. It does what I want it to do. I love it</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER TO KEEP YOUR RED, RED!!</li>
            <li> The  First Bottle of Tressa Was great! I reordered the same color and bottle. When the package came in the mail, the bottle was completely red. The bottle seemed to have popped on the way to me, because it wasn&#x27;t rapped up. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because half the shampoo was missing. Regardless of that. Going off the first bottle I had, that shampoo is good &amp; smells great. Helps keep color rich. I went back to my natural hair color since I couldn&#x27;t keep up the red. I wish they would sent me a &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this. My hair dresser messed up the color and gave me an orange color. I have Mediterranean olive skin, can&#x27;t work with blonde hues, Tressa is a life and hair saver.</li>
            <li> So I have naturally brown hair, which at the time was dyed/bleached blonde (most of it) and then we added red. A beautiful red that I am madly in love with. So deciding I want to keep my luscious red locks, I found the reviews on this product to be convincing enough to buy this product. I tried it when the red started to fade into a weird red copper (which was not the original color) and ta-da my coppery fading is gone. Back to the fab red that it was just out of the salon. I don&#x27;t know if its my and the product together, but it really did work and worked extremely well. Amazing. I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I love this.  I love this.  I bought the red to keep some of the professionally applied pink highlights I had in my hair for October&#x27;s breast cancer awareness month.  I loved the hot pink peekaboos in my hair but they started fading fairly quickly.  With this shampoo, color is evenly deposited and add&#x27;s a great depth of color.  My main (mane?) color is dark brown/auburn and this shampoo adds a hint of red to the dark brown and a hint of pink to the lighter highlighted pieces. The color lasts about a week (I shampoo every other day).  I love this product.  I&#x27;m going to have to try some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair every 4 weeks and red is a really hard color to keep from fading.  My hair stylist introduced me to this brand and it&#x27;s great.  My hair stays looking bright and vibrant for weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product helps me hold on to my red for longer! This workes to brighten reds and to prolong the need to recolor as often.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my fair as red as the day I colored it. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loved that it helps my red from fading but it dries my hair out very much, so I bought a clear sulfate free shampoo to mix it with and it works very well, plus it makes it last longer only having to use half as much.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Here is how you make it work the best. when in the shower, wash your hair with your regular shampoo to get your hair squeaky clean (I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is clean just using tressa alone). Then, I wrap my hair in a towel and make sure most of the water is extracted. Then I apply tressa and massage it well in my hair. Then I will finish my shower, leaving tressa on my hair for about 5 minutes then rinse with cool water. You will find your hair is vibrant and by using this method, you will find your hair color lasts vibrantly until your next visit to your hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I am soooo glad to have found this!  It really works - way better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It definitely refreshed my color.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the other \\&quot;color\\&quot; shampoos.  They don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair red for years and reds fade faster than any other color. A few weeks in, and the color is dull and ready for a re-do.&lt;br /&gt;I read about Tressa Watercolors online. Since I was going to have my hair done red again, and I was already having nightmares about the fade, I picked this stuff up from Amazon. I use it once a week (maybe twice if I&#x27;m feeling vibrant), mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with a color protecting shampoo and let it sit for 5 minutes, and then rinse. Holy cow! My color is rich, vibrant red, and looks absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ll never color my hair without Tressa in my arsenal. There&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li> If you have reddish hair this shampoo will pump it up and keep it vibrant There really isn&#x27;t a better red shampoo that I have found</li>
            <li> I could see the difference after the first shampoo. You don&#x27;t need much, the more you massage, the more it lathers.</li>
            <li> Nice lather and the color definitely helps boost my deep red color. No weird smell to this either. There&#x27;s no sulfate in this product, which was a bonus.</li>
            <li> I found this very drying to my hair.  I have been coloring my hair red since highschool(I am 36 now) and I know that a lot has to be done to maintain your red! I had tried everything on the market and come up with some ideas that work well for me. I was really hoping this stuff would deposit more red than it did! I am going to stick with my ways and not buy this again. Too much money and not good enough results:(</li>
            <li> I have mahogany red hair and this shampoo helps maintain the color.  Anyone with dyed red hair knows how hard it is to keep up.  The color washes out very fast.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo everyday and it really helps.  If your not careful and wash your hands immediately wit soap after putting it on your hands will turn red. I have been using a color depositing conditioner called CHI Tone and Shine in red mahogany.  These conditioners not only moisturize colored hair, but they also lightly deposit color with each wash. This keeps your hair vibrant and helps you go longer in between touch-ups. Using both will help preserve your hair, but I find that the conditioners give the best results.</li>
            <li> Red/Auburn is one of the most difficult hair colors to maintain over time, Tressa Watercolors gives your hair color a boost, adding to the longevity of your hair color, making trips to the salon less frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week, I mix it with L&#x27;Oreal EverPure Shampoo (a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner is key) and Tressa Watercolors adds a slight, but noticeable, hue to my hair. If I ever feel my hair needs a bigger boost, I just use Tressa Watercolors alone (maybe twice a month). Works great on my hair, which is brunette with a red undertone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found watercolors! I love my bright red hair, but the maintenance is ridiculous. Watercolors extends my color, so I&#x27;m not constantly touching it help. It&#x27;s gentle on dry ends, but cleanses my oily scalp. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with staining, like some of the other reviews mentioned. This has become my number one must have product, I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> pretty good color depositing shampoo, better than other ones that i&#x27;ve used, just wish it was darker, its lighter than what my dye color one is , i&#x27;d recommend to anyone that has medium auburn dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dyed bright red/magenta hair very vibrant but leaves a film im not happy with and I feel like rinsing more is not a solution cuz that would fade my color ... Idk</li>
