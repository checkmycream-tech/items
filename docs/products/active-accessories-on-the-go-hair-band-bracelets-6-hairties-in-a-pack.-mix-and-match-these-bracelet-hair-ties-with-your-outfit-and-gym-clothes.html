            <li>They are gentle on your head and look super cute on your wrist.  </li>
            <li>They look great in my hair and never cause dents like other hair ties do.</li>
            <li>Most hair bands slip, get tangled and break my hair because I have to wrap them so many times to get them tight in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Bright, Stylish, hard to lose.</li>
            <li>These not only are much more attractive than any plain ponytail holder on your wrist, they really do their job in your hair, as well!</li>
            <li>They are of a higher quality than what I&#x27;ve seen in the stores; the edges dont fray and they havent lost their elasticity.</li>
            <li>There are stretchy so they wont leave the red mark on your wrist like most hair hands feeling like your circulation will be cut off from the tightness.  </li>
            <li>There made of a cotton stretchy material and come in many different colors and designs.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to always lose or break hair ties, but these are so pretty</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve wanted to give them a try, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would hold my hair well enough.</li>
            <li>Those were the first one&#x27;s that I bought and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to everyone!!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hurt your wrists and actually look really cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten tons of complements on these and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I already knew the quality of their products were amazing because of another product I have from Active Accessories.</li>
            <li>and you pretty much had to throw them away after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>First they look cute and are fun without being childish or tacky.</li>
            <li>I ordered these hair bands in the hope that they would work with my baby fine hair and they DELIVERED IN A BIG WAY!  </li>
            <li>Also they work really well.</li>
            <li>and/or bracelet ready when &amp; if they&lt;br</li>
            <li>They truly work as they say - gentle on your hair, but holds regardless of what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cute and they hold my hair as well as, if not better, than a hairband.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE my Active Accessories</li>
            <li>I ordered three packs of hair accessories from three different suppliers and couldn&#x27;t wait to get these cool colors.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  these.</li>
            <li>Normal hair ties</li>
            <li>I keep seeing on Instagram that new color sets are being sold now</li>
            <li>First of all let me tell you that all hairbands are not created equal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled for a long time with my fine hair coming loose from ponytails during intense training runs or workouts.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super gentle on my long color treated hair, that i need to tie up in a big bun for running.</li>
            <li>Much better alternative to the basic black hair ties I was using.</li>
            <li>The price for them are reasonable and last a while.</li>
            <li>typically only last a few weeks, a month at most, before they stretch out and a new one is needed.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is which set to buy next - they are all so pretty.</li>
            <li>The best part too is they don&#x27;t leave an awkward crease in my hair if I take my hair down.</li>
            <li>major problems i have with all the others i&#x27;ve tried: pulls out hair, cuts off circulation to my hand when worn on wrist, doesn&#x27;t hold well for a run, etc.</li>
            <li>I received my first two packages and was still waiting on my order from Active Accessories.  </li>
            <li>Tight and sturdy, so they don&#x27;t expand larger than your wrist right away.</li>
            <li>I purchased a pack of these On The Go Hair Bands last year and have been mainly using 1 for the last 2+ months, it hasn&#x27;t stretched out or lost it&#x27;s elasticity yet.</li>
            <li>(I must admit, I was a little hesitant at first if they&#x27;re actually work to keep my hair up</li>

            <li> Tight and sturdy, so they don&#x27;t expand larger than your wrist right away.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pack of these On The Go Hair Bands last year and have been mainly using 1 for the last 2+ months, it hasn&#x27;t stretched out or lost it&#x27;s elasticity yet.</li>
            <li> (I must admit, I was a little hesitant at first if they&#x27;re actually work to keep my hair up</li>
            <li> I can wear them as tight as they get over night in my hair and they barely leave a mark!</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair and am constantly putting it up and down throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> They came on a silver chain with a clip to keep them all together so you won&#x27;t loose them.  </li>
            <li> I thought these were a little overpriced until I actually started using them.</li>
            <li> Unlike other hair bands, when you put these on your wrist, you forget they are there.  </li>
            <li> They have not lost their shape, the color hasn&#x27;t faded away, like the other company&#x27;s did</li>
            <li> Not with Active Accessories...</li>
            <li> so when I saw that Active Accessories had there on line of these hair bands, I had to try it!</li>
            <li> The band is tight and holds your hair without ripping your hair when you take it out.</li>
            <li> I lose my hairbands on a daily basis because they are small and black, but the hairbands from active accessories are hard to lose!</li>
            <li> I also like to wear them as bracelets (I like to stack a few at time).</li>
            <li> I know their are a lot of companies that sell theirs for a lot more than Active Accessories and the quality is horrible...</li>
            <li> They keep my hair up tight during a hard workout.</li>
            <li> They also stay all day (or through a tough workout) without letting your ponytail slip down.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t leave that ugly dent and they don&#x27;t fall out of your hair, no matter how fine or thin your hair is but the quality of theirs,from \\&quot;Twistband\\&quot; was horrible</li>
            <li> They also worked well for my casual ponytails.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the bands.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using these hair ties for several weeks and they are by far the best brand I have used! They are the perfect size and very soft. Love the patterns and colors they come in.</li>
            <li> Love these hairbands, need to buy more!  They are of a higher quality than what I&#x27;ve seen in the stores; the edges dont fray and they havent lost their elasticity.</li>
            <li> These bands are perfect to wear as a hair band or a braclet.

There made of a cotton stretchy material and come in many different colors and designs. There perfect for when you just want to throw your hair up , or when exercising, even going out for a run.  The best part about using these are they wont snap like a regular hair band.  They came on a silver chain with a clip to keep them all together so you won&#x27;t loose them.  I have nothing bad to say about the bands. I highly recommend  these. The price for them are reasonable and last a while.</li>
            <li> These hair ties are very cute and stay in place during workouts. Much better alternative to the basic black hair ties I was using.</li>
            <li> these hair bands are awesome! major problems i have with all the others i&#x27;ve tried: pulls out hair, cuts off circulation to my hand when worn on wrist, doesn&#x27;t hold well for a run, etc. these are so much better! they&#x27;re super gentle on my long color treated hair, that i need to tie up in a big bun for running. they hold my hair and don&#x27;t leave a dent or pull out a bunch of hair when i take my ponytail out. these hair bands are awesome, i will definitely keep buying them! they come in great colorways too!</li>
            <li> These are awesome! First they look cute and are fun without being childish or tacky. Also they work really well. The band is tight and holds your hair without ripping your hair when you take it out. They also stay all day (or through a tough workout) without letting your ponytail slip down. All in all a must buy!</li>
            <li> I wear hair ties around my wrist all the time in case I need them but it always looked childish/tacky. Now I can be fashionable and always prepared! I got colors to go with different outfits so they look like they are meant to be there.</li>
            <li> I ordered three packs of hair accessories from three different suppliers and couldn&#x27;t wait to get these cool colors. I received my first two packages and was still waiting on my order from Active Accessories.  I emailed customer service and they were super friendly and quick to reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out - they were sent in an envelope vs a package, so they were waiting patiently for me in my work mailbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand. Tight and sturdy, so they don&#x27;t expand larger than your wrist right away. The edges are also singed perfectly, so they don&#x27;t look burnt or tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order from them again in the future!</li>
            <li> These hair ties are awesome!  They come in all different colors and they feel great when they are in your hair.  This company was also the cheapest I found for these sorts of hair ties.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Good quality at a very affordable price! I use them when running outside and it does stay in place. So many pretty colors to choose from.  When I go out of the house but don&#x27;t feel like tying my hair, I put them on my wrist.  If and when I do decide to tie my hair, I don&#x27;t have to search in my purse for a hair band.</li>
            <li> Our daughters loved their &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; from Santa!  Great for their hair and/or bracelet ready when &amp; if they&lt;br /&gt;need it for their hair!  Super product at great price and on-time delivery!</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to always lose or break hair ties, but these are so pretty I have not lost one yet, and the quality is so good, they never break! They look great in my hair and never cause dents like other hair ties do. I also like to wear them as bracelets (I like to stack a few at time). Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> As a dancer and a runner, I constantly have a hair tie on my wrist. These not only are much more attractive than any plain ponytail holder on your wrist, they really do their job in your hair, as well! I&#x27;ve gotten through countless runs and rehearsals without having to redo my ponytail when I have my on-the-go hair bands in. Definitely reccommend these!</li>
            <li> I ordered these hair bands in the hope that they would work with my baby fine hair and they DELIVERED IN A BIG WAY!  Most hair bands slip, get tangled and break my hair because I have to wrap them so many times to get them tight in my fine hair.  These did not.  No snags and they stayed in place...all day, working out, sleeping, etc.  A bonus is that they look great too!  You can wear them on your wrist as a stylish bracelet as well.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these bands!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my Active Accessories On-The-Go Hair bands! They are super cute and hold my hair up perfectly. (I must admit, I was a little hesitant at first if they&#x27;re actually work to keep my hair up but they do!!) I love how they look on my writst and I wear colors to compliment my outfit. I keep seeing on Instagram that new color sets are being sold now and I am so tempted to buy more!!</li>
            <li> Bright, Stylish, hard to lose. These hairbands are amazing. I lose my hairbands on a daily basis because they are small and black, but the hairbands from active accessories are hard to lose! They keep my hair up tight during a hard workout. I don&#x27;t have to continually put it up as hair falls from to my face. There are many colors to choose from. They are reasonably priced, and did I mention before that they are stylish?</li>
            <li> I love these head bands.  They truly work as they say - gentle on your hair, but holds regardless of what you are doing.  Unlike other hair bands, when you put these on your wrist, you forget they are there.  My only problem is which set to buy next - they are all so pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these hairbands a lot recently and I&#x27;ve wanted to give them a try, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would hold my hair well enough. I won a pack in a giveaway, and they did not disappoint! They&#x27;re super cute and they hold my hair as well as, if not better, than a hairband. The best part too is they don&#x27;t leave an awkward crease in my hair if I take my hair down. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> First of all let me tell you that all hairbands are not created equal! These are the newest type to hit the market and the most popular right now. There are several different companies that make these, with the most expensive being \\&quot;Twistband\\&quot;. Those were the first one&#x27;s that I bought and I liked the concept and design of these kind of hair bands but when I received the \\&quot;Twistband\\&quot; brand,  the ends were already frayed, they lost there shape and you pretty much had to throw them away after a couple uses. However, like I said I loved the concept because they don&#x27;t pull your hair, they don&#x27;t leave that ugly dent and they don&#x27;t fall out of your hair, no matter how fine or thin your hair is but the quality of theirs,from \\&quot;Twistband\\&quot; was horrible so when I saw that Active Accessories had there on line of these hair bands, I had to try it! I already knew the quality of their products were amazing because of another product I have from Active Accessories. Well, these were no exception! Not only were the ends not frayed when I received them but they still have not frayed at all!! They have not lost their shape, the color hasn&#x27;t faded away, like the other company&#x27;s did and they do not slip out of my hair....They are perfect and the quality is unsurpassed! I know their are a lot of companies that sell theirs for a lot more than Active Accessories and the quality is horrible...you may get to use them twice...maybe three times and then you have to throw them away...Not with Active Accessories... These are the best you will find anywhere! I have tried so many different brands but none as good as this brand!! I highly recommend these to everyone!!</li>
            <li> When I tried these hair bands for the first time, I immediately fell in love.  I&#x27;ve struggled for a long time with my fine hair coming loose from ponytails during intense training runs or workouts.  Not anymore!  Now I can pull my hair back with a On-The-Go Hair Bands and forget about my hair for the rest of my workout.  They also worked well for my casual ponytails.  On-The-Go Hair Bands come at a great price and in lots of colorful options.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair and am constantly putting it up and down throughout the day.  Normal hair ties typically only last a few weeks, a month at most, before they stretch out and a new one is needed.  I purchased a pack of these On The Go Hair Bands last year and have been mainly using 1 for the last 2+ months, it hasn&#x27;t stretched out or lost it&#x27;s elasticity yet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these hair bands! I have them in multiple colors &amp; even wear them as bracelets. They are also very good about not pulling my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love these hair ties!  They are gentle on your head and look super cute on your wrist.  My favorite pattern is the houndstooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dana Carey</li>
            <li> I have the warm pack and I love them! I can wear them as tight as they get over night in my hair and they barely leave a mark! Bonus is that they make cute bracelets and don&#x27;t leave an indentation on your wrist where they were.</li>
            <li> I thought these were a little overpriced until I actually started using them. These hairties are super cute, stylish, and I can wear them anywhere. I wear them for formal events AND they&#x27;re comfy enough I can wear them to the gym, too. They don&#x27;t hurt your wrists and actually look really cute. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of complements on these and will definitely buy more.</li>
