    <ol>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair coloring product I have found.</li>
            <li>Perfect 10...</li>
            <li>Perfect product.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair color I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The results are beautiful.</li>
            <li>It always does a great job of coloring.</li>
            <li>I love this hair color by perfect 10.</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 does not smell nearly as strong as some haircolors</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, smells good, has great conditioner, leaves my hair looking shiny and is done in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite color at all!</li>
            <li>I love this color and shine!  </li>
            <li>So glad I did!  </li>
            <li>And the smell is lovely!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>This is the best haircolor I have ever used and the Dark Auburn shade is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>Best hair color and fast delivery times.</li>
            <li>so the color is nice and even.</li>
            <li>like the Perfect 10 kits because they are easy to use and gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>Good results quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>This hair color gives a wonderful, deep reddish brown, with shine and high-lites.</li>
            <li>Gives you more precision when coloring.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Will order MORE.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can be DONE in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I am Robert&#x27;s wife. :-)</li>
            <li>I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>I could not be more devastated that they discontinued this color in-store.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but washed out in about four shampoos.</li>
            <li>The chemicals are easy to mix and the smell is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is ridiculously easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The comb makes for really easy application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the offending odor is just wayy too strong.</li>
            <li>otherwise you don&#x27;t get enough coverage and your hair won&#x27;t look great.</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 can be partially mixed in a smaller container to get more than one use.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also pleasant unlike most other hair dyes.  </li>
            <li>I have used Clairol product the Nice &amp; Easy,color blend, few times, and I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The color is true and doesn&#x27;t vary from lot to lot.</li>
            <li>and it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li>At every hair-cut, my stylist compliments the color, the feel and texture of my hair, and says he couldn&#x27;t give me any better results with professional haircolor.</li>
            <li>The hefty salon price tag and the fact that every single one of my friends does her own color led me to consider an at-home dye job.</li>
            <li>the color looks very shiny when I first put on, but the redness just lose too quick, still like the color after though.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon still stocks this product because I can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore.</li>
            <li>rarely use the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachment, but I like it for root touch ups and the very end of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the color on the box and covered my gray too.</li>
            <li>but I have never left mine in for more than the 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that the color &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; very well.</li>
            <li>I can really target the gray hair at the hairline with this.</li>
            <li>* I&#x27;mgetting ready to use pack</li>
            <li>I hope it remains available in the future.</li>
            <li>Perfect 10 is hard to find in stores in the dark auburn color.</li>
            <li>OK, I just finished drying my hair after coloring it with Perfect10 Dark Auburn.  </li>
            <li>Love it that it comes to my home every other month!</li>
            <li>However, the deep conditioning treatment included in each box is my favorite part of this entire kit.</li>
            <li>I love the way this color goes on and it actually stays longer than regular boxed hair colors.</li>
            <li>Covers the gray well and leaves hair soft, silky and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I could easily wait 6 weeks in-between root touch-ups, but my gray reappears in about half that time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately after dying (even though this color is darker than my true natural color), my hair does feel brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a rather medium brown and fine, though I have a lot of it; I have been highlighting it and, more lately, overall coloring it at the salon for the past 10 years; I am 38 and have a mild-to-moderate amount of white strands.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so natural that people can&#x27;t believe I color it!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Rinsed until the water was clear.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is medium brown.</li>
            <li>I really like it, cause it only takes 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Even if this color does not last as long as the salon&#x27;s (which has been about 2 months on average, as my stylist uses a semi-permanent that fades gradually for a more natural grow out), it will still save me a bundle over the course of a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is amazing, not fake looking, unfortunately it is nearly impossible to find in the store.</li>
            <li>I think that 5 weeks is a decent amount of time for such an inexpensive product to last.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to have natural highlights of red and blonde coming through.</li>
            <li>I did notice general fade over the last 5 weeks, so that my dark auburn is much lighter now.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but I love this Dark Auburn dye because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair purple like other brands do.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is very natural looking as well, not that fake, fire engine red or bizarre purple color I have found with every other red hair dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It takes just 10 minutes, and fully covers my grey.</li>
            <li> But I would like to warn people with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for so long that &amp;#34;Dark Auburn&amp;#34; is my &amp;#34;natural color&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The grey at my temples is showing through, and there is growth at the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review later with how long the color lasted on me (I shampoo every day, so probably not as long as on other women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> conditions hair, covers gray, makes hair shine, and lasts a LONG time!  </li>
            <li> so I went with 007 Dark Blonde.</li>
            <li> I forewent the 48-hours-prior test thing, as I do not have sensitive skin in the least.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to have someone assist you, at least with the back of your head</li>
            <li> Since I am training for a marathon in September and doing so much running and cross-training with swimming, I really wanted to at least try this less expensive option over the summer.</li>
            <li> Other dyes will dye your skin as well as your hair, and leave your hair feeling slimy.</li>
            <li> The color does fade after a while so it won&#x27;t be as dark, it will be a lighter auburn.</li>
            <li> I have to buy two boxes because I have very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> only place that this dye is weak is in the gray-coverage area.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Medium Auburn and decided to try a little darker.</li>
            <li> It was a tad lighter than I hoped, but that is only because my hair is naturally dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to tell my poor stylist the next time I go in for a cut.  </li>
            <li> If you do not like the smell of heavy chemicals, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instructions were easy to follow, the small wasn&#x27;t TOO bad, and no scalp burning during processing!</li>
            <li> If you have hair past your bra strap, you need three bottles...</li>
            <li> I have medium brown thick curly hair that goes past my chest and it takes two boxes for me to fully coat my hair</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores too.</li>
            <li> Or at the very least, tell me what color is closest.</li>
            <li> Not great gray coverage</li>
            <li> I am sad to see that Clairol has discontinued the line.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This hair color gives a wonderful, deep reddish brown, with shine and high-lites. It takes just 10 minutes, and fully covers my grey. At every hair-cut, my stylist compliments the color, the feel and texture of my hair, and says he couldn&#x27;t give me any better results with professional haircolor. If you have very short hair, you can get two colorings from one box. I do, with no loss of color quality or fastness.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a man, and I use this hair color. Perfect 10 is hard to find in stores in the dark auburn color. Other dyes will dye your skin as well as your hair, and leave your hair feeling slimy. Perfect 10 can be partially mixed in a smaller container to get more than one use. I use it to die the incoming white out of my auburn beard. I&#x27;m not ready to look old yet.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but washed out in about four shampoos. Back to Colorsilk for this redhead.</li>
            <li> From my wife...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reference to 008 Medium Blonde... It always does a great job of coloring. My hair looks so natural that people can&#x27;t believe I color it! But I would like to warn people with long hair. If you have shoulder length hair, you need two bottles. If you have hair past your bra strap, you need three bottles... otherwise you don&#x27;t get enough coverage and your hair won&#x27;t look great. You want to saturate the hair with the coloring, leave it for ten minutes, then rinse and condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2015: They stopped making the color I use for my hair so I went with 007 Dark Blonde. It is not my favorite color at all! It&#x27;s drab and doesn&#x27;t show highlights well. I prefer to have natural highlights of red and blonde coming through. I miss 008 Medium Blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If Clariol reads this... please bring back 008 Medium Blonde! Or at the very least, tell me what color is closest. Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 24 2015: After a week, some of the dye has washed away and the color is starting to show some highlights.</li>
            <li> I am glad that Amazon still stocks this product because I can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore. I have been using this kit for so long that &amp;#34;Dark Auburn&amp;#34; is my &amp;#34;natural color&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know what I am going to do when it finally goes away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Perfect 10 kits because they are easy to use and gentle on my hair. The color is true and doesn&#x27;t vary from lot to lot. The chemicals are easy to mix and the smell is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after dying (even though this color is darker than my true natural color), my hair does feel brittle and dry. However, the deep conditioning treatment included in each box is my favorite part of this entire kit. If Clairol sold it separately, I would buy it to use every time that I wash my hair. The conditioner makes my hair feel like silk and it smells incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely use the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; attachment, but I like it for root touch ups and the very end of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place that this dye is weak is in the gray-coverage area. I don&#x27;t think that the color &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; very well. I could easily wait 6 weeks in-between root touch-ups, but my gray reappears in about half that time.</li>
            <li> I love the way this color goes on and it actually stays longer than regular boxed hair colors. The applicator keeps it off your scalp and on your hair. Gives you more precision when coloring. I can really target the gray hair at the hairline with this. Hard to find in stores too.</li>
            <li> OK, I just finished drying my hair after coloring it with Perfect10 Dark Auburn.  WOW!  I love this color and shine!  My hair is naturally a rather medium brown and fine, though I have a lot of it; I have been highlighting it and, more lately, overall coloring it at the salon for the past 10 years; I am 38 and have a mild-to-moderate amount of white strands.  The hefty salon price tag and the fact that every single one of my friends does her own color led me to consider an at-home dye job. Since I am training for a marathon in September and doing so much running and cross-training with swimming, I really wanted to at least try this less expensive option over the summer. So glad I did!  Even if this color does not last as long as the salon&#x27;s (which has been about 2 months on average, as my stylist uses a semi-permanent that fades gradually for a more natural grow out), it will still save me a bundle over the course of a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is ridiculously easy to use.  I forewent the 48-hours-prior test thing, as I do not have sensitive skin in the least. Just went styling-product-free-clean hair overnight and colored the next morning.  Followed the instructions and did the all-over application.  Set my timer for 10 minutes. Rinsed until the water was clear. Applied the conditioner for two minutes.  Voila!  All those nasty whites are covered and my hair truly looks like I just left the salon (sans the awesome haircut, of course). And the smell is lovely!  I think my color is prettier, even, than the lady-on-the-box&#x27;s. Soft and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to tell my poor stylist the next time I go in for a cut.  Hopefully, she&#x27;ll understand.  I would definitely encourage anyone on the fence to give it a go!  If it doesn&#x27;t work out, your salon can probably rescue just about anything.  I&#x27;ll update this review later with how long the color lasted on me (I shampoo every day, so probably not as long as on other women).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** I&#x27;mgetting ready to use pack #2.  So, it&#x27;s about 5 weeks later.  The grey at my temples is showing through, and there is growth at the scalp.  I think that 5 weeks is a decent amount of time for such an inexpensive product to last.  I did notice general fade over the last 5 weeks, so that my dark auburn is much lighter now.  But, that&#x27;s OK -- it is summer after all!</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair this color for years and I love it! It covers my greys. Even my hair stylist loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is easy to use, smells good, has great conditioner, leaves my hair looking shiny and is done in 10 minutes. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Best hair color and fast delivery times.</li>
            <li> USE IT ALL THE TIME.  Good results quick shipping.  Will order MORE.</li>
            <li> the color looks very shiny when I first put on, but the redness just lose too quick, still like the color after though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Medium Auburn and decided to try a little darker. The results are beautiful. My natural hair color is medium brown. It looks exactly like the color on the box and covered my gray too. I have to buy two boxes because I have very long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> This actually seemed to make my hair lighter which I did not want. Not great gray coverage and it fades really quickly. But I bought the 2 pack so I have another one to use. After that though, I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but I love this Dark Auburn dye because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair purple like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I really like it, cause it only takes 10 minutes and then I&#x27;m done!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it! I&#x27;m sure you will!</li>
            <li> I could not find it in the stores so I was elated to find it online. I hope it remains available in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Covers the gray well and leaves hair soft, silky and very manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair coloring product I have found. I am sad to see that Clairol has discontinued the line.  It does everything as advertised:  conditions hair, covers gray, makes hair shine, and lasts a LONG time!  The fragrance is also pleasant unlike most other hair dyes.  Sorry to say that the last vendor I went through on Amazon.com did not deliver the product as promised but Amazon.com made sure the refund was made.</li>
            <li> This is the best haircolor I have ever used and the Dark Auburn shade is wonderful. Perfect 10 does not smell nearly as strong as some haircolors and I love that I can be DONE in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used Clairol product the Nice &amp; Easy,color blend, few times, and I have been very pleased with the results. this month, I decided to try another hair color product from Clairol--Perfect 10... I have to say... I am totally disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the offending odor is just wayy too strong. If you do not like the smell of heavy chemicals, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not work. It only colored the roots and left the rest of my hair \\&quot;untouched\\&quot;--I followed the instructions and applied the mixed dye on my hair thoroughly, and I have a pixie haircut, so.. that tells you a lot about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am throwing the second box away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I am Robert&#x27;s wife. :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  Love it that it comes to my home every other month!</li>
            <li> I love this hair color by perfect 10. I recently have read reviews that you should leave it in for 30+ minutes but I have never left mine in for more than the 10 minutes it says it needs. I have medium brown thick curly hair that goes past my chest and it takes two boxes for me to fully coat my hair (in reality it took about 1 1/2 bottles of hair dye)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color if you are looking to get some red into your hair but not to drastic of a red</li>
            <li> I truly love this product. The color is amazing. It is very natural looking as well, not that fake, fire engine red or bizarre purple color I have found with every other red hair dye I&#x27;ve tried. I could not be more devastated that they discontinued this color in-store. The comb makes for really easy application. The color does fade after a while so it won&#x27;t be as dark, it will be a lighter auburn.</li>
            <li> Love this color! It was a tad lighter than I hoped, but that is only because my hair is naturally dirty blonde. Instructions were easy to follow, the small wasn&#x27;t TOO bad, and no scalp burning during processing! It definitely helps to have someone assist you, at least with the back of your head so the color is nice and even. My hair falls just below my shoulders and I only used about 1/2 to 2/3 of the color solution.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair color I have ever used.  It works in 10 minutes.  The color is amazing, not fake looking, unfortunately it is nearly impossible to find in the store.</li>
