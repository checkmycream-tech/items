            <li>Wish there were more available!</li>
            <li>I always received many compliments when I wore this fragrance.</li>

            <li>My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>NOTHING like the original.  </li>
            <li>I bought my original at a regular store and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my daughter as a gift for Christmas, and when she opened it she said it didn&#x27;t smell right!</li>
            <li>You cannot return this product, but luckily I called customer service</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>just looks funny.</li>
            <li>Love it, this is a very tropical daily smell , just the right amount of sent for every day.</li>
            <li>The perfume last a whole day :)</li>
            <li>It was in the original packaging but the perfume itself was discolored (yellow) and smelled NOTHING like it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t just smell like the wrong fragrance, it is unwearable because it smells so strong and cheap.</li>
            <li>Is it an old, old  scent that Michael Kors doesn&#x27;t even carry anymore??  </li>
            <li>I used to wear Into the Blue, and this scent is very close.  </li>
            <li>I think the perfume is old since the smell is somewhat like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but I think I just made a major boo-boo.  </li>
            <li>It was old and the perfume was yellow.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and subtle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased a Michael Kors product I didn&#x27;t simply adore...need I say more...get it, it&#x27;s a beautiful fragrance!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the value of Amazon&#x27;s price.  If you love a light floral scent that has a hint of a summer breeze through palm trees and the fragrance of Hawaii, this is for you.  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Cannot rate just yet, but I have to in order for this to post... but I think I just made a major boo-boo.  I don&#x27;t think this will be the same Island Michael Kors that I sampled at ULTA.  The one at ULTA is for Island Michael Kors PALM BEACH.  This item doesn&#x27;t say PALM BEACH anywhere.  What is this one then?  Is it an old, old  scent that Michael Kors doesn&#x27;t even carry anymore??  ACK!</li>
            <li> I have to purchase Island on line because it is not available in stores anymore. I have tried several sites and this is the best price, and the real thing (not so sure about some others!). If you love this perfume, buy it here.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I actually loved the fragrance but was allergic to it.  Won&#x27;t be able to by it again but would have, otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, but didn&#x27;t listen to the reviews of others and bought it from amazon.  It was in the original packaging but the perfume itself was discolored (yellow) and smelled NOTHING like it was supposed to.  I don&#x27;t know if it was contaminated somehow or amazon bought a bad batch but it was awful! It didn&#x27;t just smell like the wrong fragrance, it is unwearable because it smells so strong and cheap.

            <li> very nice scent. reminds me of the ocean. lasts all day. my husband and i both like it. my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this parfum, it only took three days after ordering for me to receive it, product and response time is awesome!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, but do NOT purchase it from Amazon!  I bought my original at a regular store and loved it.  I ordered my second one from Amazon and it is NOT the same!  The packaging looks the same, but the perfume inside is yellow and smells horrible... NOTHING like the original.  You cannot return this product, but luckily I called customer service and they are suppposed to be refunding my purchase.  I have never had an issue with Amazon orders before, but I will say there customer service is great.</li>
            <li> This Michael Kors fragrance is wonderful! It&#x27;s light and fresh and the price was right. Feels like you are in the islands!</li>
            <li> I love Islands! Wish there were more available!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!! Beware, knock-off, color and smell are wrong!! Not suppose to be the color of gas!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter as a gift for Christmas, and when she opened it she said it didn&#x27;t smell right! She had just finished a bottle of the same perfume and she said there was something not right. As a caution, I won&#x27;t order from this person again.</li>
            <li> I always received many compliments when I wore this fragrance. It&#x27;s aroma reminds me of the ocean. I feel like I&#x27;m on vacation each time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Love it, this is a very tropical daily smell , just the right amount of sent for every day. The perfume last a whole day :)</li>
            <li> I used to wear Into the Blue, and this scent is very close.  Beautiful bottle, fabulous light scent.  It doesn&#x27;t last all day so you must reapply, but I don&#x27;t like heave scents anyway.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample from another retailer. Loved the scent. It smells clean and subtle. Purchased on Amazon as it was a better price.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I think the perfume is old since the smell is somewhat like alcohol.  I&#x27;ve used the producut in the past from retail stores so I know what it should have smelled like.  I would not buy perfume on line again.</li>
            <li> This perfume was nothing like the one I had before. It smelled like gasoline and it came with a body cream that was liquid. I would like to return this and get a refund . Please assist</li>
            <li> My new favorite perfume! I am very picky with scents but this is very easy to wear day or night and isnt too overpowering. The price is also lower than most department stores.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend, she loved it</li>
            <li> It was old and the perfume was yellow. Not happy at all.</li>
