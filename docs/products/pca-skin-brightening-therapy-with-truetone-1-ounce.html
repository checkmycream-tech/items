    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>PCA products are excellent</li>
            <li>My skin looks great.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great for under eye circles as well as pigment and scaring issues.</li>
            <li>I started by purchasing the trial size pigment set and loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The whole line is great.</li>
            <li>I think most of us with oily skin would not want to use this as it is like putting oil on top of oil.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing beauty products from Forever Young, customer service is excellent with prompt delivery!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look bright and alive!</li>
            <li>(I ran out and didn&#x27;t restock right away)</li>
            <li>This product really makes my skin appear brighter and more clear.  </li>
            <li>I utilize the entire PCA line and love it.</li>
            <li>have used this product for my first 6 weeks already</li>
            <li>you Forever Young!!!!</li>
            <li>It fit right in to my current regiment without any side effects.</li>
            <li>While I loved the Skin Pigment gel, I am not sure that this added much to the lightening.  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the pigment bar as a cleanser!</li>
            <li>I started using this product, ALONG with the PCA Pigment Gel (HQ Free) and have used them religiously every morning and every night for over 6 months.</li>
            <li>Not seeing much of anything on this one; not going to get it again.</li>
            <li>Less noticeable :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the pigment control and skin brightening therapy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using these two products together.</li>
            <li>Maybe this would be ok for those with normal to dry skin, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for acne prone oily skin, especially when you can get something cheaper that works well, like Turmeric soap, which is under $3 and eaves the skin with a matte appearance.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well within the last 2 weeks to diminish any new scars I had and reduced the severity any older ones I had.</li>
            <li>Like what I see so far.</li>
            <li>, I have noticed this natural blend and engineered quality ingredients has began to reduce my pigmentation spots and even out my skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve not gotten darker, so it&#x27;s keeping things neutral to modest improvement.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;ve not gotten darker, so it&#x27;s keeping things neutral to modest improvement.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any new dark spots since I have started using this product</li>
            <li> My 3-4 dark spots on my cheeks may have lightened a little bit, not as much as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago with the hopes of finding something to remove the brown spots on my skin after having acne.</li>
            <li> I use this product with other complementary PCA products selected for my skin type and needs.  </li>
            <li> It truly penetrates deep into the skin, I apply at night, thin layer and WOW... a dramatic improvement in my facial appearance.</li>
            <li> And after a month of using it I can testify that it has helped lighten dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> The bottle was small, however, the product goes quite a long way.</li>
            <li> Some of my dark spots have slightly faded.</li>
            <li> This product is a little stronger than the PCA Phaze 13.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, but does cause a little peeling.  </li>
            <li> Because I use this as a regimen with 2-3 other facial skin care products, it is difficult to say that this alone makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive too</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product but it works!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been using the PCA line for brightening for about 8 months. I love this product! It makes my skin look bright and alive! I use it after the Intensive clarity at night and the C-strength in the am. The whole line is great. My skin looks great. I receive compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> This product really makes my skin appear brighter and more clear.  It is a great product.  I have used it for a number of years.</li>
            <li> I utilize the entire PCA line and love it. I was recommended to begin using this line to help w/ my pigment issues. I started by purchasing the trial size pigment set and loved it. I also highly recommend the pigment bar as a cleanser! This product along with the entire product line has done wonders  for my skin in just 6 weeks. This is great for under eye circles as well as pigment and scaring issues.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist put me on the PCA pigment control regime. And after a month of using it I can testify that it has helped lighten dark spots on my face. I highly recommend the pigment control and skin brightening therapy.</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago with the hopes of finding something to remove the brown spots on my skin after having acne. This felt oily on my skin. I think most of us with oily skin would not want to use this as it is like putting oil on top of oil.     It is expensive too and I did not use it anymore than 3 or 4 times. Maybe this would be ok for those with normal to dry skin, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for acne prone oily skin, especially when you can get something cheaper that works well, like Turmeric soap, which is under $3 and eaves the skin with a matte appearance.</li>
            <li> I started using this product, ALONG with the PCA Pigment Gel (HQ Free) and have used them religiously every morning and every night for over 6 months. The hyperpigmentation (brown spots) that were on my face are almost GONE! Highly recommend using these two products together. THEY WORK!</li>
            <li> I have used this for only a week and can see a difference. My spots are starting to fade and my face is glowy. This is an expensive product but it works!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Helped diminish sun spots.  Less noticeable :)</li>
            <li> Some of my dark spots have slightly faded. Hoping to see further results as time passes. I have not seen any new dark spots since I have started using this product</li>
            <li> While I loved the Skin Pigment gel, I am not sure that this added much to the lightening.  Trying the gel without the Brightening Therapy this time around.</li>
            <li> Not seeing much of anything on this one; not going to get it again.</li>
            <li> Because I use this as a regimen with 2-3 other facial skin care products, it is difficult to say that this alone makes a difference.  However, when I stopped using the PCA Brightening Therapy for about 3-4 weeks (I ran out and didn&#x27;t restock right away), I could tell a difference!  I use this product with other complementary PCA products selected for my skin type and needs.  The 1oz. tube lasts me about 5 months using it 2 x per day (in the morning and at night).</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyper pigmentation on my face from acne scarring. This product has worked very well within the last 2 weeks to diminish any new scars I had and reduced the severity any older ones I had. Now that I know what was causing my breakouts - dairy allergy, I can continue the healing process. It fit right in to my current regiment without any side effects. Like what I see so far.</li>
            <li> This product is a little stronger than the PCA Phaze 13.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, but does cause a little peeling.  I would recommend using at night.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing beauty products from Forever Young, customer service is excellent with prompt delivery!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PCA Brightening Therapy:&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for my first 6 weeks already, I have noticed this natural blend and engineered quality ingredients has began to reduce my pigmentation spots and even out my skin discoloration. It truly penetrates deep into the skin, I apply at night, thin layer and WOW... a dramatic improvement in my facial appearance. It does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Forever Young!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used PCA for about 5 yrs. Works to a degree!</li>
            <li> PCA products are excellent</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell a noticeable difference in my skin tone when using this product.  I have not been disapointed with any PCA product I have purchased.  The bottle was small, however, the product goes quite a long way.</li>
            <li> use for a month saw no improvement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. My 3-4 dark spots on my cheeks may have lightened a little bit, not as much as I&#x27;d hoped for. They&#x27;ve not gotten darker, so it&#x27;s keeping things neutral to modest improvement.</li>
