            <li>My hair comes out perfect everytime, just like the box.  </li>
            <li>So if you want a product all in one box to come out perfect, no fuss every time, no rush to get Brass Banisher or Hair Color Remover or try any and everything to get rid of the Orange</li>
            <li>The best highlighting kit I&#x27;ve found!  </li>
            <li>, this made my hair about three shades lighter, it gave me the look I wanted perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome for highlights</li>
            <li>It came out beautiful!  </li>
            <li>My highlights are perfect!</li>
            <li>It still worked great though.</li>
            <li>This seems like a great product from what I&#x27;ve seen however I wouldn&#x27;t order from here again.  </li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>this is the best one for really light highlights!</li>
            <li>They provide bleach, developer, product to wash your hair with, gloves, a container in which to mix the product (which is a good size), mixer/hook for mixing the bleach and pulling strands of hair through the provided hair cap.</li>
            <li>I have caramel hair, with a fair skin tone</li>
            <li>but a friend gave it a good recommendation.</li>
            <li>A good tip.  </li>
            <li>Love the color!</li>
            <li>I must say,  I love this product!</li>
            <li>I wasnt thrilled it was a bleach, but decided to give it a go</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own for years</li>
            <li>and Ive been highlighting my own hair for years</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Never turns my hair a funny shade or orange, always turns out great.</li>
            <li>or you can cut your own easily from a roll of foil), and then allow the unwrapped strands of hair to sit out uncovered.</li>
            <li>within 20min most of it was banana peel</li>
            <li>I still love this stuff.</li>
            <li>You will like this much better than L&#x27;Oreal or Feria, etc.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Thought Id try it because I love revlon.</li>
            <li>Very nice, I&#x27;m always a little iffy when it comes to drugstore brand hair products, but this is good stuff!</li>
            <li>Easy instructions to follow and almost fool-proof.</li>
            <li>I have red in my hair and this turns it the perfect platinum blonde color Love it!</li>
            <li>If you have dyed hair, pay special attention to the ends of your hair, because the roots always seem to turn out lighter.  </li>
            <li>My bleached highlights were platinum, full out bounce and life.</li>
            <li>get me a light honey color on the first bleaching.</li>
            <li>there is a nice little tube in the box, but I have another quality conditioner from dhccare.com that makes my hair so smooth &amp; tangle free.</li>
            <li>It also includes a short bag shaped piece of plastic that operates as an additional cap to place over the hair that has been bleached, in order to prevent drying (this is important, see more on this below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t need the second box, it is there for the next time, Happy Coloring.</li>
            <li>Im almost considering buying several boxes and doing the rest of my hair since I can find no information on developer/bleach used.&lt;br /&gt;There is also no info included on how to manage doing roots, I could easily understand why someone not knowledgeable would end up over-processing by doing full applications over and over.</li>
            <li>Having used them repeatedly to continually lighten my ombre, I have gotten a very light blonde on the bottoms of my strands.</li>
            <li>I wish they had not discontinued this in the stores, I like the platinum frost and glow better then the ones left in the stores.</li>
            <li>I wish I read to get a magicap from sally&#x27;s first.</li>
            <li>It actually did better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>and then i put more on for an additional 20 minutes and it was blonde.  </li>
            <li>Later research suggest the Volume is 15, so it packs an incredible punch for such a low volume developer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind you will need to do them all over for it to show up, and let it set for a good amount of time, or just check them every few minutes until you get your desired look!</li>
            <li>I must say i was VERY</li>
            <li>/&gt;There really isn&#x27;t a lot of product.</li>
            <li>Make sure the bottles are closed before you ship them.  </li>
            <li>Revlon Colorsillk Medium Ash Brown)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Frost Glow for light to dark brown hair, it is irreplaceable, and will continue being loyal to it.</li>
            <li>In order to do this, I simply sectioned my hair so that I could highlight the bottom first and the top second.</li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of them and this is the only product Ihave used with no disappointing results.  </li>
            <li>Everything else worked normally.</li>
            <li>so wait to trim until AFTER you apply so you can get rid of most of the dead ends.</li>
            <li>This truly is the product and only product you can trust to give you exactly what you expecting with no ORANGE.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty similar to the model on the box.</li>
            <li>If you have dark hair and are trying to bleach your whole head of hair, you will need more bleach than this kit provides (unless you have very short hair) and you will need a blue-ish toned toner, because the honey color begins to look orangey/yellowy when used on the entire head.</li>
            <li>The color looks good on dark haired people only when juxtaposed next to their natural color (as in highlights next to natural hairs).</li>
            <li>After washing out I was SO surprised.</li>
            <li>And wow, did they shine.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found to do this very thing unless you buy bleach and a toner.  </li>
            <li>you have lots of hair and you want to do a complete highlight of your hair</li>
            <li>After doing this over my whole head of hair, I saturated the bottom several inches of my hair with bleach.</li>
            <li>This allows you to have the prototypical light blonde ends, while creating a natural graduated look up toward the dark crown on the top of your head, because of the random highlights between the very bottom and very top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I wanted to saturate to vibrant red).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hair colorist at all, I just enjoy highlighting my hair at home, love my hair stylist for hair trim, but coloring has gotten too expensive and the results I&#x27;ve seen with Revlon Frost and Glow are exactly what I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li>When I do the aforementioned ombre procedure, I am not using foils or the cap that prevents drying, so the bleach dries out faster and after a given amount of time, my hair is not as light as it would be if I used foils or the cap, because the bleach has dried out.</li>
            <li>Cap had openings which did not line up to indications, so the whole package is likely considered a salvaged &amp;#34;defect.&amp;#34;  however, not a problem in its usage, since I had a friend doing larger chunks without the cap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the Frost &amp; Glow line in general.</li>
            <li>live with a color expert, she has tried to make my natural dark strawberry blonde hair to a platinum for YEARS to no avail with CHI bleach and developer.</li>

            <li> I naturally have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> : If you want some strands to be lighter than others, whether you are using the ombre technique above or the highlighting cap with hair strands pulled through, you can use foils in the following manner; every other strand that you coat with bleach- wrap in a piece of aluminum foil (pre-cut foils can be purchased here on Amazon or at beauty supply stores</li>
            <li> say only 20 minutes, because the other product i use..</li>
            <li> The box of the kit was smashed on one side and several things were missing including gloves, instructions, shampoo, conditioner, and the packet the powder should be in was ripped open with nothing in it.  </li>
            <li> she can get her black Asian hair platinum!!</li>
            <li> The only reason for four stars instead of five, is that I was using the Medium highlights box for a long time and decided I wanted a few lighter highlights, so I purchased this box.</li>
            <li> The cap is the generic highlights cap that allows you to pull small sections of hair through in order to bleach only parts of your hair.</li>
            <li> so I decided to do black hair with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go a touch longer but was afraid the developer was quite strong and chickened out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, I just think it stinks.</li>
            <li> Hair now brown with small amount of red tones</li>
            <li> The bleach works as long as it is still moist and hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> All the other highlight kits I have bought make my hair brassy.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown</li>
            <li> have very dark hair and the Frost &amp; Glow kits</li>
            <li> No shine, just dead and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste anytime, anywhere relse and wait and see.  </li>
            <li> OR just wasn&#x27;t lazy and used foils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a tooth brush to paint bleach onto very small sections of hair, bringing the bleach on some strands closer to the scalp than others.</li>
            <li> NOT good.</li>
            <li> Since I draw insane red tones it seemed futile)&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this stuff works like crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Crap!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this a staple in our household</li>
            <li> I wish they had not discontinued this in the stores, I like the platinum frost and glow better then the ones left in the stores. I have red in my hair and this turns it the perfect platinum blonde color Love it!</li>
            <li> I must say i was VERY impressed!!&lt;br /&gt;No brassiness! No orange! No reddish!&lt;br /&gt;And YES....Only 20 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;I say only 20 minutes, because the other product i use..i had to leave on atleast 60 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;Never again! Im sold! This stuff is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Let me share, I had no expectations for this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it thinking it was a \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; dye- meaning I hoped to lighten maybe 2 shades to orange in preparation for BAQ henna (I wanted to saturate to vibrant red). I purchased at target for $6, in my defense to not reading the box; the power was out @ target after a snowstorm but they remained open.  I wasnt thrilled it was a bleach, but decided to give it a go anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live with a color expert, she has tried to make my natural dark strawberry blonde hair to a platinum for YEARS to no avail with CHI bleach and developer. I always ended up fried after 60min and too orange/brassy to tone. No shine, just dead and lifeless. We gave up (mind you she can get her black Asian hair platinum!! Since I draw insane red tones it seemed futile)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on and within 20min most of it was banana peel yellow (yay). I wanted to go a touch longer but was afraid the developer was quite strong and chickened out. After washing out I was SO surprised. My bleached highlights were platinum, full out bounce and life. And wow, did they shine. Love love love! Later research suggest the Volume is 15, so it packs an incredible punch for such a low volume developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides: the cap is junk. As is the hook. I wish I read to get a magicap from sally&#x27;s first. OR just wasn&#x27;t lazy and used foils.&lt;br /&gt;There really isn&#x27;t a lot of product. Maybe 5-6oz developer? Im almost considering buying several boxes and doing the rest of my hair since I can find no information on developer/bleach used.&lt;br /&gt;There is also no info included on how to manage doing roots, I could easily understand why someone not knowledgeable would end up over-processing by doing full applications over and over.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s for dark blonde to blonde hair, and I was really scared to use it because I have dark brown hair.  It actually did better than I thought it would.  I left it on for an hour and it was like a caramel blonde, and then i put more on for an additional 20 minutes and it was blonde.  If you have dyed hair, pay special attention to the ends of your hair, because the roots always seem to turn out lighter.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, I just think it stinks.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Hair now brown with small amount of red tones😒</li>
            <li> Revlon Blonde Highlighting Kit is the only product that I will continue using.  My hair comes out perfect everytime, just like the box.  This is the only product that I have found to do this very thing unless you buy bleach and a toner.  So if you want a product all in one box to come out perfect, no fuss every time, no rush to get Brass Banisher or Hair Color Remover or try any and everything to get rid of the Orange, this is it.  Don&#x27;t waste anytime, anywhere relse and wait and see.  This truly is the product and only product you can trust to give you exactly what you expecting with no ORANGE.  I have tried a ton of them and this is the only product Ihave used with no disappointing results.  You may want to buy two boxes just incase you have lots of hair and you want to do a complete highlight of your hair, if you don&#x27;t need the second box, it is there for the next time, Happy Coloring.</li>
            <li> The best highlighting kit I&#x27;ve found!  This is the only one that does not leave my hair too brassy.  Love the color!</li>
            <li> This Frost &amp; Glow is the lighter option of several you can buy from Revlon&#x27;s highlighting line. I&#x27;m a big fan of the Frost &amp; Glow line in general. The only reason for four stars instead of five, is that I was using the Medium highlights box for a long time and decided I wanted a few lighter highlights, so I purchased this box. I did not see a difference in the results. It still worked great though. Frankly, I think regardless of your starting hair color, you could probably get away with buying any Frost &amp; Glow set.&lt;br /&gt;The Frost &amp; Glow sets come with everything you need to highlight your hair. They provide bleach, developer, product to wash your hair with, gloves, a container in which to mix the product (which is a good size), mixer/hook for mixing the bleach and pulling strands of hair through the provided hair cap. The cap is the generic highlights cap that allows you to pull small sections of hair through in order to bleach only parts of your hair. It also includes a short bag shaped piece of plastic that operates as an additional cap to place over the hair that has been bleached, in order to prevent drying (this is important, see more on this below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMBRE: I used this product to achieve an ombre look. In order to do this, I simply sectioned my hair so that I could highlight the bottom first and the top second. I did not use the highlights cap or the bag that keeps in moisture. I used a tooth brush to paint bleach onto very small sections of hair, bringing the bleach on some strands closer to the scalp than others. After doing this over my whole head of hair, I saturated the bottom several inches of my hair with bleach. This allows you to have the prototypical light blonde ends, while creating a natural graduated look up toward the dark crown on the top of your head, because of the random highlights between the very bottom and very top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRYING CAP: The bleach works as long as it is still moist and hasn&#x27;t dried out. When I do the aforementioned ombre procedure, I am not using foils or the cap that prevents drying, so the bleach dries out faster and after a given amount of time, my hair is not as light as it would be if I used foils or the cap, because the bleach has dried out. If you want to get the lightest look possible in a given amount of time, use something to prevent the strands from drying.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you want some strands to be lighter than others, whether you are using the ombre technique above or the highlighting cap with hair strands pulled through, you can use foils in the following manner; every other strand that you coat with bleach- wrap in a piece of aluminum foil (pre-cut foils can be purchased here on Amazon or at beauty supply stores or you can cut your own easily from a roll of foil), and then allow the unwrapped strands of hair to sit out uncovered. When you rinse your hair and style it, you will see that the strands that were covered in foil are lighter than the ones that were exposed to air the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dark hair and the Frost &amp; Glow kits get me a light honey color on the first bleaching. Having used them repeatedly to continually lighten my ombre, I have gotten a very light blonde on the bottoms of my strands. If you have dark hair and are trying to bleach your whole head of hair, you will need more bleach than this kit provides (unless you have very short hair) and you will need a blue-ish toned toner, because the honey color begins to look orangey/yellowy when used on the entire head. The color looks good on dark haired people only when juxtaposed next to their natural color (as in highlights next to natural hairs).</li>
            <li> Very nice, I&#x27;m always a little iffy when it comes to drugstore brand hair products, but this is good stuff! I have caramel hair, with a fair skin tone, this made my hair about three shades lighter, it gave me the look I wanted perfectly. Keep in mind you will need to do them all over for it to show up, and let it set for a good amount of time, or just check them every few minutes until you get your desired look! Only dislike is the smell, but all hair stuff smells! I still love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Cap had openings which did not line up to indications, so the whole package is likely considered a salvaged &amp;#34;defect.&amp;#34;  however, not a problem in its usage, since I had a friend doing larger chunks without the cap.  Everything else worked normally.</li>
            <li> You will like this much better than L&#x27;Oreal or Feria, etc. if you like to run highlights in your hair. I don&#x27;t usually go to Revlon products first but a friend gave it a good recommendation. Easy instructions to follow and almost fool-proof. Like any highlighting product, it does tend to strip the hair and make it brittle/subject to split ends... so wait to trim until AFTER you apply so you can get rid of most of the dead ends. And condition, condition, condition.  there is a nice little tube in the box, but I have another quality conditioner from dhccare.com that makes my hair so smooth &amp; tangle free.</li>
            <li> The bottle inside leaked all over everything.  A good tip.  Make sure the bottles are closed before you ship them.  I had to throw it away!</li>
            <li> This is the only kit that I buy now. All the other highlight kits I have bought make my hair brassy. I use this after dying my hair champagne blonde. The color is pretty similar to the model on the box.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations and the shipping exceeded my expectations - a win-win!</li>
            <li> This seems like a great product from what I&#x27;ve seen however I wouldn&#x27;t order from here again.  The box of the kit was smashed on one side and several things were missing including gloves, instructions, shampoo, conditioner, and the packet the powder should be in was ripped open with nothing in it.  The only things in the kit were the cap, applicator, and cream developer.</li>
            <li> Awesome for highlights I have been doing my own for years this is the best one for really light highlights! Love it.</li>
            <li> I must say,  I love this product! I naturally have dark brown hair and I recently changed it to red. After a while I wanted to change it to something else so I decided to do black hair with blonde highlights. It came out beautiful!  I didn&#x27;t use the cap, I used foils instead (easier for me). I recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon Frost and Glow for years. This product works great. Never turns my hair a funny shade or orange, always turns out great.</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that colors my hair the way I like, and not yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hair colorist at all, I just enjoy highlighting my hair at home, love my hair stylist for hair trim, but coloring has gotten too expensive and the results I&#x27;ve seen with Revlon Frost and Glow are exactly what I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. My hair is dark brown so I leave the Revlon prep for 90min checking every 30min.&lt;br /&gt;(Every month, I touch up my hair roots with Revlon Colorsillk Medium Ash Brown)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Frost Glow for light to dark brown hair, it is irreplaceable, and will continue being loyal to it. My highlights are perfect!</li>
            <li> NOT good. Made my hair orange and Ive been highlighting my own hair for years and this stuff works like crap. Thought Id try it because I love revlon. Stick to Loreal!</li>
            <li> Crap!  Stay away from products like these!</li>
