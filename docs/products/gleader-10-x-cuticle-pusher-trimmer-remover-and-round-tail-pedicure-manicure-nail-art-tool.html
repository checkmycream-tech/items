            <li>Seem sharp enough, just doesn&#x27;t cut as good or easily as some others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>These work amazing and are very sharp.</li>

            <li> Had a hard time finding them, should have come to Amazon first.!</li>
            <li> They also last long.</li>
            <li> These took a really long time so be prepared to wait.</li>
            <li> If your criteria for selecting a cuticle trimmer is that it be sharp, look no further.  </li>
            <li> The grooves are too wide and dull, you have to apply too much pressure to get any removing done</li>
            <li> Not sure what one might be cutting for them to be dull, lol.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve spent upwards of 10 bucks for one of these before</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful with these, they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is sharp and not too flimsy.</li>
            <li> the sodial are sharp its like peeling the skin off an apple</li>
            <li> These things ARE sharp, as in like a razor.  </li>
            <li> But, if you want sharp, as I do, buy these.  </li>
            <li> The blades were extremely sharp, therefore, be very careful when using them.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not perfect (a little lightweight) but work pretty well, considering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are sharp!</li>
            <li> They were very sharp.</li>
            <li> I ordered trimmers from several different companies to test them against each other as I was tired of mangling my cuticles with dull trimmers.  </li>
            <li> and it had less usage life then these.  </li>
            <li> much too wide at the cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> and then it becomes pretty dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Not a good deal since you wind up not really using them.</li>
            <li> But some of them are very dull.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three stars as they were make from poor quality materials.  </li>

            <li> Perfect came just as shown and they were the perfect size came in a cute bag and everything definitely recomend:)</li>

            <li> Like it.But some of them are very dull.</li>
            <li> 5 star for value, 3.5 star for function.  Seem sharp enough, just doesn&#x27;t cut as good or easily as some others I&#x27;ve used.  Can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it -- no pun intended :-)</li>
            <li> These took a really long time so be prepared to wait. They are worth it though and are every bit as good as the ones you find in the store, perhaps a bit better. Great deal, thank you.</li>
            <li> The blades on these wands work quite nicely, just as well as the top cuticle trimmers I&#x27;ve used which cost this price or more for one individual trimmer. This being said, these are not for a perfectionist who notices details. The batch of removers I received all have air bubbles in the wands which basically make the brown portion of the wand appear defective, the batch that couldn&#x27;t be sold to a retailer, because these would not meet quality control standards. This said, if the air bubbles were non-existent, I&#x27;d say these are perfect. For those who do not care about such details, it&#x27;s a great buy. For .30 each, the price can&#x27;t be beat, and they do serve the purpose for which they are intended. Shipping was also great as these were received earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Revlon use to make the best ones but there new desgin doesnt cut cuticles well,these no name one work much better,they are not perfect but not bad and the price is right</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to order these because of some of the mixed reviews but pleasantly surprised! For under $4, these are a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received from China in 12 days, much faster than expected. 10 included as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sharp! Not sure what one might be cutting for them to be dull, lol. For skin/ cuticles, they&#x27;re excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smile. Would recommend to others and order again. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEN, &amp; GREAT PRICE. FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> These are falling apart when you take them out of the bag. The blade is too flimsy and digs in when it flexes. Avoid, Junk.</li>
            <li> Work well. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Works better than all the over-priced ones cuticle removers that I have tried.  I totally recommmend it.  It also arrived undamaged and as promised.</li>
            <li> Be careful with these, they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three stars as they were make from poor quality materials.  The blades were extremely sharp, therefore, be very careful when using them.  I cut my cuticles too deeply and bled on numerous occasions.  Well, for that price, worth buying.</li>
            <li> Price is right, works fine, long delivery time.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Fast delivery and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> They are all sharp and relatively sturdy - great deal considering how cheap they were.</li>
            <li> these things are addicting! watch out.  i bought this pack for stocking stuffers.  they work great for me.  i&#x27;ve spent upwards of 10 bucks for one of these before and it had less usage life then these.  what a great deal.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Love this little tools. Got a great deal on a bundle. They also last long.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting good quality since the price is so reasonable but was pleasantly surprised.  They&#x27;re not perfect (a little lightweight) but work pretty well, considering.  If you go through a lot of these, it&#x27;s really a good bargain.</li>
            <li> I purchased these, one because they were inexpensive, and I thought what the heck if they don&#x27;t work.  Turns out, these are the BEST cuticle trimmers I have ever purchased and the price is an added bonus.  Most of the time I knick my cuticle and they bleed for the longest, but I have only used one and the percision is right on.  I will definitely be purchasing these again!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly want I wanted!</li>
            <li> Took a several weeks to arrive. The trimmer is sharp and not too flimsy. Would buy again</li>
            <li> These are more blunt shaped than photo shows but most were sharp enough. I prefer the more pointy tipped, these are not if thats what your looking for. Took awhile for them to come.</li>
            <li> The grooves are too wide and dull, you have to apply too much pressure to get any removing done and then it becomes pretty dangerous.  Not a good deal since you wind up not really using them.</li>
            <li> 10 for less than I would pay for 1 at the local pharmacy and just as good.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because they look like the ones I get from the beauty outlet and they work just as well.  the sodial are sharp its like peeling the skin off an apple that&#x27;s how even  sharp and smooth they are I purchased 30 at the time,but I will be getting more they work great and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Tried 3 of the ten. They were very sharp. I&#x27;d buy them again, but this is a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> much too wide at the cutting edge.  We can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I hope I can give it 0 star, totally trash, threw it away already</li>
            <li> Very flimsy,  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> If your criteria for selecting a cuticle trimmer is that it be sharp, look no further.  I ordered trimmers from several different companies to test them against each other as I was tired of mangling my cuticles with dull trimmers.  Yikes!  These things ARE sharp, as in like a razor.  Keep alcohol and tissues nearby.  The opening at the end is a bit wider than most which makes it ever so easy to draw blood.  You&#x27;ve been warned.  But, if you want sharp, as I do, buy these.  Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for my cuticles, just what I wanted, .</li>
            <li> These work amazing and are very sharp. I use them every time I do my nails.</li>
            <li> Love them. They&#x27;re sharp &amp; do a good job.</li>
            <li> should be sold in smaller pack sizes</li>
