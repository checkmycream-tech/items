            <li>so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the shipping was more than the item, I decided to buy 2.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>I have thicker hair and most clips don&#x27;t hold so well.</li>
            <li>I love these clips..</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have looked for these in many stores but none have the &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; power these do.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see these affordable clips on Amazon!</li>
            <li>These are perfect and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair I&#x27;ve been looking in stores and found these at amazon</li>
            <li>They are easy to put in your hair and hold the hair you clip up securely and comfortably, however,</li>
            <li>These clips are great for holding back my bangs.</li>
            <li>These are great for pinning back bangs.</li>
            <li>perfect for holding thick hair in place</li>
            <li>My hair is too thin for barrettes and bobby pins and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love these simple clips.  </li>
            <li>we all love them only thing that stays in my hair</li>
            <li>I first bought them at the walmart</li>
            <li>I used to be able to purchase them locally, but they have disappeared from shelves.</li>
            <li>These are slightly smaller than I expected but they work great.</li>
            <li>Quality of the item is very good, but on fine thin hair like mine, they don&#x27;t hold well enough for all day use.</li>
            <li>I have fine asian hair that doesn&#x27;t take well to curling or hair pins.</li>
            <li>Stays in place if I don&#x27;t tug my hair around too much.  </li>
            <li>I really take care of them.</li>
            <li>If you need clips to hold your style, you would do very well to try the DCNL Metal Snap Clip.</li>
            <li>Awesome, but so expensive!</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and this type of clip</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that these clips are so hard to find in stores, because more people ought to give them a try!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if Amazon stops carrying them, because for me, bobby pins and normal clips just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>There is a nice variety of colors that should work for most hair colors (the gold might look a little weird with someone with dark/black hair, but it looks nice in my highlighted dark brown hair).</li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of hair clip types before, from the simple-1-prong metal snaps to those metal-pressure-held-slide-clip ones that hurt your fingers to remove to those super long snap clips.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty straight and silky smooth so regular clips have a hard time making it stay point</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, straight hair and these</li>
            <li>Wide enough to get a secure grip.</li>
            <li>The old Goody clips without the fold-over construction do not have this problem.</li>
            <li>These clips attach &amp; stay even in my thin very fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always hard to fine clips that stay put.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty with bobby pins or the single pronged snap clips.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews that these clips really hold hair</li>
            <li>I have been searching for hair clips like these for a very long time; I have found others of this same design but not of this same high quality material.</li>

            <li> is the only one that will stay in my hair all day long and last through various activities.</li>
            <li> When a simple product like this can hold my hair in line all day long without hurting and pulling my hair out at the roots, it is sheer perfection.</li>
            <li> when I looked at them later in the day I noticed that they are not large enough to hold all of the short hair I needed to pin up.</li>
            <li> The claw back really keeps these in place--I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them slipping or not gripping hair well enough.</li>
            <li> and when I pulled it back in a pony tail the shorter hair on the sides kept coming loose and falling in my face.</li>
            <li> Does not slip as other clips that are made similar.  </li>
            <li> They do come as black, dark red, and gold, which is different from the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Unlike other clips, I don&#x27;t have to really dig into the base of my hair to get a secure grip.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that the black clips begin to chip after a couple of month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I still have a few left from the bundle I ordered in 2009</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding them in local stores</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is growing from a short cut</li>

            <li> , I BOUGHT IT FOR TAKING OUT SOME LITTLE HAIR I GOT LOSEN</li>
            <li> I just give the segment of hair a little twist before securing it with the clip, and I know that by the time I take it out at night</li>
            <li> I bought some clips like this a few years ago, and like hair clips do, they gradually disappeared.</li>
            <li> and I can use them to put a small section half up.</li>
            <li> But I usually just do one on each side of my hair.</li>
            <li> A hard to find style that I need to keep wisps away while I read or type.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> They are often hard to find, but when I find them, I stock up.</li>
            <li> hate when I lose one of these clips, they really are a must buy for me.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and try to jam a lot of it into these clips, hair gets stuck and you end up ripping it out of your head.</li>

            <li> A hard to find style that I need to keep wisps away while I read or type.  These work well enough despite the steep price, but after a short time the color is already chipping from some of them.</li>
            <li> They stay put and don&#x27;t slip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coating falls off on the colored ones though....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would want to buy a pack of all sliver next time if possible.</li>
            <li> Short enough to sit against my head and not poke out.  Wide enough to get a secure grip. Unlike other clips, I don&#x27;t have to really dig into the base of my hair to get a secure grip.  Stays in place if I don&#x27;t tug my hair around too much.  They last forever! I still have a few left from the bundle I ordered in 2009 and they still work great!  I have fine asian hair that doesn&#x27;t take well to curling or hair pins. I have tried a variety of hair clip types before, from the simple-1-prong metal snaps to those metal-pressure-held-slide-clip ones that hurt your fingers to remove to those super long snap clips. But this work best for my hair.  It&#x27;s a shame that these clips are so hard to find in stores, because more people ought to give them a try!  The only downside is that the black clips begin to chip after a couple of month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair in place.  Stays secure even if your hair is thin. Does not slip as other clips that are made similar.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love these simple clips.  I have thick, fine, straight hair and these are the only types of clips that will stay in my hair.  I have a hard time finding them in local stores so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Quality of the item is very good, but on fine thin hair like mine, they don&#x27;t hold well enough for all day use.</li>
            <li> IS A GOOD QUALITY SNAP CLIP AND YOUR HAIR WON´T GET OUT, BUT I THINK THEY ARE TOO BIG TO USE IT ON A DAILY BASIS, I BOUGHT IT FOR TAKING OUT SOME LITTLE HAIR I GOT LOSEN WHEN I DO MY PONY TAIL, BUT THIS ARE JUST TOO BIT FOR WHAT I NEED.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for hair clips like these for a very long time; I have found others of this same design but not of this same high quality material. They do come as black, dark red, and gold, which is different from the picture shown. I have long fine hair and this type of clip is the only one that will stay in my hair all day long and last through various activities. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty with bobby pins or the single pronged snap clips.</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked for these snap clips, and when I found them on Amazon, I had to buy!&lt;br /&gt;Although the shipping was more than the item, I decided to buy 2.&lt;br /&gt;Because I have thick hair, long bangs, I need this snap clip to hold my hair because other&lt;br /&gt;snap clips just don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I hate when I lose one of these clips, they really are a must buy for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome, but so expensive!</li>
            <li> Held my short hair in place. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I already had a couple and just needed a spare.  My hair is too thin for barrettes and bobby pins and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> perfect for holding thick hair in place</li>
            <li> Great hair clips. My hair is pretty straight and silky smooth so regular clips have a hard time making it stay point but these do the trick!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair I&#x27;ve been looking in stores and found these at amazon gave some away we all love them only thing that stays in my hair</li>
            <li> I love them! I&#x27;m always buying them! I use them in my ballet classes. It holds it and doesnt hurt!</li>
            <li> These are slightly smaller than I expected but they work great. I have medium length hair and I can use them to put a small section half up. But I usually just do one on each side of my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair and try to jam a lot of it into these clips, hair gets stuck and you end up ripping it out of your head. Ouch. The old Goody clips without the fold-over construction do not have this problem.</li>
            <li> These clips are great for holding back my bangs. I have thicker hair and most clips don&#x27;t hold so well. They don&#x27;t slip and hold all day! These are perfect and worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.. I first bought them at the walmart and I fell in love. I really take care of them. I been looking for them. almost for two years and today I found them again at the walmart, got me two  pcks of them. They hold and don&#x27;t pull and  they last forever..</li>
            <li> Nothing holds my hair all day but these clips. I used to be able to purchase them locally, but they have disappeared from shelves. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if Amazon stops carrying them, because for me, bobby pins and normal clips just don&#x27;t cut it. I&#x27;ve put these clips through all kinds of punishment and they never budge. The design is flawless, and the color options make them incredibly versatile. I&#x27;ve bought both sizes, the smaller ones for my bangs and the larger option for updo&#x27;s, and they both function equally well. I just give the segment of hair a little twist before securing it with the clip, and I know that by the time I take it out at night, every hair will still be where I put it that morning. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> These clips attach &amp; stay even in my thin very fine hair. I have looked for these in many stores but none have the &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; power these do.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and it&#x27;s always hard to fine clips that stay put.  These stay where I put them and stay all day.</li>
            <li> DCNL clips are outrageously good. They are often hard to find, but when I find them, I stock up. When a simple product like this can hold my hair in line all day long without hurting and pulling my hair out at the roots, it is sheer perfection. If you need clips to hold your style, you would do very well to try the DCNL Metal Snap Clip.</li>
            <li> They Shipped on time before promised date... and these are the  perfect set of clips!  They stay in your hair!</li>
            <li> I bought some clips like this a few years ago, and like hair clips do, they gradually disappeared. I was so excited to see these affordable clips on Amazon! The claw back really keeps these in place--I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them slipping or not gripping hair well enough. These are great for pinning back bangs. There is a nice variety of colors that should work for most hair colors (the gold might look a little weird with someone with dark/black hair, but it looks nice in my highlighted dark brown hair). I will definitely repurchase if I need to, but I&#x27;ll try to keep track of these!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for - I need the 3-prong snap to hold back my thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is growing from a short cut and when I pulled it back in a pony tail the shorter hair on the sides kept coming loose and falling in my face. I read other reviews that these clips really hold hair well so I tried them. They are easy to put in your hair and hold the hair you clip up securely and comfortably, however, when I looked at them later in the day I noticed that they are not large enough to hold all of the short hair I needed to pin up. I like the pairs of the same color as I wear one on each side, but now I will be looking for larger clips.</li>
