            <li>Good price for these &amp; worth it!</li>
            <li>As your filing you can see the grit turn to dust, at first I thought great</li>
            <li>I have bought them before from another seller and they were thicker and did a better job.  </li>
            <li>It is more like 40 grit.  </li>
            <li>Love them...</li>
            <li>I was using a finer grit before, this is much better for me.  </li>

            <li>The high grade of the sanding surface is great.  </li>
            <li>I do love that it is strong and it came in bulk</li>
            <li>They would be great for toenails or acrylic nails but not for natural fingernails.  </li>
            <li>these are super coarse and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Bend and break easy - don&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and recieved all 10</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>very gritty great boards</li>
            <li>but those r fantastic to they r sturdy and well built works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use these around the house for light sanding projects, too.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really a smooth side to buff nails with.</li>
            <li>Good files, do well on natural nails and gel.</li>
            <li>These are good quality but more coarse than I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>Okay, first of all...</li>
            <li>Sorry...I just can&#x27;t get excited about nail files.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good quality, slow delivery.</li>
            <li>Good for onychomycosis-thickened nails, to thin them and make them better looking as well as fitting better in closed-toe shoes.</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>These are really rough &amp; it&#x27;s great for me</li>
            <li>They are quite rough on both sides and great for acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>Good value and very coarse emery boards</li>
            <li>theyre hella good and really gritty</li>
            <li>Love zebra files,works very well.</li>
            <li>A true measur of 7inch  x.75inch.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful for those callussus you can&#x27;t get off any other way!!!!</li>
            <li>Lucky these were inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I break my nails often then chew them to the quick just out of nervous habit.</li>
            <li>These files work quickly too.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t hold your breath for quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great for filing down a nail; but you will need another file to finish it off.  </li>
            <li>These nail files are very sharp and are great for shaping my nails.</li>
            <li>I was looking for emery files for acrylic nails that would file fast &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and I just bought them &amp;#34;on the come.&amp;#34;  They don&#x27;t really have a fine grade side.</li>
            <li>as well many uses in auto restoration fine tuning plastic and similar console/stereo</li>
            <li>This is a great product for heavy calluses on my feet &amp; for me, my bowling hand.</li>
            <li>Coarse and effective.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>but this is way too powerful.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much,  I will order again.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Having my nails done makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li>Clearly these are cheap knockoffs made in &amp; shipped from China.</li>
            <li>Had enough liquid, but needed more files.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as describe.</li>
            <li>They took weeks to arrive from China, smelled funny, and deposited lots of board grit all over the place when used.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please to say that !</li>
            <li>This is a much better deal than buying them from a drug, beauty supply or big box store.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well...</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;zebra&amp;#34; nail files look different than the product photo - they are actually better.  </li>
            <li>You definitely don&#x27;t want to buy these if you&#x27;re looking for a file for natural nails but for other nails these are great!</li>
            <li>If you are interested in getting these for real nails, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>These are good if you really need to file off a lot of nail - but they are very coarse, and you will definitely need a gentler file for shaping and finishing.</li>
            <li>The nail file shape is different than the product photo too: more pointed on one end, more squared off corners on the other end.  </li>
            <li>They are extra tough and perfect for dog nails.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use them for my real nails</li>
            <li>Arrive fast via Prime add-on and as described.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine the need for them on real nails...</li>
            <li>Took a bit of  time to arrive from China, but at  35 cents each, this was a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never came across something so powerful, not even professional but industrial grade.</li>
            <li>They are different than other files I have and are more effective, in a different way than the others.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when these wear down.</li>
            <li>While they&#x27;re cheap enough, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if you&#x27;re using them professionally as u&#x27;ll go thru them like water.</li>
            <li>I use them on my feet to smooth out rough patches, as well as on my nails.</li>
            <li>Not to rough and not too smooth...</li>
            <li>: I do not like these files at all, they have way to much grit for natural fingernails.</li>
            <li>Hey, okay so I&#x27;m a healthcare provider for inmates in a state prison and see the end results of mindless disregard of self-care.  </li>
            <li>Good for shortening long, thick nails, but a finer grit will be necessary to smooth the edges.  </li>
            <li>has no alternate fine grade on the second side</li>
            <li>They are quite effective on tough toenails, and in fact, nail clippers are not needed that much.</li>
            <li>Cut them down and they work fine as disposables to use with the Scholl kit.</li>
            <li>Crisp files, very durable, and doesn&#x27;t wear out as fast as the cheap thin ones from cos or rite aid..</li>
            <li>These are very professional Nail files.  </li>
            <li>these are ok, but I should have know what grit I was actually looking for when I got these; they have a little too much grit.</li>
            <li>What a great bargain-I highly recommend if you need to file down thick nails.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why many of the reviews say that this is &amp;</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Great for artificial nails.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy for natural nails..</li>
            <li>These grey emery boards are professional quality and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Not thick like pictured, thinner like the old school emery boards, but bigger and do work well!</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>High quality,but may be a bit aggressive with first few uses.last</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you&#x27;re looking for industrial grade nail file, go for it but make sure not to take your eye off of your nail for a second and take it slow unlike me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but way to rough</li>
            <li>There was hardly any wear at all on the emery board after that, so I know I will be able to use this 10-pack for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit rough, and wear down fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>for the occasional mutant toenail as described by a previous reviewer, and &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for quickly smoothing rough edges after a fingernail trim.  </li>
            <li>Works great for filing down length or artificial nails.</li>

            <li> These are really rough &amp; it&#x27;s great for me</li>
            <li> They are quite rough on both sides and great for acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Good value and very coarse emery boards</li>
            <li> theyre hella good and really gritty</li>
            <li> Love zebra files,works very well.</li>
            <li> A true measur of 7inch  x.75inch.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for those callussus you can&#x27;t get off any other way!!!!</li>
            <li> Lucky these were inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I break my nails often then chew them to the quick just out of nervous habit.</li>
            <li> These files work quickly too.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t hold your breath for quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Great for filing down a nail; but you will need another file to finish it off.  </li>
            <li> These nail files are very sharp and are great for shaping my nails.</li>
            <li> I was looking for emery files for acrylic nails that would file fast &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and I just bought them &amp;#34;on the come.&amp;#34;  They don&#x27;t really have a fine grade side.</li>
            <li> as well many uses in auto restoration fine tuning plastic and similar console/stereo</li>
            <li> This is a great product for heavy calluses on my feet &amp; for me, my bowling hand.</li>
            <li> Coarse and effective.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> but this is way too powerful.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much,  I will order again.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Having my nails done makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li> Clearly these are cheap knockoffs made in &amp; shipped from China.</li>
            <li> Had enough liquid, but needed more files.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as describe.</li>
            <li> They took weeks to arrive from China, smelled funny, and deposited lots of board grit all over the place when used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very please to say that !</li>
            <li> This is a much better deal than buying them from a drug, beauty supply or big box store.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well...</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;zebra&amp;#34; nail files look different than the product photo - they are actually better.  </li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t want to buy these if you&#x27;re looking for a file for natural nails but for other nails these are great!</li>
            <li> If you are interested in getting these for real nails, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are good if you really need to file off a lot of nail - but they are very coarse, and you will definitely need a gentler file for shaping and finishing.</li>
            <li> The nail file shape is different than the product photo too: more pointed on one end, more squared off corners on the other end.  </li>
            <li> They are extra tough and perfect for dog nails.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use them for my real nails</li>
            <li> Arrive fast via Prime add-on and as described.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the need for them on real nails...</li>
            <li> Took a bit of  time to arrive from China, but at  35 cents each, this was a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never came across something so powerful, not even professional but industrial grade.</li>
            <li> They are different than other files I have and are more effective, in a different way than the others.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when these wear down.</li>
            <li> While they&#x27;re cheap enough, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if you&#x27;re using them professionally as u&#x27;ll go thru them like water.</li>
            <li> I use them on my feet to smooth out rough patches, as well as on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not to rough and not too smooth...</li>
            <li> : I do not like these files at all, they have way to much grit for natural fingernails.</li>
            <li> Hey, okay so I&#x27;m a healthcare provider for inmates in a state prison and see the end results of mindless disregard of self-care.  </li>
            <li> Good for shortening long, thick nails, but a finer grit will be necessary to smooth the edges.  </li>
            <li> has no alternate fine grade on the second side</li>
            <li> They are quite effective on tough toenails, and in fact, nail clippers are not needed that much.</li>
            <li> Cut them down and they work fine as disposables to use with the Scholl kit.</li>
            <li> Crisp files, very durable, and doesn&#x27;t wear out as fast as the cheap thin ones from cos or rite aid..</li>
            <li> These are very professional Nail files.  </li>
            <li> these are ok, but I should have know what grit I was actually looking for when I got these; they have a little too much grit.</li>
            <li> What a great bargain-I highly recommend if you need to file down thick nails.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why many of the reviews say that this is &amp;</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Great for artificial nails.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy for natural nails..</li>
            <li> These grey emery boards are professional quality and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Not thick like pictured, thinner like the old school emery boards, but bigger and do work well!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> High quality,but may be a bit aggressive with first few uses.last</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you&#x27;re looking for industrial grade nail file, go for it but make sure not to take your eye off of your nail for a second and take it slow unlike me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but way to rough</li>
            <li> There was hardly any wear at all on the emery board after that, so I know I will be able to use this 10-pack for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit rough, and wear down fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> for the occasional mutant toenail as described by a previous reviewer, and &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for quickly smoothing rough edges after a fingernail trim.  </li>
            <li> Works great for filing down length or artificial nails.</li>
            <li> I tried many in the past but they were always either dull, peeled off, or separated.</li>
            <li> Just be very VERY careful on natural nails.</li>
            <li> Just received the file today (8-5-15)  to flat not what is being shown in picture.</li>
            <li> They look like they will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As a result, they won&#x27;t last long in regular use &amp; will likely need to be trashed well before the file part has worn down enough to discard.</li>
            <li> I was told by my dermatologist that he could remove it, but it would likely grow back the same way, so I should have someone file down the nail to reduce the thickness.  </li>
            <li> These should last a long time!!</li>
            <li> These files are professional size, and the surface is not too harsh for finishing tips of nails.  </li>
            <li> The file surface is the same on both sides, ROUGH.</li>
            <li> just enough grit for rough edges...</li>
            <li> They are thick and have little grit on one side and are smooth on the other.</li>
            <li> They were smaller in width than I expected and not as rough as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I have to spend up to 5-10 minutes just shaping a single nail with the crappy grit on this file.</li>
            <li> cause the boards always die long before I think they should!!</li>
            <li> It sizzled so bad for many days.</li>
            <li> Not as course as I expected</li>
            <li> It leaves too rough a finish.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have a big toenail that was injured some 15 years  ago by dropping heavy boards on it</li>
            <li> Wanted a rough emery board.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes and a pile of nail dust, my mutant toenail is the same thickness as my other nails.  </li>
            <li> A little long in arrival but no problem.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers mentioned these are &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; boards.</li>
            <li> sharp edges fingers</li>
            <li> Very rough grit.</li>
            <li> Very rough</li>
            <li> These are &#x27;100&#x27; grit and will file down your toenails, quickly, without provoking the damage done by nail &amp;#34;clippers&#x27;, which are hideously dangerous.  </li>
            <li> these files are too harsh or  rough to file your nails  you could use them for something other than nails......</li>
            <li> These may not be meant for conventional nail filing</li>
            <li> have to try a little harder on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Dont push too hard or you wont have nail left.</li>
            <li> Thin and flimsy and don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they seem to sharpen nails rather than file them.</li>
            <li> The grit is wright for filing down my nails ,like the length.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the black one from Trim seems stronger.</li>
            <li> (I am clumsy with medium &amp; long nails &amp; gouge everything.)</li>
            <li> thick enough to file down thick toenails with.</li>
            <li> They work on real and artificial nails.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They arrived within a few days and were delivered with my reg. mail.  </li>
            <li> These nail files are ridiculously harsh.</li>
            <li> The file was used up within v a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> One day I was filing my broken nail (it was long/average length) and I looked away from my nail for a second to talk to my mom and it cut my finger underneath.</li>
            <li> They file unevenly.</li>
            <li> They are not flimsy like some that have thin cardboard in the center.</li>
            <li> the small emery boards just could not cut it like these do.</li>
            <li> The file itself is as expected, but these are paper thin &amp; bend/fold with the least amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> These are really hard surface</li>
            <li> Worked well on thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> these buff down the fake tips and acrylic just like a nail gun does</li>
            <li> So I file the acrylics down which requires a very tough grit.</li>
            <li> No good for nails.</li>
            <li> this babies are tough....</li>
            <li> tough nail</li>
            <li> These are tough and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with these files</li>
            <li> They dont leave a lot of residue behind, and even if they did because of the color there is no trace of it.</li>
            <li> and my nail has been really, really thick, blackish, and almost impossible to trim since.  </li>
            <li> but they are definitely wrong.</li>
            <li> Now i have 10 of these laying around that ill</li>
            <li> They are very thin.  </li>
            <li> Too hard, these must be for artificial nails, they just make my nails split terribly bad :(</li>
            <li> These files have a lite grit that if you have artificial nails</li>
            <li> Literally, you are wasting your money :(</li>
            <li> A lot of dust come off, smell very bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as course as I expected</li>
            <li> Wonderful files. Crisp files, very durable, and doesn&#x27;t wear out as fast as the cheap thin ones from cos or rite aid..</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers mentioned these are &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; boards. You should also order some of the finer standard ones.</li>
            <li> These nail files are very sharp and are great for shaping my nails.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> They are very thin.  I have bought them before from another seller and they were thicker and did a better job.  I wouldn&#x27;t order these again.</li>
            <li> Good files, do well on natural nails and gel. I wish one of the sides was finer.</li>
            <li> has no alternate fine grade on the second side</li>
            <li> Finally received emery board they are just has advertised.</li>
            <li> Good item with a great price.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Great files</li>
            <li> A VERY NICE SIMPLE ENJOYABLE PERCHISE</li>
            <li> the best nail file that I ever used.</li>
            <li> These are really hard surface so they handle strong nails.  I use them on my feet to smooth out rough patches, as well as on my nails.</li>
            <li> I wanted a strong file and boy these are strong! You definitely don&#x27;t want to buy these if you&#x27;re looking for a file for natural nails but for other nails these are great!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but way to rough although I do like them to shape my acrylic nails. Really good for the price I wouldn&#x27;t use them for my real nails</li>
            <li> Not thick like pictured, thinner like the old school emery boards, but bigger and do work well! No padding though. Thickness of actual item doesn&#x27;t match photos.</li>
            <li> Great for filing down a nail; but you will need another file to finish it off.  It leaves too rough a finish.</li>
            <li> Very rough grit. Works great for filing down length or artificial nails. Just be very VERY careful on natural nails. Lasting quality! You&#x27;ll misplace one before you need to replace!</li>
            <li> this is not a nail FILE. it&#x27;s a SCRAPER. I don&#x27;t know who named this product but they are definitely wrong. People who wanna buy this please don&#x27;t. Literally, you are wasting your money :(</li>
            <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Looks to be a handy and functional set of files.  Good Price too !</li>
            <li> These are very very coarse.  They actually can tear up nails, says my wife.  Moral of the story is 100 grit in a nail file is nothing like 100 sandpaper.  It is more like 40 grit.  Lucky these were inexpensive.  I will use in the shop to file stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gadget</li>
            <li> really strong great files. for  &#x27;heavier jobs&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am not sure why many of the reviews say that this is &amp;#34;too strong&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;works too well&amp;#34;. It does the job, but the black one from Trim seems stronger. This is fine for my finger nails ... have to try a little harder on my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good price.  A little long in arrival but no problem.</li>
            <li> Good price for these &amp; worth it!</li>
            <li> No good for nails. You can grind your calaises with these.</li>
            <li> Love them...I was using a finer grit before, this is much better for me.  Arrive fast via Prime add-on and as described.  Made in America!  WOOT!</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all... These files don&#x27;t look ANYTHING like they are pictured here. They are thick and have little grit on one side and are smooth on the other. They do not shape my nails AT ALL. I have to spend up to 5-10 minutes just shaping a single nail with the crappy grit on this file. I do not recommend these if you want a nice file to shape your nails with. I get better files for $1 at the dollar store. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great quality as described. Love these.</li>
            <li> thick enough to file down thick toenails with. And a great price for a pack of ten. Cannot complain.</li>
            <li> Dont push too hard or you wont have nail left. Lol</li>
            <li> Worked well on thick toenails.  Better than struggling with sissors.</li>
            <li> These files are professional size, and the surface is not too harsh for finishing tips of nails.  They arrived within a few days and were delivered with my reg. mail.  They are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love it because it because  I can do my own nails.  I do the gel nails and I save a lot of money doing it my self and when I want them.  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Too hard, these must be for artificial nails, they just make my nails split terribly bad :( I wont buy them again</li>
            <li> Arrived Aug 13, 2015  Nail Files Product as described</li>
            <li> These nail files are ridiculously harsh. I can&#x27;t imagine the need for them on real nails...</li>
            <li> I was looking for emery files for acrylic nails that would file fast &amp; easy. I break my nails often then chew them to the quick just out of nervous habit. Not all the time but when I go through the phase &amp; my nails are sore I wear acrylics till the phase passes. It is an ongoing cycle that requires constant vigilance &amp; application of nails. Because I do a lot of yard work &amp; work constantly at a computer my acrylic nails have to be short (I am clumsy with medium &amp; long nails &amp; gouge everything.) So I file the acrylics down which requires a very tough grit. These zebra files work perfectly &amp; save me time as I can file quickly &amp; get on with tasks.</li>
            <li> They were smaller in width than I expected and not as rough as I thought they would be. Still a good buy for the price. They work on real and artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Coarse and effective.</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  Good value and very coarse emery boards like I wanted.  Thank you very much,  I will order again.</li>
            <li> High quality,but may be a bit aggressive with first few uses.last a good while .very use full as substitute for hobby sanding,model filing,stiff does not load with paint or filler highly reliable for woodworking as well many uses in auto restoration fine tuning plastic and similar console/stereo installs.a must have for every individual,and the seller I bought from had great prices affordable and reliable.</li>
            <li> depends what you need it for...this babies are tough....grind your wall with this babies if you want.....sand your bike sand your head...do what you want.</li>
            <li> theyre hella good and really gritty</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and I can not get these in the Alaska Bush.  I taught myself how to do acrillic nails before I left the lower 48.  Having my nails done makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li> These files have a lite grit that if you have artificial nails it&#x27;s not that great.  As your filing you can see the grit turn to dust, at first I thought great it&#x27;s doing what I want,  but after looking at the file I realized the grit had turned to dust.  The file was used up within v a few minutes. So when I need files like this again it will not be these.  It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are great!  The high grade of the sanding surface is great.  You can&#x27;t beat the value either.  It&#x27;s waaaay better than the stuff you can buy at Target/Walmart/CVS and it&#x27;s cheaper too.  I will buy more when these wear down.</li>
            <li> Bend and break easy - don&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> Wish I could return them! The file surface is the same on both sides, ROUGH. It&#x27;s like 80 grit sandpaper you&#x27;d use with a belt sander, I&#x27;m not joking</li>
            <li> These are just perfect for what I need.  I have a big toenail that was injured some 15 years  ago by dropping heavy boards on it and my nail has been really, really thick, blackish, and almost impossible to trim since.  I was told by my dermatologist that he could remove it, but it would likely grow back the same way, so I should have someone file down the nail to reduce the thickness.  I&#x27;d rather do it myself so after some research decided on these emery boards.  Wow!  After a few minutes and a pile of nail dust, my mutant toenail is the same thickness as my other nails.  There was hardly any wear at all on the emery board after that, so I know I will be able to use this 10-pack for a long, long time.  What a great bargain-I highly recommend if you need to file down thick nails.</li>
            <li> These grey emery boards are professional quality and exactly what I wanted. Not to rough and not too smooth... just right! Took a bit of  time to arrive from China, but at  35 cents each, this was a real bargain. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> these are ok, but I should have know what grit I was actually looking for when I got these; they have a little too much grit.</li>
            <li> Clearly these are cheap knockoffs made in &amp; shipped from China. Had I known beforehand ... oh well! The file itself is as expected, but these are paper thin &amp; bend/fold with the least amount of pressure. As a result, they won&#x27;t last long in regular use &amp; will likely need to be trashed well before the file part has worn down enough to discard. While they&#x27;re cheap enough, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these if you&#x27;re using them professionally as u&#x27;ll go thru them like water. It&#x27;s a trade off I guess.</li>
            <li> If you know about brand you know about nails!! This is OPI FILES i did not expect that!! Beautiful work!! reccomend my costumers LOVE my job with these!!</li>
            <li> Love zebra files,works very well. Will order again.</li>
            <li> They work well and are gritty so it shapes your nails easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED: I do not like these files at all, they have way to much grit for natural fingernails. If you are interested in getting these for real nails, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Work nicely on toenails.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted a.strong but tough nail so i can my. nails faster so wil odwr thw product again</li>
            <li> Bought it to use as replacement files for the Scholl Fungal Nail Treatment.  Had enough liquid, but needed more files.  Cut them down and they work fine as disposables to use with the Scholl kit.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful for those callussus you can&#x27;t get off any other way!!!! Very rough</li>
            <li> These are really rough &amp; it&#x27;s great for me cause the boards always die long before I think they should!! These should last a long time!!</li>
            <li> Sephora quality without the price tag... just enough grit for rough edges... I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> finally a good quality set of files. thank you for your business.</li>
            <li> They are great! The price was fabulous and they are a good quality emery board. so glad i found them</li>
            <li> I use them on my dogs nails after they are trimmed.  They are a bit rough, and wear down fairly quickly.  I go through one per dog each time.</li>
            <li> I like the files.  They are different than other files I have and are more effective, in a different way than the others.</li>
            <li> Whatever. It&#x27;s a nail file and it files nails.</li>
            <li> In this set we received 10 files from the company O.P.I, very very good</li>
            <li> Best for toenails but for that purpose these are perfect.  These are &#x27;100&#x27; grit and will file down your toenails, quickly, without provoking the damage done by nail &amp;#34;clippers&#x27;, which are hideously dangerous.  Toenail fungus anyone? Go ahead, if you dare but my advice is to file away and save time and your nails.

            <li> file the nail on the spot. Nice and well used here in my home.</li>
            <li> work for what i need--toes/sharp edges fingers</li>
            <li> Just received the file today (8-5-15)  to flat not what is being shown in picture. never will but again</li>
            <li> These are very professional Nail files.  They look like they will last for a long time.  I am very happy with acquiring the set and know I will get a lot of miles from them.</li>
            <li> Thin and flimsy and don&#x27;t last long at all. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice product,fast shipping!!!Thanks))</li>
            <li> These are fantastic nail files. They are not flimsy like some that have thin cardboard in the center. These are tough and get the job done.  They are quite effective on tough toenails, and in fact, nail clippers are not needed that much. These files work quickly too. Good product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very gritty great boards i love them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quit get the zebra nail files I got o.p.i. but those r fantastic to they r sturdy and well built works fantastic. Easy to handle and recieved all 10</li>
            <li> I bought these to do my dachshunds nails as he HATES nail clippers. They are extra tough and perfect for dog nails.</li>
            <li> Great and Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> Great product and good service!</li>
            <li> I do my own acrylics at home and since I do not have a nail file that is battery operated or electric I do all of the filing by hand these are super coarse and work perfectly. I would definatelybuy them again.</li>
            <li> Good for shortening long, thick nails, but a finer grit will be necessary to smooth the edges.  Good for onychomycosis-thickened nails, to thin them and make them better looking as well as fitting better in closed-toe shoes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these files</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> These seemed like a good bargain. They took weeks to arrive from China, smelled funny, and deposited lots of board grit all over the place when used. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> These may not be meant for conventional nail filing and I just bought them &amp;#34;on the come.&amp;#34;  They don&#x27;t really have a fine grade side.</li>
            <li> I loved it ! Got on time and I&#x27;m very please to say that ! Thank you !!</li>
            <li> This is a much better deal than buying them from a drug, beauty supply or big box store.  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Good price, good quality, slow delivery.</li>
            <li> these files are too harsh or  rough to file your nails  you could use them for something other than nails......</li>
            <li> Strong and sturdy files.  Great for artificial nails.  I use these around the house for light sanding projects, too.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> Nice grainy files. They dont leave a lot of residue behind, and even if they did because of the color there is no trace of it. Im happy with the value as well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. This is a great product for heavy calluses on my feet &amp; for me, my bowling hand. the small emery boards just could not cut it like these do.</li>
            <li> Wanted a rough emery board. This is definitely rougher than what I had before!</li>
            <li> These are good if you really need to file off a lot of nail - but they are very coarse, and you will definitely need a gentler file for shaping and finishing.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Sorry...I just can&#x27;t get excited about nail files.  They came from overseas (yes, China) so don&#x27;t hold your breath for quick delivery.  Good deal for count/dollars.</li>
            <li> The grit is wright for filing down my nails ,like the length.A true measur of 7inch  x.75inch.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted. They are quite rough on both sides and great for acrylic nails. A great purchase at a good price.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well... My only complaint is that they seem to sharpen nails rather than file them. There isn&#x27;t really a smooth side to buff nails with.</li>
            <li> I love getting my nails done as well as doing my own nails. I needed a nail file that can actually FILE. I tried many in the past but they were always either dull, peeled off, or separated. So, I started a hunt. I came across this on Amazon and with the great reviews and the price, I went for it. Now, the thing is though, I wanted a nail FILE, this was almost a nail SCRAPER. I&#x27;ve never came across something so powerful, not even professional but industrial grade. I do love that it is strong and it came in bulk so I added two stars but this is way too powerful. One day I was filing my broken nail (it was long/average length) and I looked away from my nail for a second to talk to my mom and it cut my finger underneath. It sizzled so bad for many days. Therefore, if you&#x27;re looking for industrial grade nail file, go for it but make sure not to take your eye off of your nail for a second and take it slow unlike me. I&#x27;ve learned.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to do some beautiful acrylic nails these buff down the fake tips and acrylic just like a nail gun does</li>
            <li> Nice to feel and doesn&#x27;t snag on my skin. Files my nails well and it has a great price.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;zebra&amp;#34; nail files look different than the product photo - they are actually better.  The grit label reads 100 / 180 unlike the 100 / 100 in the product description, so you get &amp;#34;good and rough&amp;#34; for the occasional mutant toenail as described by a previous reviewer, and &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for quickly smoothing rough edges after a fingernail trim.  The nail file shape is different than the product photo too: more pointed on one end, more squared off corners on the other end.  Also there are the initials &amp;#34;O . P . I&amp;#34; printed on the files.  They were mailed to me from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> A lot of dust come off, smell very bad. Doubt about It might do harm to Heath, so I return it immediately</li>
            <li> These files destroyed my nails.  They file unevenly.</li>
            <li> Do not buy for natural nails.. The grit is way to high......tore up my nails. Now i have 10 of these laying around that ill likely never use</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose. Nothing too great to write home about.</li>
            <li> If  you want a nail file that has  100  grit on both sides,  this  one  is  it.&lt;br /&gt;And  to  get  10  for  $2.50  including  postage  is a great  bargain.</li>
            <li> These are good quality but more coarse than I thought they would be.  They would be great for toenails or acrylic nails but not for natural fingernails.  I kept them to use on my toes.</li>
