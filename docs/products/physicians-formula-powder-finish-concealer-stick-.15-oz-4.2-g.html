    <ol>
            <li>I use this as an &amp;#34;under the eyebrow&amp;#34; highlighter, as well as under eye concealer, it&#x27;s awesome for that.  </li>
            <li>wonderful formula .</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my makeup and flawless look.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>It also gives you a very soft perfect skin look.</li>
            <li>good coverage and cheap price</li>
            <li>I love this concealer because of the powder finish.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Mostly does the job.</li>
            <li>So I was glad to come across this at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product that is why I ordered three.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more creamy.  </li>
            <li>I loved this so much!</li>
            <li>got my product very quick.</li>
            <li>I got the product very quick;  excelllent</li>
            <li>but it covers just fine.</li>
            <li>This product does a fantastic job neutralizing the darker circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The yellow color is the best for concealing dark eye circles, and this product goes on very easily and thoroughly (unlike some powder concealers I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>I find yellow concealers cover so much better than the flesh colored ones.  </li>
            <li>eyes look younger and my face more awake.  </li>
            <li>My local drugstores don&#x27;t carry this concealer anymore - I&#x27;m so glad to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gotten around to purchasing more, but I used the hell out of my last one.</li>
            <li>To be gentle to your eyes and help the ease of blending, apply a dot of your regular liquid concealer or moisturizer on top of this product before blending.</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;ve had good luck with Physicians Formula, but I threw this away.</li>
            <li>This yellow concealer covers my dark circles perfectly on my medium-dark Asian skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying moisturizer, I dab a bit of the Physicians Formula Yellow Stick Concealer in the corner of my eye and underneath then lightly blend with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>It also covers my mild red cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have to rub it on my finger first then tap it on, but it is so dry it doesn&#x27;t go on very well.  </li>
            <li>Not easy to find anymore in the stick form either, which is so ultra easy to use.  </li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was really thick to put on and really had to blend it in, other than that, it looked so nice.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged, the hereditary dark circles under my eyes have gotten more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>When I do manage to get it on, it doesn&#x27;t really cover the dark circle very well.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of oil-free products because of my sensitive skin and this is the only brand I found that delivers.</li>
            <li>I have very dark circles under my eyes and this product hides them very well.  </li>

            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes and this product hides them very well.  </li>
            <li> Lastly if needed, a bit of skin toned concealer in the dark circle</li>
            <li> but I asked for green concealer and got a yellow one</li>
            <li> This one goes on smoothly and thoroughly covers dark areas under the eyes, those annoying dark spots on my face and general skin blotches that are dark or red.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other conealers are so greasy that it makes your eyeliner smudge</li>
            <li> I would never use any other concealer.</li>
            <li> The stick is very firm as if it&#x27;s too dry which makes it difficult to smooth on in the delicate under eye area.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps mine are too dark to cover.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years it helps hide my dark circle under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Somewhat thick consistency.</li>
            <li> It is a little dry, but not as bad as another brand I tried.</li>
            <li> When I buy these I buy them in bulk because I am so afraid they will stop making them some day.</li>

            <li> I love this concealer because of the powder finish. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and keeps your eyeliner in place all day! Other conealers are so greasy that it makes your eyeliner smudge but this one doesn&#x27;t. It also gives you a very soft perfect skin look. I get so many compliments on my makeup and flawless look. I love it. I would never use any other concealer. When I buy these I buy them in bulk because I am so afraid they will stop making them some day. I don&#x27;t ever want to get caught with out it.</li>
            <li> I find yellow concealers cover so much better than the flesh colored ones.  This one goes on smoothly and thoroughly covers dark areas under the eyes, those annoying dark spots on my face and general skin blotches that are dark or red. I carry this in my purse as a must-have cosmetic.</li>
            <li> good coverage and cheap price</li>

            <li> I have very dark circles under my eyes and this product hides them very well.  Is a staple to my makeup regime.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, the hereditary dark circles under my eyes have gotten more pronounced.  This product does a fantastic job neutralizing the darker circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying moisturizer, I dab a bit of the Physicians Formula Yellow Stick Concealer in the corner of my eye and underneath then lightly blend with my fingertips.  Next comes the SPF foundation making a point to apply and blend under my eyes.  Lastly if needed, a bit of skin toned concealer in the dark circle area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look younger and my face more awake.  Excellent product that I highly recommend!</li>

            <li> This yellow concealer covers my dark circles perfectly on my medium-dark Asian skin. Nothing else has ever worked this well. It also covers my mild red cheeks. I am a fan of oil-free products because of my sensitive skin and this is the only brand I found that delivers. A little goes a long way. It is a little dry, but not as bad as another brand I tried. TIP: To be gentle to your eyes and help the ease of blending, apply a dot of your regular liquid concealer or moisturizer on top of this product before blending.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I wish it was a tad bit creamer but it covers just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice but I asked for green concealer and got a yellow one</li>
            <li> I have facial redness from rosacea, and this concealer did not work. It disappeared into my skin and didn&#x27;t improve the redness at all. Also it was greasy. Usually I&#x27;ve had good luck with Physicians Formula, but I threw this away.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much! Haven&#x27;t gotten around to purchasing more, but I used the hell out of my last one. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it was really thick to put on and really had to blend it in, other than that, it looked so nice.</li>
