            <li>The smallest size is one I will probably never use but would be great for a kid or someone with short, fine hair.  </li>

            <li>This product truly is the fun bun!</li>
            <li>so I use the largest one, it works great and it definitely makes my hair look good on a no-wash running late kind of day.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for a neat bun when I&#x27;m running late for work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like since my hair doesn&#x27;t grip as easily as when I first used this product.</li>
            <li>The different sizes are perfect for different ages or bun sizes.</li>
            <li>Good colour that blends in well with my hair and the smaller two are great sizes while the large is pretty massive.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thin hair and these work so great to give her a full looking bun!!</li>
            <li>* at first!</li>
            <li>and it looks more professional , as if she went to a hair salon.</li>
            <li>I am adding pics of all 3 sizes, which are nice to give different volume depending on which look you are going for!</li>
            <li>A hair donut is a styling device that helps create a full fashionable bun that looks perfect for both casual and formal occasions.</li>
            <li>The three different sizes made it simple to create many different beautiful hair styles that you can wear for any occasion from exercising all the way to weddings.</li>
            <li>Then you just need a couple of bobbie pins to hold it all in place , it is so simple with such a great effect .I</li>
            <li>She said it stayed tight and perfect all day long , even with training.</li>
            <li>I love having three different sizes depending upon the size bun I want or the style I am going for.</li>
            <li>It is so simple to use to create an elegant hair bun.  </li>
            <li>Plus it makes it look like I have more hair than I actually do!</li>
            <li>and I used the largest at first.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and it rolled up quickly, easily and neatly as seen in the photo attached.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and my buns were always pretty tiny and never held shapeâ€¦ever.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new, fun ways to wear my hair.  </li>
            <li>.These are really simple and easy to use , just grab your hair as if you are going to make a ponytail .They</li>
            <li>It came with three sizes but my photos are of the large bun..</li>
            <li>I use the medium sometimes and the large almost every time.  </li>
            <li>This really helped.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>So I ordered the brown ones and they match my hair color very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are fabulous hair accessories , for doing your hair for different occasions</li>
            <li>On the other hand for my 12 year old sister it worked just as it should and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>For a night out, I like to make the bun a little more carefree looking by leaving some of the hair loose around bun for a more tousled look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes a bun so simple and clean looking.  </li>
            <li>I have medium fine, long, wavy hair</li>
            <li>Such an easy way to do your hair, especially in those moments where you need to hurry and get ready!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product over all, My Daughter has thick, curly hair and this bun maker just doesn&#x27;t use enough of the length of it.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old and 3 year old both use them and they make the right size bun for their size.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend saving your money.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I just throw it up in a messy bun, but I have started to notice that it is causing my hair to break, and I did not want that.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair, and 3 kids, those 2 just don&#x27;t go together.</li>
            <li>Since I live in tropical weather, I like to wear my hair in the bun very frequently.  </li>
            <li>Bun looks like a professional hairdresser&#x27;s masterpiece!  </li>
            <li>For work, you can keep an elegant bun when you use styling gel or mousse for a slick, neat looking bun.  </li>
            <li>This is a product where you can get a professional look by doing it yourself , this is a must for everyone woman to have in your hairstyling kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was later informed you can purchase the same product, at a higher quality, for $2 a piece at target.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m looking for one a little bigger for right now.</li>
            <li>I like this one because my hair is not long</li>
            <li>These work really well a handful of times and then stretch out and become less functional.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m looking for one a little bigger for right now.</li>

            <li> These work really well a handful of times and then stretch out and become less functional.</li>
            <li> I moved to the middle size and that&#x27;s now too stretched to function properly.</li>
            <li> You will receive 3 hair donuts one large 8-9cm diameter, medium 7-8cm diameter, and small 6-7cm diameter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She normally just makes an ordinary bun, but finds it comes lose later in the day</li>
            <li> , I never thought it was possible, but this has saved me time and money ( on hair ties) and I will never go back to the old messy bun again!</li>
            <li> Still need to practice a little on my 6 year old for her recital</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I put my hair up in a high ponytail and pulled my ponytail through the donut, I then splayed my hair evenly covering it and then tucked and wrapped my hair under slowly.</li>
            <li> Buns were a little smaller than I originally expected.  </li>
            <li> Or, can also be used as a loose bun with tousled hair on your way out to the beach, yoga, or a run!</li>
            <li> Be warned that they do stretch out a bit after a few uses, but the three sizes mean you can generally just swap to a smaller one.</li>
            <li> But for my hair, long, coarse and thick, did not work that well.</li>
            <li> Now since my hair is so long, and I have all those little baby hairs all over my hair line, I use some hair gel on my hair and then ran a brush through it.</li>

            <li> Work well for dance class up-dos</li>
            <li> I love this product! Forget an elegant updo... I&#x27;m a mom and have five minutes to get my hair done!. Literally took me one minute! I pulled it through like a ponytail and wrapped my hair to cover bun.. couple bobbypins and off for the day! I was so tired of the rushed mommy messy bun.. this is a great look and super fast and cheap! Great for rushing to work and still looking good! It came with three sizes but my photos are of the large bun.. I like this one because my hair is not long so it gives me more volume.</li>
            <li> These are so great! Such an easy way to do your hair, especially in those moments where you need to hurry and get ready! Love the different sizes as well, gives me more diversity!</li>
            <li> Super happy with this purchase. I have fine hair and my buns were always pretty tiny and never held shapeâ€¦ever. This really helped.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes a bun so simple and clean looking.  Still need to practice a little on my 6 year old for her recital but it was easy to do it in my own hair.</li>
            <li> Nicely done, bit does not work for all hair. I used the smallest one for my daughter&#x27;s ballet class. She has silky straight medium-short length hair and it worked great for her bun. But for my hair, long, coarse and thick, did not work that well. I used the largest one. Still I like it, because it is great for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other brands to use in my hair yo attempt the perfect bun and nothing has worked...until I ordered these! I love having three different sizes depending upon the size bun I want or the style I am going for. The quality is great and they match my hair color.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of making the perfect bun with these 3 size donut bun makers!  Perfect for quick up due!! Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> These work great. The different sizes are perfect for different ages or bun sizes. My 12 year old and 3 year old both use them and they make the right size bun for their size. My girls want more!!</li>
            <li> Sizes on these seem a little misleading. I thought the largest would be bigger. It&#x27;s only about the size of the Palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> Very durable great value</li>
            <li> The Hair Donut Bun Maker is a great tool for creating the perfect bun - girls, teens, college students, and women!  Bun looks like a professional hairdresser&#x27;s masterpiece!  Very easy and quick - here are some hints: 1. Use wet hair or mousse or gel to get a slick look, 2. Use bobby pins to secure hair in place as you wrap hair around the bun maker, 3. Dress it up with flowers or hair jewels for a dazzling look!  Perfect to use for a formal dance recital, prom, wedding, or any special occasion!  Or, can also be used as a loose bun with tousled hair on your way out to the beach, yoga, or a run!</li>
            <li> I have super long hair, and 3 kids, those 2 just don&#x27;t go together. Most of the time I just throw it up in a messy bun, but I have started to notice that it is causing my hair to break, and I did not want that. I had heard about hair donuts so I went on the search for a great price and something that would match my hair color. When I found this 3 piece Hair Donut Bun Maker by Wleec, I knew that they were going to be great with the quality and colors they had. So I ordered the brown ones and they match my hair color very well. Now since my hair is so long, and I have all those little baby hairs all over my hair line, I use some hair gel on my hair and then ran a brush through it. Then I easily put the hair donut in my hair and BAM there was like a perfect little bun. So you can have a perfect bun in minutes and it looks amazing, I never thought it was possible, but this has saved me time and money ( on hair ties) and I will never go back to the old messy bun again!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product over all, My Daughter has thick, curly hair and this bun maker just doesn&#x27;t use enough of the length of it. I followed a tutorial and braided the ends, wrapping them around the bun, and they dwarfed the bun itself. I like this but I&#x27;m looking for one a little bigger for right now. On the other hand for my 12 year old sister it worked just as it should and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my little sister, and not only did they have a horrible chemical smell when we opened the package, but one unraveled after the first use. I was later informed you can purchase the same product, at a higher quality, for $2 a piece at target. So I highly recommend saving your money.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE these!  I use all the different sizes depending on what style I want to achieve.  Worth every penny!  Saves me time in the morning b/c it only takes a couple minutes to do.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic product for your hair.This product is a Wleec beauty hair donut bun maker.A hair donut is a styling device that helps create a full fashionable bun that looks perfect for both casual and formal occasions.You will receive 3 hair donuts one large 8-9cm diameter, medium 7-8cm diameter, and small 6-7cm diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fabulous hair accessories , for doing your hair for different occasions .These are really simple and easy to use , just grab your hair as if you are going to make a ponytail .They spread your hair around the donut and then take the hair that&#x27;s left and wind it close to your head.Then you just need a couple of bobbie pins to hold it all in place , it is so simple with such a great effect .I had a wedding to attend recently and with the warm weather this was perfect for an updo, it looked amazing with a nice bun and some wisps in the front , it looked very elegant .Another great use is, I gave one of these to my daughter who is in the military , she has to keep her hair up at work.She normally just makes an ordinary bun, but finds it comes lose later in the day and she has to fix it.Well I gave her one of these and what a difference is has made for her.She finds it much easier to get a great bun and it looks more professional , as if she went to a hair salon.She said it stayed tight and perfect all day long , even with training.This is a product where you can get a professional look by doing it yourself , this is a must for everyone woman to have in your hairstyling kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this great hairstyling product.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new, fun ways to wear my hair.  This review is on the Wleec Beauty 3 pieces hair donut bun maker.  It comes as a set of (3) different sized hair donut rings.  My set is the brown color to complement my red hair.  What a great way to help you create different looks for your hair.  I just started experimenting with this product.  It is so simple to use to create an elegant hair bun.  You basically make a ponytail by using an elastic band, place the hair doughnut ring through the ponytail to the base of ponytail, cover the doughnut ring with hair, securing in place with hair pin or bobby pins. Simple as pie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how you can add so many finishing touches to your bun.  For work, you can keep an elegant bun when you use styling gel or mousse for a slick, neat looking bun.  For a night out, I like to make the bun a little more carefree looking by leaving some of the hair loose around bun for a more tousled look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to enhance my bun with decorative hair clips.  I love to add bling with sparkly hair clips and sparkly bobby pins. Since I live in tropical weather, I like to wear my hair in the bun very frequently.  This product truly is the fun bun!</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I cannot put my thin hair in a bun that stays and it did not disappoint.  I went from plain jane to fancy in a heartbeat.  It was so easy and I no longer have to go to the salon before a big event.</li>
            <li> Buns were a little smaller than I originally expected.  The smallest size is one I will probably never use but would be great for a kid or someone with short, fine hair.  I use the medium sometimes and the large almost every time.  Great quality and gives the perfect bun.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves them and I can&#x27;t believe how cute they make a hair bun look!  Great price too :)</li>
            <li> These light weight bun makers were very easy to use. The three different sizes made it simple to create many different beautiful hair styles that you can wear for any occasion from exercising all the way to weddings. The color matched my hair perfectly. I have super long hair and it rolled up quickly, easily and neatly as seen in the photo attached.</li>
            <li> Works SO much better than the &amp;#34;sock buns&amp;#34; for a cleaner look. Love that it helps to grip the hair and makes it so much easier when doing your own. I am adding pics of all 3 sizes, which are nice to give different volume depending on which look you are going for! Recommending these to all my family and friends!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair so I use the largest one, it works great and it definitely makes my hair look good on a no-wash running late kind of day.</li>
            <li> They work great! It&#x27;s so easy to put your hair through and if you don&#x27;t have time to roll, to place another elastic around the bun maker and pin the excess hair around. I have fairly thin hair and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! I have fairly thin hair so I was worried that these would show but all three worked beautifully. My favorite size is the medium. It&#x27;s perfect for a neat bun when I&#x27;m running late for work. It&#x27;s unbelievably easy to use and very quick. Plus it makes it look like I have more hair than I actually do! I put my hair up in a high ponytail and pulled my ponytail through the donut, I then splayed my hair evenly covering it and then tucked and wrapped my hair under slowly. I used a few bobby pins to keep the hair in place and i&#x27;m on my way out the door. I got so many compliments at work on my &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; bun!</li>
            <li> These work really well a handful of times and then stretch out and become less functional. I have medium fine, long, wavy hair and I used the largest at first. I can no longer get the tight, neat look I&#x27;d like since my hair doesn&#x27;t grip as easily as when I first used this product. I moved to the middle size and that&#x27;s now too stretched to function properly. I&#x27;m bummed because these worked *great* at first!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these. She likes the different sizes, the color and the quality!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!! My daughter has thin hair and these work so great to give her a full looking bun!! Easy to put in her hair and remove! Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use these religiously! They are so easy to use and give you an updo in just minutes. No time to do your hair? Throw one of these babies on and you are out the door!</li>
            <li> These things are great. Good colour that blends in well with my hair and the smaller two are great sizes while the large is pretty massive. Be warned that they do stretch out a bit after a few uses, but the three sizes mean you can generally just swap to a smaller one.</li>
            <li> Buggest bun too small .. All are too small</li>
