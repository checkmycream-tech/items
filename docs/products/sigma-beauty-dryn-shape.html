            <li>I liked this product</li>
            <li>i had heard so many good reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to squeeze out all the excess water and really do a good job of this without pulling on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I take great care in how I clean my brushes, so</li>

            <li>WOW was I impressed!!!  </li>
            <li>Good thing they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>(it stands up on its own because it is a foldable U-shape) on top of a paper</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t own so many medium sized brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does do a good job at maintaining the shape of the brushes which fit.</li>
            <li>I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this I have used it to travel with &amp; it keeps my Brushes in shape.</li>
            <li>As always, Sigma packaging was great and service was fast.</li>
            <li>i was able to wash all of my brushes in 2 days.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it &#x3D;].</li>
            <li>Although the case isn&#x27;t leather, it sure does look like leather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>Innovative.</li>
            <li>This is a really useful product for any make up fan who has their fair share of brushes.</li>
            <li>as many youtube gurus rave on about it, so do i.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I could do more at a time.</li>
            <li>so sure they will serve me fabulously !</li>
            <li>Most my brushes are IT Cosmetics and</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>There are also no holes in the elastic that bristles could fall into, so it eliminates the possibility of disfiguring your brush if you fit them in nice and snug, while even drying them way faster than the Brush</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>but i wish it was cheaper or maybe had more slots in it.</li>
            <li>And on top of that it does it in an orderly, practical fashion.</li>
            <li>Love the concept.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Very effective, keeps bristles very dense.</li>
            <li>Keeping all my makeup, face products, and tools clean and in good condition is extremely important to me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and useful!</li>
            <li>I bought this item straight from Sigma Beauty for $30 and it is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the dry&#x27;n shape.  </li>
            <li>The Dry&#x27;n shape works perfectly for me</li>
            <li>Very classy case that I can feel proud to pull out in front of my clients.  </li>
            <li>Sigma has great prices and great products for the pro and for the amateur makeup artist.</li>
            <li>So far seems to work, I&#x27;m happy with the size.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li>Super easy and functional!</li>
            <li>Everything dries very quickly and when I remove my brushes, they look the way they did the day I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have already invested in a set of good quality brushes then this is a nice stylish was to reshape, dry and even store your brushes.</li>
            <li>they are hands down the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>All About Keeping My Brushes Good as New</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one will be fine</li>
            <li>it does exactly as described, my brushes are brand new after every wash and its so easy to use and quick to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LoVe Sigma!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a must have if you have nice brushes and/or a large collection.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with how it gets my brushes back In shape after washing.  </li>
            <li>It would just be exceptional to have room for ALL my make-up brushes in one handy Dry &#x27;n&#x27;</li>
            <li>Even some of my older more worn brushes look better after using this once.</li>
            <li>Travel Friendly and compact, this Dry&#x27;n Shape by Sigma is a great addition to your makeup collection as you can easily &amp;#34;dry&#x27;n shape&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>easy to use and dries your brushes really quickly.  </li>
            <li>having something that allows my nice clean brushes to not only dry evenly but also retain their shape is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>With additional holders for small brushes, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this item soooooo much!</li>
            <li>and I was dying to try it for myself, because I own several Sigma products and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>great product, makes it much easier and faster to wash my makeup brushes, most are dry in about 5 hours.</li>
            <li>if you are amakeup adddict specially brush collecter .you will thing of something to maintain the shape of your precios collection of brushes.can be used also to hold brushes when traviling.heavy duty material .suitable</li>
            <li>This product is a must have for everyone who wants to keep their brushes in top condition.</li>
            <li>Really cool system for drying brushes.</li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars is bc it really needs more skinny slots for eye shadow brushes</li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve used it, it has left all my brushes in the perfect condition I bought it in -- and since I see that consistent every time I wash them, I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;ll last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this since I just got the 10 piece set of Sigma brushes and wanted to make sure they stayed in like new condition.</li>
            <li>and she did a quick demonstration on how it dryed and reshaped the brushes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy and very convient.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product the weekend before christmas, and although i&#x27;m sure you guys were very busy, i got it in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this,  but at first use one of the elastic bands that hold the brush head in place was ripped so had to return.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to wash my brushes and know that in 4 hours they will be dry &amp; ready to use.</li>
            <li>It really does dry brushes overnight enabling me to take great care of my make up tools.</li>
            <li>Fit my brushes into the Dry&#x27;n Shape from biggest to smallest, making sure that the fit is so snug that I have to jiggle the bristles in...</li>
            <li>Only problem is good for large brushes.</li>
            <li>I was disapointed in this because I watched demos online and others had success.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If you put money into your brushes then this investment is truly worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but definitely not a must have.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see this product, and so far it seems to stand up to its reputation.  </li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>Still not that good for travel as that is what I&#x27;m looking for, something small &amp; light for my brushes for travel.</li>
            <li>After filling all the spots and storing them upside own, my brushes dry within 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>Once I tried it the first time, it was a KEEPER.</li>
            <li>BIG CHECK ON MY BOOK :)</li>
            <li>the hairs on my brushes are shaped to the way they were when i first purchased them.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying in a funny shape.</li>
            <li>but I only wished it  held more brushes.</li>
            <li>Makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>The only improvement in this product would be place more magnets so it would open up more when brushes are drying.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;d have to purchase 10+ to cover all of the brushes I use, but that&#x27;s not reasonable.</li>
            <li>omg it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>exactly like I just got it at the store.</li>
            <li>But first...</li>
            <li>The moment you pull them out of the elastic part, they&#x27;re reshaped and packed together (exactly the way they are when you squeeze out all the excess water)</li>
            <li>I now do not dread washing my brushes and this has gotten me into the great habit of washing them at least once a week.</li>
            <li>You just have to get creative and stick in 2 brushes into big slots.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It does such a great job when I dry my brushes; I didn&#x27;t think it would work at first</li>
            <li>This product really saved my brushes and now I clean them way more often because they dry in about 5 hours!</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;n shape leave my brushes very nicely shaped and it actually works!</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviews that it would be nice if they had a version just for shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>I was the brushes before bed, slip them into the Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape and in the morning, they come out beautifully shaped and completely dry and ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Therefore this product does exactly what its name would suggest, simply and easily.  </li>
            <li>All other brushes dried in about 3-4 hours and came out beautifully shaped!</li>
            <li>Firstly i could not believe how fast the shipping was to Australia.</li>
            <li>I love this Sigma Beauty Dry n Shape.</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite way to dry makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my dry n shape because it really works, I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>since apparently Sigma didn&#x27;t think we were going to clean our eyshadow brushes, ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, little disclaimer that I don&#x27;t work for either brand and am writing this fully out of my own accord.</li>
            <li>It is of high quality and does exactly as it says it does.</li>
            <li>The fact that m brush went back to its shape is huge.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t really a problem for me though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute must-have for every make-up artist as part of his/her kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how well this product works, I must comment on it&#x27;s esthetics.  </li>
            <li>None of the reviews I read or videos I watched said you had to really wring out the water after washing</li>
            <li>I patted them gently on a towel to remove the excess water.</li>
            <li>I prefer it over the brushguards and they really do shape the brushes well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Dries my brushes super quick instead of me having them air dry.</li>
            <li>I love the dry and shape!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I needed for my brushes to keep them looking and feeling like new, as well as preserving them</li>
            <li>I LOVE my new Sigma Beauty Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry quickly!</li>
            <li>sure now that I clean my brushes regularly I will have less acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>Only down is that it only has so many slots and if you have a lot of brushes you won&#x27;t be able to use this on all of them unless you do them in groups.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The brushes remain the original shape and get dry faster</li>
            <li>I can easily clean my brushes throw them into the dry&#x27;n shape and</li>
            <li>so I did what I normally do with my brushes after washing.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try getting more water out before loading them in the Shap&#x27;n Dry and hope that makes</li>
            <li>I have had the dry n shape for almost a year now (my husband actually bought it for me for my birthday) and absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It could have a few more slots for small brushes but by having the number of slots that it does it is able to keep it small and not take up much room on your counter top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my new Dry n Shape, it definitely takes half the time to clean and dry my brushes!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to keep purchasing new brushes.</li>
            <li>But, that being said, they dry quickly anyhow.  </li>
            <li>Brushes dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a free lance makeup artist and this will be such a big help!</li>
            <li>Extremely professional, high-end esthetics!  </li>
            <li>and the reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5, is that there are no small slots for eye brushes.  </li>
            <li>if four times now and my brushes are exactly the same shape as when they came.</li>
            <li>but since i got this dry&#x27;n shape i&#x27;ll wash them more often because my brushes dry in 4 hours</li>
            <li>Dries my brushes quick enough when I wash them the night before for use the next morning.  </li>
            <li>, this does not help shape smaller brushes (shadow smudgers) because the smallest elastic loop is too large.</li>
            <li>And it also dries them super fas, just as other reviewers said.</li>
            <li>the next morning I have clean dry</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very convenient,I wash my brushes and just put them in there, it automatically reshapes them and at the same time, lets it breath</li>
            <li>so i find myself having to put two together in one of the larger holes, or play around with it in order for the smaller brushes to fit in snuggly enough so they can be well shaped while drying.</li>
            <li>this dry n shape is very very good！</li>
            <li>I also purchased my first ever complete brush set from sigma as well as this dry n shape</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I wished it had more sleeves for smaller brushes, but other than that it works.</li>
            <li>My brushes dry fast&amp; keep their shape!</li>
            <li>my humble opinion, if you really value your tools, this is the only way to clean your brushes.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: Dry and Shape my darlings.</li>
            <li>Since I love using different types of eye brushes, 2 small slots are really just not enough for me.</li>
            <li>It does shape the brushes, but I honestly think placing them slightly elevated on a tea towel is less of a hassle and works almost as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item works well as described, but it definitely needs more holders for small brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have more small brushes than big brushes</li>
            <li>It makes it soooo much easier to wash and dry my brushes.</li>
            <li>The Sigma Beauty Dry&#x27;n Shape works as fast as it says.</li>
            <li>] brushes, which would take over 2 whole days to dry in the Brush Guard.</li>
            <li>Sigma&#x27;s Dry&#x27;n Shape make drying and shaping my brushes so much easier.  </li>
            <li>so I look forward to it lasting as long as my brushes, which is now hopefully forever ;)</li>
            <li>My brushes stayed in shape and dried so quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyway, even my super dense Sigmax duo brushes dried in them within 6 HOURS.</li>
            <li>However, there needs to be a few more smaller slots, some of my brushes like the E25 and the E40 are so small that it can just slide through the slots, it doesnt really hold the bristles together so much, not like it does for the bigger face brushes.  </li>
            <li>The elastic first squeezes excess water from brushes, then allows them to dry in their proper shape.  </li>
            <li>So back to the Brush Guard, first, the brushes would take over 24 hours to dry.</li>
            <li>Got barely any use for the medium sized slots.</li>
            <li>use the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape to hold my Sigma Kabuki brushes, my Sigma F30 Large Powder brush and my smaller eye and face brushes.  </li>
            <li>this shape dry&#x27;n shape is about the same as I brought from the sigma official website, and it really works, trusts me.</li>
            <li>and I think the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape is really going to help my brushes last.</li>
            <li>They dry in 4-6 hours, like promised, and look brand new.</li>
            <li>making it such a loose fit that my brushes would inevitably slide down, ruining their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brushes to not dry any faster in this thing, however it does help them retain their shape.</li>
            <li>Certainly not very wet, but still damp when you brushed them onto your face.</li>
            <li>It is great you are not going to be disappointed.</li>
            <li>my brushes use to take nearly 24hrs to dry.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised too because after the Brush Guard, I accepted that maybe the brushes were too dense to dry overnight.</li>
            <li>Even the smaller shadow brushes were not dry all the way thru.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl of simple needs, I just want to dry my brushes upside down, keep my brushes feeling soft and new, and save time.</li>
            <li>My flat kabuki brushes (F80s) still take 24+ hours to dry completely.</li>
            <li>Sigma uses really quality fabric that holds the bristles together in place so that even my brushes with the thickest handles have never slid down in any way!</li>

            <li> I liked this product</li>
            <li> i had heard so many good reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to squeeze out all the excess water and really do a good job of this without pulling on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take great care in how I clean my brushes, so</li>

            <li> WOW was I impressed!!!  </li>
            <li> Good thing they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> (it stands up on its own because it is a foldable U-shape) on top of a paper</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t own so many medium sized brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does do a good job at maintaining the shape of the brushes which fit.</li>
            <li> I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this I have used it to travel with &amp; it keeps my Brushes in shape.</li>
            <li> As always, Sigma packaging was great and service was fast.</li>
            <li> i was able to wash all of my brushes in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it &#x3D;].</li>
            <li> Although the case isn&#x27;t leather, it sure does look like leather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Innovative.</li>
            <li> This is a really useful product for any make up fan who has their fair share of brushes.</li>
            <li> as many youtube gurus rave on about it, so do i.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I could do more at a time.</li>
            <li> so sure they will serve me fabulously !</li>
            <li> Most my brushes are IT Cosmetics and</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> There are also no holes in the elastic that bristles could fall into, so it eliminates the possibility of disfiguring your brush if you fit them in nice and snug, while even drying them way faster than the Brush</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> but i wish it was cheaper or maybe had more slots in it.</li>
            <li> And on top of that it does it in an orderly, practical fashion.</li>
            <li> Love the concept.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Very effective, keeps bristles very dense.</li>
            <li> Keeping all my makeup, face products, and tools clean and in good condition is extremely important to me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and useful!</li>
            <li> I bought this item straight from Sigma Beauty for $30 and it is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the dry&#x27;n shape.  </li>
            <li> The Dry&#x27;n shape works perfectly for me</li>
            <li> Very classy case that I can feel proud to pull out in front of my clients.  </li>
            <li> Sigma has great prices and great products for the pro and for the amateur makeup artist.</li>
            <li> So far seems to work, I&#x27;m happy with the size.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li> Super easy and functional!</li>
            <li> Everything dries very quickly and when I remove my brushes, they look the way they did the day I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have already invested in a set of good quality brushes then this is a nice stylish was to reshape, dry and even store your brushes.</li>
            <li> they are hands down the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> All About Keeping My Brushes Good as New</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will be fine</li>
            <li> it does exactly as described, my brushes are brand new after every wash and its so easy to use and quick to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LoVe Sigma!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you have nice brushes and/or a large collection.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with how it gets my brushes back In shape after washing.  </li>
            <li> It would just be exceptional to have room for ALL my make-up brushes in one handy Dry &#x27;n&#x27;</li>
            <li> Even some of my older more worn brushes look better after using this once.</li>
            <li> Travel Friendly and compact, this Dry&#x27;n Shape by Sigma is a great addition to your makeup collection as you can easily &amp;#34;dry&#x27;n shape&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> easy to use and dries your brushes really quickly.  </li>
            <li> having something that allows my nice clean brushes to not only dry evenly but also retain their shape is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> With additional holders for small brushes, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this item soooooo much!</li>
            <li> and I was dying to try it for myself, because I own several Sigma products and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> great product, makes it much easier and faster to wash my makeup brushes, most are dry in about 5 hours.</li>
            <li> if you are amakeup adddict specially brush collecter .you will thing of something to maintain the shape of your precios collection of brushes.can be used also to hold brushes when traviling.heavy duty material .suitable</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for everyone who wants to keep their brushes in top condition.</li>
            <li> Really cool system for drying brushes.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars is bc it really needs more skinny slots for eye shadow brushes</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used it, it has left all my brushes in the perfect condition I bought it in -- and since I see that consistent every time I wash them, I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;ll last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this since I just got the 10 piece set of Sigma brushes and wanted to make sure they stayed in like new condition.</li>
            <li> and she did a quick demonstration on how it dryed and reshaped the brushes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy and very convient.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product the weekend before christmas, and although i&#x27;m sure you guys were very busy, i got it in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this,  but at first use one of the elastic bands that hold the brush head in place was ripped so had to return.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to wash my brushes and know that in 4 hours they will be dry &amp; ready to use.</li>
            <li> It really does dry brushes overnight enabling me to take great care of my make up tools.</li>
            <li> Fit my brushes into the Dry&#x27;n Shape from biggest to smallest, making sure that the fit is so snug that I have to jiggle the bristles in...</li>
            <li> Only problem is good for large brushes.</li>
            <li> I was disapointed in this because I watched demos online and others had success.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you put money into your brushes then this investment is truly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but definitely not a must have.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see this product, and so far it seems to stand up to its reputation.  </li>
            <li> Came super fast!</li>
            <li> Still not that good for travel as that is what I&#x27;m looking for, something small &amp; light for my brushes for travel.</li>
            <li> After filling all the spots and storing them upside own, my brushes dry within 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> Once I tried it the first time, it was a KEEPER.</li>
            <li> BIG CHECK ON MY BOOK :)</li>
            <li> the hairs on my brushes are shaped to the way they were when i first purchased them.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying in a funny shape.</li>
            <li> but I only wished it  held more brushes.</li>
            <li> Makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> The only improvement in this product would be place more magnets so it would open up more when brushes are drying.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;d have to purchase 10+ to cover all of the brushes I use, but that&#x27;s not reasonable.</li>
            <li> omg it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> exactly like I just got it at the store.</li>
            <li> But first...</li>
            <li> The moment you pull them out of the elastic part, they&#x27;re reshaped and packed together (exactly the way they are when you squeeze out all the excess water)</li>
            <li> I now do not dread washing my brushes and this has gotten me into the great habit of washing them at least once a week.</li>
            <li> You just have to get creative and stick in 2 brushes into big slots.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It does such a great job when I dry my brushes; I didn&#x27;t think it would work at first</li>
            <li> This product really saved my brushes and now I clean them way more often because they dry in about 5 hours!</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;n shape leave my brushes very nicely shaped and it actually works!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that it would be nice if they had a version just for shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> I was the brushes before bed, slip them into the Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape and in the morning, they come out beautifully shaped and completely dry and ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Therefore this product does exactly what its name would suggest, simply and easily.  </li>
            <li> All other brushes dried in about 3-4 hours and came out beautifully shaped!</li>
            <li> Firstly i could not believe how fast the shipping was to Australia.</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma Beauty Dry n Shape.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite way to dry makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my dry n shape because it really works, I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> since apparently Sigma didn&#x27;t think we were going to clean our eyshadow brushes, ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, little disclaimer that I don&#x27;t work for either brand and am writing this fully out of my own accord.</li>
            <li> It is of high quality and does exactly as it says it does.</li>
            <li> The fact that m brush went back to its shape is huge.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t really a problem for me though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute must-have for every make-up artist as part of his/her kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how well this product works, I must comment on it&#x27;s esthetics.  </li>
            <li> None of the reviews I read or videos I watched said you had to really wring out the water after washing</li>
            <li> I patted them gently on a towel to remove the excess water.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over the brushguards and they really do shape the brushes well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Dries my brushes super quick instead of me having them air dry.</li>
            <li> I love the dry and shape!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I needed for my brushes to keep them looking and feeling like new, as well as preserving them</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new Sigma Beauty Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape.  </li>
            <li> It really does dry quickly!</li>
            <li> sure now that I clean my brushes regularly I will have less acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> Only down is that it only has so many slots and if you have a lot of brushes you won&#x27;t be able to use this on all of them unless you do them in groups.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The brushes remain the original shape and get dry faster</li>
            <li> I can easily clean my brushes throw them into the dry&#x27;n shape and</li>
            <li> so I did what I normally do with my brushes after washing.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll try getting more water out before loading them in the Shap&#x27;n Dry and hope that makes</li>
            <li> I have had the dry n shape for almost a year now (my husband actually bought it for me for my birthday) and absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It could have a few more slots for small brushes but by having the number of slots that it does it is able to keep it small and not take up much room on your counter top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new Dry n Shape, it definitely takes half the time to clean and dry my brushes!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to keep purchasing new brushes.</li>
            <li> But, that being said, they dry quickly anyhow.  </li>
            <li> Brushes dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a free lance makeup artist and this will be such a big help!</li>
            <li> Extremely professional, high-end esthetics!  </li>
            <li> and the reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5, is that there are no small slots for eye brushes.  </li>
            <li> if four times now and my brushes are exactly the same shape as when they came.</li>
            <li> but since i got this dry&#x27;n shape i&#x27;ll wash them more often because my brushes dry in 4 hours</li>
            <li> Dries my brushes quick enough when I wash them the night before for use the next morning.  </li>
            <li> , this does not help shape smaller brushes (shadow smudgers) because the smallest elastic loop is too large.</li>
            <li> And it also dries them super fas, just as other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> the next morning I have clean dry</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very convenient,I wash my brushes and just put them in there, it automatically reshapes them and at the same time, lets it breath</li>
            <li> so i find myself having to put two together in one of the larger holes, or play around with it in order for the smaller brushes to fit in snuggly enough so they can be well shaped while drying.</li>
            <li> this dry n shape is very very good！</li>
            <li> I also purchased my first ever complete brush set from sigma as well as this dry n shape</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I wished it had more sleeves for smaller brushes, but other than that it works.</li>
            <li> My brushes dry fast&amp; keep their shape!</li>
            <li> my humble opinion, if you really value your tools, this is the only way to clean your brushes.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: Dry and Shape my darlings.</li>
            <li> Since I love using different types of eye brushes, 2 small slots are really just not enough for me.</li>
            <li> It does shape the brushes, but I honestly think placing them slightly elevated on a tea towel is less of a hassle and works almost as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item works well as described, but it definitely needs more holders for small brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have more small brushes than big brushes</li>
            <li> It makes it soooo much easier to wash and dry my brushes.</li>
            <li> The Sigma Beauty Dry&#x27;n Shape works as fast as it says.</li>
            <li> ] brushes, which would take over 2 whole days to dry in the Brush Guard.</li>
            <li> Sigma&#x27;s Dry&#x27;n Shape make drying and shaping my brushes so much easier.  </li>
            <li> so I look forward to it lasting as long as my brushes, which is now hopefully forever ;)</li>
            <li> My brushes stayed in shape and dried so quickly.</li>
            <li> Anyway, even my super dense Sigmax duo brushes dried in them within 6 HOURS.</li>
            <li> However, there needs to be a few more smaller slots, some of my brushes like the E25 and the E40 are so small that it can just slide through the slots, it doesnt really hold the bristles together so much, not like it does for the bigger face brushes.  </li>
            <li> The elastic first squeezes excess water from brushes, then allows them to dry in their proper shape.  </li>
            <li> So back to the Brush Guard, first, the brushes would take over 24 hours to dry.</li>
            <li> Got barely any use for the medium sized slots.</li>
            <li> use the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape to hold my Sigma Kabuki brushes, my Sigma F30 Large Powder brush and my smaller eye and face brushes.  </li>
            <li> this shape dry&#x27;n shape is about the same as I brought from the sigma official website, and it really works, trusts me.</li>
            <li> and I think the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape is really going to help my brushes last.</li>
            <li> They dry in 4-6 hours, like promised, and look brand new.</li>
            <li> making it such a loose fit that my brushes would inevitably slide down, ruining their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brushes to not dry any faster in this thing, however it does help them retain their shape.</li>
            <li> Certainly not very wet, but still damp when you brushed them onto your face.</li>
            <li> It is great you are not going to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my brushes use to take nearly 24hrs to dry.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised too because after the Brush Guard, I accepted that maybe the brushes were too dense to dry overnight.</li>
            <li> Even the smaller shadow brushes were not dry all the way thru.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl of simple needs, I just want to dry my brushes upside down, keep my brushes feeling soft and new, and save time.</li>
            <li> My flat kabuki brushes (F80s) still take 24+ hours to dry completely.</li>
            <li> Sigma uses really quality fabric that holds the bristles together in place so that even my brushes with the thickest handles have never slid down in any way!</li>
            <li> I really wish they would make one just for eyeshadow brushes because the regular one doesn&#x27;t have that much small sections for eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> I can usually manage to fit it in my mr. Bunny set, 1 f80, 1realtechniques core set and a few precision brushes as well as a couple of stippling brushes from elf and 1 elf powder brush.</li>
            <li> big problem was I wanted to stop drying brushes flat because lying them flat makes water go into the metal barrel which loosens the glue and causes shedding.</li>
            <li> I want all my brushes, especially my Bobbi Brown one, to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It still amazes me how the brushes completely dry in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> so you do need to fluff them up on the palm of your hand or through your fingers, but in doing that you also get to see how completely dry and perfectly soft they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wash them at night so by the time I wake up and take out my brushes to use, they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> My bathroom is so damn small that the towel construct i used till now was a real hassle to have in there.</li>
            <li> Dries my brushes faster than lying the flat.</li>
            <li> This product dried my brushes within 4 hours and my brushes came out looking like NEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing this out there just as a comparison to show that the Dry&#x27;n Shape solves really essential brush washing issues for me.</li>
            <li> Storage was also easy and I never had any weird leather smell.  </li>
            <li> ALL my brushes drys within 4 hours and they are very soft when dried.</li>
            <li> When washing several brushes at once, it can be difficult to find a place to put them so they dry quickly and retain their shape can be a bit more tricky (especially in a small shared bathroom).  </li>
            <li> the only down thing is the smaller brush areas are still to big for my of my brushes.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;n Shape  is essential to dry the brush as it helps to prevent deformation</li>
            <li> I use this item on a daily basis to dry my stipple brush and loose powder brush.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> There is not much room for smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> so I can have them for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was always a pain for me to have to wash my brushes, knowing there would be a long wait time for them to dry.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for my cream/liquid foundation brushes and any other brushes I&#x27;ve used with creamy/liquid cosmetic products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only out when you need it, so it won&#x27;t take up valuable space..... which can be use by other make-up products.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t wash my brushes that often because they take forever to dry</li>
            <li> I used this for the 1st time yesterday &amp; just as promised, my brushes were dry in 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Now I could wash my brushes at night and know they will be dry in the morning when I need to use them again.</li>
            <li> beauty dry ´n</li>
            <li> so gets dry faster.  </li>
            <li> I washed all my brushes before bed, loaded them into the Dry&#x27;n Shape and headed to bed.</li>
            <li> I had to take them out of the Dry&#x27;n Shape and leave them laying on a towel for another couple of hours before they were completely dry.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t even dry overnight.</li>
            <li> i just recieved the sigma shape and dry.  </li>
            <li> I then put it in my dry n shape with the guards on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I got the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape, I used to put my brushes into [[ASIN:B004ZD2LIW Coastal Scents</li>
            <li> Sigma Beauty Dry&#x27;n Shape]] literally solves ALL the problems I had with the Brush Guard.</li>
            <li> The Dry&#x27;n Shape does all 3 and is made of durable material</li>
            <li> They definitely dry and shape my makeup brushes faster than using brushguards.</li>
            <li> Also it does help to dry brushes quicker while aiding in keeping the shape of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I mean...are my brushes totally dry overnight?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my brushes at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within 6 hours, every single brush in there is perfectly dry.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the largest spot is still not big enough for my kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> It holds my biggest brushes down to my smaller eye brushes.  </li>
            <li> The Dry&#x27;n Shape works!   </li>
            <li> with the sigma shape and dry, they are!</li>
            <li> I only purchased in hopes that my brushes would dry a little quicker.</li>
            <li> With this I turn the side with the brushes on the outside, close it and have a little tower that i can put wherever i wish.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of the Dry&#x27;n Shape and watched YouTube videos praising it&#x27;s ability to dry the dense Sigma brushes in less than 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough of the common, smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> When the item arrived i had expected it to be delivered two weeks from the date</li>
            <li> I would take them out, feel them, and even after 48 hours they&#x27;d still be wet in the center.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After all my brushes are in their little fittings, I turn the Dry&#x27;n Shape upside down so that the brushes are pointing downward and stand it up slightly open</li>
            <li> My brushes dry in half the time...</li>
            <li> Brushes dry in half the time now.  </li>
            <li> Both are thicker brushes and I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t dry for the next use, but they dried in a timely manner and kept their shape which is exactly what this product is for.  </li>
            <li> based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> but it is money well spent!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I have a small number of face and eye brushes that I&#x27;ve invested in (Sigma, Origins, Mac, Bobbi Brown, and Sephora; 1-3 brushes from each respective brand).</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed with any of my Sigma products &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s only two parts for small brushes.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to dry</li>
            <li> Maybe I did something wrong, but I checked my brushes after 7.5 hrs and large powder brush &amp; kabuki were  still wet.</li>
            <li> But somehow, the Dry&#x27;n Shape gets the water 100% out in a few hours.</li>
            <li> But that is really my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> one and only complaint -</li>
            <li> I found my brushes dried quicker and kept their shape as promised - though I did find that my largest Mac buffer brush did not fit in the loops as I had hoped; that brush takes the longest to dry.</li>
            <li> Even my fullest brushes dry in no more than 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it makes the brushes dry faster</li>
            <li> Keeps them all in a small space as they dry.</li>
            <li> i usually wash my brushes at night, and i always worry if they will be dry by morning.  </li>
            <li> Some brushes take longer to dry than others but a few take no time at all!</li>
            <li> It does take a little longer than the 4-6 this way</li>
            <li> and I think the brushes may be a little drier than if I&#x27;d just laid them out on a tea towel, but...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it dried my brushes any faster than laying them out on my counter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> so I thought my daughter would like a few of their items for Christmas.</li>
            <li> After my order arrived I am thinking about ordering a few items to try myself.</li>
            <li> I am waiting for a replacement and will write a review after using a few times.  </li>
            <li> This baby dries even my thickest brushes in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> My foundation brush just yesterday literally dried in about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush guards variety pack a few weeks before this</li>
            <li> I always hate cleaning my brushes because they take forever to dry, but this literally does the job so much faster!</li>
            <li> Had my brushes dry in a few hours!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few as gifts for my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wash all my brushes at once.</li>
            <li> When I woke up in the morning ready to put makeup on I was disappointed to find the brushes were still damp.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, at least once a week, depending on how often i use my brushes.</li>
            <li> The fabric that surrounds the bristles is a thick elastic that speeds up the water evaporation process.</li>
            <li> I was someone who was really skeptical and had this on my Amazon Wishlist for a while and tried other (cheaper) brush drying methods.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical trying this...</li>
            <li> so I would just avoid washing my brushes which is not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> Although the Brush Guard was a way to keep my brush standing upside down, the plastic material is horrible in that it kept water from ventilating and drying, the pack only comes with 5</li>
            <li> I used to HATE waiting all day and night for my brushes to dry</li>
            <li> I hate having to wait over night for my brushes to dry.</li>
            <li> So I always hated cleaning my makeup brushed until I got this.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> This product will help extend the life of your brushes, since they will not become splayed and unable to be used the way you need them to.  </li>
            <li> I was really sad because these are two that I use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I had to wash my brushes over the course of a week after waiting for each batch to dry, and worst of all there were holes in the plastic</li>
            <li> the make me crazy brush set from sigma</li>
            <li> I no longer have those annoying whips and the brush stays the shape that it was meant to be!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Its not worth the money!!!! I didn&#x27;t find that it dried my brushes any faster than laying them out on my counter. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this I have used it to travel with &amp; it keeps my Brushes in shape. Also if I need to wash them while I am out also...</li>
            <li> I watch some online reviews on this product and I was dying to try it for myself, because I own several Sigma products and I absolutely love them. Sigma has great prices and great products for the pro and for the amateur makeup artist. I 100% recommend this product because it simply does what they say it will do.  It is great you are not going to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She is thrilled with it.. It is of high quality and does exactly as it says it does.</li>
            <li> I love this Sigma Beauty Dry n Shape. It makes it soooo much easier to wash and dry my brushes. I no longer have those annoying whips and the brush stays the shape that it was meant to be!!! I will use this for many years to come!</li>
            <li> I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  I take great care in how I clean my brushes, so having something that allows my nice clean brushes to not only dry evenly but also retain their shape is wonderful.  This product will help extend the life of your brushes, since they will not become splayed and unable to be used the way you need them to.  Well done, Sigma.</li>
            <li> This works well but there are not enough spots for eye brushes.  The slots are too big. It would be nice if they made one for just eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I heard this product from Sonia Castaneda (sccastaneda) on youtube and she did a quick demonstration on how it dryed and reshaped the brushes and I wanted to try it out myself. This worked great for me! It&#x27;s real easy to use and my brushes look amazing.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see this product, and so far it seems to stand up to its reputation.  However, there needs to be a few more smaller slots, some of my brushes like the E25 and the E40 are so small that it can just slide through the slots, it doesnt really hold the bristles together so much, not like it does for the bigger face brushes.  But that is really my only complaint.  I ordered this product the weekend before christmas, and although i&#x27;m sure you guys were very busy, i got it in no time at all.  So well done again Sigma, keep it up.  Regards,  Patrice...R</li>
            <li> This brush roll worked perfectly!!!! My brushes stayed in shape and dried so quickly. I recommended this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the dry&#x27;n shape.  It&#x27;s great to wash my brushes and know that in 4 hours they will be dry &amp; ready to use. As always, Sigma packaging was great and service was fast.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t wash my brushes that often because they take forever to dry but since i got this dry&#x27;n shape i&#x27;ll wash them more often because my brushes dry in 4 hours and it leaves them very nicely shaped</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  Dries my brushes quick enough when I wash them the night before for use the next morning.  I&#x27;ve bought a few as gifts for my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing! It does such a great job when I dry my brushes; I didn&#x27;t think it would work at first but I saw a video about it and I had to try it out so I brought it. Once I tried it the first time, it was a KEEPER. This product dried my brushes within 4 hours and my brushes came out looking like NEW. Definitely recommend this to anyone whose into makeup. BIG CHECK ON MY BOOK :)</li>
            <li> As quality brushes require regular cleaning, this item is invaluable.  The elastic first squeezes excess water from brushes, then allows them to dry in their proper shape.  Therefore this product does exactly what its name would suggest, simply and easily.  Sigma Beauty ship this practical product quickly and offer great customer service.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent holder. It will keep brushes protected for travelling. And it also dries them super fas, just as other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my new Dry n Shape, it definitely takes half the time to clean and dry my brushes! I always hate cleaning my brushes because they take forever to dry, but this literally does the job so much faster!</li>
            <li> I bought this item straight from Sigma Beauty for $30 and it is absolutely amazing! I used to HATE waiting all day and night for my brushes to dry and then they wouldn&#x27;t hold their shape so I would just avoid washing my brushes which is not a good idea. This product really saved my brushes and now I clean them way more often because they dry in about 5 hours! That is  truly amazing and I will continue to buy this product over and over.</li>
            <li> I hate having to wait over night for my brushes to dry. Not only do I have to wait over night, the bruses lose their shape. Not with this product! I love it!!</li>
            <li> this product has changed my life. my brushes use to take nearly 24hrs to dry. now it takes me between 8-9 hours. which is amazing. i was able to wash all of my brushes in 2 days. the hairs on my brushes are shaped to the way they were when i first purchased them. the only down thing is the smaller brush areas are still to big for my of my brushes. wasn&#x27;t really a problem for me though. i also recommend purchasing a set of sigma brushes. they are hands down the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;n shape leave my brushes very nicely shaped and it actually works! ALL my brushes drys within 4 hours and they are very soft when dried. Very good size for travelling also. Would recommend it &#x3D;].</li>
            <li> I used this for the 1st time yesterday &amp; just as promised, my brushes were dry in 4 hours. I love it!!! Thank you Sigma!</li>
            <li> Maybe I did something wrong, but I checked my brushes after 7.5 hrs and large powder brush &amp; kabuki were  still wet. I was disapointed in this because I watched demos online and others had success. Great idea, but not the miracle product I ex  pected based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my new Sigma Beauty Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape.  Even my fullest brushes dry in no more than 6 hours.  I use it daily for my cream/liquid foundation brushes and any other brushes I&#x27;ve used with creamy/liquid cosmetic products.  I was the brushes before bed, slip them into the Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape and in the morning, they come out beautifully shaped and completely dry and ready to use.  I know this will be indispensible for travelling as well.  It&#x27;s an absolute must-have for every make-up artist as part of his/her kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how well this product works, I must comment on it&#x27;s esthetics.  Although the case isn&#x27;t leather, it sure does look like leather.  Very classy case that I can feel proud to pull out in front of my clients.  Extremely professional, high-end esthetics!  What a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one and only complaint - and the reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5, is that there are no small slots for eye brushes.  That means needing a separate roll to carry my eye make-up brushes in.  But, that being said, they dry quickly anyhow.  It would just be exceptional to have room for ALL my make-up brushes in one handy Dry &#x27;n&#x27; Shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this awesome product by Sigma!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for everyone who wants to keep their brushes in top condition. It was always a pain for me to have to wash my brushes, knowing there would be a long wait time for them to dry. Now I could wash my brushes at night and know they will be dry in the morning when I need to use them again. And I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying in a funny shape. They dry in 4-6 hours, like promised, and look brand new. Thanks, Sigma for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about the Sigma Beauty line so I thought my daughter would like a few of their items for Christmas. After my order arrived I am thinking about ordering a few items to try myself.</li>
            <li> The Sigma Beauty Dry&#x27;n Shape works as fast as it says. It&#x27;s super easy and very convient. Dries my brushes super quick instead of me having them air dry. I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase. It saves me a lot of time and also money. This product makes my brushes last longer and I don&#x27;t have to keep purchasing new brushes. I really wish they would make one just for eyeshadow brushes because the regular one doesn&#x27;t have that much small sections for eye shadow brushes. But other than that, it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li> Item works well as described, but it definitely needs more holders for small brushes.  With additional holders for small brushes, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but I only wished it  held more brushes. I am not sure if it makes the brushes dry faster but it does help he brush maintain the shape.</li>
            <li> meus  pinceis  agora estao  limpos  e com o  sigma beauty dry ´n shape  secam  facilmente  !!Ameiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</li>
            <li> Innovative. Excellent product. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> This is a really useful product for any make up fan who has their fair share of brushes. I found my brushes dried quicker and kept their shape as promised - though I did find that my largest Mac buffer brush did not fit in the loops as I had hoped; that brush takes the longest to dry. All other brushes dried in about 3-4 hours and came out beautifully shaped!</li>
            <li> if you are amakeup adddict specially brush collecter .you will thing of something to maintain the shape of your precios collection of brushes.can be used also to hold brushes when traviling.heavy duty material .suitable for different sizes of brushes ..</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very convenient,I wash my brushes and just put them in there, it automatically reshapes them and at the same time, lets it breath so gets dry faster.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it needs spaces for smaller brushes as well, I couldn&#x27;t put my smaller brushes because the spaces were too big.  If it had that would be PERFECT! Even to keep your brushes there for traveling.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! Firstly i could not believe how fast the shipping was to Australia. When the item arrived i had expected it to be delivered two weeks from the date it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as many youtube gurus rave on about it, so do i. I also purchased my first ever complete brush set from sigma as well as this dry n shape and i can tell you its definately going to last me a lifetime. it does exactly as described, my brushes are brand new after every wash and its so easy to use and quick to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LoVe Sigma!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this,  but at first use one of the elastic bands that hold the brush head in place was ripped so had to return.  I am waiting for a replacement and will write a review after using a few times.  Hopefully this one will be fine can&#x27;t wait to use!</li>
            <li> Super easy and functional! The brushes remain the original shape and get dry faster</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical trying this... I only purchased in hopes that my brushes would dry a little quicker. WOW was I impressed!!!  Had my brushes dry in a few hours!!! LOVE THIS! Makes my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Really cool system for drying brushes. Very effective, keeps bristles very dense. Brushes dry quickly. Keeps them all in a small space as they dry. Only down is that it only has so many slots and if you have a lot of brushes you won&#x27;t be able to use this on all of them unless you do them in groups. But I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that. I don&#x27;t usually wash all my brushes at once. It could have a few more slots for small brushes but by having the number of slots that it does it is able to keep it small and not take up much room on your counter top. Highly recommend. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it. The only improvement in this product would be place more magnets so it would open up more when brushes are drying.  Thx</li>
            <li> Seems like a lot of money but it is money well spent!  It really does dry brushes overnight enabling me to take great care of my make up tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my dry n shape because it really works, I&#x27;ve used if four times now and my brushes are exactly the same shape as when they came. My brushes dry in half the time...This is a must have if you have nice brushes and/or a large collection.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this since I just got the 10 piece set of Sigma brushes and wanted to make sure they stayed in like new condition. I read reviews of the Dry&#x27;n Shape and watched YouTube videos praising it&#x27;s ability to dry the dense Sigma brushes in less than 6 hours. I washed all my brushes before bed, loaded them into the Dry&#x27;n Shape and headed to bed. When I woke up in the morning ready to put makeup on I was disappointed to find the brushes were still damp. Certainly not very wet, but still damp when you brushed them onto your face. Even the smaller shadow brushes were not dry all the way thru. I had to take them out of the Dry&#x27;n Shape and leave them laying on a towel for another couple of hours before they were completely dry. None of the reviews I read or videos I watched said you had to really wring out the water after washing so I did what I normally do with my brushes after washing. I patted them gently on a towel to remove the excess water. Next time I&#x27;ll try getting more water out before loading them in the Shap&#x27;n Dry and hope that makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it works excellently for shaping the brushes. Even some of my older more worn brushes look better after using this once. I agree with the other reviews that it would be nice if they had a version just for shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> this shape dry&#x27;n shape is about the same as I brought from the sigma official website, and it really works, trusts me.</li>
            <li> present. she loved it.</li>
            <li> My brushes dry fast&amp; keep their shape! I ordered another so I could do more at a time. To be honest, I&#x27;d have to purchase 10+ to cover all of the brushes I use, but that&#x27;s not reasonable. I use this for my brushes that I use a lot.</li>
            <li> Dries my brushes faster than lying the flat.</li>
            <li> The reason why I purchased this product is because it can save my brushes and reshape them , so they are 2 in 1 ..  I so sure they will serve me fabulously !</li>
            <li> It was everything I wanted it to be.  I am so happy with how it gets my brushes back In shape after washing.  I no longer have to lay them out on my counter.  It&#x27;s the best, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This baby dries even my thickest brushes in a few hours.  Most my brushes are IT Cosmetics and this works great in drying them.</li>
            <li> Travel Friendly and compact, this Dry&#x27;n Shape by Sigma is a great addition to your makeup collection as you can easily &amp;#34;dry&#x27;n shape&amp;#34; your brushes within 4-6 hours. My only gripe is that I wished it had more sleeves for smaller brushes, but other than that it works. It&#x27;s sturdy when it stands upright and holds brushes intact.  This is a great product for those on those on the go!</li>
            <li> My brushes to not dry any faster in this thing, however it does help them retain their shape.</li>
            <li> I have had the dry n shape for almost a year now (my husband actually bought it for me for my birthday) and absolutely love this product. It really does dry quickly! My foundation brush just yesterday literally dried in about 3 hours. I bought the brush guards variety pack a few weeks before this and they didn&#x27;t even dry overnight. Still damp 24 hours later. Good thing they were so cheap. Complete waste of money. I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> The Dry&#x27;n Shape works!   Brushes dry in half the time now.  It seems quite durable and fits well.  Can never have enough slots for the brushes! lol</li>
            <li> i just recieved the sigma shape and dry.  i have already used it, and it is great!  i had heard so many good reviews on this product.  i am very glad that i bought it.  i usually wash my brushes at night, and i always worry if they will be dry by morning.  with the sigma shape and dry, they are!</li>
            <li> My magnet on one side would not stick close. It doesn&#x27;t hold very many brushes at all. In order for brushes to stay properly they must be put in snug. There is not much room for smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but omg it does exactly what it says. Dries and shapes the brush in 6-8 hrs. The fact that m brush went back to its shape is huge. The reason for 4 stars is bc it really needs more skinny slots for eye shadow brushes</li>
            <li> I love the dry and shape!! It still amazes me how the brushes completely dry in such a short amount of time. I&#x27;m such a sigma fan now!!</li>
            <li> Works amazing!! I use this with the brush guards. I get an even tighter shape exactly like I just got it at the store. I then put it in my dry n shape with the guards on. It does take a little longer than the 4-6 this way but it&#x27;s worth it. Plus in doing so you can put a couple brushes in to a bigger spot because you have the guards on. I have more small brushes than big brushes so this gets a bigger bang for my buck. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;n Shape  is essential to dry the brush as it helps to prevent deformation and so they can last longer brushes</li>
            <li> I have a small number of face and eye brushes that I&#x27;ve invested in (Sigma, Origins, Mac, Bobbi Brown, and Sephora; 1-3 brushes from each respective brand). Being in college, I know even having name brand makeup brushes is a luxury so I plan on making my investment in each of them last -- forever if possible. Keeping all my makeup, face products, and tools clean and in good condition is extremely important to me and I think the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape is really going to help my brushes last. Every time I&#x27;ve used it, it has left all my brushes in the perfect condition I bought it in -- and since I see that consistent every time I wash them, I&#x27;m confident they&#x27;ll last a lot longer. The Dry&#x27;n shape works perfectly for me so I&#x27;ll include my process below in case it&#x27;s not working for you. But first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;How I USED to Wash Brushes&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I got the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape, I used to put my brushes into [[ASIN:B004ZD2LIW Coastal Scents The Brush Guard, Variety Pack, 0.60-Ounce]]. I&#x27;m throwing this out there just as a comparison to show that the Dry&#x27;n Shape solves really essential brush washing issues for me. So back to the Brush Guard, first, the brushes would take over 24 hours to dry. I don&#x27;t have a lot of brushes, so this is an inconvenience to me. This goes especially for my [[ASIN:B005V1G1R4 Sigma Synthetic Sigmax Duo]] brushes, which would take over 2 whole days to dry in the Brush Guard. I would take them out, feel them, and even after 48 hours they&#x27;d still be wet in the center. I was really sad because these are two that I use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big problem was I wanted to stop drying brushes flat because lying them flat makes water go into the metal barrel which loosens the glue and causes shedding. Although the Brush Guard was a way to keep my brush standing upside down, the plastic material is horrible in that it kept water from ventilating and drying, the pack only comes with 5 so I had to wash my brushes over the course of a week after waiting for each batch to dry, and worst of all there were holes in the plastic making it such a loose fit that my brushes would inevitably slide down, ruining their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;How I NOW Wash Brushes&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B0050CFD1O Sigma Beauty Dry&#x27;n Shape]] literally solves ALL the problems I had with the Brush Guard. Also, little disclaimer that I don&#x27;t work for either brand and am writing this fully out of my own accord. Anyway, even my super dense Sigmax duo brushes dried in them within 6 HOURS. I was really surprised too because after the Brush Guard, I accepted that maybe the brushes were too dense to dry overnight. But somehow, the Dry&#x27;n Shape gets the water 100% out in a few hours. Here&#x27;s how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Wash all my brushes (finally there are enough fittings for all my brushes in one wash) with my regular shampoo and conditioner. I make sure to squeeze out all the excess water and really do a good job of this without pulling on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Fit my brushes into the Dry&#x27;n Shape from biggest to smallest, making sure that the fit is so snug that I have to jiggle the bristles in...The fabric that surrounds the bristles is a thick elastic that speeds up the water evaporation process. Sigma uses really quality fabric that holds the bristles together in place so that even my brushes with the thickest handles have never slid down in any way! There are also no holes in the elastic that bristles could fall into, so it eliminates the possibility of disfiguring your brush if you fit them in nice and snug, while even drying them way faster than the Brush Guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) After all my brushes are in their little fittings, I turn the Dry&#x27;n Shape upside down so that the brushes are pointing downward and stand it up slightly open (it stands up on its own because it is a foldable U-shape) on top of a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 6 hours, every single brush in there is perfectly dry. I usually wash them at night so by the time I wake up and take out my brushes to use, they&#x27;re ready to go. The moment you pull them out of the elastic part, they&#x27;re reshaped and packed together (exactly the way they are when you squeeze out all the excess water) so you do need to fluff them up on the palm of your hand or through your fingers, but in doing that you also get to see how completely dry and perfectly soft they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s All About Keeping My Brushes Good as New&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my humble opinion, if you really value your tools, this is the only way to clean your brushes. I was someone who was really skeptical and had this on my Amazon Wishlist for a while and tried other (cheaper) brush drying methods. If you put money into your brushes then this investment is truly worth every penny. I want all my brushes, especially my Bobbi Brown one, to last for a long time. I&#x27;m a girl of simple needs, I just want to dry my brushes upside down, keep my brushes feeling soft and new, and save time. The Dry&#x27;n Shape does all 3 and is made of durable material so I look forward to it lasting as long as my brushes, which is now hopefully forever ;)</li>
            <li> great product, makes it much easier and faster to wash my makeup brushes, most are dry in about 5 hours. only complaint is that the largest spot is still not big enough for my kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> Never had a product so good, it is very good and help a lot to clean my brushes, I recommend  to any one who has brushes to tri this product.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations for your product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I now do not dread washing my brushes and this has gotten me into the great habit of washing them at least once a week. It will change your beauty routine for the better!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this and I am sooo glad that he did! Its exactly what I needed for my brushes to keep them looking and feeling like new, as well as preserving them so I can have them for a long time. My boyfriend is also the one who bought me the make me crazy brush set from sigma and I have never been disappointed with any of my Sigma products &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> They definitely dry and shape my makeup brushes faster than using brushguards. I love this product but i wish it was cheaper or maybe had more slots in it. The product&#x27;s great though and the quality&#x27;s topnotch. I use this all the time, at least once a week, depending on how often i use my brushes. I prefer it over the brushguards and they really do shape the brushes well. I can usually manage to fit it in my mr. Bunny set, 1 f80, 1realtechniques core set and a few precision brushes as well as a couple of stippling brushes from elf and 1 elf powder brush. You just have to get creative and stick in 2 brushes into big slots.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough of the common, smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Cumpre o prometido. Os pincéis secam rápido e deixam os pelinhos todos no lugar! Produto Sigma muito bom! adorei! A entrega dentro do prazo.</li>
            <li> Wish they&#x27;d make one exclusively for face brushes and one exclusively for eye brushes for those of us who use a lot of brushes often</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype on this product. It&#x27;s nice, but definitely not a must have. My flat kabuki brushes (F80s) still take 24+ hours to dry completely. It does shape the brushes, but I honestly think placing them slightly elevated on a tea towel is less of a hassle and works almost as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this does not help shape smaller brushes (shadow smudgers) because the smallest elastic loop is too large.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do: Dry and Shape my darlings. And on top of that it does it in an orderly, practical fashion. My bathroom is so damn small that the towel construct i used till now was a real hassle to have in there. With this I turn the side with the brushes on the outside, close it and have a little tower that i can put wherever i wish. Why only 4 stars? I just don&#x27;t own so many medium sized brushes. Got barely any use for the medium sized slots. Since I love using different types of eye brushes, 2 small slots are really just not enough for me.</li>
            <li> So far seems to work, I&#x27;m happy with the size. Still not that good for travel as that is what I&#x27;m looking for, something small &amp; light for my brushes for travel.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to dry but o like the reshaping concept.</li>
            <li> I use this item on a daily basis to dry my stipple brush and loose powder brush.  Both are thicker brushes and I was afraid they wouldn&#x27;t dry for the next use, but they dried in a timely manner and kept their shape which is exactly what this product is for.  This is a great solution for brush drying/shaping and is a lot more practical than buying the disposable brush sleeves that cost a fortune over time.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> easy to use and dries your brushes really quickly.  It worked on all my brushes too.  Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Mac brushes</li>
            <li> Love the concept. Also it does help to dry brushes quicker while aiding in keeping the shape of the brushes. However, there is plenty of room for improvement in terms of the structure/fit. For me there were not enough spots for the smaller brushes so i find myself having to put two together in one of the larger holes, or play around with it in order for the smaller brushes to fit in snuggly enough so they can be well shaped while drying. I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite way to dry makeup brushes. It dries faster and I feel like it keeps the brush fresher for longer. I no longer have chunks of &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; coming out of my brush since I have used this.</li>
            <li> So I always hated cleaning my makeup brushed until I got this.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can easily clean my brushes throw them into the dry&#x27;n shape and the next morning I have clean dry brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure now that I clean my brushes regularly I will have less acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> Some brushes take longer to dry than others but a few take no time at all! It&#x27;s great to have.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect!!</li>
            <li> Product is just as described in description. Came super fast! I love it! I&#x27;m a free lance makeup artist and this will be such a big help! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this item soooooo much! It&#x27;s really nice and useful! Only problem is good for large brushes. here&#x27;s only two parts for small brushes.</li>
            <li> I mean...are my brushes totally dry overnight? No. I thought they would be, based on all the reviews. My smaller ones are, but they&#x27;re essentially just laying in the loop, since apparently Sigma didn&#x27;t think we were going to clean our eyshadow brushes, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does do a good job at maintaining the shape of the brushes which fit. and I think the brushes may be a little drier than if I&#x27;d just laid them out on a tea towel, but...eh.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my brushes at all. If anything, keeping them out by the sink dries them faster than using this. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Regular washing of makeup brushes is key to their longevity.  When washing several brushes at once, it can be difficult to find a place to put them so they dry quickly and retain their shape can be a bit more tricky (especially in a small shared bathroom).  Sigma&#x27;s Dry&#x27;n Shape make drying and shaping my brushes so much easier.  It holds my biggest brushes down to my smaller eye brushes.  Everything dries very quickly and when I remove my brushes, they look the way they did the day I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape to hold my Sigma Kabuki brushes, my Sigma F30 Large Powder brush and my smaller eye and face brushes.  Love,love,love this thing!</li>
            <li> Love this. It does what its meant to do.</li>
            <li> If you have already invested in a set of good quality brushes then this is a nice stylish was to reshape, dry and even store your brushes. And because it folds away for storage its easier that using jars or containers. It&#x27;s only out when you need it, so it won&#x27;t take up valuable space..... which can be use by other make-up products.</li>
            <li> I used to have the coastal scents brush guards but now I use this as it dries my brushes quicker.  After filling all the spots and storing them upside own, my brushes dry within 3-4 hours. Storage was also easy and I never had any weird leather smell.  One of my best beauty investments!!</li>
            <li> this dry n shape is very very good！ and it is help to protect the brush and it is convenience to use！</li>
