    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Calgon Ageless Bath Pearls go perfect with a glass of wine and maybe some candles.</li>
            <li>It also has delightful shimmering effects in the water.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>They smell  wonderful.  </li>
            <li>These bath beads smell absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy to drop a fiver on it. :D</li>
            <li>Anything that makes her happy is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>Just pour a hand-full or two into warm water, and they dissolve away and leave the bath smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had mostly great reviews</li>
            <li>They do a good job.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I tried this one out because my husband finds the scent of my favorites (The Village Company) a bit overwhelming and he found this one pleasant in the jar.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t come out covered in glitter, but it&#x27;s really nice to just relax and bask in the sparkling water.</li>
            <li>This pearls work well with a sponge with warm water.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The scent sticks to your body nicely</li>
            <li>They would make a nice sachet too, or potpouri.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely a feminine earthy/musk scent that fills your bathroom.</li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t love it -</li>
            <li>I think its lovely stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product--</li>
            <li>It really does smell great until you put it in the bath</li>
            <li>but this was more clumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of bath salts, milks, bubbles, and whatnots.</li>
            <li>Overall, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the quantity needed (the package says one handful, but I used two capfuls in the end)</li>
            <li>My sister loves this as a present üéÅ I gave her she said it smells great</li>
            <li>I promise you it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I used it a couple times to be sure, and I used more each time to be sure I was using enough.</li>
            <li>i like to use these after a full body shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be a great gift for tweens, teens, new moms, old moms, all the women on your list.</li>
            <li>I get it at WM but wanted to check the price and see if it was available for the monthly shipping, its not, sadly.</li>
            <li>If you take your hands out you see that it is indeed filled with a type of oily softener that drifts into the water, it reminds me of large sand crystals in a way</li>
            <li>Anyway, I read the reviews and had to laugh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bathtub junkie because I often have trouble falling asleep at night, and to me there&#x27;s nothing that helps me more than a nice soak in some scented hot water.</li>
            <li>I probably use way too much playing with it!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be ordering it again, and I have discarded the remainder of the first canister I bought.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s WAY overpriced here on Amazon, I got it at Walmart for $5.</li>
            <li>enough so that I&#x27;m willing to spend quite a bit more than I otherwise would (and have) on it.</li>
            <li>I received these as a gift from a friend not too long ago, and I&#x27;m already buying more.</li>
            <li>The way it makes the water shimmer was a fun little novelty, as was the very light shimmer that remains when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>If you just take this stuff and throw it in the tub, you won&#x27;t see it do much of anything...at all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice that they enhanced my bath water at all.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a decent product if you&#x27;re not paying the Amazon price.</li>
            <li>Silky and soft!  </li>
            <li>when I jump in the shower right after one of her long soaks, but I&#x27;m a guy and what do I know?</li>
            <li>and I will say my skin feels wonderfully soft after only one soaking (especially in my excessively hot water that drys the skin out).</li>
            <li>Instead, when I leave my bath, my skin feels soft and smooth, and has a little luminescent pop from the beads (a sheen you can see just from scooping up a handful of the beads).</li>
            <li>In my opinion, check out village natural products.</li>
            <li>I found it also left some kind of icky clumps in the tub after I drained it.</li>
            <li>Calgon&#x27;s Ageless Bath Pearls are a lovely little treat for anyone who works long days and comes home bone-weary.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone who uses baths as a de-stresser after a long, trying day.</li>
            <li>Leaves sparkles on your skin, a little weird but kind of fun.  </li>
            <li>I soak long, sometimes several hours, and this is the first bath product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin really dry.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars because they&#x27;re expensive online, and because I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>

            <li> Calgon Ageless Bath Pearls go perfect with a glass of wine and maybe some candles. The scent is lovely a feminine earthy/musk scent that fills your bathroom. It also has delightful shimmering effects in the water. You won&#x27;t come out covered in glitter, but it&#x27;s really nice to just relax and bask in the sparkling water. Yep, you&#x27;re 12 again. That&#x27;s just my humble opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a great gift for tweens, teens, new moms, old moms, all the women on your list.</li>
            <li> Did not obtain admire, do not recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t love it - but my wife does.  Anything that makes her happy is a bargain.  I think that it leaves the tub kinda&#x27; slippery when I jump in the shower right after one of her long soaks, but I&#x27;m a guy and what do I know?</li>
            <li> Its double the price here I get it at WM but wanted to check the price and see if it was available for the monthly shipping, its not, sadly. Anyway, I read the reviews and had to laugh. If you just take this stuff and throw it in the tub, you won&#x27;t see it do much of anything...at all. I think its a sensory thing for me, I like the smell of it, the feel of it in my hands. I fill my hands with it and close fisted put my hands in the water where I feel it get very cold. If you take your hands out you see that it is indeed filled with a type of oily softener that drifts into the water, it reminds me of large sand crystals in a way and I like to rub it on my arms and lower it into the water. I probably use way too much playing with it! I think its lovely stuff and it lasts me a month or so, I&#x27;m happy to drop a fiver on it. :D</li>
            <li> This Calgon bath product does not work for me.  It has an irritating quality to it that causes a low grade bladder irritation and a skin itch.  I won&#x27;t be ordering it again, and I have discarded the remainder of the first canister I bought.  It took me a while to realize that Calgon bath pearls was the culprit causing the irritation.</li>
            <li> This pearls work well with a sponge with warm water. They are so relaxing. They do a good job.</li>
            <li> skin feels like silk after a 15 minute soak. i like to use these after a full body shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice that they enhanced my bath water at all. No reason to buy it.</li>
            <li> Silky and soft!  Leaves sparkles on your skin, a little weird but kind of fun.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bathtub junkie because I often have trouble falling asleep at night, and to me there&#x27;s nothing that helps me more than a nice soak in some scented hot water. I&#x27;m a huge fan of bath salts, milks, bubbles, and whatnots. I tried this one out because my husband finds the scent of my favorites (The Village Company) a bit overwhelming and he found this one pleasant in the jar. First of all, it&#x27;s WAY overpriced here on Amazon, I got it at Walmart for $5. Expect to use quite a bit if you&#x27;d like to smell it while you soak. The way it makes the water shimmer was a fun little novelty, as was the very light shimmer that remains when you&#x27;re done. The scent sticks to your body nicely and I will say my skin feels wonderfully soft after only one soaking (especially in my excessively hot water that drys the skin out). Overall, I wasn&#x27;t happy with the quantity needed (the package says one handful, but I used two capfuls in the end) but it&#x27;s a decent product if you&#x27;re not paying the Amazon price. If I had paid $13 or whatever for it I woyl be disappointed with it. In my opinion, check out village natural products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I received these as a gift from a friend not too long ago, and I&#x27;m already buying more. Calgon&#x27;s Ageless Bath Pearls are a lovely little treat for anyone who works long days and comes home bone-weary. Just pour a hand-full or two into warm water, and they dissolve away and leave the bath smelling wonderful. I soak long, sometimes several hours, and this is the first bath product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin really dry. Instead, when I leave my bath, my skin feels soft and smooth, and has a little luminescent pop from the beads (a sheen you can see just from scooping up a handful of the beads). I&#x27;m in love with this product--enough so that I&#x27;m willing to spend quite a bit more than I otherwise would (and have) on it. Highly recommended to anyone who uses baths as a de-stresser after a long, trying day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Sorry Calgon,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this item. I read reviews about how luxurious this made their bath.&lt;br /&gt;No bubbles, no silky skin and no lovely fragrance. I won&#x27;t purchase this item again. :(</li>
            <li> We found really cute champagne bottles by Wilton, and were looking for something inexpensive to put in them for a lingerie bridal shower but everything smelled horrible - bath salts, bubble bath, etc.  We found these for $6.50 for 16 oz at K-mart.  They smell  wonderful.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them.  They would make a nice sachet too, or potpouri.  I&#x27;m giving only 4 stars because they&#x27;re expensive online, and because I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
            <li> These bath beads smell absolutely wonderful! They also come as a shower gel. I promise you it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> My sister loves this as a present üéÅ I gave her she said it smells great</li>
            <li> I would not even give it one star if I can. No bubble no smell no nothing. Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had mostly great reviews but I had a different experience. It really does smell great until you put it in the bath, then you don&#x27;t smell anything. I used it a couple times to be sure, and I used more each time to be sure I was using enough. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel moisturized in any way and after towelling off my skin felt a little dry. I have other bath products that leave my skin soft and moisturized. I found it also left some kind of icky clumps in the tub after I drained it. I have bath oil that leaves a bit of a ring in the tub but this was more clumpy. This product didn&#x27;t do it for me and I won&#x27;t buy it again. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to someone else to try and see what they think about it. I know I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
