    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best thing about this product?</li>
            <li>I have found that if you do one eye at a time, it works best.  </li>
            <li>The best fibre lash extensions mascara is by Cherry Blooms.</li>
            <li>But I am very happy with the way this product works, and that I don&#x27;t need to pay $60 for the effect (as opposed to the Cherry Bloom mascara).&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>But until then sign me &#x27;Happy&#x27;!</li>
            <li>but i LOVE the effect!!!!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t AS mind blowing as I thought it would be but is still a great mascara!</li>
            <li>The fibers are AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>Impressive.  </li>
            <li>I put my Merle Norman mascara over it and it comes out beautifully!!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>I tell everyone about them I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li>If you take your time and apply it with patience, it is awesome.</li>
            <li>this is the best mascara i have ever used!</li>
            <li>it makes my lashes look so great!</li>
            <li>With alll the hype about fibers and mascara, I thought this would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>I tried this at Sephora and was impressed at the time with results.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me!  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>All I can say is that is the best Mascara I have ever ever used !</li>
            <li>after 2-3 times the results are remarkable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whoever invented this product is brilliant.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an incredible difference shown when using this product.</li>
            <li>Good look!</li>
            <li>Too Faced should drop this from their product line before it damages their good reputation (and my lashes)!</li>
            <li>They are really beautiful ...</li>
            <li>They are really beautiful ...</li>
            <li>If you have beautiful lashes, this will make them pop.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t travelled nor had it experienced any temperature changes.  </li>
            <li>The best way to remove it is in the shower and using warm water over your eyes - it will soften up and wash away.  </li>
            <li>I tried the younique brand as well as a cheaper alternative and was happy, but the fibers still fell off.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this mascara though.</li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>GREAT product!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product does great with eyelash length, however when you put it on after a bit</li>
            <li>You have to continuously build up the mascara and fibers to achieve any great length, though</li>
            <li>However, over all I was so happy with how it made my eyes look.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this.</li>
            <li>But for now, I&#x27;m a happy woman.</li>
            <li>i love this product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this!!</li>

            <li>and she loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This two layer process is the answer to my prayers - eyelash wise</li>
            <li>I cant believe I thought buying this product would be a good idea....</li>
            <li>The mascara went on very smoothly and did a great job of keeping my lashes separate.</li>
            <li>Very interesting.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product on most days.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t thicken them at all, but I am very pleased...</li>
            <li>It has been many years since I have 2 mascaras that make me happy, but too faced  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the way this enhances my lashes!</li>
            <li>worked with a girl who had amazing lashes, she told me about too faced,</li>
            <li>This mascara is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been loving it ever since.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really more about how good the fibers are than anything.</li>
            <li>so i can use my own mascara --</li>
            <li>I liked the fibers but not the mascara.</li>
            <li>wish they sold the fibers on their own.</li>
            <li>I like to kind of wiggle the brush as I do it.</li>
            <li>I honestly think they dropped the ball on this one.</li>
            <li>To be honestly I have no idea</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,product was perfect.</li>
            <li>but the unique formula allows me to build my lashes to great lengths.  </li>
            <li>Knew it was too good to be true!  </li>
            <li>I decided to go against what most people had said, I had heard so many good things from friends.  </li>
            <li>The fibers on the eyelash is a wonderful concept and I have very sensitive eyes and for getting stuff in them.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap on amazon, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I am a mascara-holic, I love mascara and have tried every kind out there...</li>
            <li>I love it honestly</li>
            <li>I love this product it made my eyes look amazing.</li>
            <li>By far the best mascara on the planet!!!  </li>
            <li>so they look natural, but these are awesome!</li>
            <li>But, Two Faced truly does a great job of making my lashes look longer and more full and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The fibers that you apply to your lashes can easily get in your eyes and irritate and they didn&#x27;t make my lashes look any longer at all!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>When I order this product I was expecting it to be amazing and trust me, I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>The best mascara I have used to build lashes, strenghten and condition them is Bare Minerals,</li>
            <li>First time ever I have great lashes ...told and showed everyone I know, will order again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s much more affordable here on Amazon and becomes incredibly easy when you get used to it!</li>
            <li>as it works a million times better.</li>
            <li>do a much better job without the addit.</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad that I</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I still have the duo of Better</li>
            <li>I love how my eyelashes look when I have this mascara on, I definetly will be ordering Too</li>
            <li>Faced - Better</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite for going out.  </li>
            <li>Love it,, please let me know if you will be carring this FRIM now on</li>
            <li>That seems to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried and tested most of them already.</li>
            <li>love love love it</li>
            <li>and I love amazon</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews before purchasing this product and I&#x27;m glad I did; more so glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I found this at Costco (and will be buying more before everyone in town discovers it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better than any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mascara that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Use as many coats as desired.</li>
            <li>Ok so I bought this mascara before reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li>So glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I could comb them, but it was just one more step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I was able to comb and re-apply, but they didn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I received more than one comment/</li>
            <li>I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend using your favorite mascara as the top coat to keep eyelashes from sticking together</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay....</li>
            <li>My favorite part is probably the take-off of the mascara.</li>
            <li>The mascara doesn&#x27;t come off if it comes into contact with water unless - which I absolutely LOVE.</li>
            <li>(well it just hasn&#x27;t been proven safe).</li>
            <li>so I just adjust how many layers I want based on how balanced it looks.</li>
            <li>so i love the look</li>
            <li>, I just wish the product itself was better made.</li>
            <li>I even gave it more than one try.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is okay.</li>
            <li>I have used it three times and I am impressed totally.</li>
            <li>I tried this at Sephora and it is just ok.</li>
            <li>One more thing..</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I did and that&#x27;s what sold me on this stuff :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.....</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite products.</li>
            <li>Wonderful results if used properly.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Too Faced and have continued to be a fan for years.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product i read most of the reviews from both sides.</li>
            <li>I thought the concept was interesting until I realized that the fibers in this mascara were nylon.  </li>
            <li>I returned it after three days for a Givenchy mascara that I love.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favorite and skip this product-you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is okay</li>
            <li>But I bet there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li>and I just wanted more length for going out.</li>
            <li>The l&#x27;oriel packaging is better as is the performance.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara...</li>
            <li>I tried this on at ULTA and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money on it.</li>
            <li>Yeah its that sticky where your top and bottom lashes will stick together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to getting more practice in...</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>I usually love Too Faced products</li>
            <li>, I have naturally full lashes, I just like a glamorous touch here and there! :)</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, mascara and fiber makes my eyes look huge without the glue and trying to make it fit on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t add much time to my regime and the results are awesome.</li>
            <li>lengthening and building up of my own lashes is immediate and very evident.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who can pretty much wear any mascara and still have amazing lashes, this will work great for you.</li>
            <li>to)&lt;br /&gt;100% happy customer, quick shipping, product as pictured, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this mascara, but it was a huge letdown.</li>
            <li>This such is incredible</li>
            <li>It made my lashes a good bit longer,  it didn&#x27;t give as much volume as I thought it might.</li>
            <li>I have to use baby oil to get it off but will use it when I really want to have a good effect</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mascara because my lashes did look good when I was putting it on.</li>
            <li>I had bought the same product at Sephora and loved it!</li>
            <li>The product comes off quite easily too</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easy to wash off in the shower with some rubbing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is SO easy to take off, I don&#x27;t even need makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a water-proof mascara... but easy to take off.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly easy to remove too.</li>
            <li>The mascara burns my eyes, it also doesn&#x27;t wipe away easily.</li>
            <li>The fiber stuff went on easily as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleanup was easy.</li>
            <li>I really liked this the first couple of times I used it.  </li>
            <li>and I would like to say that if done properly this mascara Will look beautiful.</li>
            <li>hands down the best.</li>
            <li>It does build the lashes, but since my lashes are fine, it clumped and my lashes stuck together.</li>
            <li>While the mascara worked fine in terms of separation and definition, the nylon fibers would not adhere to my lashes like they did in the store.</li>
            <li>and it was super tacky!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product and removes easily with a make-up remover cloth!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I bought this mascara, thinking it&#x27;d make my sparse but mid-length eyelashes look nice.  </li>
            <li>So I bought it here off amazon because the it was cheaper and had free shipping.</li>
            <li>even the packaging of that stuff looks cheap to me)</li>
            <li>I purchased at amazon, no tax, free shipping is pricy, but I use Lancôme, so it was comparable.</li>
            <li>Before putting fibers on you need to lightly wipe off any excess fibers on the edge of the tube.</li>
            <li>I even took a light nap in mine today and it did not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the time, money and effort to look sexy and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe worth trying with a better mascara or waterproof one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather buy the cheap stuff that washes off.</li>
            <li>My lashes are longer with cheap drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li>So easy to put on and washes off super easy.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried MANY different mascaras, and have never found a &#x27;builder&#x27; mascara as good as this one, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>have not had any of the issues I have read, but I was able to research the right way to do it before</li>
            <li>Love this product, you need to know how to use it right and your lashed will look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping</li>
            <li>I wear very good face creams products (due to allergies)</li>
            <li>I love it - it builds my lashes to a much more pronounced look with no clumping and at night it cleans off normally without a bunch of clumps and tubes.</li>
            <li>I found this in a local store and it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because of the ecstatic videos I&#x27;ve seen of it.  </li>
            <li>Too Faced original formula.</li>
            <li>Not only does it give AMAZING volume and length, but when it dries, it ABSOLUTELY does NOT flake or smudge and looks just as good at the end of my day as it did when i put it on.</li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always excited to tell them what I use.  </li>
            <li>I felt I had to adjust my original review.  </li>
            <li>It nice and make my lashes super nice ad long</li>
            <li>My tiny, sparse lashes were slightly clumpy but I was pretty impressed that they looked more noticeable than with my regular mascara (Dior, which is an awesome mascara for volume)</li>
            <li>You can use a clean finger to lift lashes up after you have applied the product and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this does lengthen your lashes and make them look awesome, I have a huge complaint as to the stickiness of this product.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to add that another reviewer may be right that this may only work for people that have great lashes to begin with.</li>
            <li>So here is what I think...if you want this mascara for like a special event or something..it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is very simple to use and makes my eyes look bright.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for this type of mascara, I would recommend buying good fibers and just use your regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews on products, but I love this one so much I felt compelled.</li>
            <li>If you have very short lashes, this might be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>stuff really is cool.....</li>
            <li>I love it, it really does make your lashes look longer.</li>
            <li>Thing was, I couldn&#x27;t even keep the stuff on a full day without going nuts.  </li>
            <li>It really does lengthen lashes and I love the way my lashes look immediately after application.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to get off, also.</li>
            <li>To wash it off, I use a mild, tear-free baby wash, as I do with all eye make-up, and it came off with ease.</li>
            <li>So then I moved to Latisse, which wasn&#x27;t as bold as the extensions but still worked.</li>
            <li>but it actually is really easy and quit fast.</li>
            <li>This product is still the best product I&#x27;ve used to make short lashes long.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time to buy this product, I love it!</li>
            <li>It made my lashes so pretty and a lot of people noticed the length!</li>
            <li>more time and attention for application than my previous mascaras - this is already a three-step process according to its own directions.  </li>
            <li>Product is great, I was a little concerned however when it didn&#x27;t come in</li>
            <li>At first I read the reviews and they prevented me from buying this right away!</li>
            <li>Every time I have it on, several people comment about how amazing I look or that my eyes look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>The brush is not very defining, but it has good coverage and volume.</li>
            <li>When you look around, you can actually see the sides of your own nose, but your brain just ignores it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked, worth the price</li>
            <li>I rarely write product reviews, but am writing one for this stuff because I want to see it go mainstream.</li>
            <li>Instead, I look like I have great, thick, fantastic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>If you see any fibers kind of clumping your eyelash together, just use your finger to pull it off before you do the next step.</li>
            <li>I was Not crazy about the step #two product that looked and felt like lint feathers.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel is worth the money.</li>
            <li>the falsies volume express waterproof - then I would put the golden two face mascara</li>
            <li>what was in this golden bottle didn&#x27;t even know what nylon lash was written in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I loved this product it made my lashes super long, but it is kinda clumpy and really sticky.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how other girls were able to give this mascara any more than 1 star.</li>
            <li>it shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>Use fast and if you want straight perfect eye lashes this is not for you.this mascara is to achieve thick full lashes.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>No one can see those gorgeous lashes if they are closed shut!</li>
            <li>if you do it right, you&#x27;re gonna be in love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use it right and follow the directions, then it works.</li>
            <li>It looks FABULOUS, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t dry out in the tube quickly, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>But realistically it was the golden bottle that really really made my eye lashes longer then ever before!</li>
            <li>So, to be fair, my lashes are already a decent length, but even after curling them and applying regular mascara, they would never hold the curl for more than the first ten minutes.</li>
            <li>and I felt that mascara worked fine for me, but I was willing to try something new.</li>
            <li>Just a super gentle wipe with your fingers.</li>
            <li>If you already have nice lashes but want crazy-long, thick spider lashes, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>was very fast.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this new mascara.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyelashes, and this works wonders!  </li>
            <li>I do like the fact that the fibers are white, so I&#x27;ve never been able to notice them on my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the things that the negative reviews have stated.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product, due to using Better Than Sex mascara.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to pay the high price of falsh lashes this is the way to go!!  </li>
            <li>Plus I love that I don&#x27;t feel it and that I can wash it off at night and start all over the next day.</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara in February for my birthday at Sephora and was kinda sceptical at first because I had never tried fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and use it when I want the extra length and fullness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bit tricky to put on at first.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, however I don&#x27;t like the WHITE fibers.</li>
            <li>I have short, stubby eyelashes, and this lengthens them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Finish doing your hair first</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to curl your lashes later.  </li>
            <li>only downside is that the nylon fiber tube doesn&#x27;t come with as many uses as the mascara itself.</li>
            <li>While it does lengthen your lashes it is VERY sticky!</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this product</li>
            <li>Basically unless you wash your mascara brush off after each use, the product does not stay consistent from use to use.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that the whole point of the mascara !</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, thank you!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different mascaras from the $5 -$30</li>
            <li>It can be tricky at first but</li>
            <li>My regular mascara works much much better</li>
            <li>I felt it worked pretty well and seemed to enhance the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>You put the mascara on first, then before it dries apply the nylon fibers.</li>
            <li>I love that the fibers were white so you can see what you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li>This is my first try with a fiber mascara and after only one try with no research on how to apply, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>few good tips I have read....</li>
            <li>I have probably tried more than 50 different mascaras throughout my adult life, and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>The mascara wand bristles are too far apart and doesn&#x27;t apply the mascara evenly, smoothly or cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, and clean up is  no problem.</li>
            <li>I am just using the mascara, and not the whit flaky stuff that is supposed to be the Magic to give you long lashes.  </li>
            <li>First of all this is a real review.</li>
            <li>They were just long enough to look good but not fake.</li>
            <li>gives you a full, lush lash.</li>
            <li>think the trick to avoid the \\&quot;clumpiness\\&quot; that some people have experienced is to use a good magnifying mirror when applying it and to really comb the base coat through the lashes well before applying the nylon fibers, then let them dry a bit before combing on the top coat.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking pretty lashes!  </li>
            <li>I use my normal eye makeup remover and the product comes right off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, you have to make sure your eye lashes are dry.</li>
            <li>My lashes look longer using this product than when I use regular mascara, and it is easy to remove with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if you want you dont necessarily have to apply the little white fibers, the first mascara tube itself works great by its self too!</li>
            <li>The end result are little nylon extensions at the end of your own lashes creating a longer lash look.</li>
            <li>the cost is too much for the quality of the product</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to read three whole sentences to figure out how the product works, just look at the two tubes.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely made my lashes look longer and fuller than anything else</li>
            <li>&quot; much easier on my lashes.</li>
            <li>But it takes some time of gentle rubbing or washing.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This mascara work very well.</li>
            <li>It does make your lashes very spidery at the tips.</li>
            <li>Very Black]]&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>This has to be applied gently and with coats</li>
            <li>It really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great-it really thickens my lashes</li>
            <li>In my case, it didnt really work...</li>
            <li>Like it so much ...</li>
            <li>it so much ...</li>
            <li>When applying it you must be patient and can&#x27;t rush it to much or it will come out all clumpy.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>It really looks like you went to a salon.  </li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t have lashes.</li>
            <li>Really goopy.</li>
            <li>They just really look and feel like feathers, not lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also was using Sephora&#x27;s disposable mascara wands to test which had much wider,</li>
            <li>Very sticky on your lashes.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very client look.</li>
            <li>Finally I gave in and bought the product, but I&#x27;m afraid it doesn&#x27;t work any better than many of the lush mascaras available at more reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li>This, however, didn&#x27;t work so well with my stubby, sparse, instantly-deflating lashes--but it did work beautifully on my sister (who has naturally long, fluffy lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont wear false lashes so this was the perfect alternative for me, and its not all clumpy and gross either</li>
            <li>: I definitely think this is over-hyped and over-priced, but it is a decent mascara--and a pretty unique one to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It applies easily, lasts all day, and makes my lashes look LONG.</li>
            <li>I have really short, thin, light lashes and this makes them look long and awesome.</li>
            <li>Finish with a DIFFERENT mascara than the original.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love it</li>
            <li>It is better then what I expected!</li>
            <li>It comes off sooooo easy after a long day!</li>
            <li>Always clean any clumps off brush before starting.</li>
            <li>Well fast forward to present day and finding out that Latisse is not approved for pregnant women</li>
            <li>My L&#x27;oriel lasts all day and looks smooth with no flakes, but I can&#x27;t get as long a lash.</li>
            <li>You can use them more heavily if you like, but I try to use gently because using too much can feel weird.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>, thank you so much amazon for still selling the original formula as the new one is no good, thank you, I love it</li>
            <li>Use step 1 on the tips of your top lashes, about halfway down.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a ton on mascara and have a drawer full !</li>
            <li>So there you are, trying to look half-way decent, with your eyes watery and red while you attempt to get some of the stuff out of your eyes, which only makes the lashes clump together even more (since touching them makes them adhere to each other)!  </li>
            <li>It is like putting cotton candy fibers onto the lashes but it turned black with the top coat</li>
            <li>either the falsies agian or clump crusher by lash blast just to make it stick and look more black.</li>
            <li>Could use slight more volume enhancer</li>
            <li>it get&#x27;s too sticky and goopy to finish with the main mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly the mascara itself</li>
            <li>I was eager to give this a try from the decent reviews I&#x27;ve seen/read</li>
            <li>Use one coat of your favorite regular mascara, then use your regular curler.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ready to Wear makes something similar that I&#x27;ll try too, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep a backup of this product:)</li>
            <li>I too am older and have thinning lashes.</li>
            <li>you could definitely combine the fibers with your favorite mascara for the ultimate</li>
            <li>Beautiful thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly recommendit</li>
            <li>lol, I then do 1 coat of the base mascara and then quickly apply the extensions applicator (this way it sticks right on)</li>
            <li>Plus, I was always conscious of feeling them attached to my real lashes.</li>
            <li>I used to have lash extensions for about a year and they were great but too expensive for the maintenance.</li>
            <li>My lashes have never been this long and full.</li>
            <li>I put it on just like I would normally do.</li>
            <li>Takes me maybe 1 minute longer than normal mascara.</li>
            <li>I have normal length lashes</li>
            <li>This mascara is the only kind that I wear that actually makes my Asian eyes stand out and make me look</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the actual mascara, at least give the fibers a try with your own!</li>
            <li>I can wear it everyday and add more plush for evening wear..</li>
            <li>So what I normally do regardless of the type of mascara...</li>
            <li>thinking it was normal mascara.</li>
            <li>the white nylon feathers making a full coat repeat the first Step of  black mascara quickly add another coat of nylon feathers this time only adding it to the tips repeat the first step</li>
            <li>More time consuming, couldn&#x27;t stand the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; that were dry and looked like fuzz that I had to put on after the actual mascara.</li>
            <li>There is an identical product from Younique that uses all natural BLACK fibers and is 100x Better.</li>
            <li>I have super long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li>Use a blow dryer on cool to dry them when you are done.</li>
            <li>After that I seal it with some of my other cheap mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lashes ended up very pretty long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of two makeup products I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I have always used fiber mascaras to lengthen/thicken my lashes, and this one is my absolute least favorite.</li>
            <li>It really looks natural, you can evenly apply this product onto your natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately since buying the product I have not been able to achieve the same results remotely close to what I saw in the store.</li>
            <li>I like this product- the down side: runs out quickly!</li>
            <li>I have used this about five times now and have found that my lashes do not look the same as they did the first time around.</li>
            <li>The too faced better than false lashes extreme is much better.</li>
            <li>What a great problem to have!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that perhaps any negative reviewers didn&#x27;t follow directions: you have to use black as a primer</li>
            <li>My friend left me her brand new golden bottle when she left to go home from visiting</li>
            <li>I was almost tempted to return it after reading so many negative posts, but then decided since there was also several positive...</li>
            <li>Maybe the mascara is old.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t damage your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I did two applications just for poops and giggles, and my lashes nearly hit my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>The tube of fibers will outlast the mascara by far.</li>
            <li>it will cause your eyelashes to stick together and some of the eyelashes if you get hair stuck near them</li>
            <li>I also put hair spray in the formula and it solved the water proof and soft lash problem.</li>
            <li>This 2-step system has completely changed the look of my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t get completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>far apart bristles than the ones included with product.</li>
            <li>It took days for it to completely come off, and</li>
            <li>Not only did it make my lashes look so much longer, but the mascara is like glue...</li>
            <li>The product was either dryer up or more complicated than it was worth.</li>
            <li>Illegal Lengths by Maybelline is far superior, and has fibers in it.  </li>
            <li>While not the answer to my problem, it is better than plain mascara while my lashes (hopefully) grow back.</li>
            <li>Lightly apply one coat of mascara and then swift swipe of the fibers, wait about a minute to dry And repeat until your eyelashes are as long as you want them.</li>
            <li>Maybe even when I get to work, to let my lashes dry completely after washing my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you must curl them first.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more, wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li>First step to using this mascara add the black first coat next you</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are what I would consider to be pretty average normally.</li>
            <li>I find that (like other users here) this mascara causes my eyelashes to clump fairly significantly so that I have to also come the lashes out after the third step.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend you chose a different fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>Also, the mascara provided in the kit is fine as the base, but I follow the fiber coating with another, more volume intense mascara.  </li>
            <li>A gentle hand goes a long way.</li>
            <li>High hopes but was really let down.</li>
            <li>I have extremely short and thin lashes and this product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed slight clumpage, but an eyelash comb seemed to clean it up enough.</li>
            <li>, it is stickier than regular mascara, and dries more slowly.  </li>
            <li>Was kinda weird feeling the first couple of time, apply mascara than the white fuzzy, I wear contacts, I recommend putting in contacts after,,,,,,,,After experimenting, have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>After trying this for the first time I cannot use any other mascara.  </li>
            <li>Such a natural feel!</li>
            <li>False eyelashes will look MUCH fuller, but this is still a nice little way to give you some vavavoom without damaging your natural eyelashes with eye lash glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only gave this two stars Instead of just one because the mascara by itself is decent enough to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am still considering getting fake lashes as this wasn&#x27;t as amazing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I use my general mascara for my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>The pictures on TV of the ladies who&lt;br /&gt;got fabulous lashes have to be fake, because I did exactly what the instructions said and didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>In order to completely remove the product from my lashes, I have to coat my fingers with the coconut oil and massage the lashes between my thumb and middle finger.  </li>
            <li>And be careful not to glob too much on at once, it will get sticky.</li>
            <li>The mascara definitely has fibers and they definitely cling to your lashes, but they build up in a very unnatural looking way and ultimately flake off in bits and get in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the mascara was old and tacky when I sampled it or whether it was the different brush that I used...</li>
            <li>Takes too long and looks just like any normal mascara.</li>
            <li>I have thick, but average-length and rather light eyelashes.</li>
            <li>What is worse, every time I blink the top lashes stick to the bottom</li>
            <li>So I bought the too faced better than false lashes at costco and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn false eyelashes since I was 16 (many years ago) and thought I&#x27;d give this pricey product a try.  </li>
            <li>This item is better than false lashes.  </li>
            <li>otherwise you will get a hot mess.</li>
            <li>When it is dry the bottom and top lashes would stick together when you blink creating a hard time to open and shut your eyes.</li>
            <li>Faced Better than False Lashes, despite the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>I thought that it couldn&#x27;t possibly work, that the brush with the fibers would just get black and clumpy from being added over freshly mascaraed lashes, and that the whole thing would just be a big mess (</li>
            <li>I am not sure that I think it is worth the price though.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a separate top and base coat so that the final coat was a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I had fun playing with this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d choose it over lash tubes.</li>
            <li>The fibers provided with the mascara do not stick very well, so I used some previously purchased from QVC (which are wonderful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually happier with my regular $9 mascara (Bare Esensuals) - it makes my lashes look longer than this product did.</li>
            <li>They looked fantastic the first few days, but after showering a few times I noticed some lashes falling out a little at a time so that by the end of my trip I had some noticeable gaps.</li>
            <li>Not too short but not really long.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The best thing about this product?</li>
            <li> I have found that if you do one eye at a time, it works best.  </li>
            <li> The best fibre lash extensions mascara is by Cherry Blooms.</li>
            <li> But I am very happy with the way this product works, and that I don&#x27;t need to pay $60 for the effect (as opposed to the Cherry Bloom mascara).&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> But until then sign me &#x27;Happy&#x27;!</li>
            <li> but i LOVE the effect!!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t AS mind blowing as I thought it would be but is still a great mascara!</li>
            <li> The fibers are AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Impressive.  </li>
            <li> I put my Merle Norman mascara over it and it comes out beautifully!!</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> I tell everyone about them I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> If you take your time and apply it with patience, it is awesome.</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara i have ever used!</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes look so great!</li>
            <li> With alll the hype about fibers and mascara, I thought this would be perfect.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Perfect!</li>
            <li> I tried this at Sephora and was impressed at the time with results.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me!  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that is the best Mascara I have ever ever used !</li>
            <li> after 2-3 times the results are remarkable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whoever invented this product is brilliant.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an incredible difference shown when using this product.</li>
            <li> Good look!</li>
            <li> Too Faced should drop this from their product line before it damages their good reputation (and my lashes)!</li>
            <li> They are really beautiful ...</li>
            <li> They are really beautiful ...</li>
            <li> If you have beautiful lashes, this will make them pop.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t travelled nor had it experienced any temperature changes.  </li>
            <li> The best way to remove it is in the shower and using warm water over your eyes - it will soften up and wash away.  </li>
            <li> I tried the younique brand as well as a cheaper alternative and was happy, but the fibers still fell off.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this mascara though.</li>
            <li> Its great.</li>
            <li> Great product,</li>
            <li> GREAT product!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product does great with eyelash length, however when you put it on after a bit</li>
            <li> You have to continuously build up the mascara and fibers to achieve any great length, though</li>
            <li> However, over all I was so happy with how it made my eyes look.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this.</li>
            <li> But for now, I&#x27;m a happy woman.</li>
            <li> i love this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I do and it works beautifully if you use good products.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!</li>
            <li> amazing stuff!</li>

            <li> I tried this product from Sephora and loved it, it was cheaper online to I ordered it on here.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This two layer process is the answer to my prayers - eyelash wise</li>
            <li> I cant believe I thought buying this product would be a good idea....</li>
            <li> The mascara went on very smoothly and did a great job of keeping my lashes separate.</li>
            <li> Very interesting.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product on most days.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t thicken them at all, but I am very pleased...</li>
            <li> It has been many years since I have 2 mascaras that make me happy, but too faced  </li>
            <li> I love that!</li>
            <li> Tried it, and love it!  </li>
            <li> I think this product is ingenious!  </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara out!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the way this enhances my lashes!</li>
            <li> worked with a girl who had amazing lashes, she told me about too faced,</li>
            <li> This mascara is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been loving it ever since.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really more about how good the fibers are than anything.</li>
            <li> so i can use my own mascara --</li>
            <li> I liked the fibers but not the mascara.</li>
            <li> wish they sold the fibers on their own.</li>
            <li> I like to kind of wiggle the brush as I do it.</li>
            <li> I honestly think they dropped the ball on this one.</li>
            <li> To be honestly I have no idea</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,product was perfect.</li>
            <li> but the unique formula allows me to build my lashes to great lengths.  </li>
            <li> Knew it was too good to be true!  </li>
            <li> I decided to go against what most people had said, I had heard so many good things from friends.  </li>
            <li> The fibers on the eyelash is a wonderful concept and I have very sensitive eyes and for getting stuff in them.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap on amazon, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara-holic, I love mascara and have tried every kind out there...</li>
            <li> I love it honestly</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my eyes look amazing.</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara on the planet!!!  </li>
            <li> so they look natural, but these are awesome!</li>
            <li> But, Two Faced truly does a great job of making my lashes look longer and more full and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The fibers that you apply to your lashes can easily get in your eyes and irritate and they didn&#x27;t make my lashes look any longer at all!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> When I order this product I was expecting it to be amazing and trust me, I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have used to build lashes, strenghten and condition them is Bare Minerals,</li>
            <li> First time ever I have great lashes ...told and showed everyone I know, will order again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s much more affordable here on Amazon and becomes incredibly easy when you get used to it!</li>
            <li> as it works a million times better.</li>
            <li> do a much better job without the addit.</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad that I</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I still have the duo of Better</li>
            <li> I love how my eyelashes look when I have this mascara on, I definetly will be ordering Too</li>
            <li> Faced - Better</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite for going out.  </li>
            <li> Love it,, please let me know if you will be carring this FRIM now on</li>
            <li> That seems to work better for me.  </li>

            <li> love love love it</li>
            <li> and I love amazon</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before purchasing this product and I&#x27;m glad I did; more so glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I found this at Costco (and will be buying more before everyone in town discovers it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Better than any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mascara that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Use as many coats as desired.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this mascara before reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> So glad I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I could comb them, but it was just one more step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was able to comb and re-apply, but they didn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I received more than one comment/</li>
            <li> I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend using your favorite mascara as the top coat to keep eyelashes from sticking together</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s okay....</li>
            <li> My favorite part is probably the take-off of the mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t come off if it comes into contact with water unless - which I absolutely LOVE.</li>
            <li> (well it just hasn&#x27;t been proven safe).</li>
            <li> so I just adjust how many layers I want based on how balanced it looks.</li>
            <li> so i love the look</li>
            <li> , I just wish the product itself was better made.</li>
            <li> I even gave it more than one try.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is okay.</li>
            <li> I have used it three times and I am impressed totally.</li>
            <li> I tried this at Sephora and it is just ok.</li>
            <li> One more thing..</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I did and that&#x27;s what sold me on this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.....</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful results if used properly.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced and have continued to be a fan for years.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product i read most of the reviews from both sides.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was interesting until I realized that the fibers in this mascara were nylon.  </li>
            <li> I returned it after three days for a Givenchy mascara that I love.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favorite and skip this product-you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is okay</li>
            <li> But I bet there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted more length for going out.</li>
            <li> The l&#x27;oriel packaging is better as is the performance.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara...</li>
            <li> I tried this on at ULTA and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money on it.</li>
            <li> Yeah its that sticky where your top and bottom lashes will stick together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to getting more practice in...</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li> I usually love Too Faced products</li>
            <li> , I have naturally full lashes, I just like a glamorous touch here and there! :)</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, mascara and fiber makes my eyes look huge without the glue and trying to make it fit on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t add much time to my regime and the results are awesome.</li>
            <li> lengthening and building up of my own lashes is immediate and very evident.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person who can pretty much wear any mascara and still have amazing lashes, this will work great for you.</li>
            <li> to)&lt;br /&gt;100% happy customer, quick shipping, product as pictured, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this mascara, but it was a huge letdown.</li>
            <li> This such is incredible</li>
            <li> It made my lashes a good bit longer,  it didn&#x27;t give as much volume as I thought it might.</li>
            <li> I have to use baby oil to get it off but will use it when I really want to have a good effect</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara because my lashes did look good when I was putting it on.</li>
            <li> I had bought the same product at Sephora and loved it!</li>
            <li> The product comes off quite easily too</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to remove, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easy to wash off in the shower with some rubbing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is SO easy to take off, I don&#x27;t even need makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a water-proof mascara... but easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly easy to remove too.</li>
            <li> The mascara burns my eyes, it also doesn&#x27;t wipe away easily.</li>
            <li> The fiber stuff went on easily as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleanup was easy.</li>
            <li> I really liked this the first couple of times I used it.  </li>
            <li> and I would like to say that if done properly this mascara Will look beautiful.</li>
            <li> hands down the best.</li>
            <li> It does build the lashes, but since my lashes are fine, it clumped and my lashes stuck together.</li>
            <li> While the mascara worked fine in terms of separation and definition, the nylon fibers would not adhere to my lashes like they did in the store.</li>
            <li> and it was super tacky!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product and removes easily with a make-up remover cloth!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I bought this mascara, thinking it&#x27;d make my sparse but mid-length eyelashes look nice.  </li>
            <li> So I bought it here off amazon because the it was cheaper and had free shipping.</li>
            <li> even the packaging of that stuff looks cheap to me)</li>
            <li> I purchased at amazon, no tax, free shipping is pricy, but I use Lancôme, so it was comparable.</li>
            <li> Before putting fibers on you need to lightly wipe off any excess fibers on the edge of the tube.</li>
            <li> I even took a light nap in mine today and it did not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the time, money and effort to look sexy and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe worth trying with a better mascara or waterproof one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather buy the cheap stuff that washes off.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer with cheap drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> So easy to put on and washes off super easy.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried MANY different mascaras, and have never found a &#x27;builder&#x27; mascara as good as this one, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> have not had any of the issues I have read, but I was able to research the right way to do it before</li>
            <li> Love this product, you need to know how to use it right and your lashed will look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping</li>
            <li> I wear very good face creams products (due to allergies)</li>
            <li> I love it - it builds my lashes to a much more pronounced look with no clumping and at night it cleans off normally without a bunch of clumps and tubes.</li>
            <li> I found this in a local store and it is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of the ecstatic videos I&#x27;ve seen of it.  </li>
            <li> Too Faced original formula.</li>
            <li> Not only does it give AMAZING volume and length, but when it dries, it ABSOLUTELY does NOT flake or smudge and looks just as good at the end of my day as it did when i put it on.</li>
            <li> Worth trying!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always excited to tell them what I use.  </li>
            <li> I felt I had to adjust my original review.  </li>
            <li> It nice and make my lashes super nice ad long</li>
            <li> My tiny, sparse lashes were slightly clumpy but I was pretty impressed that they looked more noticeable than with my regular mascara (Dior, which is an awesome mascara for volume)</li>
            <li> You can use a clean finger to lift lashes up after you have applied the product and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this does lengthen your lashes and make them look awesome, I have a huge complaint as to the stickiness of this product.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to add that another reviewer may be right that this may only work for people that have great lashes to begin with.</li>
            <li> So here is what I think...if you want this mascara for like a special event or something..it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is very simple to use and makes my eyes look bright.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for this type of mascara, I would recommend buying good fibers and just use your regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on products, but I love this one so much I felt compelled.</li>
            <li> If you have very short lashes, this might be a good product for you.</li>
            <li> stuff really is cool.....</li>
            <li> I love it, it really does make your lashes look longer.</li>
            <li> Thing was, I couldn&#x27;t even keep the stuff on a full day without going nuts.  </li>
            <li> It really does lengthen lashes and I love the way my lashes look immediately after application.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to get off, also.</li>
            <li> To wash it off, I use a mild, tear-free baby wash, as I do with all eye make-up, and it came off with ease.</li>
            <li> So then I moved to Latisse, which wasn&#x27;t as bold as the extensions but still worked.</li>
            <li> but it actually is really easy and quit fast.</li>
            <li> This product is still the best product I&#x27;ve used to make short lashes long.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time to buy this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes so pretty and a lot of people noticed the length!</li>
            <li> more time and attention for application than my previous mascaras - this is already a three-step process according to its own directions.  </li>
            <li> Product is great, I was a little concerned however when it didn&#x27;t come in</li>
            <li> At first I read the reviews and they prevented me from buying this right away!</li>
            <li> Every time I have it on, several people comment about how amazing I look or that my eyes look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> The brush is not very defining, but it has good coverage and volume.</li>
            <li> When you look around, you can actually see the sides of your own nose, but your brain just ignores it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked, worth the price</li>
            <li> I rarely write product reviews, but am writing one for this stuff because I want to see it go mainstream.</li>
            <li> Instead, I look like I have great, thick, fantastic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> If you see any fibers kind of clumping your eyelash together, just use your finger to pull it off before you do the next step.</li>
            <li> I was Not crazy about the step #two product that looked and felt like lint feathers.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel is worth the money.</li>
            <li> the falsies volume express waterproof - then I would put the golden two face mascara</li>
            <li> what was in this golden bottle didn&#x27;t even know what nylon lash was written in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it made my lashes super long, but it is kinda clumpy and really sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other girls were able to give this mascara any more than 1 star.</li>
            <li> it shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> Use fast and if you want straight perfect eye lashes this is not for you.this mascara is to achieve thick full lashes.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> No one can see those gorgeous lashes if they are closed shut!</li>
            <li> if you do it right, you&#x27;re gonna be in love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use it right and follow the directions, then it works.</li>
            <li> It looks FABULOUS, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t dry out in the tube quickly, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> But realistically it was the golden bottle that really really made my eye lashes longer then ever before!</li>
            <li> So, to be fair, my lashes are already a decent length, but even after curling them and applying regular mascara, they would never hold the curl for more than the first ten minutes.</li>
            <li> and I felt that mascara worked fine for me, but I was willing to try something new.</li>
            <li> Just a super gentle wipe with your fingers.</li>
            <li> If you already have nice lashes but want crazy-long, thick spider lashes, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> was very fast.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this new mascara.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyelashes, and this works wonders!  </li>
            <li> I do like the fact that the fibers are white, so I&#x27;ve never been able to notice them on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the things that the negative reviews have stated.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product, due to using Better Than Sex mascara.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to pay the high price of falsh lashes this is the way to go!!  </li>
            <li> Plus I love that I don&#x27;t feel it and that I can wash it off at night and start all over the next day.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara in February for my birthday at Sephora and was kinda sceptical at first because I had never tried fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it when I want the extra length and fullness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bit tricky to put on at first.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, however I don&#x27;t like the WHITE fibers.</li>
            <li> I have short, stubby eyelashes, and this lengthens them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Finish doing your hair first</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to curl your lashes later.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that the nylon fiber tube doesn&#x27;t come with as many uses as the mascara itself.</li>
            <li> While it does lengthen your lashes it is VERY sticky!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product</li>
            <li> Basically unless you wash your mascara brush off after each use, the product does not stay consistent from use to use.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that the whole point of the mascara !</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, thank you!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different mascaras from the $5 -$30</li>
            <li> It can be tricky at first but</li>
            <li> My regular mascara works much much better</li>
            <li> I felt it worked pretty well and seemed to enhance the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> You put the mascara on first, then before it dries apply the nylon fibers.</li>
            <li> I love that the fibers were white so you can see what you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with a fiber mascara and after only one try with no research on how to apply, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> few good tips I have read....</li>
            <li> I have probably tried more than 50 different mascaras throughout my adult life, and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> The mascara wand bristles are too far apart and doesn&#x27;t apply the mascara evenly, smoothly or cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, and clean up is  no problem.</li>
            <li> I am just using the mascara, and not the whit flaky stuff that is supposed to be the Magic to give you long lashes.  </li>
            <li> First of all this is a real review.</li>
            <li> They were just long enough to look good but not fake.</li>
            <li> gives you a full, lush lash.</li>
            <li> think the trick to avoid the \\&quot;clumpiness\\&quot; that some people have experienced is to use a good magnifying mirror when applying it and to really comb the base coat through the lashes well before applying the nylon fibers, then let them dry a bit before combing on the top coat.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking pretty lashes!  </li>
            <li> I use my normal eye makeup remover and the product comes right off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, you have to make sure your eye lashes are dry.</li>
            <li> My lashes look longer using this product than when I use regular mascara, and it is easy to remove with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if you want you dont necessarily have to apply the little white fibers, the first mascara tube itself works great by its self too!</li>
            <li> The end result are little nylon extensions at the end of your own lashes creating a longer lash look.</li>
            <li> the cost is too much for the quality of the product</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to read three whole sentences to figure out how the product works, just look at the two tubes.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely made my lashes look longer and fuller than anything else</li>
            <li> &quot; much easier on my lashes.</li>
            <li> But it takes some time of gentle rubbing or washing.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This mascara work very well.</li>
            <li> It does make your lashes very spidery at the tips.</li>
            <li> Very Black]]&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> This has to be applied gently and with coats</li>
            <li> It really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great-it really thickens my lashes</li>
            <li> In my case, it didnt really work...</li>
            <li> Like it so much ...</li>
            <li> it so much ...</li>
            <li> When applying it you must be patient and can&#x27;t rush it to much or it will come out all clumpy.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> It really looks like you went to a salon.  </li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have lashes.</li>
            <li> Really goopy.</li>
            <li> They just really look and feel like feathers, not lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also was using Sephora&#x27;s disposable mascara wands to test which had much wider,</li>
            <li> Very sticky on your lashes.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very client look.</li>
            <li> Finally I gave in and bought the product, but I&#x27;m afraid it doesn&#x27;t work any better than many of the lush mascaras available at more reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li> This, however, didn&#x27;t work so well with my stubby, sparse, instantly-deflating lashes--but it did work beautifully on my sister (who has naturally long, fluffy lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont wear false lashes so this was the perfect alternative for me, and its not all clumpy and gross either</li>
            <li> : I definitely think this is over-hyped and over-priced, but it is a decent mascara--and a pretty unique one to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It applies easily, lasts all day, and makes my lashes look LONG.</li>
            <li> I have really short, thin, light lashes and this makes them look long and awesome.</li>
            <li> Finish with a DIFFERENT mascara than the original.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I love it</li>
            <li> It is better then what I expected!</li>
            <li> It comes off sooooo easy after a long day!</li>
            <li> Always clean any clumps off brush before starting.</li>
            <li> Well fast forward to present day and finding out that Latisse is not approved for pregnant women</li>
            <li> My L&#x27;oriel lasts all day and looks smooth with no flakes, but I can&#x27;t get as long a lash.</li>
            <li> You can use them more heavily if you like, but I try to use gently because using too much can feel weird.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> , thank you so much amazon for still selling the original formula as the new one is no good, thank you, I love it</li>
            <li> Use step 1 on the tips of your top lashes, about halfway down.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a ton on mascara and have a drawer full !</li>
            <li> So there you are, trying to look half-way decent, with your eyes watery and red while you attempt to get some of the stuff out of your eyes, which only makes the lashes clump together even more (since touching them makes them adhere to each other)!  </li>
            <li> It is like putting cotton candy fibers onto the lashes but it turned black with the top coat</li>
            <li> either the falsies agian or clump crusher by lash blast just to make it stick and look more black.</li>
            <li> Could use slight more volume enhancer</li>
            <li> it get&#x27;s too sticky and goopy to finish with the main mascara.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mainly the mascara itself</li>
            <li> I was eager to give this a try from the decent reviews I&#x27;ve seen/read</li>
            <li> Use one coat of your favorite regular mascara, then use your regular curler.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ready to Wear makes something similar that I&#x27;ll try too, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep a backup of this product:)</li>
            <li> I too am older and have thinning lashes.</li>
            <li> you could definitely combine the fibers with your favorite mascara for the ultimate</li>
            <li> Beautiful thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> highly recommendit</li>
            <li> lol, I then do 1 coat of the base mascara and then quickly apply the extensions applicator (this way it sticks right on)</li>
            <li> Plus, I was always conscious of feeling them attached to my real lashes.</li>
            <li> I used to have lash extensions for about a year and they were great but too expensive for the maintenance.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never been this long and full.</li>
            <li> I put it on just like I would normally do.</li>
            <li> Takes me maybe 1 minute longer than normal mascara.</li>
            <li> I have normal length lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara is the only kind that I wear that actually makes my Asian eyes stand out and make me look</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the actual mascara, at least give the fibers a try with your own!</li>
            <li> I can wear it everyday and add more plush for evening wear..</li>
            <li> So what I normally do regardless of the type of mascara...</li>
            <li> thinking it was normal mascara.</li>
            <li> the white nylon feathers making a full coat repeat the first Step of  black mascara quickly add another coat of nylon feathers this time only adding it to the tips repeat the first step</li>
            <li> More time consuming, couldn&#x27;t stand the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; that were dry and looked like fuzz that I had to put on after the actual mascara.</li>
            <li> There is an identical product from Younique that uses all natural BLACK fibers and is 100x Better.</li>
            <li> I have super long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> Use a blow dryer on cool to dry them when you are done.</li>
            <li> After that I seal it with some of my other cheap mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lashes ended up very pretty long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of two makeup products I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I have always used fiber mascaras to lengthen/thicken my lashes, and this one is my absolute least favorite.</li>
            <li> It really looks natural, you can evenly apply this product onto your natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately since buying the product I have not been able to achieve the same results remotely close to what I saw in the store.</li>
            <li> I like this product- the down side: runs out quickly!</li>
            <li> I have used this about five times now and have found that my lashes do not look the same as they did the first time around.</li>
            <li> The too faced better than false lashes extreme is much better.</li>
            <li> What a great problem to have!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that perhaps any negative reviewers didn&#x27;t follow directions: you have to use black as a primer</li>
            <li> My friend left me her brand new golden bottle when she left to go home from visiting</li>
            <li> I was almost tempted to return it after reading so many negative posts, but then decided since there was also several positive...</li>
            <li> Maybe the mascara is old.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t damage your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I did two applications just for poops and giggles, and my lashes nearly hit my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> The tube of fibers will outlast the mascara by far.</li>
            <li> it will cause your eyelashes to stick together and some of the eyelashes if you get hair stuck near them</li>
            <li> I also put hair spray in the formula and it solved the water proof and soft lash problem.</li>
            <li> This 2-step system has completely changed the look of my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t get completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> far apart bristles than the ones included with product.</li>
            <li> It took days for it to completely come off, and</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my lashes look so much longer, but the mascara is like glue...</li>
            <li> The product was either dryer up or more complicated than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Illegal Lengths by Maybelline is far superior, and has fibers in it.  </li>
            <li> While not the answer to my problem, it is better than plain mascara while my lashes (hopefully) grow back.</li>
            <li> Lightly apply one coat of mascara and then swift swipe of the fibers, wait about a minute to dry And repeat until your eyelashes are as long as you want them.</li>
            <li> Maybe even when I get to work, to let my lashes dry completely after washing my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you must curl them first.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more, wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> First step to using this mascara add the black first coat next you</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are what I would consider to be pretty average normally.</li>
            <li> I find that (like other users here) this mascara causes my eyelashes to clump fairly significantly so that I have to also come the lashes out after the third step.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend you chose a different fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> Also, the mascara provided in the kit is fine as the base, but I follow the fiber coating with another, more volume intense mascara.  </li>
            <li> A gentle hand goes a long way.</li>
            <li> High hopes but was really let down.</li>
            <li> I have extremely short and thin lashes and this product is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> I noticed slight clumpage, but an eyelash comb seemed to clean it up enough.</li>
            <li> , it is stickier than regular mascara, and dries more slowly.  </li>
            <li> Was kinda weird feeling the first couple of time, apply mascara than the white fuzzy, I wear contacts, I recommend putting in contacts after,,,,,,,,After experimenting, have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> After trying this for the first time I cannot use any other mascara.  </li>
            <li> Such a natural feel!</li>
            <li> False eyelashes will look MUCH fuller, but this is still a nice little way to give you some vavavoom without damaging your natural eyelashes with eye lash glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only gave this two stars Instead of just one because the mascara by itself is decent enough to use</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am still considering getting fake lashes as this wasn&#x27;t as amazing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I use my general mascara for my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> The pictures on TV of the ladies who&lt;br /&gt;got fabulous lashes have to be fake, because I did exactly what the instructions said and didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> In order to completely remove the product from my lashes, I have to coat my fingers with the coconut oil and massage the lashes between my thumb and middle finger.  </li>
            <li> And be careful not to glob too much on at once, it will get sticky.</li>
            <li> The mascara definitely has fibers and they definitely cling to your lashes, but they build up in a very unnatural looking way and ultimately flake off in bits and get in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the mascara was old and tacky when I sampled it or whether it was the different brush that I used...</li>
            <li> Takes too long and looks just like any normal mascara.</li>
            <li> I have thick, but average-length and rather light eyelashes.</li>
            <li> What is worse, every time I blink the top lashes stick to the bottom</li>
            <li> So I bought the too faced better than false lashes at costco and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false eyelashes since I was 16 (many years ago) and thought I&#x27;d give this pricey product a try.  </li>
            <li> This item is better than false lashes.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you will get a hot mess.</li>
            <li> When it is dry the bottom and top lashes would stick together when you blink creating a hard time to open and shut your eyes.</li>
            <li> Faced Better than False Lashes, despite the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought that it couldn&#x27;t possibly work, that the brush with the fibers would just get black and clumpy from being added over freshly mascaraed lashes, and that the whole thing would just be a big mess (</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I think it is worth the price though.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a separate top and base coat so that the final coat was a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I had fun playing with this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d choose it over lash tubes.</li>
            <li> The fibers provided with the mascara do not stick very well, so I used some previously purchased from QVC (which are wonderful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually happier with my regular $9 mascara (Bare Esensuals) - it makes my lashes look longer than this product did.</li>
            <li> They looked fantastic the first few days, but after showering a few times I noticed some lashes falling out a little at a time so that by the end of my trip I had some noticeable gaps.</li>
            <li> Not too short but not really long.</li>
            <li> I was applying makeup 10 minutes later when a gentle touch of my eyeliner pen caused all of my lashes to clump together and tangle up in a mess!</li>
            <li> This mascara is way too sticky with my eyelashes and very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I actually put on about 3 layers and every once in a while one eye naturally has thicker or longer lashes than the other</li>
            <li> Went back to my old mascara minus 35 dollars!</li>
            <li> Not a bad alternative, but definitely not the same as false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes were never full and long, but now that I&#x27;m getting older regular mascara wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> wet with eye makeup remover, which is apparently what I need to be doing daily in order to avoid product build-up.  </li>
            <li> It makes them look longer a tiny bit and somewhat fuller but clumpy and the ends wind up crooked and Strange looking</li>
            <li> , it did take a bit longer to dry than regular mascara, but it&#x27;s not regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> Cherry Blooms also contains all natural ingredients, HIGH-GRADE beeswax and BLACK fibres (NOT WHITE)!</li>
            <li> Make your bottom lashes as long as you want using your regular mascara....</li>
            <li> thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems to stay kinda damp throughout the day, and if the lashes are really long then it can sometime hit my upper eyelid and leave dots-</li>
            <li> I know that the white tube was a dry substance but not the mascara.</li>
            <li> I even tried keeping my eyes open for a while with out blinking to give them a chance to dry and still when I blinked my eyelashes close shut again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what the 5-star reviews say, it is not the same as regular mascara and is much harder to remove.</li>
            <li> I applied it like the directions state, but I did do a coat of my standard mascara to have a good base.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like having fresh false lashes that you can apply daily.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make my lashes quite as long s I expected, but definitely longer that with regular mascara!</li>
            <li> But as soon as I swept the mascara back over, making those white fibers black, my brain went back to ignoring them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for people with very little lashes like myself.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed due to the fact that it&#x27;s very clumpy and my top lashes stick to the bottom lashes...</li>
            <li> It really, really works, at least it did for</li>
            <li> Used it today and my eyes have been burning and sore all day long, even after I removed the mascara.</li>
            <li> Plus a couple of those things got in my eye and bugged me all day long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t make them too long, as I wear glasses.  </li>
            <li> Made my eyelashes stick together and they remained sticky all day long.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be careful of is to not touch it when it is drying, which i have found takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected a product to be different to what was already on the market 10yrs ago!</li>
            <li> While it does make them longer, I&#x27;ve gotten them just as long with a combo of drugstore mascaras.</li>
            <li> makes lashes sticky all day long.</li>
            <li> Too dry,look like already been long time in the stock.</li>
            <li> Can not make my eyelash long.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this product a 4 is because the shipping took longer than I expected to I ended up having to go to Sephora and to buy one.</li>
            <li> long lashes&lt;br /&gt;Decent</li>
            <li> The lashes stay long all day and all night</li>
            <li> I bought this at ulta because I have long lashes</li>
            <li> and/or as long lengthwise.  </li>
            <li> I already have long eye lashes</li>
            <li> This is a strange system.</li>
            <li> I spent the entire day wiping it from my lids and from under my eyes.</li>
            <li> but this product definelty gives you luscious long lashes.</li>
            <li> perhaps they got an old batch that had dried out?  </li>
            <li> The mascara is really an adhesive and is not meant to be thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married next month and was going to have to find someone to put false eyelashes on me the morning of my noon time wedding....</li>
            <li> Eyelashes can stick together and it takes too long to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have other mascaras that make my lashes look just as long and only require 1 step and aren&#x27;t sticky.  </li>
            <li> Takes way to long to dry, clumps together.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are now so long they are a little uncomfortable with my glasses, so I wear contacts more often.</li>
            <li> These other people obviously don&#x27;t know to use it.</li>
            <li> It is the last part of my makeup routine due to this.</li>
            <li> After trying several other makers, this one is tops.</li>
            <li> Like, tickle-your-brows long!</li>
            <li> Repeat the same with your other eye.</li>
            <li> When I received it the mascara was extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> It will take awhile to fully dry...</li>
            <li> The fiber wand is dry as a bone.  </li>
            <li> but it gets dry therefore making everything look clumpy</li>
            <li> It did not ever dry on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my lashes weren&#x27;t dry yet.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t dry for me, and if it does, it takes about 20 minutes with a hairdryer</li>
            <li> I found it way too much work to achieve the same effect I do from the inexpensive false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star rating except that the little fibers can (and did) get into my eyes if you are not extremely careful.</li>
            <li> I only just applied it, I&#x27;ve no clue if it will remove easily or not, so I may be altering my review later.  </li>
            <li> , then white, then black again.&lt;br /&gt;I balked at the price and, depending on how long this product lasts, may not use it forever.</li>
            <li> I have bought this 3 times and I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it!!</li>
            <li> If you can deal with the annoying side of it, it really does make your lashes look very long and full.</li>
            <li> 2 (white tube) contained small white fibers, not a liquid.</li>
            <li> The microfibres that adds volume to lashes are super uncomfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super itchy and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> This seemed very dry.</li>
            <li> Then the third time I went to use it, all the mascara had leaked out of it&#x27;s container and was a mess.  </li>
            <li> And it would make my lashes extremely long it would extend my eye lashes not like any other type of mascara.</li>
            <li> The first step adds volume, you have to add a few layers to make any difference, but this makes the lashes uneven and messy.</li>
            <li> After I use this they are definitely longer and a little thicker.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even know there was a little white bottle as showen in the photo.</li>
            <li> As long as you know how to use this, it will work well!!!</li>
            <li> mine have always been difficult to curl, short, sparse, and straight.nd straight.</li>
            <li> In fact I need to be careful</li>
            <li> Ive only had to do that a few times.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not straight.</li>
            <li> Really dumbfounded by some of the poor reviews.</li>
            <li> The base is made of some kind of stringy cotton.</li>
            <li> Although it was slightly clumpy at the time, I brushed it off as a side effect from the heavily used sample product that who knows how long has been out and used.</li>
            <li> I am not certain that this is</li>
            <li> Not certain</li>
            <li> Then I only put fibers on the tips of my eyelashes, and maybe about half way down.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before locally, there should have been a box it comes in... very odd</li>
            <li> However, after a long day at work, I always end up getting black smudges under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and its harder to remove than my other mascara.</li>
            <li> I have what I consider to be \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lashes-- not too short, not too long, not too thick, not too sparse.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I have to say that this is VERY very sticky.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I love it - on the days I use it well; but some days I hate it cause its clumpy or doesn&#x27;t dry well.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of other mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li> One says &amp;#34;steps 1 &amp; 3&amp;#34; and the other says &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a bit weird when you first apply the fibers.  </li>
            <li> feel the mascara itself was extremely damaging to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I think if they are experiencing the &amp;#34;split end&amp;#34; look that it must be due to an &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; application.  </li>
            <li> Apply mascara again and shoot some cool air on the eye for about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;*Comes off with cold</li>
            <li> I plan to do some experimenting and use the fibers with some other mascaras.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used the fibers with other mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not too thin but not thick.</li>
            <li> Repeat the steps with your other eye.  </li>
            <li> This was so sticky that my eyelashes closed shut!</li>
            <li> Expensive first off, I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m not very good at it...but not now, with this product I get the same results.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT stickier than regular mascara, it is NOT difficult to get off (i use pond&#x27;s cold cream and have for years don&#x27;t waste your money on eye makeup liquid remover), and it IS a breeze to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl</li>
            <li> Hard to deal with next day.</li>
            <li> The little white stuff in the small tube took some getting used to</li>
            <li> this product is so not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> the way I use it is: 1) apply regular mascara however thick</li>
            <li> I could never get anyone to put them on properly and with this product you can put it on as thick as you want</li>
            <li> Just buy the real thing, false eye lashes!</li>
            <li> It felt like I was brushing down feathers onto sticky</li>
            <li> Nylon does not break down if it gets stuck in your eye...which it did.  </li>
            <li> The Too Faced mascara isn&#x27;t quite as dramatic as false lashes, but the difference is still very noticeable on my short, stubby lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how this product is supposed to work, but the nylon particles were dry and got into my eyes.</li>
            <li> but, worth giving it a shot, in case I was wrong!).</li>
            <li> The downside is that it is very pricey and a little difficult to remove (you MUST use an eye makeup remover product).  </li>
            <li> (I had used Lancome Hypnose Star, previously.).</li>
            <li> After two uses, I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 (gold tube) contained black mascara with what I think of as an \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; brush.</li>
            <li> but why wouldn&#x27;t you use black??</li>
            <li> Especially if you don&#x27;t like to wear fake lashes on a daily.</li>
            <li> My lashes looked no different than when I used my regular, $8 mascara and, what is much worse, it is SO HARD to get this off your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re 12 with no makeup experience, you truly can&#x27;t mess this up.</li>
            <li> If you try and hurry, it will glob and make a mess around your eys.</li>
            <li> I had to comb the mess out</li>
            <li> Overall not a good product.</li>
            <li> , STICKY LASHES: this will NOT give you natural-looking lashes--but if long, clumpy, thick spider lashes are your thing (which my sister likes)</li>
            <li> Sort of disappointed by this product, very pricey when there are drug store brands that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> but this did very little for me, other than give me clumpy lashes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost!</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s never gotten this type of volume with any other mascara--and she usually applies like 5 coats..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little box?</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I&#x27;m 40-something and wear little to no makeup.)</li>
            <li> No better than any other mascara</li>
            <li> will say, I think the picture on the box is a little deceitful.</li>
            <li> The fibers look like cotton ball threads, very hard to apply properly.</li>
            <li> and it does lengthen but can get a little messy looking</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were not stiff, but maybe it was just a weird reaction.  </li>
            <li> Dont go crazy and put too much on.</li>
            <li> I have a few recommendations for you though, that I wish someone had shared with me.  </li>
            <li> It clumped my eyelashes together and dried out in a week.</li>
            <li> But the product I received was completely dried out and was unusable.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble with my mascara leaving smudges along my lower lash line and flaking during the day.</li>
            <li> you wash it off, the fibers will be a bit messy on your face.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin short lashes, not the product to use.</li>
            <li> However, the base and sealing mascara did not stay on very well and barely a few hours later it was running</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> You do have to try it a few times to get used to applying them</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that can simulate false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> time I went on vacation I decided to get semi-permanent false lashes at a local salon.</li>
            <li> Very black mascara makes lashes stand out</li>
            <li> It is very expensive, and very misleading.  </li>
            <li> To my horror, I found that what was left underneath was nothing but a few broken off, sparse nubs!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product at the naval base in San Diego and love it, for someone who USED to wear false lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> When I put the fibers on, it looked like I had just been out in the snow, with small flakes covering my lashes, so it felt a bit odd, and my brain was having a hard time seeing past them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> This one is a massive fail for me.</li>
            <li> Not better than usual mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant to deviate from my usual mascara brand.  </li>
            <li> and I am lazy.</li>
            <li> i usually buy the L&#x27;oriel version instead.  </li>
            <li> Only fault I have with it is the price....very expensive.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Just swiped my face cleansing wipe as usual and everything came</li>
            <li> What did adhere to lashes ended up looking strange like barbed wire on the tips of lashes sort of like a weird split end.</li>
            <li> not sure why some of the negative reviews ended up with clumps</li>
            <li> The mascara and fibers made my lashes very stiff and this stuff is a nightmare to remove.</li>
            <li> softer lashes (I hate when lashes get REALLY hard from a lot of mascara, but this one was too soft... if you bumped you lashes or laid down you lashes will be moved around)&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to get out ..</li>
            <li> (I learned the hard way one day when I was driving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have hardly any lashes</li>
            <li> and it is hard to take off ?</li>
            <li> This product was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know where the negative remarks come from.  </li>
            <li> Not a nice end result.</li>
            <li> I have have read negative reviews about this mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick, gooey consistency, and dries like a capsule around your lash.</li>
            <li> Thick, spidery lashes&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It looks sloppy, not smooth and neat.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $30!!</li>
            <li> also agree with other reviews, in that it can be difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t manage false lashes anytime much less in the morning before work, so I&#x27;ve tried a bzillion mascaras that claim the \\&quot;False Lash Look!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, not worth it.</li>
            <li> From reading the bad reviews, I have a guess that some people are not actually following the instructions, and they&#x27;re not that hard to follow.</li>
            <li> ridiculous)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I bought this the day before the wedding and it left me scrambling to find something else without actually using false lashes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that Too Faced made this mascara, because I have NEVER had such a bad experience with one of their products.</li>
            <li> I also am confused by the negative comments.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good product all.  </li>
            <li> When I first began using this product, the fibers were terrible.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and have only been disappointed to varying degrees.  </li>
            <li> I have small eyelashes and people ask if I am wearing fake eyelashes plus no flaking.</li>
            <li> I don´t like it because the results were no better from any good/less expensive mascara.</li>
            <li> even if I don&#x27;t apply it to the bottom...and it flakes on skin and is very hard to remove without some type of cream or make-up</li>
            <li> It is very hard to remove, so I would have to rub with makeup remover very hard to get it all, and in the process my lashes would fall out.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get off, also.</li>
            <li> False eyelashes are hard on my eyes and this product is perfect...can&#x27;t even feel them, but you can see them!</li>
            <li> This product was a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> thought it was the white base that was causing it,</li>
            <li> alas, if you have hard-to-curl stubby, sparse lashes, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;-UNNATURAL</li>
            <li> Hahah I was gonna google about it and find another bottle when I ran out but who knew that it actually came with the base coat and end coat</li>
            <li> So that is why I am not happy.</li>
            <li> , lastly I apply the base coat again as it is used as a finisher as well</li>
            <li> To make things worse...</li>
            <li> The fibres get into my eyes and makes the whole thing terrible</li>
            <li> thought that I was still wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> While it may not give you the false lash look, but it does make your eyelashes noticeably longer.</li>
            <li> Than False Lashes received by Too Faced.</li>
            <li> I am no longer going to torture myself with false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> which is the minimum needed to apply false eyelashes).  </li>
            <li> Than False Lashes Mascara again.</li>
            <li> This product DOES lengthen my lashes, so I can&#x27;t claim false advertising -- but it is so sticky that lashes stick together, making them look spiky.  </li>
            <li> (Semi-permanent false lashes were a NIGHTMARE to</li>
            <li> I almost look like il have false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheaper and easier than applying false lashes.</li>
            <li> The product does work and gives close to the look of false lashes.</li>
            <li> , at least I thought it would be the same product, off of Amazon, but am very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because the theory behind this mascara seems to make sense.</li>
            <li> Unable to master false lashes, I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the bad reviewers are talking about?</li>
            <li> I use cleansing wipes, it can b e difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> Everyone thought I had fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> People think I have on fake lashes when I use this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Faster than applying fake lashes</li>
            <li> I could not fully remove this mascara with the coconut oil without rubbing so vigorously that I was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I do have some expensive sunglasses and wore them one day when I was wearing this product.....</li>
            <li> this mascara is extremely difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> It was also difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I tried it several times according to the directions with awful results.  </li>
            <li> I can never get fake eyelashes to work.  </li>
            <li> The product stuck to my lashes for days, and I would have rather just pulled a strip of false lashes off!</li>
            <li> I was so sick and tired of people trying to sell me on younique products (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get some black specs on me but not like stupid crazy amounts when I&#x27;d bug or hate the product.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the fibers would fall into my eyes and irritate my contacts, but not an issue at all.  </li>
            <li> no kidding, you can can repeatedly apply the duo to build your lashes up like crazy.</li>
            <li> if wearing expensive sunglasses, I guess!  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to use....</li>
            <li> /&gt;very, very difficult to remove -</li>
            <li> It is also very difficult to remove even with cotton pads and eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> but I received a bad tube.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (I prefer the newer plastic brushes like these ones: [[ASIN:B0039UTO5A</li>
            <li> I did have my hopes up but was&lt;br /&gt;sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the mascara, then the fibers before the base dries.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s annoying to constat;y apply and it irrtates your eyes,</li>
            <li> So I may try the base with another mascara -- but I am pitching the mascara.  </li>
            <li> And I may pitch the base too.  </li>
            <li> Then I use the base mascara (gold tube).</li>
            <li> I  was putting on a base mascara- maybellne</li>
            <li> Then I would put an end base -</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all these bad reviews!</li>
            <li> It is awful!</li>
            <li> so I thought this mascara would make my lashes insane!</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
            <li> The primer is awful!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Horrible .</li>
            <li> This mascara is terrible!</li>
            <li> The worst mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but this really awful product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However..if you want to use it daily..its terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loved this product it made my lashes super long, but it is kinda clumpy and really sticky. But other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed due to the fact that it&#x27;s very clumpy and my top lashes stick to the bottom lashes...even if I don&#x27;t apply it to the bottom...and it flakes on skin and is very hard to remove without some type of cream or make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;And the cost is too much for the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the naval base in San Diego and love it, for someone who USED to wear false lashes all the time. These other people obviously don&#x27;t know to use it. Here are some hints ladies....the way I use it is: 1) apply regular mascara however thick you want I do 2. 2) apply the too faced mascara until you can actually run the comb through your lash, then apply the fibers and use the mascara again. Do this 2 times. I work on camp Pendleton and my coworkers thought that I was still wearing false lashes. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Bestest Mascara out There! Gonna add pics!</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product? It comes off sooooo easy after a long day! I love that! The brush is not very defining, but it has good coverage and volume. I don&#x27;t often use the white extentions, but when I do they work! Mind you, I have naturally full lashes, I just like a glamorous touch here and there! :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of the ecstatic videos I&#x27;ve seen of it.  The microfibres that adds volume to lashes are super uncomfortable to wear.  It kinda feels like something is stuck in my eyes that&#x27;s hard to get out .. all the time.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this from Sephora and I tried it one day. WOW!!! My eye lashes looked like they grew. They were just long enough to look good but not fake. So easy to put on and washes off super easy. So I bought it here off amazon because the it was cheaper and had free shipping. Got it next day! I have been loving it ever since.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara at Costco yesterday, since it was only $14.99. Used it today and my eyes have been burning and sore all day long, even after I removed the mascara. It is awful! Going back to using Benefit They&#x27;re Real! as it works a million times better. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Nothing about it worked for me. More time consuming, couldn&#x27;t stand the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; that were dry and looked like fuzz that I had to put on after the actual mascara. Plus a couple of those things got in my eye and bugged me all day long.  Lot&#x27;s of other mascara&#x27;s do a much better job without the addit. hassle.</li>
            <li> My lashes were never full and long, but now that I&#x27;m getting older regular mascara wasn&#x27;t working. And I can&#x27;t manage false lashes anytime much less in the morning before work, so I&#x27;ve tried a bzillion mascaras that claim the \\&quot;False Lash Look!\\&quot; The L&#x27;Oreal tubes one had been my fav, but when they come off from cleaning or just from time, they literally are \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; that come off your lashes and can get clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this Too Faced product reluctantly because of the price, but it was cheaper than Latisse. I love it - it builds my lashes to a much more pronounced look with no clumping and at night it cleans off normally without a bunch of clumps and tubes.</li>
            <li> Tried it, and love it!  From reading the bad reviews, I have a guess that some people are not actually following the instructions, and they&#x27;re not that hard to follow. If you don&#x27;t want to read three whole sentences to figure out how the product works, just look at the two tubes.  One says &amp;#34;steps 1 &amp; 3&amp;#34; and the other says &amp;#34;step 2&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviews I read here says that it comes with a &amp;#34;primer of flaky white stuff&amp;#34; and a tube of mascara.  That&#x27;s not quite correct.  There&#x27;s one tube which is both a primer AND mascara (that&#x27;s why it says &amp;#34;steps 1 &amp; 3&amp;#34; on the tube). The second tube is step 2, in between coats of mascara, you add tiny white fibers to your lashes.  I thought that it couldn&#x27;t possibly work, that the brush with the fibers would just get black and clumpy from being added over freshly mascaraed lashes, and that the whole thing would just be a big mess (but, worth giving it a shot, in case I was wrong!). Boy, am I glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it did take a bit longer to dry than regular mascara, but it&#x27;s not regular mascara.  It absolutely made my lashes look longer and fuller than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a bit weird when you first apply the fibers.  When you look around, you can actually see the sides of your own nose, but your brain just ignores it.  Works the same with your lashes. When I put the fibers on, it looked like I had just been out in the snow, with small flakes covering my lashes, so it felt a bit odd, and my brain was having a hard time seeing past them.  But as soon as I swept the mascara back over, making those white fibers black, my brain went back to ignoring them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara.  (I had used Lancome Hypnose Star, previously.). Give it a try - but be patient, and READ the instructions. (Or, go to YouTube and watch a video!)</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use....</li>
            <li> Sort of disappointed by this product, very pricey when there are drug store brands that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I really liked this the first couple of times I used it.  Then the third time I went to use it, all the mascara had leaked out of it&#x27;s container and was a mess.  I hadn&#x27;t travelled nor had it experienced any temperature changes.  What a waste of $30!!</li>
            <li> This product was a little disappointing.  I&#x27;d been wanting and wanting to try it, but hesitated because of the price.  Finally I gave in and bought the product, but I&#x27;m afraid it doesn&#x27;t work any better than many of the lush mascaras available at more reasonable prices.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have always used fiber mascaras to lengthen/thicken my lashes, and this one is my absolute least favorite. When I first began using this product, the fibers were terrible. The fibers provided with the mascara do not stick very well, so I used some previously purchased from QVC (which are wonderful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the mascara itself was extremely damaging to my lashes. It&#x27;s a thick, gooey consistency, and dries like a capsule around your lash. It is very hard to remove, so I would have to rub with makeup remover very hard to get it all, and in the process my lashes would fall out. I don&#x27;t care what the 5-star reviews say, it is not the same as regular mascara and is much harder to remove. I stopped using this product after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for this type of mascara, I would recommend buying good fibers and just use your regular mascara. It&#x27;s what I do and it works beautifully if you use good products. I think it&#x27;s really more about how good the fibers are than anything. The mascara I use is called \\&quot;They&#x27;re Real,\\&quot; much easier on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyelashes, and this works wonders!  I have a few recommendations for you though, that I wish someone had shared with me.  Start with their mascara and then add the fiber mascara.  Finish with a DIFFERENT mascara than the original.  I say this for two reasons.  1.  it get&#x27;s too sticky and goopy to finish with the main mascara.  Eyelashes can stick together and it takes too long to dry.  2.  It will last longer!&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with other reviews, in that it can be difficult to remove.  The best way to remove it is in the shower and using warm water over your eyes - it will soften up and wash away.  But it takes some time of gentle rubbing or washing.  Well worth it.  The fibers on the eyelash is a wonderful concept and I have very sensitive eyes and for getting stuff in them. I have had NO problem.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The fibers look like cotton ball threads, very hard to apply properly.</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This mascara work very well. While it may not give you the false lash look, but it does make your eyelashes noticeably longer. I used it as instructed and had no problems at all. To wash it off, I use a mild, tear-free baby wash, as I do with all eye make-up, and it came off with ease. And if you apply mascara to upper and lower lashes, I suggest using a different brand of mascara on the lower lash, I did this and had no problem with my eyelashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> I am not certain that this is Too Faced original formula. I still have the duo of Better Than False Lashes received by Too Faced. This one I ordered from Amazon does not perform the same as the one I received from Too Faced. Maybe the mascara is old. Not certain but there is a difference in performance.</li>
            <li> I also am confused by the negative comments.  I am no longer going to torture myself with false eyelashes.  This is the only mascara that can simulate false eyelashes.  It is pricey, but so are eyelashes, glue and mascara (which is the minimum needed to apply false eyelashes).  Bonus - it doesn&#x27;t damage your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product was a big disappointment.  My daughter recommended it to me. When I received it the mascara was extremely dry.  I know the product just came out but I must have received a dud.  I know that the white tube was a dry substance but not the mascara.</li>
            <li> When I order this product I was expecting it to be amazing and trust me, I was not disappointed at all! I love how my eyelashes look when I have this mascara on, I definetly will be ordering Too Faced - Better Than False Lashes Mascara again.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite for going out.  She pointed out to me how they make her lashes longer, and I noticed that she was out.  After receiving her replacement, she showed me her lashes.  They look longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She showed me the different parts of the product.  The nylon fibers.  Very interesting.....</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product. I found it to be chunky and goody on my eyes. It clumped my eyelashes together and dried out in a week. Not worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Definite difference in the thickness of my lashes once applied. You have to take your time to remove it though. Waterproof make up remover is a must</li>
            <li> Love it,, please let me know if you will be carring this FRIM now on</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all these bad reviews! when I started using this mascara, all my female friends started asking me what I have done to my eyelashes. They thought I used Latisse or had extension done to my lashes. I have probably tried more than 50 different mascaras throughout my adult life, and this one is my favorite so far. It&#x27;s $35 at Sephora, so I will buy from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> After having lash extensions for awhile, I had a SEVERE reaction to my last fill, and had to have them removed.  To my horror, I found that what was left underneath was nothing but a few broken off, sparse nubs!  Unable to master false lashes, I tried this product.  I have found that if you do one eye at a time, it works best.  Also, the mascara provided in the kit is fine as the base, but I follow the fiber coating with another, more volume intense mascara.  That seems to work better for me.  While not the answer to my problem, it is better than plain mascara while my lashes (hopefully) grow back.</li>
            <li> The best fibre lash extensions mascara is by Cherry Blooms. I&#x27;ve tried and tested most of them already. Cherry Blooms also contains all natural ingredients, HIGH-GRADE beeswax and BLACK fibres (NOT WHITE)! Definitely recommend it! It was featured in the Oscars gift bags too! So you know it works!</li>
            <li> I was so sick and tired of people trying to sell me on younique products (even the packaging of that stuff looks cheap to me) so I researched online to find this. I applied it like the directions state, but I did do a coat of my standard mascara to have a good base. I do like the fact that the fibers are white, so I&#x27;ve never been able to notice them on my face. My husband even noticed the lashes for date night!</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried MANY different mascaras, and have never found a &#x27;builder&#x27; mascara as good as this one, for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The lengthening and building up of my own lashes is immediate and very evident.  In fact I need to be careful I don&#x27;t make them too long, as I wear glasses.  But I am very happy with the way this product works, and that I don&#x27;t need to pay $60 for the effect (as opposed to the Cherry Bloom mascara).&lt;br /&gt;Since I only just applied it, I&#x27;ve no clue if it will remove easily or not, so I may be altering my review later.  But until then sign me &#x27;Happy&#x27;!</li>
            <li> worked with a girl who had amazing lashes, she told me about too faced, I purchased at amazon, no tax, free shipping is pricy, but I use Lancôme, so it was comparable. Was kinda weird feeling the first couple of time, apply mascara than the white fuzzy, I wear contacts, I recommend putting in contacts after,,,,,,,,After experimenting, have to say I love it. My lashes were hitting my eyebrows, it may get clumpy at times, I just use my twizzers and separate. I would advise cleaning them off nightly, one night I didn&#x27;t and woke up to pieces all over my face. I use cleansing wipes, it can b e difficult to get off. My lashes have never been this long and full. I&#x27;m hooked, worth the price</li>
            <li> love love love it, thank you so much amazon for still selling the original formula as the new one is no good, thank you, I love it and I love amazon</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews before purchasing this product and I&#x27;m glad I did; more so glad I purchased it.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the things that the negative reviews have stated.  I think if they are experiencing the &amp;#34;split end&amp;#34; look that it must be due to an &amp;#34;over&amp;#34; application.  I think this product is ingenious!  I can&#x27;t believe someone hasn&#x27;t come up with the idea before now.  I&#x27;m getting married next month and was going to have to find someone to put false eyelashes on me the morning of my noon time wedding....because I&#x27;m not very good at it...but not now, with this product I get the same results.  The product comes off quite easily too so I don&#x27;t know where the negative remarks come from.  I use my normal eye makeup remover and the product comes right off.  I will definitely buy more, wish it was a little cheaper!</li>
            <li> I splurged and bought this mascara hoping it would do what it claimed to do and make my somewhat short lashes appear longer and thicker. I&#x27;m actually happier with my regular $9 mascara (Bare Esensuals) - it makes my lashes look longer than this product did. It&#x27;s unfortunate because the theory behind this mascara seems to make sense. The fibers that you apply to your lashes can easily get in your eyes and irritate and they didn&#x27;t make my lashes look any longer at all! I wish I would have kept my $35 to spend on the eyelash enhancers that I just bought. Save your money, get another mascara and try an eyelash enhancement product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product, due to using Better Than Sex mascara. But the product I received was completely dried out and was unusable. Returned it. I don&#x27;t doubt the product would work but I received a bad tube.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mascara at all. Made my eyelashes stick together and they remained sticky all day long. Never tried. The too faced better than false lashes extreme is much better.</li>
            <li> This seemed very dry.</li>
            <li> I rarely write product reviews, but am writing one for this stuff because I want to see it go mainstream. I have thick, but average-length and rather light eyelashes. I found this at Costco (and will be buying more before everyone in town discovers it). It applies easily, lasts all day, and makes my lashes look LONG. I did two applications just for poops and giggles, and my lashes nearly hit my eyebrow. No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;*Do one eye at a time.&lt;br /&gt;*Apply the mascara, then the fibers before the base dries. Apply mascara again and shoot some cool air on the eye for about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;*Comes off with cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever invented this product is brilliant. It really is very simple to use and makes my eyes look bright. I will hoard--sorry, purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara out!  After trying this for the first time I cannot use any other mascara.  If you don&#x27;t want to pay the high price of falsh lashes this is the way to go!!  Everyone thought I had fake lashes.  This such is incredible</li>
            <li> i love this product!! it shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap on amazon, it&#x27;s a good product. But it&#x27;s annoying to constat;y apply and it irrtates your eyes,</li>
            <li> This product DOES lengthen my lashes, so I can&#x27;t claim false advertising -- but it is so sticky that lashes stick together, making them look spiky.  What is worse, every time I blink the top lashes stick to the bottom ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was the white base that was causing it, so I tried using just the mascara and found that IT is sticky.  So I may try the base with another mascara -- but I am pitching the mascara.  And I may pitch the base too.  I have other mascaras that make my lashes look just as long and only require 1 step and aren&#x27;t sticky.  This one is a massive fail for me.</li>
            <li> This mascara is simply amazing. I always had trouble with my mascara leaving smudges along my lower lash line and flaking during the day. I tried the younique brand as well as a cheaper alternative and was happy, but the fibers still fell off. I work 14 hour shifts and this was just not acceptable. So I bought the too faced better than false lashes at costco and decided to give it a try. I will never go back to anything else. Not only does it give AMAZING volume and length, but when it dries, it ABSOLUTELY does NOT flake or smudge and looks just as good at the end of my day as it did when i put it on. The only thing to be careful of is to not touch it when it is drying, which i have found takes about 15 minutes. It is the last part of my makeup routine due to this. I never write reviews on products, but I love this one so much I felt compelled. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> im loving my longer lashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some lukewarm reviews about this mascara, but decided I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It really, really works, at least it did for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I went on vacation I decided to get semi-permanent false lashes at a local salon. They looked fantastic the first few days, but after showering a few times I noticed some lashes falling out a little at a time so that by the end of my trip I had some noticeable gaps. Plus, I was always conscious of feeling them attached to my real lashes. The Too Faced mascara isn&#x27;t quite as dramatic as false lashes, but the difference is still very noticeable on my short, stubby lashes. Better than any \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mascara that I&#x27;ve ever tried. Plus I love that I don&#x27;t feel it and that I can wash it off at night and start all over the next day. (Semi-permanent false lashes were a NIGHTMARE to remove.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the trick to avoid the \\&quot;clumpiness\\&quot; that some people have experienced is to use a good magnifying mirror when applying it and to really comb the base coat through the lashes well before applying the nylon fibers, then let them dry a bit before combing on the top coat.</li>
            <li> I like this product- the down side: runs out quickly! and its harder to remove than my other mascara. Up side: does make your lashes fuller and somewhat longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still considering getting fake lashes as this wasn&#x27;t as amazing as I had hoped. I think its a good product though- spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it like this: too faced mascara, nylon things, MY mascara.</li>
            <li> People think I have on fake lashes when I use this mascara.  Love it!</li>
            <li> hoping to be allowed to only order the white tube so i can use my own mascara -- but i LOVE the effect!!!!</li>
            <li> Not better than usual mascara. For the price I expected a product to be different to what was already on the market 10yrs ago! I had a similar version to this product by boujoir in 2005 (9.99). The results were basically the same. The first step adds volume, you have to add a few layers to make any difference, but this makes the lashes uneven and messy. Not a nice end result. Save your money and buy a cheaper alternative or stick to regular mascara.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t AS mind blowing as I thought it would be but is still a great mascara! I have super long lashes to begin with so I thought this mascara would make my lashes insane! While it does make them longer, I&#x27;ve gotten them just as long with a combo of drugstore mascaras. It does make your lashes very spidery at the tips. It tends to clump together a bit. The fibers are AWESOME!! They are coolest things ever to me. It&#x27;s mainly the mascara itself that&#x27;s a bit of a letdown. I&#x27;ve used this mascara maybe 4 times or so and I feel like it&#x27;s already drying up. The tube of fibers will outlast the mascara by far. I plan to do some experimenting and use the fibers with some other mascaras. I wish Too Faced would sell these individually. I will probably buy this product again but for me it isn&#x27;t a MUST HAVE in my makeup collection. All in all I recommend trying this product out for yourself!</li>
            <li> I liked the fibers but not the mascara. So I&#x27;ve used the fibers with other mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they sold the fibers on their own. Mascara is too sticky.</li>
            <li> I almost look like il have false eyelashes. Instead, I look like I have great, thick, fantastic eyelashes.  Easy to use.  Easy to remove, too. Love it</li>
            <li> Impressive.  It made my lashes a good bit longer,  it didn&#x27;t give as much volume as I thought it might. I am so happy with this mascara though. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!</li>
            <li> This is just like regular mascara!  Don&#x27;t waste your money! Knew it was too good to be true!  Just buy the real thing, false eye lashes!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I put my Merle Norman mascara over it and it comes out beautifully!! I have bought this 3 times and I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it!! I highly recommend this for people with very little lashes like myself.</li>
            <li> I was eager to give this a try from the decent reviews I&#x27;ve seen/read but this did very little for me, other than give me clumpy lashes. I gave it a shot for two weeks and didn&#x27;t get any different result. I&#x27;m bummed as I thought this would give me lengthier lashes but *sigh*, it did not.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to regular mascara again. I have have read negative reviews about this mascara and I would like to say that if done properly this mascara Will look beautiful. First step to using this mascara add the black first coat next you the white nylon feathers making a full coat repeat the first Step of  black mascara quickly add another coat of nylon feathers this time only adding it to the tips repeat the first step next step keep adding nylon feathers only to the tips. Use as many coats as desired. Use fast and if you want straight perfect eye lashes this is not for you.this mascara is to achieve thick full lashes. Practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all my friends and would definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara last me about 4 months. Its great.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this mascara before reading all the reviews.  I was almost tempted to return it after reading so many negative posts, but then decided since there was also several positive...I will keep it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any of the issues I have read, but I was able to research the right way to do it before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do..&lt;br /&gt;First I curl my eyelashes. Then I use the base mascara (gold tube). I put it on just like I would normally do. Then I use the fibers (white tube). Before putting fibers on you need to lightly wipe off any excess fibers on the edge of the tube. Then I only put fibers on the tips of my eyelashes, and maybe about half way down. This keeps them from getting in your eyes if you dont go all the way to the root of lashes. Dont go crazy and put too much on. If you see any fibers kind of clumping your eyelash together, just use your finger to pull it off before you do the next step. That will keep you from getting the clumping some have talked about. Ive only had to do that a few times. Next,  go back to the mascara in the gold tube and start putting that over the fibers. I like to kind of wiggle the brush as I do it. I do two coats. After that I seal it with some of my other cheap mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few good tips I have read....&lt;br /&gt;1. Use a blow dryer on cool to dry them when you are done. This is something I have always done anyway because it keeps them from making marks under eyes or eyelids while drying.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dont do on bottom lashes. Keeps them from sticking.&lt;br /&gt;3. Always clean any clumps off brush before starting. I think this is where people have been having a problem.&lt;br /&gt;4. Only do one eye at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a lot of steps and would be time consuming but it actually is really easy and quit fast. Takes me maybe 1 minute longer than normal mascara. I love it! So glad I decided to give it a try. My eyelashes are what I would consider to be pretty average normally. Not too short but not really long. Not too thin but not thick. After I use this they are definitely longer and a little thicker. Very natural looking pretty lashes!  Love!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Ulta after seeing it on Amazon. If you have very short lashes, this might be a good product for you. I have normal length lashes and I felt that mascara worked fine for me, but I was willing to try something new. After two uses, I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 (gold tube) contained black mascara with what I think of as an \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; brush. (I prefer the newer plastic brushes like these ones: [[ASIN:B0039UTO5A CoverGirl LashBlastFusion Mascara Very Black]]&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 (white tube) contained small white fibers, not a liquid. It felt like I was brushing down feathers onto sticky lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Makes lashes longer&lt;br /&gt;- Very black mascara makes lashes stand out&lt;br /&gt;- Faster than applying fake lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to wash off in the shower with some rubbing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Sticky lashes. I could comb them, but it was just one more step in the process.&lt;br /&gt;- Thick, spidery lashes&lt;br /&gt;- Flaking&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to deal with next day. I was able to comb and re-apply, but they didn&#x27;t look as good.&lt;br /&gt;- Takes 3x longer to apply than just mascara</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local Ulta store for $35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;good color&lt;br /&gt;lengthens lashes dramatically - I received more than one comment/compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;expensive&lt;br /&gt;very, very difficult to remove - I regularly use organic coconut oil to remove all my makeup.  I could not fully remove this mascara with the coconut oil without rubbing so vigorously that I was uncomfortable.  In order to completely remove the product from my lashes, I have to coat my fingers with the coconut oil and massage the lashes between my thumb and middle finger.  And, yes, I used regular store-bought makeup remover and got the same results.&lt;br /&gt;requires more time and attention for application than my previous mascaras - this is already a three-step process according to its own directions.  I find that (like other users here) this mascara causes my eyelashes to clump fairly significantly so that I have to also come the lashes out after the third step.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara in February for my birthday at Sephora and was kinda sceptical at first because I had never tried fiber lash mascara. The little white stuff in the small tube took some getting used to but once you actually take your time and learn how to apply it, its actually a breeze. Ive never had issues with clumping or flakes or anything like that. I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont recommend applying on your lower lashes because they will stick together when you blink! (I learned the hard way one day when I was driving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s much more affordable here on Amazon and becomes incredibly easy when you get used to it! Sometimes if you want you dont necessarily have to apply the little white fibers, the first mascara tube itself works great by its self too!</li>
            <li> makes lashes sticky all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use it when I want the extra length and fullness. It&#x27;s bit tricky to put on at first. This has to be applied gently and with coats otherwise you will get a hot mess. Lightly apply one coat of mascara and then swift swipe of the fibers, wait about a minute to dry And repeat until your eyelashes are as long as you want them. I recommend using your favorite mascara as the top coat to keep eyelashes from sticking together</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, however I don&#x27;t like the WHITE fibers. There is an identical product from Younique that uses all natural BLACK fibers and is 100x Better. Great product, but why wouldn&#x27;t you use black?? [...]</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this new mascara. Sadly, I have to say that this is VERY very sticky. Clumpd all my lashes together and the fibers got into my eye and ino my contacts. Very hard to get off, also. I would not recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. Sometimes I love it - on the days I use it well; but some days I hate it cause its clumpy or doesn&#x27;t dry well. But all in all it&#x27;s a great product on most days. Especially if you don&#x27;t like to wear fake lashes on a daily. This mascara is the only kind that I wear that actually makes my Asian eyes stand out and make me look awake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to make sure your eye lashes are dry. I like to put mascara on last after all my make up is done. Maybe even when I get to work, to let my lashes dry completely after washing my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, you must curl them first. NOT AFTER! You will ruin your lashes if you attempt to curl them after. You can use a clean finger to lift lashes up after you have applied the product and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, use the fibers only at the end of your lashes so as to not sting your eyes!</li>
            <li> I found this in a local store and it is amazing!  It really works as advertised.  I have short, stubby eyelashes, and this lengthens them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  You do have to use it properly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is stickier than regular mascara, and dries more slowly.  Here are my tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Finish doing your hair first so it&#x27;s not in your way when you do your mascara.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use one coat of your favorite regular mascara, then use your regular curler.  You won&#x27;t be able to curl your lashes later.  Make your bottom lashes as long as you want using your regular mascara....you won&#x27;t use this product on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use step 1 on the tips of your top lashes, about halfway down.  No need to coat your entire lash.  Do only one eye first.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Immediately follow by using the step 2 fibers only on the tips.  You can use them more heavily if you like, but I try to use gently because using too much can feel weird.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Immediately coat generously with step 1, trying to seperate your lashes as much as possible while doing so.  Now..... Do not comb....do not curl....leave it alone now.  Repeat the steps with your other eye.  It will take awhile to fully dry...that&#x27;s okay....it won&#x27;t get all over your face though unless you gave excess skin that hoods your eyes.  But if you do not coat your entire lash with extender, you can avoid that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product will last all day.  I even took a light nap in mine today and it did not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you wash it off, the fibers will be a bit messy on your face.  It is the price of beauty.  LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really is cool.....if you do it right, you&#x27;re gonna be in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note....I do have some expensive sunglasses and wore them one day when I was wearing this product.....I noticed later that a bit of finish seemed scratched off on the inside where my lashes touched the glass.  My eyelashes were not stiff, but maybe it was just a weird reaction.  I dunno,  Use with caution if wearing expensive sunglasses, I guess!  Removing stars for that reason.moving stars for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, mascara and fiber makes my eyes look huge without the glue and trying to make it fit on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I never would have known about this product if Michelle Phan hadn&#x27;t used it on one of her utube demonstrations!!</li>
            <li> I WAS LOOKING SO FORWARD TO RECEIVING THIS  AFTER RECEIVING IT I USED IT  AWFUL! IT CLUMPED  DID NOT DO AS ADVERTISED  I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE MY MONEY RETURNED!!!!!! NEVER BEFORE HAVE I ORDERED ANYTHING FROM AMAZON THAT I DID NOT LIKE</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an incredible difference shown when using this product. It looks FABULOUS, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t dry out in the tube quickly, and is really easy to use. My favorite part is probably the take-off of the mascara. It is SO easy to take off, I don&#x27;t even need makeup remover. Whenever I wash my face at night I simply run my fingers along my lashes and the mascara comes off with ease. You don&#x27;t need to PULL your lashes!!! That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying. Just a super gentle wipe with your fingers. The mascara doesn&#x27;t come off if it comes into contact with water unless - which I absolutely LOVE. It&#x27;s like a water-proof mascara... but easy to take off. GREAT product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the nylon fiber tube doesn&#x27;t come with as many uses as the mascara itself.</li>
            <li> Works great! Read the instructions though, theres 3 steps, not 2. Also, don&#x27;t put any on your bottom lashes (you shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway). My lashes look longer using this product than when I use regular mascara, and it is easy to remove with makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I have really short, thin, light lashes and this makes them look long and awesome. Doesn&#x27;t thicken them at all, but I am very pleased...I was afraid the fibers would fall into my eyes and irritate my contacts, but not an issue at all.  Surprisingly easy to remove too.</li>
            <li> While this does lengthen your lashes and make them look awesome, I have a huge complaint as to the stickiness of this product. I literally spent all day pulling my lashes apart which completely messed up the look. I couldn&#x27;t go out in the sun without my eyes getting practically glued shut! If you can deal with the annoying side of it, it really does make your lashes look very long and full.</li>
            <li> I used to have lash extensions for about a year and they were great but too expensive for the maintenance. So then I moved to Latisse, which wasn&#x27;t as bold as the extensions but still worked. Well fast forward to present day and finding out that Latisse is not approved for pregnant women (well it just hasn&#x27;t been proven safe). So I decided to try Too Faced Better than False Lashes, despite the mixed reviews. It&#x27;s definitely something you need to work with, you might not love it after your first time. I actually put on about 3 layers and every once in a while one eye naturally has thicker or longer lashes than the other so I just adjust how many layers I want based on how balanced it looks. I think it&#x27;s great-it really thickens my lashes and it does lengthen but can get a little messy looking but i actually like that thicker clumpy look:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a girl that likes to wear makeup and you can tell i wear makeup-so i love the look and i like it better than my fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems to stay kinda damp throughout the day, and if the lashes are really long then it can sometime hit my upper eyelid and leave dots- so i finish with a layer of waterproof mascara to seal it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready to Wear makes something similar that I&#x27;ll try too, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep a backup of this product:)</li>
            <li> While it does lengthen your lashes it is VERY sticky! My lashes were clumping and sticking together all day! Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> In my case, it didnt really work... it actually makes my lashes &amp;#34;crumble&amp;#34; and they dont actually look fuller nor longer</li>
            <li> Too dry,look like already been long time in the stock. Can not make my eyelash long.</li>
            <li> It has been many years since I have 2 mascaras that make me happy, but too faced  and Lorac did the trick.. I tell everyone about them I am very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I was Not crazy about the step #two product that looked and felt like lint feathers. Overall my eyelashes appeared fuller!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff, comes off easy at the end of the day (when it want it to)&lt;br /&gt;100% happy customer, quick shipping, product as pictured, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again&lt;br /&gt;Like it so much ... They are really beautiful ... definitely I will ask again</li>
            <li> the product does great with eyelash length, however when you put it on after a bit it will cause your eyelashes to stick together and some of the eyelashes if you get hair stuck near them will cause your eyelashes to fuse together. I have to use baby oil to get it off but will use it when I really want to have a good effect, I just wish the product itself was better made.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  At first I read the reviews and they prevented me from buying this right away! I decided to go against what most people had said, I had heard so many good things from friends.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this!! As long as you know how to use this, it will work well!!! The mascara is really an adhesive and is not meant to be thick. You have to add layers of it, it gets thicker as you do!! And be careful not to glob too much on at once, it will get sticky.</li>
            <li> This product delivers nada,nothing, zilch of what it promises.  I did have my hopes up but was&lt;br /&gt;sorely disappointed.  I even gave it more than one try.  The pictures on TV of the ladies who&lt;br /&gt;got fabulous lashes have to be fake, because I did exactly what the instructions said and didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;even get the length I get from my regular mascara (Selma Hayak mascara).  The picture on&lt;br /&gt;the box have to be manufactured...this product is so not worth the price. I&#x27;m returning it asap.</li>
            <li> This mascara has a primer. The primer is awful!  It&#x27;s like putting cotton on your eyelashes and then coating them with mascara.  It just does not work.  It is very expensive, and very misleading.  I am just using the mascara, and not the whit flaky stuff that is supposed to be the Magic to give you long lashes.  It is inferior and I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is okay.I don&#x27;t have hardly any lashes and it definitely made them look a litle longer and fuller. I am not sure that I think it is worth the price though.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this product a 4 is because the shipping took longer than I expected to I ended up having to go to Sephora and to buy one. I tried this product from Sephora and loved it, it was cheaper online to I ordered it on here. I needed it from prom that saturday, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been delivered until that following Monday. I ended up gifting this one to a friend for her birthday and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says&lt;br /&gt;Long long lashes&lt;br /&gt;Decent Volume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Messy&lt;br /&gt;Hard to take off (you have to use makeup remover)&lt;br /&gt;Created softer lashes (I hate when lashes get REALLY hard from a lot of mascara, but this one was too soft... if you bumped you lashes or laid down you lashes will be moved around)&lt;br /&gt;Not water proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVEN AFTER ALL THOSE CONS... This product is still the best product I&#x27;ve used to make short lashes long. When applying it you must be patient and can&#x27;t rush it to much or it will come out all clumpy. I also put hair spray in the formula and it solved the water proof and soft lash problem. Good look!</li>
            <li> I purchased at Sephora and I must say it is different. It is like putting cotton candy fibers onto the lashes but it turned black with the top coat and I totally recommend. I too am older and have thinning lashes. After trying several other makers, this one is tops. I have used it three times and I am impressed totally. Worth trying!</li>
            <li> I have what I consider to be \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lashes-- not too short, not too long, not too thick, not too sparse.  My lashes looked no different than when I used my regular, $8 mascara and, what is much worse, it is SO HARD to get this off your lashes.  After four days of use, including using eye makeup remover every night, the product was so built up on my lashes that they were all stuck together!  I finally had to go through the process of meticulously cleaning them by rubbing and pulling my lashes between my thumb and forefinger wet with eye makeup remover, which is apparently what I need to be doing daily in order to avoid product build-up.  I&#x27;m going back to my drugstore brand mascara!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Sephora to enhance my lashes for a wedding I&#x27;m in. It looks nothing like the picture shown on the box as an end result. Instead of the fibers thickening and lenghtening, it&#x27;s like running a q-tip over your lashes after you&#x27;ve just applied a coat of mascara. Your lashes end up mish-mashed. They&#x27;re not straight. It just looks like you slept in your mascara. It looks sloppy, not smooth and neat. Very disappointed because I bought this the day before the wedding and it left me scrambling to find something else without actually using false lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this at Sephora and it is just ok. It does build the lashes, but since my lashes are fine, it clumped and my lashes stuck together. The best mascara I have used to build lashes, strenghten and condition them is Bare Minerals, hands down the best. Doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on amazing. One more thing..this mascara is extremely difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> If you have beautiful lashes, this will make them pop. If you have thin short lashes, not the product to use.</li>
            <li> I had bought the same product at Sephora and loved it! So I figured I&#x27;d purchase the same product, at least I thought it would be the same product, off of Amazon, but am very disappointed!  The mascara wand bristles are too far apart and doesn&#x27;t apply the mascara evenly, smoothly or cleanly.  Then the white fibers seem to flake off easier, not to mention the mascara is also flaky.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This two layer process is the answer to my prayers - eyelash wise, that is.  I have tried them all and have only been disappointed to varying degrees.  This process works so well!  The lashes stay long all day and all night and if you do two layers instead of one you will have the longest thickest lashes ever.  People have noticed my lashes so often now and I&#x27;m always excited to tell them what I use.  I will never stop!!</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant to deviate from my usual mascara brand.  But, Two Faced truly does a great job of making my lashes look longer and more full and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of person who can pretty much wear any mascara and still have amazing lashes, this will work great for you. This, however, didn&#x27;t work so well with my stubby, sparse, instantly-deflating lashes--but it did work beautifully on my sister (who has naturally long, fluffy lashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-BUILDABLE VOLUME: no kidding, you can can repeatedly apply the duo to build your lashes up like crazy. Like, tickle-your-brows long! My sister&#x27;s never gotten this type of volume with any other mascara--and she usually applies like 5 coats..&lt;br /&gt;-YOU CAN USE THE FIBERS WITH ANY MASCARA: don&#x27;t like the mascara it came with? you could definitely combine the fibers with your favorite mascara for the ultimate combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-DOESN&#x27;T WORK FOR EVERYONE: alas, if you have hard-to-curl stubby, sparse lashes, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;-UNNATURAL, STICKY LASHES: this will NOT give you natural-looking lashes--but if long, clumpy, thick spider lashes are your thing (which my sister likes) you&#x27;ll love this mascara. Just FYI, If you look closely, the tip of your lashes will look kind of frayed and awkward, like you have massive split ends--but it&#x27;s just the fibers, so you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;-PRICE: I definitely think this is over-hyped and over-priced, but it is a decent mascara--and a pretty unique one to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: If you already have nice lashes but want crazy-long, thick spider lashes, you&#x27;ll love this. If you don&#x27;t like the actual mascara, at least give the fibers a try with your own! You have to continuously build up the mascara and fibers to achieve any great length, though--this isn&#x27;t a one-coat or two-coat type of mascara.</li>
            <li> This 2-step system has completely changed the look of my eyes. I&#x27;m not sure what all the bad reviewers are talking about? It is NOT stickier than regular mascara, it is NOT difficult to get off (i use pond&#x27;s cold cream and have for years don&#x27;t waste your money on eye makeup liquid remover), and it IS a breeze to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl your lashes and apply the mascara, before it dries add the fibers and then re-apply the mascara. Unless you&#x27;re 12 with no makeup experience, you truly can&#x27;t mess this up. Every time I have it on, several people comment about how amazing I look or that my eyes look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine doesn&#x27;t clump or stick but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on bottom lashes either. It may be pricy but it&#x27;s cheaper and easier than applying false lashes. I looooooooooooove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will deliver results....check out the you tube reviews/demos. I did and that&#x27;s what sold me on this stuff :)</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time to buy this product, I love it! I can wear it everyday and add more plush for evening wear..False eyelashes are hard on my eyes and this product is perfect...can&#x27;t even feel them, but you can see them! Whoever came up with this is a genius!</li>
            <li> High hopes but was really let down. The product was either dryer up or more complicated than it was worth. Returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mascara that I have ever used that has actually made my eyelashes visible!!!!  I have extremely short and thin lashes and this product is absolutely amazing.  The downside is that it is very pricey and a little difficult to remove (you MUST use an eye makeup remover product).  Other than that I love it and it is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This works but was not what I was erecting. I had higher expectations for this product and I don&#x27;t feel is worth the money.</li>
            <li> What a letdown.  It clumped and made the lashes stick together. I had to pry them apart with a safety pin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..... It is better then what I expected!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! I wish I had found it sooner. It&#x27;s one of two makeup products I can&#x27;t live without. One of my all time favorite products. Wonderful results if used properly. You will however have to invest in eye makeup remover to take it off. Love!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is a two step product and I am lazy. It really doesn&#x27;t add much time to my regime and the results are awesome. I had no problems with it at all. A gentle hand goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. it really works. gives you a full, lush lash. def. would recommend this to everyone looking to enhance their eyes.</li>
            <li> I love Too Faced and have continued to be a fan for years. I honestly think they dropped the ball on this one. Before purchasing this product i read most of the reviews from both sides. I decided to give it a go. Basically unless you wash your mascara brush off after each use, the product does not stay consistent from use to use. I have used this about five times now and have found that my lashes do not look the same as they did the first time around. I wish there was a separate top and base coat so that the final coat was a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Not a bad alternative, but definitely not the same as false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I cant believe I thought buying this product would be a good idea....don&#x27;t do it!  I thought the concept was interesting until I realized that the fibers in this mascara were nylon.  Nylon does not break down if it gets stuck in your eye...which it did.  I had a fiber stuck in my eye for a week and almost had to go to the doctor.  I ended up fishing it out myself eventually but I will never use something like this again</li>
            <li> Product is great, I was a little concerned however when it didn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s little box? I have purchased this item before locally, there should have been a box it comes in... very odd</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false eyelashes since I was 16 (many years ago) and thought I&#x27;d give this pricey product a try.  I found it way too much work to achieve the same effect I do from the inexpensive false eyelashes.  It was also difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Horrible . Didn&#x27;t come with the white primer part ! Isn&#x27;t that the whole point of the mascara !</li>
            <li> First time ever I have great lashes ...told and showed everyone I know, will order again. Fast delivery, thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Sephora after hearing all the girls rave about it and looking to find a replacement for my D.I.Y fiberwig mascara, which they stopped carrying. Anyways it has two steps , the mascara and then the fiber extensions..which look and feel like dust particles. Then you reapply the mascara... it clumps , doesnt give any type of umph and leaks under the eyes. I returned it after three days for a Givenchy mascara that I love. It&#x27;s not waterproof, yet stays put even with my oily skin. Do yourself a favorite and skip this product-you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I have tried so many different mascaras from the $5 -$30 and this is the only that has fully delivered.  It can be tricky at first but after 2-3 times the results are remarkable! I have small eyelashes and people ask if I am wearing fake eyelashes plus no flaking.</li>
            <li> i found the same product at Costco for only $15... This mascara is okay I would say.. But I bet there&#x27;s better out there.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara-holic, I love mascara and have tried every kind out there...this mascara is sticky, by the end of the day, my eyes were so irritated.I would HIGHLY recommend you chose a different fiber lash mascara. Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this at ulta because I have long lashes and I just wanted more length for going out. The fibers make your lashes severely stick together(its ridiculous) when the mascara is applied for the third step. The mascara and fibers made my lashes very stiff and this stuff is a nightmare to remove. I only gave this two stars Instead of just one because the mascara by itself is decent enough to use so I didn&#x27;t get completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> If you take your time and apply it with patience, it is awesome. Not heavy, and clean up is  no problem. If you try and hurry, it will glob and make a mess around your eys. The results will also reflect your impatience</li>
            <li> This item is better than false lashes.  It really looks natural, you can evenly apply this product onto your natural lashes.  It really looks like you went to a salon.  I could never get anyone to put them on properly and with this product you can put it on as thick as you want and/or as long lengthwise.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to worry about them coming off and it&#x27;s like having fresh false lashes that you can apply daily.  Well worth the time, money and effort to look sexy and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  Stars, Stars, Stars!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, it really does make your lashes look longer. My daughter and I tell everyone about it, and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This mascara is terrible! I already have long eye lashes but i&#x27;m a blonde so I like to enhance them. This was so sticky that my eyelashes closed shut! I tried this three different times hoping that maybe it was just me but it&#x27;s not. I even tried keeping my eyes open for a while with out blinking to give them a chance to dry and still when I blinked my eyelashes close shut again. I don&#x27;t know how other girls were able to give this mascara any more than 1 star. No one can see those gorgeous lashes if they are closed shut!</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara i have ever used! it makes my lashes look so great! people compliment me when ever i have it on.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes so pretty and a lot of people noticed the length! Such a natural feel! I have recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product all.  I tried it several times according to the directions with awful results.  My regular mascara works much much better</li>
            <li> With alll the hype about fibers and mascara, I thought this would be perfect.  It&#x27;s not.  It does absolutely nothing.  The fiber wand is dry as a bone.  I inquired about that, and was told, that&#x27;s how it is supposed to be.  Illegal Lengths by Maybelline is far superior, and has fibers in it.  DO NOT BUY THE TOO FACED MASCARA!</li>
            <li> Really dumbfounded by some of the poor reviews. If you use it right and follow the directions, then it works. You have to put a coat of mascara, then the fibers, then another coat of mascara. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Flaky but builds lashes well.  I felt I had to adjust my original review.  i usually buy the L&#x27;oriel version instead.  The l&#x27;oriel packaging is better as is the performance.  This stuff flakes within hours but the unique formula allows me to build my lashes to great lengths.  My L&#x27;oriel lasts all day and looks smooth with no flakes, but I can&#x27;t get as long a lash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian so I basically have no eye lashes. My friend left me her brand new golden bottle when she left to go home from visiting and I didn&#x27;t even know there was a little white bottle as showen in the photo. So I went with it without searching about it. So what I normally do regardless of the type of mascara... I  was putting on a base mascara- maybellne the falsies volume express waterproof - then I would put the golden two face mascara thinking it was normal mascara. And it would make my lashes extremely long it would extend my eye lashes not like any other type of mascara. Then I would put an end base - either the falsies agian or clump crusher by lash blast just to make it stick and look more black. But realistically it was the golden bottle that really really made my eye lashes longer then ever before! Hahah I was gonna google about it and find another bottle when I ran out but who knew that it actually came with the base coat and end coat (no idea what it&#x27;s called- white bottle). I love it honestly and like I said I&#x27;m Asian and I really don&#x27;t have lashes. Only giving it four stars cause I don&#x27;t know what the white bottle can do. And it does get flakey, it did that when I didn&#x27;t put an end coat on to make it stick. To be honestly I have no idea what was in this golden bottle didn&#x27;t even know what nylon lash was written in the bottle. The flakey ness didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;d get some black specs on me but not like stupid crazy amounts when I&#x27;d bug or hate the product. It does what it&#x27;s suppose too</li>
            <li> It nice and make my lashes super nice ad long but it gets dry therefore making everything look clumpy</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara...highly recommendit</li>
            <li> Really goopy. Makes lashes stick together and will not come off with makeup remover. It makes them look longer a tiny bit and somewhat fuller but clumpy and the ends wind up crooked and Strange looking</li>
            <li> Because my lashes have thinned out over the years, I decided to try this product after seeing it on The Today Show.&lt;br /&gt;It definately makes your lashes appear longer! I would have given it a 5 star rating except that the little fibers can (and did) get into my eyes if you are not extremely careful. It was pretty easy to get off, also. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a strange system. The white fibers are like microfine cotton or cotton candy. They are wispy and act like stubborn dust bunnies. When you seal them in, your lashes WILL almost double in length (so not kidding! but they are like feathers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only adjective I can apply here is &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34;. I had fun playing with this product, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d choose it over lash tubes. They just really look and feel like feathers, not lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m 40-something and wear little to no makeup.)</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my eyes look amazing. Only fault I have with it is the price....very expensive. The bottle of fibers is not very big. However, over all I was so happy with how it made my eyes look.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I bought this mascara, thinking it&#x27;d make my sparse but mid-length eyelashes look nice.  Thing was, I couldn&#x27;t even keep the stuff on a full day without going nuts.  The mascara definitely has fibers and they definitely cling to your lashes, but they build up in a very unnatural looking way and ultimately flake off in bits and get in your eyes.  So there you are, trying to look half-way decent, with your eyes watery and red while you attempt to get some of the stuff out of your eyes, which only makes the lashes clump together even more (since touching them makes them adhere to each other)!  I won&#x27;t be getting these again.</li>
            <li> I tried this on at ULTA and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend the money on it. I felt it worked pretty well and seemed to enhance the length of my lashes. However, the base and sealing mascara did not stay on very well and barely a few hours later it was running so I had racoon eyes.  Maybe worth trying with a better mascara or waterproof one but then you have to pay for both these items and only use 1/2.</li>
            <li> amazing stuff! I dont wear false lashes so this was the perfect alternative for me, and its not all clumpy and gross either</li>
            <li> The worst mascara I have ever used. I spent the entire day wiping it from my lids and from under my eyes. It did not ever dry on my lashes. It stung, it clumped. I returned it and I don&#x27;t recall ever trying to return makeup before. The clerk who gave my money back said she had the same experience with it. I wear very good face creams products (due to allergies) so there is nothing to blame but this really awful product. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this. They don&#x27;t make my lashes quite as long s I expected, but definitely longer that with regular mascara! This stuff also doesn&#x27;t run, if I neglect to wash it off at night. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> So here is what I think...if you want this mascara for like a special event or something..it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However..if you want to use it daily..its terrible. It&#x27;s clumpy and does not wash off no matter what I try. I was hoping to use it regularly but I can maybe use it once a week. So that is why I am not happy. I&#x27;d rather buy the cheap stuff that washes off.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara because my lashes did look good when I was putting it on. But two minutes later it was a disaster. This mascara stays sticky all day so if you touch it it turns into one big clump. I made the mistake of getting dressed after putting it on and when my shirt touched my lashes again they formed into one big clump. Oh and don&#x27;t close your eyes, because you will have to pry thm back open. Yeah its that sticky where your top and bottom lashes will stick together.</li>
            <li> First of all this is a real review. I do not understand the people that said it doesnt work and it is hard to take off ? The product does work and gives close to the look of false lashes. Its very easy to use. I start with curling my eyelashes cuz mine tend to sometimes go all over the place lol, I then do 1 coat of the base mascara and then quickly apply the extensions applicator (this way it sticks right on), lastly I apply the base coat again as it is used as a finisher as well and I do 2 coats of this. Repeat the same with your other eye. Perfect! Could use slight more volume enhancer but this product definelty gives you luscious long lashes. **Note: I do not use for my bottom lashes because I noticed it smears at the bottom when I do.****  I use my general mascara for my bottom lashes. Overall this is a good product and removes easily with a make-up remover cloth!</li>
            <li> No better than any other mascara</li>
            <li> I tried this at Sephora and was impressed at the time with results. Although it was slightly clumpy at the time, I brushed it off as a side effect from the heavily used sample product that who knows how long has been out and used. I also was using Sephora&#x27;s disposable mascara wands to test which had much wider, far apart bristles than the ones included with product. You put the mascara on first, then before it dries apply the nylon fibers.The fibers are white and stick to the just applied mascara. Last you put another coat of mascara on. The end result are little nylon extensions at the end of your own lashes creating a longer lash look. My tiny, sparse lashes were slightly clumpy but I was pretty impressed that they looked more noticeable than with my regular mascara (Dior, which is an awesome mascara for volume)..so I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately since buying the product I have not been able to achieve the same results remotely close to what I saw in the store. While the mascara worked fine in terms of separation and definition, the nylon fibers would not adhere to my lashes like they did in the store. What did adhere to lashes ended up looking strange like barbed wire on the tips of lashes sort of like a weird split end. To make things worse...I was applying makeup 10 minutes later when a gentle touch of my eyeliner pen caused all of my lashes to clump together and tangle up in a mess! I had to comb the mess out and it was super tacky! I couldn&#x27;t believe my lashes weren&#x27;t dry yet. Now I look like I have spider legs for lashes. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the mascara was old and tacky when I sampled it or whether it was the different brush that I used...but this product doesn&#x27;t deliver what it promises in the end and is going back to Sephora. I also wanted to add that another reviewer may be right that this may only work for people that have great lashes to begin with. I personally do not...mine have always been difficult to curl, short, sparse, and straight.nd straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure how this product is supposed to work, but the nylon particles were dry and got into my eyes. Then when you add another layer of mascara it clumps up and your eyelashes stick together. Would NOT buy again!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money... Threw it away after trying it for the third and last time. Did not notice any difference. Went back to my old mascara minus 35 dollars!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product but it&#x27;s so dry it doesn&#x27;t work at all. My lashes are longer with cheap drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> When I turned 50, my normally short lashes became almost non-existent. Mascara companies make promises, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. THIS ONE WORKS!! My lashes are now so long they are a little uncomfortable with my glasses, so I wear contacts more often. What a great problem to have!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that perhaps any negative reviewers didn&#x27;t follow directions: you have to use black as a primer, then white, then black again.&lt;br /&gt;I balked at the price and, depending on how long this product lasts, may not use it forever. Hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. But for now, I&#x27;m a happy woman. I finally have lashes.</li>
            <li> Takes way to long to dry, clumps together.  When it is dry the bottom and top lashes would stick together when you blink creating a hard time to open and shut your eyes.</li>
            <li> Takes too long and looks just like any normal mascara. The fibres get into my eyes and makes the whole thing terrible</li>
            <li> Love this product, you need to know how to use it right and your lashed will look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast. It was delivered 3 days after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,product was perfect. Very happy :)</li>
            <li> Love the way this enhances my lashes!</li>
            <li> Very sticky on your lashes. It leaves a very client look. Overall not a good product.</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara on the planet!!!  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this product. Expensive first off, I thought I would give it a shot. The mascara burns my eyes, it also doesn&#x27;t wipe away easily. It took days for it to completely come off, and the way my eyelashes look when the product is on... Sorry to say, not worth it. :/ I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t dry for me, and if it does, it takes about 20 minutes with a hairdryer</li>
            <li> I have extremely short eyelashes, so I&#x27;ve been looking for anything to make them look longer.  I can never get fake eyelashes to work.  This is perfect for me!  You do have to try it a few times to get used to applying them so they look natural, but these are awesome!</li>
            <li> It really does lengthen lashes and I love the way my lashes look immediately after application. However, after a long day at work, I always end up getting black smudges under my eyes.  It is also very difficult to remove even with cotton pads and eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Beautiful thick, long lashes. Works wonderfully. I love that the fibers were white so you can see what you&#x27;re applying. I ended up being allergic to it sadly, but for those who aren&#x27;t, it is better than the MLM competitor brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first try with a fiber mascara and after only one try with no research on how to apply, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased. The mascara went on very smoothly and did a great job of keeping my lashes separate. The fiber stuff went on easily as well. Last, using the mascara again, this time as a sealer, was also a piece of cake. My lashes ended up very pretty long. I&#x27;m looking forward to getting more practice in...see what different application techniques will do. Next time I&#x27;ll try to go for thicker lashes and pay extra attention to applying the fiber so that I don&#x27;t brush the lashes just for length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup was easy. Just swiped my face cleansing wipe as usual and everything came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I think the picture on the box is a little deceitful. I can&#x27;t imagine how to get lashes to look as voluminous as the model on the box, but you can never trust any eyelashes on a mascara model. False eyelashes will look MUCH fuller, but this is still a nice little way to give you some vavavoom without damaging your natural eyelashes with eye lash glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why some of the negative reviews ended up with clumps perhaps they got an old batch that had dried out?  I bought mine from Costco and my lashes came out clump free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this mascara, but it was a huge letdown. For starters, my lashes looked no different than with regular mascara. Secondly, the nylon fibers flaked off and got in my contact lenses, and my lashes felt waxy and sticky all day. The product stuck to my lashes for days, and I would have rather just pulled a strip of false lashes off! I can&#x27;t believe that Too Faced made this mascara, because I have NEVER had such a bad experience with one of their products. I would not purchase this again for $2, forget $35! Too Faced should drop this from their product line before it damages their good reputation (and my lashes)!</li>
            <li> So, to be fair, my lashes are already a decent length, but even after curling them and applying regular mascara, they would never hold the curl for more than the first ten minutes. This stuff is great! Just got it yesterday and used it this morning for work. Not only did it make my lashes look so much longer, but the mascara is like glue...they have held a curl all day! I noticed slight clumpage, but an eyelash comb seemed to clean it up enough. Overall I&#x27;m very very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that is the best Mascara I have ever ever used ! I have spent a ton on mascara and have a drawer full ! Absolutely love this mascara it has made my eyes look amazing !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now &amp; I have recommended it to everyone I know!!!! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my lashes because they look FABULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li> I don´t like it because the results were no better from any good/less expensive mascara. This mascara is way too sticky with my eyelashes and very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The base is made of some kind of stringy cotton. It&#x27;s super itchy and difficult to apply. I can&#x27;t imagine wearing it all day! I usually love Too Faced products but I don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
