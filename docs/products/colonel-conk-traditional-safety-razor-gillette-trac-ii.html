            <li>perfect.</li>
            <li>My gave me the specs he wanted for a razor handle, and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>excellent product....</li>
            <li>it preformed flawlessly all those years until one day I dropped it and the head cracked off.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and matched perfectly to what it said it was....</li>
            <li>Best ever</li>
            <li>But, in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best ever.</li>
            <li>weight and handle design is very good</li>
            <li>Good!</li>
            <li>It looked beautiful, but I see he has wrapped it with tape,and says the handle is too slippery when he shaves, and the tape is his solution.</li>
            <li>best, most beautiful shaver ever!</li>
            <li>Works great and adds class to my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It has a great weight and feel.  </li>
            <li>This was a great find.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor.  </li>
            <li>great buy</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Delivery was great.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to the Wilkinson Tech 4 and am quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>great experience</li>
            <li>So happy to found another one.</li>
            <li>Great quality.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product, but not for me.</li>
            <li>The chrome razor is very nice, of good quality, and a pleasure to see each day.  </li>
            <li>Trac II blades/cartridges fit perfectly....</li>
            <li>way superior.</li>
            <li>My husband has always loved this razor and owned two.</li>
            <li>The problem is finding the perfect blade to fit the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Colonel Conk razor for a good part of my life.  </li>
            <li>The newer swivel tops hop skip and jump across your face while the blade may be good, but the slicky stuff is not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now maybe the original razors work flawlessly.</li>
            <li>great looking razor which is more art than function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li>Very stylish razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice chrome plating too</li>
            <li>but beyond that nicely balanced and a nice chrome finsih</li>
            <li>Nice weight...</li>
            <li>, it had a nice weight</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s so nice</li>
            <li>After a while the metal where the blades attach gets pitted and starts looking not so nice...</li>
            <li>This is a very nice looking razor and the inexpensive blades fit it.  </li>
            <li>Loved the first one and the heft and form are great.</li>
            <li>Very Happy with this New replacement.</li>
            <li>The Handle is very comfortable in the hand</li>
            <li>You will enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>A non tapered handle would allow for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I paid a lot more for mine.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s Christmas, I&#x27;ll treat myself and I am glad I did cos</li>
            <li>I love this blade handle.  </li>
            <li>I love the way a 2 blade razor shaves but can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li>This stainless steel razor has a great feel and it won&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>nice weight and and smooth handle.</li>
            <li>That is all I have top say.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t real happy about the price, considering that new razor handles are super fancy yet cheaper.</li>
            <li>More economical!!</li>
            <li>this handle is nice to hold and gives a controlled clean shave.</li>
            <li>This has a nice heavy heft yet is well balanced, so it feels good in your hand and its weight is just right for a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, and I am able to hold onto this just fine..</li>
            <li>The cheap bump fighter seems better balanced.</li>
            <li>This Conk handle needs a special resting place, or it will run off!  </li>
            <li>More durable than the original.</li>
            <li>Blades slide off way to easily.</li>
            <li>Easy rinsing means a longer blade life.  </li>
            <li>I like most men vigorously tap to clean the blade.</li>
            <li>He says this one works fine with his supply of blades.</li>
            <li>I prefer the heavier one, but she likes this one just fine.</li>
            <li>Unlike the original, this handle has room between the underside of the blade and the handle, which allows for easy rinsing.  </li>
            <li>well balanced handle great to use for a close, comfortable shave, (my second one for back-up travel)</li>
            <li>This fit my needs</li>
            <li>And there are no angles on the handle to help secure your grip.</li>
            <li>Anyone know where genuine Schick and Gillette Trac-II handles are still sold?    </li>
            <li>Trac-II razor handles are no longer available in brick and mortar retailers, although retailers still stock the plastic razor cartridges.    </li>
            <li>Anyone know where genuine Schick and Gillette handles are still sold?  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor - just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Looked cheap and there was also a huge seam inside the cart attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then it seems downright cheap.</li>
            <li>I tend to buy the cheap bulk Personna blades from Ebay.</li>
            <li>Works great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I would like to make clear that the seller is Good</li>
            <li>Also it takes a good amount of force to slide the old blade off</li>
            <li>Double Track Razor #226 is a great looking razor, but I shave in the shower and quickly learned that this razor, shaving cream and water don&#x27;t mix.  </li>
            <li>, its the one thing in my medicine cabinet that I am not afraid for people to see!   </li>
            <li>Stay with the original blade.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my original trac 2 razor broke from my tapping it on the side of the sink to clean the whiskers our of the blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a balancing act that you have to focus on not dropping the device rather then concentrating on getting a close clean shave.</li>
            <li>This razor looks good and has a nice heavy feel.  </li>
            <li>The good shave does not depend on the slicky stuff lasting.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li>The razor has a nice long handle and is easy to hold on to and with the 4 blades provides a clean close...  </li>
            <li>Luckily, that&#x27;s what I received.</li>
            <li>Item super</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for Trac II lovers, its much better than Gillette&#x27;s plastic razor grip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very tight fit, and requires a great deal of force.  </li>
            <li>I love using this sleek razor, slick, quick and stylish!  </li>
            <li>Then it arrived and I understand the price and feel it&#x27;s worth it:</li>
            <li>the tracks slide nicely over it... even using the same box</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this; it&#x27;s like shaving with a work of art - heavy and very attractive.</li>
            <li>A nice, simple sturdy razor.  </li>
            <li>Probably the last razor I will ever own.</li>
            <li>Nice product that does the job, and is stylish at the same time; should last a lifetime!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful for a quick touchup after the main shave.</li>
            <li>Finish of this razor handle is not as good as merkur&#x27;s handle but also half the price.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the original hollow Gillette product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little shorter and no grooves for a good grip</li>
            <li>The blade is exactly where you expect it to be and that never changes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon he found a replacement!</li>
            <li>Exactly the razor I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I wound up looking for a 1970s vintage original atra razor on a certain auction site and ordered that for nearly 40 bucks.  </li>
            <li>Found this on Amazon and with mostly positive reviews decided this was it.</li>
            <li>Handle is solid metal, design is stylish, and shape is great, but the handle is too thin for my hand, and I found the balance to be off for me when shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just some very strange and entertaining behavior, for an inanimate object.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice and is hefty enough, making it seem better than the usual plastic stuff.  </li>
            <li>Uses trac-2 cartridges, which are getting hard to find, but I think it gives as good a shave as anything on the market today.  </li>
            <li>The Conk&#x27;s heavy, curved handle gives it the amazing inclination to slide off the counter, and into the sink, or onto the floor.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The seller did everything as promised so feel comfortable with them but this specific product is GARBAGE.</li>
            <li>And much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>how long it&#x27;s apt to last.</li>
            <li>Like the old steel-handled double-razor handle my Dad had, this one&#x27;s the kind of thing you keep and even hand down to a son.</li>
            <li>So for the time being this is a backup razor (I have a drawer full of generic cartridge blades, never opened.)</li>
            <li>The blades are much cheaper for this razor than the new ones Gillette makes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Price seems high until you factor in how well it&#x27;s made and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very attractive and appealing to the eye, but in the hand, feels awkward and clumsy.    </li>
            <li>I wanted some thing that would hold a twin blade because the 4 or 5 blades out there are just too wide for a detailed shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson also makes sharp blades and I also enjoy their quality.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Having bought my original Trac II handle back in the Mid 80&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>problem is the blade must truly fit tight.</li>
            <li>This is a very attractive razor, but I have to give it only two stars for bad design.  </li>
            <li>My 25 year old Schick handle is wearing out.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor handle for my husband to replace his years old plastic   Trac 2 handle.  </li>
            <li>I find shaving much easier with non-swivelling blades and haven&#x27;t cut myself since I went back.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend, to replace a 20 year old one which got lost in a hospital.</li>
            <li>My old plastic Trac-II handle broke</li>
            <li>I nearly cut myself taking it</li>
            <li>It is solid metal, has a nice properly balanced heavy feel to it..  </li>
            <li>The original razor was on so tight</li>
            <li>I still have my old original Type II, but it&#x27;s gotten a little wobbly through the decades.</li>
            <li>last two razors that I purchased have a shorter handle than the older one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase -- lost the first one when I left it at a hotel on a business trip.  </li>
            <li>Add to this the new razor that I purchased last year is already pitting.  </li>
            <li>This razor is nice to look at, but a bit small in the hand which makes it a little tricky to use while shaving.</li>
            <li>With a beard it will take a while, but the razor will last, unlike the old one.</li>
            <li>When wet, the Conk&#x27;s handle is very slippery.  </li>
            <li>The Conk&#x27;s polished chrome handle looks nice, but makes shaving difficult.  </li>
            <li>Others have mentioned that this razor is slippery and hard to hold on to, I am sure it&#x27;s due to the fact that they made the handle shorter.</li>
            <li>The Conk&#x27;s solid rail makes it more difficult to rinse the installed cartridge, in contrast to the old open rail design.  </li>
            <li>I received it, however, I strongly worried it was going to be made out of plastic or some cheap form of crap.</li>

            <li> Double Track Razor #226 is a great looking razor, but I shave in the shower and quickly learned that this razor, shaving cream and water don&#x27;t mix.  </li>
            <li> , its the one thing in my medicine cabinet that I am not afraid for people to see!   </li>
            <li> Stay with the original blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my original trac 2 razor broke from my tapping it on the side of the sink to clean the whiskers our of the blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a balancing act that you have to focus on not dropping the device rather then concentrating on getting a close clean shave.</li>
            <li> This razor looks good and has a nice heavy feel.  </li>
            <li> The good shave does not depend on the slicky stuff lasting.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> The razor has a nice long handle and is easy to hold on to and with the 4 blades provides a clean close...  </li>
            <li> Luckily, that&#x27;s what I received.</li>
            <li> Item super</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for Trac II lovers, its much better than Gillette&#x27;s plastic razor grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very tight fit, and requires a great deal of force.  </li>
            <li> I love using this sleek razor, slick, quick and stylish!  </li>
            <li> Then it arrived and I understand the price and feel it&#x27;s worth it:</li>
            <li> the tracks slide nicely over it... even using the same box</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this; it&#x27;s like shaving with a work of art - heavy and very attractive.</li>
            <li> A nice, simple sturdy razor.  </li>
            <li> Probably the last razor I will ever own.</li>
            <li> Nice product that does the job, and is stylish at the same time; should last a lifetime!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful for a quick touchup after the main shave.</li>
            <li> Finish of this razor handle is not as good as merkur&#x27;s handle but also half the price.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the original hollow Gillette product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little shorter and no grooves for a good grip</li>
            <li> The blade is exactly where you expect it to be and that never changes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon he found a replacement!</li>
            <li> Exactly the razor I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wound up looking for a 1970s vintage original atra razor on a certain auction site and ordered that for nearly 40 bucks.  </li>
            <li> Found this on Amazon and with mostly positive reviews decided this was it.</li>
            <li> Handle is solid metal, design is stylish, and shape is great, but the handle is too thin for my hand, and I found the balance to be off for me when shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just some very strange and entertaining behavior, for an inanimate object.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice and is hefty enough, making it seem better than the usual plastic stuff.  </li>
            <li> Uses trac-2 cartridges, which are getting hard to find, but I think it gives as good a shave as anything on the market today.  </li>
            <li> The Conk&#x27;s heavy, curved handle gives it the amazing inclination to slide off the counter, and into the sink, or onto the floor.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The seller did everything as promised so feel comfortable with them but this specific product is GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> And much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> how long it&#x27;s apt to last.</li>
            <li> Like the old steel-handled double-razor handle my Dad had, this one&#x27;s the kind of thing you keep and even hand down to a son.</li>
            <li> So for the time being this is a backup razor (I have a drawer full of generic cartridge blades, never opened.)</li>
            <li> The blades are much cheaper for this razor than the new ones Gillette makes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Price seems high until you factor in how well it&#x27;s made and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very attractive and appealing to the eye, but in the hand, feels awkward and clumsy.    </li>
            <li> I wanted some thing that would hold a twin blade because the 4 or 5 blades out there are just too wide for a detailed shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson also makes sharp blades and I also enjoy their quality.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Having bought my original Trac II handle back in the Mid 80&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> problem is the blade must truly fit tight.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive razor, but I have to give it only two stars for bad design.  </li>
            <li> My 25 year old Schick handle is wearing out.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor handle for my husband to replace his years old plastic   Trac 2 handle.  </li>
            <li> I find shaving much easier with non-swivelling blades and haven&#x27;t cut myself since I went back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, to replace a 20 year old one which got lost in a hospital.</li>
            <li> My old plastic Trac-II handle broke</li>
            <li> I nearly cut myself taking it</li>
            <li> It is solid metal, has a nice properly balanced heavy feel to it..  </li>
            <li> The original razor was on so tight</li>
            <li> I still have my old original Type II, but it&#x27;s gotten a little wobbly through the decades.</li>
            <li> last two razors that I purchased have a shorter handle than the older one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase -- lost the first one when I left it at a hotel on a business trip.  </li>
            <li> Add to this the new razor that I purchased last year is already pitting.  </li>
            <li> This razor is nice to look at, but a bit small in the hand which makes it a little tricky to use while shaving.</li>
            <li> With a beard it will take a while, but the razor will last, unlike the old one.</li>
            <li> When wet, the Conk&#x27;s handle is very slippery.  </li>
            <li> The Conk&#x27;s polished chrome handle looks nice, but makes shaving difficult.  </li>
            <li> Others have mentioned that this razor is slippery and hard to hold on to, I am sure it&#x27;s due to the fact that they made the handle shorter.</li>
            <li> The Conk&#x27;s solid rail makes it more difficult to rinse the installed cartridge, in contrast to the old open rail design.  </li>
            <li> I received it, however, I strongly worried it was going to be made out of plastic or some cheap form of crap.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this second one doesn&#x27;t seem to grip the blades very well which when not somewhat annoying seems a bit hazardous.  </li>
            <li> But if it won&#x27;t hold the blades securely then it&#x27;s more annoying and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> There are no slots in the head to allow water to clean the blades from behind.  </li>
            <li> To hold the plastic razor cartridge, this Conk handle has a slightly oversized, solid, cast metal rail, instead of a correctly sized, formed sheet metal rail, with detent spring, as on my old Schick handle.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice handle for anyone like me who prefers the simpler and less expensive trac2 cartridges.</li>
            <li> As I explain later, this Conk handle has some appeal, as an example of industrial design gone wrong... a very attractive form, but terribly awkward function.    </li>
            <li> It should definitely las a long time and is sturdy metal construction.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have it my hands long enough to try shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone complained that Trac II blades fit too tight, but I beg to differ.</li>
            <li> This causes them to clog up very quickly resulting in very poor shaves.  </li>
            <li> The other thing that was kind of bad is that it did not have those little &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; like my older atra brand razor did that held the cartridge in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a long time, the chrome is timeless&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> My friends, if you plan to use twin blade non-pivoting razors for a long time, this is the razor for you.  </li>
            <li> Constantly replacing the blades after minimal use is costly.</li>
            <li> I do not find the handle slippery, wet or dry, and I use the package</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is the same as others, it&#x27;s slippery when wet so could use a rubber grip or something.</li>
            <li> I recommend the razor due to its heavy weight and no drag shaving.</li>
            <li> Unlike the old design, there is a small but significant chance of accidentally cutting oneself on the blades, or by breaking either the plastic cartridge or its plastic carry case.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little short.</li>
            <li> I will probably cover that shiny Conk handle with friction tape, which will look ugly but make this Conk handle more usable.  </li>
            <li> People - There is nothing wrong with keeping things simple and highly functional!  </li>
            <li> Still well worth the price for the money saved on expensive 4 and 5 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> the only thing it is missing is a swivel head.</li>
            <li> The welds holding the handle to the cart attachment were so rough the chrome plating didn&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> Well the off brand blade tries to shimmy off every tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Impossible to find the special slide on blades that this requires at any local store.</li>
            <li> I thought I was simply tired and clumsy one morning, but no, my old Schick will stay wherever I put it, because it has an ugly plastic handle, straight as a ruler, and covered with ridges, for a secure grip.  </li>
            <li> Where the Schick handle will rest, all day long, the Conk will stay put for ten or twenty seconds, and then slowly start to slide, wobble, and then hop across the counter.  </li>
            <li> Sharp looking and does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Colonel Conk lubricated blades are sharp and stay sharp, no question about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, refuse to give up my Trac IIs for all these stupid moving and bending blades.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep my \\&quot;Conk\\&quot; handle, although IMHO it is not worth the $17 price plus $10 shipping.  </li>
            <li> However, the body of the handle is tapered and very slim, making the grip between thumb and forefinger uncomfortable and slippy.</li>
            <li> You really can;t go wrong and save $20 to $40 per month.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of fixing my wife&#x27;s old plastic handle, so I bought her one of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too shiny but that isn&#x27;t too bothersome as it matches with my other grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Well, over time - perhaps as little as a few days use, the cartridge started slipping around on the head.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a very small raised metal catch in the middle of the blade slide designed to hold the blade in place.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll last a lifetime I now can use my track two blades that I found in the supermarket for less than $.03 a shave!!!</li>
            <li> it came in,&lt;br /&gt;the plastic box lid, black foam mold that it sits in.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give something a little nicer than what I use and found this handle lacking.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to as it slimmer than a Trac-II.  </li>
            <li> With a few weeks of use I regret not having looked for a replacement for the inferior plastic piece I had before.  </li>
            <li> The handle is well-made and heavy chrome</li>
            <li> The results are reduced and uneven control that can be a nuisance (nicks and cuts).</li>
            <li> wanted a heavy, metal razor.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know if I would like this bottom heavy handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll dump a blade every few days.</li>
            <li> Its just not comfortable shaving like it used to be.</li>
            <li> In my opinion;  Track II cartridges are not secure on head of handle.  </li>
            <li> Heavy and firm.</li>
            <li> And I mean tight.</li>
            <li> It is to small and doesn&#x27;t resulting in the blade sliding during shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about it was that the handle just felt too bulky at the bulbous base where you grip it in your palm.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what his problem is, other than being a girly-man, cause this is NOT at all slippery or difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the Track Razor on the shelves at the stores.</li>
            <li> There is something about the vaguely parabolic curve of the Conk handle, combined with the heavy teardrop end, that makes this Conk handle slide off the place that I usually rest my razor.  </li>
            <li> I kinda got over the handle bad ergonomics after say ten shaves.</li>
            <li> Seriously - step back and look at some of these crazy azz razors!  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to slide replacement blades on because of the size and rough finish of the part that holds the blades.  </li>
            <li> I used it once and then decided it was not worth the risk of cutting my face.</li>
            <li> The shape and balance are a little awkward in use.  </li>
            <li> This has the least expensive razors on the market.  </li>
            <li> This Conk Trac-II razor handle is a very crude design, inferior to my 25 year old Schick brand handle.  </li>
            <li> - Keep it simple stupid - that what I say to these crazy engineers.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the Conk&#x27;s oversized rail makes installing and removing the razor cartridge rather difficult.  </li>
            <li> I am saving this Conk handle as an example of industrial design, gone wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> it is the actual product which is horrible.</li>
            <li> but if it won&#x27;t hold the blade it is useless.</li>
            <li> cold.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately our sons lost one and he was devastated!</li>
            <li> I hate it when blades slip off.</li>
            <li> Anything to get you to buy that crap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great and adds class to my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  It has a great weight and feel.  I had mistakenly bought trac II blades but I did not have a trac II razor.  This fit my needs and I like shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill D</li>
            <li> This razor is nice to look at, but a bit small in the hand which makes it a little tricky to use while shaving. And there are no angles on the handle to help secure your grip. Years ago I shaved with a Gillette butterfly type DE razor, and I just bought a double edge razor and some blades on Amazon to get away from the ever increasing prices of the Gillette and Schick cartridge razors I have used for decades. So for the time being this is a backup razor (I have a drawer full of generic cartridge blades, never opened.) It&#x27;s useful for a quick touchup after the main shave. Perhaps that is its best role. It will serve as a handle for a Gillette Type Two style cartridge, for those who need such a handle. I still have my old original Type II, but it&#x27;s gotten a little wobbly through the decades.</li>
            <li> Simple, lasting product.</li>
            <li> solid chrome steel handle that takes track 2 blades. perfect.</li>
            <li> Finish of this razor handle is not as good as merkur&#x27;s handle but also half the price.</li>
            <li> My gave me the specs he wanted for a razor handle, and this was perfect. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, but not for me. Handle is solid metal, design is stylish, and shape is great, but the handle is too thin for my hand, and I found the balance to be off for me when shaving.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t real happy about the price, considering that new razor handles are super fancy yet cheaper. Then it arrived and I understand the price and feel it&#x27;s worth it: Like the old steel-handled double-razor handle my Dad had, this one&#x27;s the kind of thing you keep and even hand down to a son.</li>
            <li> I love this product, refuse to give up my Trac IIs for all these stupid moving and bending blades. This has a nice heavy heft yet is well balanced, so it feels good in your hand and its weight is just right for a perfect shave. Nice chrome plating too, its the one thing in my medicine cabinet that I am not afraid for people to see!   I highly recommend this for Trac II lovers, its much better than Gillette&#x27;s plastic razor grip.</li>
            <li> With a few weeks of use I regret not having looked for a replacement for the inferior plastic piece I had before.  The chrome razor is very nice, of good quality, and a pleasure to see each day.  Now, I can use up the razor blades that have been sitting here.  With a beard it will take a while, but the razor will last, unlike the old one. I do not find the handle slippery, wet or dry, and I use the package it came it to mount the razor for drying.</li>
            <li> This was a great find. The handle is well-made and heavy chrome it&#x27;ll last a lifetime I now can use my track two blades that I found in the supermarket for less than $.03 a shave!!!</li>
            <li> Anyone know where genuine Schick and Gillette Trac-II handles are still sold?    (I have ordered a Gillette GII Razor and will review it, after I try it out.  [[ASIN:B005MY3JZW Gillette GII Razor (Same as Gillette TRAC II)]])  I am going to keep my \\&quot;Conk\\&quot; handle, although IMHO it is not worth the $17 price plus $10 shipping.  This Conk Trac-II razor handle is a very crude design, inferior to my 25 year old Schick brand handle.  As I explain later, this Conk handle has some appeal, as an example of industrial design gone wrong... a very attractive form, but terribly awkward function.    To hold the plastic razor cartridge, this Conk handle has a slightly oversized, solid, cast metal rail, instead of a correctly sized, formed sheet metal rail, with detent spring, as on my old Schick handle.  The Conk&#x27;s solid rail makes it more difficult to rinse the installed cartridge, in contrast to the old open rail design.  Additionally, the Conk&#x27;s oversized rail makes installing and removing the razor cartridge rather difficult.  It&#x27;s a very tight fit, and requires a great deal of force.  Unlike the old design, there is a small but significant chance of accidentally cutting oneself on the blades, or by breaking either the plastic cartridge or its plastic carry case.  The Conk&#x27;s polished chrome handle looks nice, but makes shaving difficult.  When wet, the Conk&#x27;s handle is very slippery.  I will probably cover that shiny Conk handle with friction tape, which will look ugly but make this Conk handle more usable.  And there&#x27;s another reason for friction tape.  The Conk&#x27;s heavy, curved handle gives it the amazing inclination to slide off the counter, and into the sink, or onto the floor.  I thought I was simply tired and clumsy one morning, but no, my old Schick will stay wherever I put it, because it has an ugly plastic handle, straight as a ruler, and covered with ridges, for a secure grip.  This Conk handle needs a special resting place, or it will run off!  There is something about the vaguely parabolic curve of the Conk handle, combined with the heavy teardrop end, that makes this Conk handle slide off the place that I usually rest my razor.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Where the Schick handle will rest, all day long, the Conk will stay put for ten or twenty seconds, and then slowly start to slide, wobble, and then hop across the counter.  The obvious fix, of course, is to park this Conk handle in a different place.  It&#x27;s just some very strange and entertaining behavior, for an inanimate object.  I am saving this Conk handle as an example of industrial design, gone wrong.  It&#x27;s very attractive and appealing to the eye, but in the hand, feels awkward and clumsy.    Why did I purchase this Conk?  My 25 year old Schick handle is wearing out.  The detent spring is growing weaker, and might break off altogether. Trac-II razor handles are no longer available in brick and mortar retailers, although retailers still stock the plastic razor cartridges.    Anyone know where genuine Schick and Gillette handles are still sold?  Everyone, including those \\&quot;walkin&#x27; walmartians\\&quot; told me to \\&quot;...try the local, mom and pop stores, that keep the leftovers, of the obsolete stuff.\\&quot;  Perhaps, there is still a place for Mom and Pop retailers, despite Walmart!</li>
            <li> It seems a little short. Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor handle for my husband to replace his years old plastic   Trac 2 handle.  It looked beautiful, but I see he has wrapped it with tape,and says the handle is too slippery when he shaves, and the tape is his solution. Sorry.</li>
            <li> well balanced handle great to use for a close, comfortable shave, (my second one for back-up travel) You will enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  It is much better than the original hollow Gillette product.  This is solid and there is no flex.  The blade is exactly where you expect it to be and that never changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a long time, the chrome is timeless&lt;br /&gt;and the tracks slide nicely over it... even using the same box it came in,&lt;br /&gt;the plastic box lid, black foam mold that it sits in. Going on 5 years now.</li>
            <li> This is a nice handle for anyone like me who prefers the simpler and less expensive trac2 cartridges. It should definitely las a long time and is sturdy metal construction. My only minor complaint is the same as others, it&#x27;s slippery when wet so could use a rubber grip or something. Still well worth the price for the money saved on expensive 4 and 5 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor - just what I was looking for.  I actually bought a razor from a different vendor on Amazon about 6 months, and looked for probably 45 minutes on the site before I selected it, only to have it arrive and be dissappointed.  This razor, however, I found within 5 minutes on the site and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second so I have a back up in case I leave this in a hotel room somewhere by mistake.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Looks nice and is hefty enough, making it seem better than the usual plastic stuff.  However, the body of the handle is tapered and very slim, making the grip between thumb and forefinger uncomfortable and slippy. The results are reduced and uneven control that can be a nuisance (nicks and cuts). If I had seen this item in person rather than just a picture, I would have thought twice about purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find handles for Trac II type blades in stores and found this on Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I spent the money on this; it&#x27;s like shaving with a work of art - heavy and very attractive. I find shaving much easier with non-swivelling blades and haven&#x27;t cut myself since I went back.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it although he had to get used to the counter weight of the bulbous handle.  He recommends it too.</li>
            <li> The Colonel Ichabod Conk Double Track Razor #226 is a great looking razor, but I shave in the shower and quickly learned that this razor, shaving cream and water don&#x27;t mix.  My hand kept sliding from the bottom of the handle up to the end of the handle next to the blade.  You have to constantly wash off the handle in order to not have your hand slip with each shave.  A non tapered handle would allow for a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great looking razor which is more art than function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> the only thing it is missing is a swivel head. but beyond that nicely balanced and a nice chrome finsih</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, to replace a 20 year old one which got lost in a hospital. He says this one works fine with his supply of blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp looking and does what it is supposed to.  What else can I say</li>
            <li> Nice weight...Trac II blades/cartridges fit perfectly....excellent product....great buy</li>
            <li> My friends, if you plan to use twin blade non-pivoting razors for a long time, this is the razor for you.  It is solid metal, has a nice properly balanced heavy feel to it..  This is something that will last you a lifetime, if you dont lose it.  Some chuckleheaded reviewer whined that it was slippery and had to wrap tape on it so he can hold it in the shower.  Not sure what his problem is, other than being a girly-man, cause this is NOT at all slippery or difficult to hold.  I shave in the shower, and I am able to hold onto this just fine..</li>
            <li> I finally bought this after the price dropped adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, however, I strongly worried it was going to be made out of plastic or some cheap form of crap. (Recently I&#x27;ve been getting ripped off on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a heavy, metal razor. Luckily, that&#x27;s what I received. It&#x27;s a little too shiny but that isn&#x27;t too bothersome as it matches with my other grooming tools.</li>
            <li> I have a handle just like this that I bought 30 years ago. Mine is &amp;#34;Made in W. Germany&amp;#34; and I can only imagine that this is a copy. I paid a lot more for mine. The Handle is very comfortable in the hand and I have NEVER had any problems attaching a blade. Mine does not use a spring either. I can use the Personna twin II blades up to a month.</li>
            <li> This razor looks good and has a nice heavy feel.  The shape and balance are a little awkward in use.  The quality of the workmanship is lacking.  It is very difficult to slide replacement blades on because of the size and rough finish of the part that holds the blades.  Once you do get the blade on it tends to slide from side to side while shaving.  I would not recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I would like to make clear that the seller is Good it is the actual product which is horrible. The blades will continue to fall out as you are shaving. Do not purchase this product PERIOD! The seller did everything as promised so feel comfortable with them but this specific product is GARBAGE. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this for some time - a period of months.  The first thing I noticed about it was that the handle just felt too bulky at the bulbous base where you grip it in your palm.  The other thing that was kind of bad is that it did not have those little &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; like my older atra brand razor did that held the cartridge in place.  It relied on &amp;#34;sliding friction&amp;#34; to keep it there.  Well, over time - perhaps as little as a few days use, the cartridge started slipping around on the head.  I wound up looking for a 1970s vintage original atra razor on a certain auction site and ordered that for nearly 40 bucks.  Pricey, but they are in short supply.  That would be my recommendation - it way superior.</li>
            <li> I wanted some thing that would hold a twin blade because the 4 or 5 blades out there are just too wide for a detailed shave.&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t want to throw away an entire shaver once a month, wasting a lot of plastic that the environment already doesn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Blades slide off way to easily.</li>
            <li> My husband has always loved this razor and owned two. Unfortunately our sons lost one and he was devastated! Thanks to Amazon he found a replacement!</li>
            <li> My old plastic Trac-II handle broke so I thought, what the heck, it&#x27;s Christmas, I&#x27;ll treat myself and I am glad I did cos this handle is nice to hold and gives a controlled clean shave. Go on....you deserve it!</li>
            <li> Impossible to find the special slide on blades that this requires at any local store. Also it takes a good amount of force to slide the old blade off and I worry about slicing my fingers in the process. Tossed it into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double blade that came with the handle has no glide surface and so grabs the skin and bunches it up. I used it once and then decided it was not worth the risk of cutting my face.</li>
            <li> I love this blade handle.  Unlike the original, this handle has room between the underside of the blade and the handle, which allows for easy rinsing.  Easy rinsing means a longer blade life.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item. Great value.</li>
            <li> I am using a bump fighter handle and bought this for a X-mas gift.  I wanted to give something a little nicer than what I use and found this handle lacking.  The welds holding the handle to the cart attachment were so rough the chrome plating didn&#x27;t stick.  Looked cheap and there was also a huge seam inside the cart attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have it my hands long enough to try shaving, it had a nice weight I just don&#x27;t know if I would like this bottom heavy handle. The cheap bump fighter seems better balanced.</li>
            <li> I love the way a 2 blade razor shaves but can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore. I found this on Amazon and purchased it immediately. I love it and use it every day. I will probably buy a second one as backup for when/if this one ever wears out.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great.  Item super</li>
            <li> I bought this because my original trac 2 razor broke from my tapping it on the side of the sink to clean the whiskers our of the blade.  This stainless steel razor has a great feel and it won&#x27;t break.  Now I just have to hide it from my wife.</li>
            <li> I got tired of fixing my wife&#x27;s old plastic handle, so I bought her one of these. There are no moving parts, so there&#x27;s nothing to fix. It&#x27;s similar to one she bought me 20 years ago. Same basic shape, just thinner and lighter. I prefer the heavier one, but she likes this one just fine. Only drawback: She says it&#x27;s so nice she doesn&#x27;t want to ding it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone complained that Trac II blades fit too tight, but I beg to differ. I hate it when blades slip off. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna happen with this one. Price seems high until you factor in how well it&#x27;s made and how long it&#x27;s apt to last. Then it seems downright cheap.</li>
            <li> This has the least expensive razors on the market.  You really can;t go wrong and save $20 to $40 per month.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Having bought my original Trac II handle back in the Mid 80&#x27;s  it preformed flawlessly all those years until one day I dropped it and the head cracked off. Damn. Tried to find the handle in every store I could think of, no luck. Found this on Amazon and with mostly positive reviews decided this was it. It&#x27;s a little shorter and no grooves for a good grip but it does the job. Good! Very Happy with this New replacement. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is a well built razor handle. More durable than the original. Mine had scratches on it out of the box. Other than that, it is a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice product that does the job, and is stylish at the same time; should last a lifetime!  The blades are much cheaper for this razor than the new ones Gillette makes.  More economical!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking razor and the inexpensive blades fit it.  It arrived promptly and matched perfectly to what it said it was....</li>
            <li> Exactly the razor I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive razor, but I have to give it only two stars for bad design.  There are no slots in the head to allow water to clean the blades from behind.  This causes them to clog up very quickly resulting in very poor shaves.  Constantly replacing the blades after minimal use is costly.</li>
            <li> I kinda got over the handle bad ergonomics after say ten shaves. The problem is finding the perfect blade to fit the product. I&#x27;ll dump a blade every few days. Doing so for me stops razor burn and razor bumps cold. I tend to buy the cheap bulk Personna blades from Ebay. I use maybe 200 blades a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is the blade must truly fit tight. And I mean tight. I like most men vigorously tap to clean the blade. Well the off brand blade tries to shimmy off every tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now maybe the original razors work flawlessly. But if your buying an outside brand watch out. Stay with the original blade. The original razor was on so tight I nearly cut myself taking it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moving on to a vintage chrome Gillette Atra handle. The one with the grappling hooks. I snapped up one for thirty.</li>
            <li> Your blades do not stay in place. The razor has a very small raised metal catch in the middle of the blade slide designed to hold the blade in place. It is to small and doesn&#x27;t resulting in the blade sliding during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weight and handle design is very good but if it won&#x27;t hold the blade it is useless.</li>
            <li> A nice, simple sturdy razor.  Just the sort of product we need the internet for.  Uses trac-2 cartridges, which are getting hard to find, but I think it gives as good a shave as anything on the market today.  And much cheaper.  It seems indestructibly.  Probably the last razor I will ever own.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Colonel Conk razor for a good part of my life.  After a while the metal where the blades attach gets pitted and starts looking not so nice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two razors that I purchased have a shorter handle than the older one&#x27;s I had.  So it makes it a 3 finger balancing act to hold the razor without dropping it. Its just not comfortable shaving like it used to be. It&#x27;s just a balancing act that you have to focus on not dropping the device rather then concentrating on getting a close clean shave. Others have mentioned that this razor is slippery and hard to hold on to, I am sure it&#x27;s due to the fact that they made the handle shorter. Add to this the new razor that I purchased last year is already pitting.  So after 35 or 40 years of shaving with this razor I decided it&#x27;s time for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colonel Conk lubricated blades are sharp and stay sharp, no question about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to the Wilkinson Tech 4 and am quite happy with it.  The razor has a nice long handle and is easy to hold on to and with the 4 blades provides a clean close...  Wilkinson also makes sharp blades and I also enjoy their quality.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase -- lost the first one when I left it at a hotel on a business trip.  Anyway, this second one doesn&#x27;t seem to grip the blades very well which when not somewhat annoying seems a bit hazardous.  Loved the first one and the heft and form are great. But if it won&#x27;t hold the blades securely then it&#x27;s more annoying and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> K.I.S.S.  - Keep it simple stupid - that what I say to these crazy engineers.  Seriously - step back and look at some of these crazy azz razors!  Bells and whistles on razors? Bling on razors?  Anything to get you to buy that crap.  People - There is nothing wrong with keeping things simple and highly functional!  Simple is making a comeback!</li>
            <li> best, most beautiful shaver ever! nice weight and and smooth handle. great experience</li>
            <li> I recommend the razor due to its heavy weight and no drag shaving.That is all I have top say. OK</li>
            <li> Had one for 20years lost it.So happy to found another one.Best ever</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the Track Razor on the shelves at the stores. But, in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best ever. The good shave does not depend on the slicky stuff lasting. The newer swivel tops hop skip and jump across your face while the blade may be good, but the slicky stuff is not. I love this razor.</li>
            <li> In my opinion;  Track II cartridges are not secure on head of handle.  I would not buy this razor handle.</li>
            <li> I love using this sleek razor, slick, quick and stylish!  I have one for home and in my travel kits.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Heavy and firm.</li>
            <li> Works great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Very stylish razor.  Takes a little getting use to as it slimmer than a Trac-II.  I need to hold it differently for the shave</li>
