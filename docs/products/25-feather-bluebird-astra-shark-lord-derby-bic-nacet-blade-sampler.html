            <li>/&gt;To date, my favorites in particular have been the Astra Superior Stainless and both kinds of Shark blades.</li>

            <li>Lord Super Chrome&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette 7 O’Clock Super Stainless&lt;br</li>
            <li>My goal is to have found a balde that I particularly like the most.</li>
            <li>As somebody who recently went to using a safety razor, I wanted to try out different blades to find which one worked best with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pack has a great selection of the most likely candidates for lots of different kinds of beards.</li>
            <li>Everyone’s beard grows at different thicknesses and the hairs have their own unique direction and pattern of growth based on the distribution of hair follicles.  </li>
            <li>This contains the most popular and most common type blades out there.</li>
            <li>, some blades are pretty low quality, but it is still cool to get a good mix, maybe they will work for you.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get this if you are really new to DE shaving, because you probably are not going to be able to tell the difference.  </li>

            <li>Have already had some that I will not purchase, and a few others that are just great.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice pack of safety razor blades from various manufacturers from around the world.  </li>
            <li>Astra Superior Stainless Double Edge</li>
            <li>;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Superior, Vidyut SuperMax, Gillette Goal Stainless, Gillette Silver Blue, Lord Platinum,</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Ideal for someone starting out or anew in the double edge shaving world.  </li>
            <li>So far my favorite is BIC.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32 year old man who has yet to hit puberty, so I&#x27;m a twice a week shaver, at most.  </li>
            <li>I feel it gets close enough to provide a smooth shave, but I feel like it requires more passes, and with each pass you up your risk of nicks and irritation.  </li>
            <li>* ;&lt;br /&gt;Astra, Trig Silver Edge, Bic, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock, Astra Superior Stainless, NACET Platinum, Gillette Nacet Stainless, Super Max Platinum, Shark, Shark Super Platinum, Lord Super Chrome, Big Ben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research, and this was the best buy with the most real variety I could find (i.e. not just seven versions of the same brand, but lots of different brands, and pretty much all the really well-loved brands</li>
            <li>It has all of the major brands that are still widely available and a couple of discontinued brands that are mostly available.</li>
            <li>Good Sharp</li>
            <li>Do you watch the Price is Right?  </li>
            <li>Treet Platinum Super Stainless Blade&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super Stainless Blades&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shark Super Stainless</li>
            <li>On second blade test, had too many nicks on 1st shave.  </li>
            <li>Several top contenders that I would use in place of the 5*&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>option is as exactly as described</li>
            <li>No negatives, got exactly what I bought.</li>
            <li>I suggest you do not start with the feather if this is your first time shaving with this type of blade.  </li>
            <li>three shaves out of my first blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During my shower I let my badger hair brush soak in hot water.  </li>
            <li>The selection is pretty good, there are a few dogs in there</li>
            <li>Personally the chrome type blades seem to be the smoothest and hold their edge better.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>so you can learn with a consistent sharpness and edge.</li>
            <li>I started with these blades and now have to go back and buy more of the first four</li>
            <li>There are so many double edge blades to try out, it appears as advertised and while I already don&#x27;t like two of the blades, the bundle has served it&#x27;s function well!</li>
            <li>In my case, I found the blade I liked fairly quickly after using a few blades, and was so convinced that I bought 100 of them.  </li>
            <li>(helpful web sites said to start with the Derby because it&#x27;s not as sharp, then go from there, getting progressively sharper), but I feel confident he&#x27;ll find the right one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the whole point of getting the multi-pack.</li>
            <li>Trig Silver Edge Stainless Steel Blade&lt;br</li>
            <li>much pulling/razor burn/bleeding</li>
            <li>A whole bunch of blades here.</li>
            <li>Still trying them Really like that</li>
            <li>I was expecting a combination pack that had at least two samples of each kind of blade, but there were only doubles for the Lord blades, which I find to be of inferior quality compared to many others.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic inexpensive pack to test and try different brands to find what you want.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize blades could differ so much.  </li>
            <li>but I think I got more duplicates than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Got this for the husband to start using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted, the ability to try out new blades.  </li>
            <li>This blade pack is replacing the 10-pack that originally came with my Merkur razor (probably standard Merkur stainless blades).  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll ofte see recommendations for those using a double-edge safety razor to experiment with different blands and types of blades (stainless, platinum, super chrome).</li>
            <li>I am very new to shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>When I finally find the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll buy in larger volumes to bring the price per blade to a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>face;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in daily with full thickness on face and neck.</li>
            <li>Good value for trying out different blades if your new starting safety razor shaves or just trying different brands before buying bulk.</li>
            <li>Like the Shark Chromes and Astras, in particular.</li>
            <li>Decent shave to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>o Decent 1st shave.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend waiting on a sampler until you&#x27;re a decent shaver.</li>
            <li>A very good assortment from sharpest to least sharp blades.</li>
            <li>, I highly suggest you do so.  </li>
            <li>All of the blades are in pristine condition, and high quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes in a little zip lock type baggie, with the names of razors and which countries they were made in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one feather razor - which you will love.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Silver Blue is super sharp yet smooth.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the $15, especially if you&#x27;re just started using a safety razor.</li>
            <li>For anyone new to DE shaving, or someone trying to find their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; go to blade, I&#x27;d highly recommend a blade sample pack like this one.</li>
            <li>This is the only way to go to determine the right blade for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently some blades work better for different beard types and work differently in different razors.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to go with a new safety razor as he figures out how to do it.</li>
            <li>you’re new to using a safety razor and debating whether to purchase a collection of blades like this</li>
            <li>This is a must have for those that are new to Safety Razor Shaving.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Safety Razors, and this blade sampler was terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If like me, you are new to using the safety razor</li>
            <li>Great for a gift, or if you want to find a replacement/backup in case your particular brand is hard to find or more expensive.</li>
            <li>With this sampler pack I have found quite a few that don&#x27;t work for me and a few that are great for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Came in a small ziplock type bag with many types.</li>
            <li>Overall, blade Pretty Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feather ended up being the one I ordered more off since ol&#x27; iron beard here would dull the others in a shave or two.</li>
            <li>o Dull Shave with many cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This selection is the more commonly used brands.</li>
            <li>Shave Soap, Sensitive</li>
            <li>Pros, lots of variety, some very god blades especially for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>25 of the most common DE blades out there.</li>
            <li>So far my favorites have been the Astra Platinum and the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Every beard is different, and the only way to find the right razor blade is through trial and error.</li>
            <li>I selected this particular set for the wide selection paired with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set with its vast selection of blades.</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler pack when I first started wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Some blades are sharper then others and that is why a new safety razor shaver needs to try an assortment to see how different blades work with your skin type.</li>
            <li>Put them in different razors and conditions (such as with soap, shaving cream, or combination soap/cream, with and without preshave oil) to really understand how each one of them performs and their pros/</li>
            <li>then Decent with minor nicks to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how the various blades/manufacturers quality varied.  </li>
            <li>So far (06MAR2015 at the moment), I&#x27;ve only gotten</li>
            <li>- Like I said earlier, I have 3 shaves so far with this blade.</li>
            <li>A few of these weren&#x27;t worth buying again</li>
            <li>This is my first safety razor and these 10 blades lasted over a year and are the only blades I have experience with, so everything will be compared to these as well as previous blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really comes down to just trying them and seeing what works for your skin/hair type.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to test with waters with different blade types, without having to purchase larger quantities and having a bad experience for several weeks.</li>
            <li>I found that as a person new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>The blades average out to close to $0.65 / blade, which is a bit more than 3 times the price of the average hundred pack of blades (per blade average is $0.15 in a 100 pack).</li>
            <li>some of the samples are really low quality, but it&#x27;s a sampler, and it really did have a little bit of everything.</li>
            <li>Whether you’re new to using a safety razor or just starting and would like to explore the quality of other blades out there, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>There really is a difference between a lot of them, and there&#x27;s enough that it&#x27;ll last you a little while</li>
            <li>Nothing stands out as remarkably good or remarkably bad.</li>

            <li> Lord Super Chrome&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette 7 O’Clock Super Stainless&lt;br</li>
            <li> My goal is to have found a balde that I particularly like the most.</li>
            <li> As somebody who recently went to using a safety razor, I wanted to try out different blades to find which one worked best with my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pack has a great selection of the most likely candidates for lots of different kinds of beards.</li>
            <li> Everyone’s beard grows at different thicknesses and the hairs have their own unique direction and pattern of growth based on the distribution of hair follicles.  </li>

            <li> ;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Superior, Vidyut SuperMax, Gillette Goal Stainless, Gillette Silver Blue, Lord Platinum,</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ideal for someone starting out or anew in the double edge shaving world.  </li>
            <li> So far my favorite is BIC.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old man who has yet to hit puberty, so I&#x27;m a twice a week shaver, at most.  </li>
            <li> I feel it gets close enough to provide a smooth shave, but I feel like it requires more passes, and with each pass you up your risk of nicks and irritation.  </li>
            <li> * ;&lt;br /&gt;Astra, Trig Silver Edge, Bic, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock, Astra Superior Stainless, NACET Platinum, Gillette Nacet Stainless, Super Max Platinum, Shark, Shark Super Platinum, Lord Super Chrome, Big Ben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research, and this was the best buy with the most real variety I could find (i.e. not just seven versions of the same brand, but lots of different brands, and pretty much all the really well-loved brands</li>
            <li> It has all of the major brands that are still widely available and a couple of discontinued brands that are mostly available.</li>
            <li> Good Sharp</li>
            <li> Do you watch the Price is Right?  </li>
            <li> Treet Platinum Super Stainless Blade&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super Stainless Blades&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shark Super Stainless</li>
            <li> On second blade test, had too many nicks on 1st shave.  </li>
            <li> Several top contenders that I would use in place of the 5*&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> option is as exactly as described</li>
            <li> No negatives, got exactly what I bought.</li>
            <li> I suggest you do not start with the feather if this is your first time shaving with this type of blade.  </li>
            <li> three shaves out of my first blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> During my shower I let my badger hair brush soak in hot water.  </li>
            <li> The selection is pretty good, there are a few dogs in there</li>
            <li> Personally the chrome type blades seem to be the smoothest and hold their edge better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> so you can learn with a consistent sharpness and edge.</li>
            <li> I started with these blades and now have to go back and buy more of the first four</li>
            <li> There are so many double edge blades to try out, it appears as advertised and while I already don&#x27;t like two of the blades, the bundle has served it&#x27;s function well!</li>
            <li> In my case, I found the blade I liked fairly quickly after using a few blades, and was so convinced that I bought 100 of them.  </li>
            <li> (helpful web sites said to start with the Derby because it&#x27;s not as sharp, then go from there, getting progressively sharper), but I feel confident he&#x27;ll find the right one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the whole point of getting the multi-pack.</li>
            <li> Trig Silver Edge Stainless Steel Blade&lt;br</li>
            <li> much pulling/razor burn/bleeding</li>
            <li> A whole bunch of blades here.</li>
            <li> Still trying them Really like that</li>
            <li> I was expecting a combination pack that had at least two samples of each kind of blade, but there were only doubles for the Lord blades, which I find to be of inferior quality compared to many others.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic inexpensive pack to test and try different brands to find what you want.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize blades could differ so much.  </li>
            <li> but I think I got more duplicates than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Got this for the husband to start using a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted, the ability to try out new blades.  </li>
            <li> This blade pack is replacing the 10-pack that originally came with my Merkur razor (probably standard Merkur stainless blades).  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll ofte see recommendations for those using a double-edge safety razor to experiment with different blands and types of blades (stainless, platinum, super chrome).</li>
            <li> I am very new to shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> When I finally find the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll buy in larger volumes to bring the price per blade to a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> face;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in daily with full thickness on face and neck.</li>
            <li> Good value for trying out different blades if your new starting safety razor shaves or just trying different brands before buying bulk.</li>
            <li> Like the Shark Chromes and Astras, in particular.</li>
            <li> Decent shave to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> o Decent 1st shave.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend waiting on a sampler until you&#x27;re a decent shaver.</li>
            <li> A very good assortment from sharpest to least sharp blades.</li>
            <li> , I highly suggest you do so.  </li>
            <li> All of the blades are in pristine condition, and high quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes in a little zip lock type baggie, with the names of razors and which countries they were made in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one feather razor - which you will love.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Silver Blue is super sharp yet smooth.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the $15, especially if you&#x27;re just started using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> For anyone new to DE shaving, or someone trying to find their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; go to blade, I&#x27;d highly recommend a blade sample pack like this one.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to go to determine the right blade for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently some blades work better for different beard types and work differently in different razors.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to go with a new safety razor as he figures out how to do it.</li>
            <li> you’re new to using a safety razor and debating whether to purchase a collection of blades like this</li>
            <li> This is a must have for those that are new to Safety Razor Shaving.  </li>
            <li> I am new to Safety Razors, and this blade sampler was terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If like me, you are new to using the safety razor</li>
            <li> Great for a gift, or if you want to find a replacement/backup in case your particular brand is hard to find or more expensive.</li>
            <li> With this sampler pack I have found quite a few that don&#x27;t work for me and a few that are great for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Came in a small ziplock type bag with many types.</li>
            <li> Overall, blade Pretty Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basic 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feather ended up being the one I ordered more off since ol&#x27; iron beard here would dull the others in a shave or two.</li>
            <li> o Dull Shave with many cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This selection is the more commonly used brands.</li>
            <li> Shave Soap, Sensitive</li>
            <li> Pros, lots of variety, some very god blades especially for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> 25 of the most common DE blades out there.</li>
            <li> So far my favorites have been the Astra Platinum and the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Every beard is different, and the only way to find the right razor blade is through trial and error.</li>
            <li> I selected this particular set for the wide selection paired with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set with its vast selection of blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack when I first started wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Some blades are sharper then others and that is why a new safety razor shaver needs to try an assortment to see how different blades work with your skin type.</li>
            <li> Put them in different razors and conditions (such as with soap, shaving cream, or combination soap/cream, with and without preshave oil) to really understand how each one of them performs and their pros/</li>
            <li> then Decent with minor nicks to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how the various blades/manufacturers quality varied.  </li>
            <li> So far (06MAR2015 at the moment), I&#x27;ve only gotten</li>
            <li> - Like I said earlier, I have 3 shaves so far with this blade.</li>
            <li> A few of these weren&#x27;t worth buying again</li>
            <li> This is my first safety razor and these 10 blades lasted over a year and are the only blades I have experience with, so everything will be compared to these as well as previous blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really comes down to just trying them and seeing what works for your skin/hair type.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to test with waters with different blade types, without having to purchase larger quantities and having a bad experience for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I found that as a person new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> The blades average out to close to $0.65 / blade, which is a bit more than 3 times the price of the average hundred pack of blades (per blade average is $0.15 in a 100 pack).</li>
            <li> some of the samples are really low quality, but it&#x27;s a sampler, and it really did have a little bit of everything.</li>
            <li> Whether you’re new to using a safety razor or just starting and would like to explore the quality of other blades out there, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> There really is a difference between a lot of them, and there&#x27;s enough that it&#x27;ll last you a little while</li>
            <li> Nothing stands out as remarkably good or remarkably bad.</li>
            <li> Has a high variety of blades so you can try a little bit of everything from different parts of the world to see what works for you before you commit yourself to a pack of blades that might not work for you.</li>
            <li> Are you familiar with the 3 Strikes game?  </li>
            <li> For a few minutes towards the end of my shower I hold a hot, wet rag against my cheeks, chin, jaw, and neck.  </li>
            <li> There are a few that are just junk, but the rest are decent.  </li>
            <li> So far this has helped me narrow my final choice to 2-3 different brands.</li>
            <li> It looks like 25 blades is going to last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> So far have used about half.</li>
            <li> Btw I&#x27;m white with dark coarse thing beard type</li>
            <li> some blades last longer than others before they start to drag.</li>
            <li> Minor nicks.  </li>
            <li> o Minor Cuts.  </li>
            <li> Minor nicks.  </li>
            <li> then noticed that the door adjustment was very loose likely  causing the problem.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive than buying just 1 brand</li>
            <li> Its worth keeping a brief log of how long each lasted and what sort of difficultly you experience in using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, more like 48 hour shadows, and even then it&#x27;s a pretty pathetic shadow considering my facial hair</li>
            <li> you’ve just purchased your first safety razor and it came with a sample set of blades, you might find you’re getting a poor quality cut with them.  </li>
            <li> Of course this is missing a bunch others, such as the Merker, Personnas, and a lot of other Gillette series such as the 7 o clock.</li>
            <li> After rating each blade on a score sheet, I bought a pack of 100 Blue Birds for less than $20.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are shipped individually wrapped inside a tightly folded plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> I searched around the net for info on a lot of these blades and found some for a little help.</li>
            <li> So I definitely recommend keeping a little log or review notes on each of the blades you used.</li>
            <li> If you are getting into wet shaving this is a must try.</li>
            <li> o Way too rough on 1st shave and throughout.  </li>
            <li> * - Average, may have minor issues with pulling/razor burn/bleeding/inconsistent cut towards the end of the week</li>
            <li> Not much to discuss or complain about.  </li>
            <li> I started shaving with just a few Gillette and Lord razors because I&#x27;ve never thought to get a sampler to try out all my different options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to get a few to several shaves out of one blade to get an idea of what I like and dislike about it.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t waste the extra money just to try some other names out.</li>
            <li> It allows me to try the different brands without getting a lot of waste!</li>
            <li> o Sharp.  </li>
            <li> Use a couple of others before moving onto the Feather blade (IT IS SHARP)</li>
            <li> Messed up my face with those, but I&#x27;m convinced it was due to my technique rather than the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> I know I won&#x27;t use, like the feather, because I know its going to be too sharp for my skin.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s already gone through a couple less sharp ones he doesn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the doubles of a couple blades.</li>
            <li> For me, hands down, the Lord Classics</li>
            <li> wish they would just bring the price down a bit and get rid of the dogs in the selection.</li>
            <li> Astra&#x27;s are very sharp and affordable.</li>
            <li> Used about half.</li>
            <li> * - Bad, couldn&#x27;t use for a full week before having to change the blade</li>
            <li> My point is that with 25 blades, this review will seriously take me at least a year to complete.  </li>
            <li> I put together a few notes on each blade as I used each one.  </li>
            <li> You will want to have been shaving for a few months.</li>
            <li> Not a razor enthusiast, so I&#x27;m not comfortable giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> After looking at all of the blade options out there, I was not sure which brand and type to purchase.</li>
            <li> As you would probably expect, most of these blades are horrible.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works comparably, if not better than Gillette cartridges.</li>
            <li> It has fewer choices than some other packs, but it&#x27;s also a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone has their preference and blades are made for different face shapes and such, but some of these are very dull and bad.</li>
            <li> I really hated the bic and all the super max blades.</li>
            <li> Too Dull.  </li>
            <li> o Dull Garbage</li>
            <li> Hard not to find some blades that will work for you.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed differences in cutting performance.</li>
            <li> This is quite common.  </li>
            <li> what this is though, it is a little on the expensive side, but not grossly overpriced so its not too bad.</li>
            <li> For example, it comes with 3 different types of Gillette blades, all bad.</li>
            <li> Very, Very Dull.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with this game, there are 8 discs inside a bag that contestants reach in blindly and pick at random.  </li>
            <li> The sample blades that come with some razors are usually poor quality.  </li>
            <li> - The one, only, the worst to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this sampler.  </li>
            <li> Almost every other blade in this pack just pulls my hair as I shave and is very painful to use.</li>
            <li> But I guess it did the job it was supposed to do (although very expensively) and</li>
            <li> Don’t be disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great sampler pack. Like the Shark Chromes and Astras, in particular.</li>
            <li> This has a multiple array of blades. I like having the ability to find out which one i want.</li>
            <li> Good value for trying out different blades if your new starting safety razor shaves or just trying different brands before buying bulk. This selection is the more commonly used brands.</li>
            <li> a great sampler for its price.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea for a guy just starting with DE shaving. It&#x27;s a good price for a decent starter pack, but it did not come as advertised. Came with only 24 blades, but oh well.</li>
            <li> A very good assortment from sharpest to least sharp blades. Great for newcomers to DE shving.</li>
            <li> great sampler pack. I definitely noticed differences in cutting performance. some blades last longer than others before they start to drag. Im glad I got this rather than give to my temptation of getting huge bulk packs of the same blade.</li>
            <li> Take the time to test different razors and find the best one for you.  This pack had a good variety.  If you are new to safety razors, a pack like this is the best way to find out which brand is going to be the best for your skin and hair combination.</li>
            <li> Came in a small ziplock type bag with many types. Great variety! Great way to see what brands are perfect for you</li>
            <li> Just a hand full of blades where good the rest where junk....</li>
            <li> Each blade is individually wrapped. It&#x27;s a great way to try many different blades to pick the brand that works best for you.</li>
            <li> Great sample pack with a great variety!</li>
            <li> Came with a TON of different blades.  I was able to find a blade that really worked for me.  If you are getting into wet shaving this is a must try.</li>
            <li> Good pack to try out the different blades.  It allows me to try the different brands without getting a lot of waste!</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the doubles of a couple blades. Why not 25 individual blades in this assortment? I searched around the net for info on a lot of these blades and found some for a little help. Some blades are sharper then others and that is why a new safety razor shaver needs to try an assortment to see how different blades work with your skin type. I&#x27;m new to double edge safety razor shaving and this assortment is ideal for trying out a variety of blades. I highly recommend this set with its vast selection of blades.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get started! I have thoroughly enjoyed making my way through the blades. Each is different. Almost done. Get this!</li>
            <li> I am very new to shaving with a safety razor. After looking at all of the blade options out there, I was not sure which brand and type to purchase. This sampler pack has been perfect for me. There have been blades that I threw away after just one use - but others that lasted a week. Now I know which brand and label to purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of blades.  I bought these when I got my first safety razor, and this provides a good sampling of the available blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, though, I haven&#x27;t yet found a huge difference in the quality or shave from these various manufacturers.  Nothing stands out as remarkably good or remarkably bad.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to go with a new safety razor as he figures out how to do it. I did a ton of research, and this was the best buy with the most real variety I could find (i.e. not just seven versions of the same brand, but lots of different brands, and pretty much all the really well-loved brands I wanted him to be able to try). He&#x27;s already gone through a couple less sharp ones he doesn&#x27;t like (helpful web sites said to start with the Derby because it&#x27;s not as sharp, then go from there, getting progressively sharper), but I feel confident he&#x27;ll find the right one. That&#x27;s the whole point of getting the multi-pack. Every beard is different, and the only way to find the right razor blade is through trial and error. This pack has a great selection of the most likely candidates for lots of different kinds of beards. It has fewer choices than some other packs, but it&#x27;s also a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack when I first started wet shaving. It is a fantastic sampler with plenty of brands to give a go. Isn&#x27;t too expensive but there are better deals elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Everyone should get one of these.  It has all of the major brands that are still widely available and a couple of discontinued brands that are mostly available.</li>
            <li> I found that as a person new to wet shaving I needed a variety of blades to see what worked for me.  With this sampler pack I have found quite a few that don&#x27;t work for me and a few that are great for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very helpful to newbies like me.</li>
            <li> I just started using a safety razor and had no idea what to get for blades, I&#x27;ve heard and read the forums about feather, astra, derby, etc. and it really comes down to just trying them and seeing what works for your skin/hair type. So far this has helped me narrow my final choice to 2-3 different brands. It is a little more expensive than buying just 1 brand but it can save you from buying and wasting blades. Overall this is a good assortment of the more popular brands.</li>
            <li> I like the assortment offered for these. Some good ones, some others I have never heard of. Feather ended up being the one I ordered more off since ol&#x27; iron beard here would dull the others in a shave or two.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice pack of safety razor blades from various manufacturers from around the world.  Whether you’re new to using a safety razor or just starting and would like to explore the quality of other blades out there, this is the way to go.  I’d also suggest this particular pack because it includes the popular and coveted Japanese Feather blade, which is known for its exceptional sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re new to using a safety razor and debating whether to purchase a collection of blades like this, I highly suggest you do so.  Everyone’s beard grows at different thicknesses and the hairs have their own unique direction and pattern of growth based on the distribution of hair follicles.  Also, everyone’s skin has its unique sensitivity.  For this reason, the blade you choose is critical to giving you a shave that works best for you.  While one person may say one blade works best for them, you may find that blade is too aggressive for your face.  It’s through trying many different blades that you’ll discover which works best for your beard and face.  This sample pack will help you do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve just purchased your first safety razor and it came with a sample set of blades, you might find you’re getting a poor quality cut with them.  Don’t be disappointed.  This is quite common.  The sample blades that come with some razors are usually poor quality.  Buy this pack, or another that has the blades you’d like to try, and enjoy the process of discovering what works best for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice sample pack. I never thought there&#x27;d be so many differences in DE blades! For anyone new to DE shaving, or someone trying to find their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; go to blade, I&#x27;d highly recommend a blade sample pack like this one. I selected this particular set for the wide selection paired with a reasonable price. When I finally find the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll buy in larger volumes to bring the price per blade to a more reasonable price. Very nice selection :)</li>
            <li> I put together a few notes on each blade as I used each one.  Notes follow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) • Super-Max Platinum&lt;br /&gt;  o No cuts 1st shave.  No cuts all the way to end.  Excellent Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) • Big Ben&lt;br /&gt;  o Perfect 1st Shave!  Multi-Pass Style Shave, No Nicks all the way to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) • Lord Super Chrome&lt;br /&gt;  o Very Good Forgiving Shave Beginning To End&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) • Nacet Platinum&lt;br /&gt;  o Forgiving Shave – Multi-Stroke Style Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Lord Platinum Class&lt;br /&gt;  o Comfortable 1st shave.  Minor nicks.  Good to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Astra Superior Stainless Double Edge&lt;br /&gt;  o Good Sharp Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Feather&lt;br /&gt;  o Too Dull.  Too many passes.  Forgiving shave however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Trig Silver Edge Stainless Steel Blade&lt;br /&gt;  o Comfortable 1st shave with a couple of nicks.  Decent shave to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Derby Extra&lt;br /&gt;  o Perfect 1st shave and then Decent with minor nicks to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;• Lord Platinum Class&lt;br /&gt;  o On second blade test, had too many nicks on 1st shave.  Just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Astra Superior Platinum&lt;br /&gt;  o Minor Cuts.  Not Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Treet Platinum Super Stainless Blade&lt;br /&gt;  o Dull Shave with many cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Gillette Silver Blue&lt;br /&gt;  o Decent 1st shave.  Minor nicks.  Overall OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Blue Bird&lt;br /&gt;  o Sharp.  Cuts from 1st shave to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Gillette 7 O’Clock Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;  o May have done invalid test as I got lots of cuts on the 1st shave and then noticed that the door adjustment was very loose likely  causing the problem.  Overall, blade Pretty Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;• Crown – Super Stainless Blades&lt;br /&gt;  o Way too rough on 1st shave and throughout.  Junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Gillette Goal Stainless&lt;br /&gt;  o Very, Very Dull.  Junk…..  Note, I am using this in a standard razor and this blade was distributed ina sample pack for standard razors.  However, I did notice that the inside rapper did have a statement indicating “Use with Gillette Goal razor for best results”.  Maybe the measurements are slightly different in that razor, but if that is the case, then the outside of the packaging should indicate that the blade is ONLY for that razor handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  Vidyut Super-Max – Stainless&lt;br /&gt;  o Dull Garbage</li>

Keep in mind everyone&#x27;s face is different and will react differently to the blade and the shave soap/cream you&#x27;re using. This is well worth the $15, especially if you&#x27;re just started using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Really good sample pack, most are pretty good some for me I only used once a never again. I personally liked the feather blades the best. I also really liked the Astra, any of the Lordes, asco, and mostly all of the gillette brand blades. I really hated the bic and all the super max blades. The treet blades are okay also. Anyways great sampler. Btw I&#x27;m white with dark coarse thing beard type</li>
            <li> lots of options, exactly as described, great for finding which blades you like best and starting off with this kind of razor</li>
            <li> A whole bunch of blades here. You are bound to find what works for your face. For me, hands down, the Lord Classics</li>
            <li> Good mix worth it if you are looking to try new blades.</li>
            <li> Pros, lots of variety, some very god blades especially for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, some blades are pretty low quality, but it is still cool to get a good mix, maybe they will work for you.</li>
            <li> Great for a starter pack to narrow your field of choices.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to go to determine the right blade for your skin.  Nice assortment of blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Not much to discuss or complain about.  It&#x27;s a pack of razors....and it&#x27;s great......and.....it helps you decide which razors to buy in the future.  So yea.  There ya go....</li>
            <li> This is a great razor blade sampler I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a safety/double-edged razor for about two years. I started shaving with just a few Gillette and Lord razors because I&#x27;ve never thought to get a sampler to try out all my different options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This option is as exactly as described and it&#x27;s a great option if you are just starting out, or want to change your blades up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best option for your money. These are all the best blades in the business, and for $15 this is a steal. After this, I found that I like the Derby&#x27;s and bought a big lot of those. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping... very nice assortment.</li>
            <li> on time, as described.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted, the ability to try out new blades.  Still haven&#x27;t found the one for me, but that&#x27;s only a matter of time.</li>
            <li> This is a great set to help you find the right razor for you, in an ideal world there would be 2 of each blade so that you could tell if one blade was a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34;. Biggest draw back is that it is WAY over-priced.</li>
            <li> A great way to find the right blades for your face.  25 of the most common DE blades out there. Good value</li>
            <li> Good way to find the correct razor for your face</li>
            <li> No negatives, got exactly what I bought.</li>
            <li> All blades are not alike, and so I found is true for Safety Razors as well. Set off with two different razors and a dozen different brands of blades.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good starting place to find a match between what two match up well and additionally, what suits your perticular skin type and hair growth. Its worth keeping a brief log of how long each lasted and what sort of difficultly you experience in using them.&lt;br /&gt;I just used a &amp;#34;white board&amp;#34; marker on my bath room mirror. A few of these weren&#x27;t worth buying again and I&#x27;m gald I found out, which ones to avoid without having to buy a dozen!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for those that are new to Safety Razor Shaving.  I tried all of them out and narrowed it to Derbys and Astra and Feathers.  Everyone skin is going to react differently to different razors.  Buy one pack of this sampler and you will see which one you love before spending money on 25,50 or 100 pack.</li>
            <li> Great selection. All individually wrapped with the name on the paper and the blade itself. I use it to shave my legs and found the  Bluebird to be the best shave. No razor burn, nicks, or pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> Ideal for someone starting out or anew in the double edge shaving world.  I bought the cheapest razor ($3-$4), and this sampler pack.  After using all the blades, I found that the blue bird worked best with my razor and my face/skin conditions.  I was surprised at how the various blades/manufacturers quality varied.  After rating each blade on a score sheet, I bought a pack of 100 Blue Birds for less than $20.</li>
            <li> some of the samples are really low quality, but it&#x27;s a sampler, and it really did have a little bit of everything.</li>
            <li> Arrived next day. I just started using a safety razor. It allows me to find the best razor for me.</li>
            <li> Still trying out different blades. There are noticeable differences and you just have to try them out to see which ones you like the best.</li>
            <li> Great selection of razor blades from around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a little zip lock type baggie, with the names of razors and which countries they were made in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one feather razor - which you will love.  I suggest you do not start with the feather if this is your first time shaving with this type of blade.  Use a couple of others before moving onto the Feather blade (IT IS SHARP)</li>
            <li> Bought it couple months ago. Still trying them Really like that I moved to double edge shaving. So far my favorite is BIC. Keep testing</li>
            <li> Great Variety of blades!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a combination pack that had at least two samples of each kind of blade, but there were only doubles for the Lord blades, which I find to be of inferior quality compared to many others.  Look somewhere else with a more comprehensive product description if you are looking for a blade sampler.</li>
            <li> As you would probably expect, most of these blades are horrible. I know that everyone has their preference and blades are made for different face shapes and such, but some of these are very dull and bad. For example, it comes with 3 different types of Gillette blades, all bad. So far my favorites have been the Astra Platinum and the Feather blades. Almost every other blade in this pack just pulls my hair as I shave and is very painful to use. But I guess it did the job it was supposed to do (although very expensively) and now I know which blades I like and will use from now on.</li>
            <li> Hard not to find some blades that will work for you. I&#x27;ve selected  the Gillette Goal as a good everyday blade (great for quick shave, forgiving). The Gillette Silver Blue is super sharp yet smooth. Astra&#x27;s are very sharp and affordable.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know. Since I&#x27;ve started using a double-edge safety razor, I haven&#x27;t been able to decide which blade works best. Out of this sampler pack, I&#x27;ve yet to find one that I don&#x27;t like. It looks like 25 blades is going to last a long time, too. In any event, this purchase was a good bargain for me. If I don&#x27;t pick out a favorite, I&#x27;ll probably buy another sample set!</li>
            <li> This will be a review in progress.  A looooong review in progress.  I&#x27;m a 32 year old man who has yet to hit puberty, so I&#x27;m a twice a week shaver, at most.  I don&#x27;t grow 5 o&#x27;clock shadows, more like 48 hour shadows, and even then it&#x27;s a pretty pathetic shadow considering my facial hair is light.  My point is that with 25 blades, this review will seriously take me at least a year to complete.  I try to get a few to several shaves out of one blade to get an idea of what I like and dislike about it.  So far (06MAR2015 at the moment), I&#x27;ve only gotten three shaves out of my first blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are shipped individually wrapped inside a tightly folded plastic bag.  I am picking these blades with no order whatsoever.  Do you watch the Price is Right?  Are you familiar with the 3 Strikes game?  If you&#x27;re not familiar with this game, there are 8 discs inside a bag that contestants reach in blindly and pick at random.  This is how I&#x27;ll be picking out my blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair to all blades, I&#x27;ll try to be consistent with my shaving methods.  For 90% of them I&#x27;ll be shaving immediately post-shower.  During my shower I let my badger hair brush soak in hot water.  For a few minutes towards the end of my shower I hold a hot, wet rag against my cheeks, chin, jaw, and neck.  I use Poraso shaving soap and my razor is a Merkur (can&#x27;t recall which type, but it&#x27;s just a standard looking safety razor).  I make three passes.  I shave with the grain, the across the grain, and finish up against the grain, lathering up between each pass.  This blade pack is replacing the 10-pack that originally came with my Merkur razor (probably standard Merkur stainless blades).  This is my first safety razor and these 10 blades lasted over a year and are the only blades I have experience with, so everything will be compared to these as well as previous blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Shark Super Stainless - Like I said earlier, I have 3 shaves so far with this blade. I feel it gets close enough to provide a smooth shave, but I feel like it requires more passes, and with each pass you up your risk of nicks and irritation.  I&#x27;ll use it a couple of more times to know for sure, but right now I prefer the freebies included with my razor.  If after a couple of more uses I change my mind, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this section of my review.enough to provide a smooth shave, but I feel like it requires more passes, and with each pass you up your risk of nicks and irritation.

            <li> This was a good way for me to test a lot of blades without the risk of having a whole case of blades I couldn&#x27;t use. The selection is pretty good, there are a few dogs in there but overall not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what this is though, it is a little on the expensive side, but not grossly overpriced so its not too bad. The blades average out to close to $0.65 / blade, which is a bit more than 3 times the price of the average hundred pack of blades (per blade average is $0.15 in a 100 pack). I know that it costs money to sort and repack all of the blades though and it definitely saved me money anyway, but 150% margin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would just bring the price down a bit and get rid of the dogs in the selection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the assortment and am currently enjoying my sample of each blade. My goal is to have found a balde that I particularly like the most.</li>
            <li> Has a high variety of blades so you can try a little bit of everything from different parts of the world to see what works for you before you commit yourself to a pack of blades that might not work for you.</li>
            <li> I am new to Safety Razors, and this blade sampler was terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives you a good feel for what many different blades are like, and what might work for you.  In my case, I found the blade I liked fairly quickly after using a few blades, and was so convinced that I bought 100 of them.  I will continue to go through the rest of the blades to see if I find something I like better.  There is allot of hype over feather blades with their legendary sharpness, but I am not finding these work for me, even though they are a fine blade that many find very attractive.  I did find out that blades like Derby and Lord don&#x27;t work well for me, but Gillette Silver Blue from Russia is now my blade of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this sampler.  I&#x27;ve used the Seller twice now, and they ship very quickly and everything I have received is as advertise.  Good Luck and Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of blades to test with my new DE razor. Have already had some that I will not purchase, and a few others that are just great. This is a great way to test with waters with different blade types, without having to purchase larger quantities and having a bad experience for several weeks. Personally the chrome type blades seem to be the smoothest and hold their edge better.</li>
            <li> Nice pack to try many different blades to get an idea on whivh ones I like.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with my first safety razor. I wanted to get a good selection of blades to see what brands work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;The set has 25 different kinds or safety razor blades. All of them have a paper wrapped around them with the model and maker. It will be easy to keep track of each ones performance.</li>
            <li> This contains the most popular and most common type blades out there. Of course this is missing a bunch others, such as the Merker, Personnas, and a lot of other Gillette series such as the 7 o clock. But overall it&#x27;s got everything else you&#x27;ll need. You&#x27;ll quickly find that not all blades are created equal and have their own characters, quirks and personality. So I definitely recommend keeping a little log or review notes on each of the blades you used. Put them in different razors and conditions (such as with soap, shaving cream, or combination soap/cream, with and without preshave oil) to really understand how each one of them performs and their pros/cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 blades is quite a bit and is perfect for a starter, or even novice looking to expand their horizons.</li>
            <li> Found some good blades I wasn&#x27;t aware of.</li>
            <li> Just buy Feather blades.  The rest of the blades in this set are subpar compared to Feathers.</li>
            <li> husband loved the variety. says he doesn&#x27;t know which one to pick, might have to buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic inexpensive pack to test and try different brands to find what you want.  Definitely recommend for a newbie.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a larger pack (50+); that&#x27;s just overkill.</li>
            <li> If yo are looking to try out a variety of blades, this is a good choice.  Plenty of quality blades and a diverse set of blade materials too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize blades could differ so much.  You&#x27;ll ofte see recommendations for those using a double-edge safety razor to experiment with different blands and types of blades (stainless, platinum, super chrome). Apparently some blades work better for different beard types and work differently in different razors. This packet gives a good variety and helped me to find three brands &amp; types that workded the best for me.  Experienced quite the difference for those that did not.</li>
            <li> Astra, Gillette, Feather, Lord, and Shark.  The most reputable blades around all in a single sampler.  The perfect mix of blades to find what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
            <li> As somebody who recently went to using a safety razor, I wanted to try out different blades to find which one worked best with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to find my favorite blade (The Wilkinson Sword Blades) and yes, there are defiantly noticeable differences between blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a blade you like, don&#x27;t waste the extra money just to try some other names out. If like me, you are new to using the safety razor then try this out.</li>
            <li> my father said they were great. Just going on his word.</li>
            <li> I would recommend waiting on a sampler until you&#x27;re a decent shaver. Buy a 5 pack of something like Shark, Astra, or 7&#x27;Oclocks so you can learn with a consistent sharpness and edge. I started with these blades and now have to go back and buy more of the first four or so I shaved with. Messed up my face with those, but I&#x27;m convinced it was due to my technique rather than the quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> This is a well thought out assortment with a range of sharpness and covering most of the manufacturing countries and brands still producing today.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best ways to try different blades while you are searching for your favorite.  It is one of the more reasonably priced of the samplers - but I think I got more duplicates than I expected.  Once you settle on a favorite, buying big quantities of just one brand is a lot more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Used about half. Great way to find what works for you</li>
            <li> Pretty good assortment.  There are a few that are just junk, but the rest are decent.  I wouldn&#x27;t get this if you are really new to DE shaving, because you probably are not going to be able to tell the difference.  You will want to have been shaving for a few months.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works comparably, if not better than Gillette cartridges. Not a razor enthusiast, so I&#x27;m not comfortable giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good starter sample pack</li>
            <li> There are so many double edge blades to try out, it appears as advertised and while I already don&#x27;t like two of the blades, the bundle has served it&#x27;s function well!</li>
            <li> Yeah if you&#x27;re starting out with Safety Razor shaving you&#x27;ll want this. Just keep trying blades until you find out which ones provide the smoothest, most comfortable shave and you can just buy that brand. There really is a difference between a lot of them, and there&#x27;s enough that it&#x27;ll last you a little while so you can chip in for a full pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To date, my favorites in particular have been the Astra Superior Stainless and both kinds of Shark blades.</li>
            <li> Excellent trial pack to see what kind is right for you.</li>
            <li> Excellent starter kit for newbies to the DE razor. I have already identified a couple favs.</li>
            <li> This product gives you a good variety or blade so you can decide which works beast for you.Give them a try you wont be disapointed</li>
            <li> Got this for the husband to start using a straight razor.  Didn&#x27;t know which blades he would like, so this was a great way to try many different ones without spending a fortune. All of the blades are in pristine condition, and high quality.  He has liked some better than others, but they have all worked well, and would be acceptable if that&#x27;s all we had on hand.  Once he gets through all these, we will look for the best deal on one of his favorites.  Not everyone will like the same blade.  It depends on how they hold the razor, hair type, type of shaving cream, how often they shave, etc.  This is a great way to find what works best for you and your shaving style.</li>
            <li> Recently started using a DE razor and thought this would be great to find the blade that works for my skin. This bundle has a ton of different sharpness blades. Great for a gift, or if you want to find a replacement/backup in case your particular brand is hard to find or more expensive. So far have used about half. Some I know I won&#x27;t use, like the feather, because I know its going to be too sharp for my skin.</li>
            <li> Rec the blades within 3 days...still trying them out. Feathers and Astras are great</li>
