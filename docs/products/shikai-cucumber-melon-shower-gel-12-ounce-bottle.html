            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this stuff every since I discovered it a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>(I even discovered it works exceptionally well as a shave gel when I had some along on a business trip and had forgotten to bring shave cream).</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant and lathers nicely while using &amp;</li>
            <li>It is my very favorite shower get.  </li>
            <li>The Cucumber Melon is a wonderful smell...not too strong. :)</li>

            <li>Provides a nice moisturizing effect without drying like soap.</li>
            <li>This Shower Gel smells wonderfullllllllllllllllllllllllllll and our household also smells wonderfullllllllllllllllllllllllllllll after using it and others have also commented on this, and we have been using this one Shikai Cucumber Melon Shower Gel already MANY years and still LOVE it, and were delighted to find it on Amazon, with good pricing, shipping and customer support when needed.</li>
            <li>feels good, smells good, cleans good, environmentally sound with a large refill available at an awesome price....</li>
            <li>The soap is high-quality - it has a light feel when you put it on, and the aroma that rises from the lather is also light and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It rinses off cleanly - my skin feels great afterward.</li>
            <li>I love this product and buy bottles three-at-a-time.</li>
            <li>After using a Polo brand shower gel for many years, the product vanished, and I was told that Polo would not reintroduce it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shower gels.  </li>
            <li>This is our favorite shower gel, since our sister-in-law gave us a bottle years ago.</li>
            <li>I love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and will get it whenever I can.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Delicious with arugula or just simple tossed greens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very excited to see it offered on Amazon as a subscribe and save 3-pack.</li>
            <li>The cucumber melon scent is very mild, fresh and clean, I also use it to bathe our dogs.&lt;br /&gt;Shikai has also come out with several awesome hand wash formulas that are wonderful and very gentle.</li>
            <li>Bothered by acne AND dry skin, I find Shikai to be the best body wash to make my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>This Shower Gel also has a nice texture to it and is concentrated, so a bottle can last a fair amount of time and our bathroom and home and people all are scented nicely from having this Shower Gel in our household.</li>
            <li>BUT most importantly, this product IS NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful - and no dry skin - just fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>, we refill our bottles at a huge savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The 3-pack eligible for free shipping</li>
            <li>I would feel comfortable recommending this to anyone with sensative skin, or those who just want a less-harsh non-soap product.</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely for a gently bubble</li>
            <li>I love the cucumber melon scent  which is light and fresh not cloying.</li>
            <li>For my original review (proving I&#x27;ve been purchasing the product), see this link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB9NM6DVMAQT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001ET7EAU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it gets you clean without pulling the moisture out of your skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash, and used to be able to buy it at a local Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you suffer dry skin or eczema, the only shower gel or soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn or aggravate my kids skin when their eczema is flaring.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of guy (or gal) that lathers up daily, this is the shower gel for you!  </li>
            <li>Very light cucumber melon scent leaves me fresh and clean without any girly fruit- or flower-smell left over.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product at Whole Foods, but found cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Why these people feel they have the right to overcharge, I have no idea.</li>
            <li>It really leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s worth trying if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin; additionally, strong fragrances give me migraines.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, natural aroma, very gender neutral, men feel comfortable using the florals and women using the sandalwood, traditionally a more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Good luck with repackaging the gooey mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and smells yummy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shower gel for many years in place of soap for daily cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my clean feeling soft and clean plus it is not heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li>Gentle to skin, with a barely noticeable cucumber scent, it leaves you feeling refreshed and smooth, with no lingering odor.</li>
            <li>I have very sensative skin and am allergic to almost all products on the market.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack is no longer available as part of Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program, I wish they would bring it back!</li>
            <li>--- Also, another importance is that we find this Shower Gel gentle enough to use even on the super sensitive areas of our anatomies without any adverse or allergic reactions to this product which is a definite plus, because we have not been able to say that about all the Shower Gels and Body Washes on the market.  </li>
            <li>The product still deserves 5 stars so I&#x27;ve left my original review</li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years; it has a light scent and is very moisturing for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is very faint, absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they need to update their image because the bottles I got look nothing like the one featured here (or my old one).</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li>I had tried a variety of different products and they all seemed to dry out my skin even more.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Product is fabulous but it is a messy, gooey experience to buy this item.</li>
            <li>The label has been completely redone and the bottle itself is also shorter.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>The cucumber melon scent is luscious, and the gel cleans while leaving my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that I wasn&#x27;t allergic because this product does have a light cucumber melon fragrance, but it is not strong and when washed away leaves virtually no smell on my skin (which is what I need, but may not be desirable to some).</li>
            <li>The scent is very subtle and pleasant, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that the gel moisturizes my skin as much as it just doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products.</li>
            <li>I know they can&#x27;t be responsible for how the package is handled once it reaches them, but there were no seals on any of the bottles under the lids and one of the lids came completely loose.</li>
            <li>This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive</li>
            <li>No dry skin here.</li>
            <li>A little soapy at first, but once you get over that the sky&#x27;s the limit.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s expensive for shower gel, it goes a long way and the smell is just wonderful---NOT your typical &amp;#34;cucumber melon&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m not sure what it reminds me of exactly, but it&#x27;s great.  </li>

            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that can get me through an entire Chicago winter without ending up dry &amp; itchy.</li>
            <li> I literarily searched for years for a replacement with no success.  </li>
            <li> : The last time I got the three-pack one of them was leaking a little bit, so all three bottles had to be washed off before being stored, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make an obvious difference in the level in the bottle that was leaking.</li>
            <li> Using it as a bubble bath for a long soak makes my skin rejoice.</li>
            <li> If you go to the actual product site, three bottles should be roughly 27 dollars, regardless of scent.</li>
            <li> I can also use this year round in hot or cold weather, as it is mild and non-drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years because of the  colloidal oatmeal it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> During winter when the dry air can chafe or cause ashy dry skin</li>
            <li> bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product).</li>
            <li> I use it for my soap for my dry hands instead of antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li> This seems to help my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I did a careful comparison and neither is true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but it has been getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying the other scents out too.  </li>
            <li> read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fragrance is soft and fresh, but not at all annoying or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive and saves me a 20 mile trip to Whole Foods.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I get seasonal eczema (dermatitis) and can&#x27;t use regular soap products. I tried Shikai a few years ago when a particularly dry winter made my skin (and and by extension, me) miserable. I had tried a variety of different products and they all seemed to dry out my skin even more.  Enter Shikai. Using it as a bubble bath for a long soak makes my skin rejoice. I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s great for softening up callouses (heels, etc).  I use it as shampoo, shower gel, bubble bath, (I even discovered it works exceptionally well as a shave gel when I had some along on a business trip and had forgotten to bring shave cream). I highly recommend it even if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin - it gets you clean without pulling the moisture out of your skin.</li>
            <li> feels good, smells good, cleans good, environmentally sound with a large refill available at an awesome price....I don&#x27;t think i will ever use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that can get me through an entire Chicago winter without ending up dry &amp; itchy. Very light cucumber melon scent leaves me fresh and clean without any girly fruit- or flower-smell left over.</li>
            <li> This shower gel is great. The scent is very subtle and pleasant, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that the gel moisturizes my skin as much as it just doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products. It isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s worth trying if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  We&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Product is fabulous but it is a messy, gooey experience to buy this item. The packaging is poor and the bottle caps are not even screwed tight, so half the product winds up inside the carton. Forget about replacement as they want you to ship the item back. Good luck with repackaging the gooey mess. I didn&#x27;t bother trying my luck with the P.O.</li>
            <li> This shower gel is an excellent product that leaves my skin feeling healthy and balanced.  The cucumber melon variety is the essence of freshness.  The scent is very faint, absolutely perfect.  The 3-pack eligible for free shipping was a great deal!</li>
            <li> If you go to the actual product site, three bottles should be roughly 27 dollars, regardless of scent. Why these people feel they have the right to overcharge, I have no idea.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, and used to be able to buy it at a local Trader Joe&#x27;s. They stopped carrying it, and so I went online looking and found it here. Ordered the 3-pack, which arrived today. First of all, they need to update their image because the bottles I got look nothing like the one featured here (or my old one). The label has been completely redone and the bottle itself is also shorter. I wondered if they may have decreased the ounces and/or changed the formula. I did a careful comparison and neither is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars is because one of the bottles leaked during shipping. I know they can&#x27;t be responsible for how the package is handled once it reaches them, but there were no seals on any of the bottles under the lids and one of the lids came completely loose. Although the 3-pack is wrapped in plastic, the wash spilled down inside the wrapping making a thick soapy slime coating all over all the bottles which I had to spend 10 minutes washing off. I also lost about 1/3 of one of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will call the ShiKai company tomorrow and see if they offer any restitution.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years; it has a light scent and is very moisturing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy bottles three-at-a-time. I have very sensative skin and am allergic to almost all products on the market. However I have used and had no reaction to Shikai products (shampoo, body gel, conditioner, hair syrum). I was surprised that I wasn&#x27;t allergic because this product does have a light cucumber melon fragrance, but it is not strong and when washed away leaves virtually no smell on my skin (which is what I need, but may not be desirable to some). I can also use this year round in hot or cold weather, as it is mild and non-drying. I would feel comfortable recommending this to anyone with sensative skin, or those who just want a less-harsh non-soap product.</li>
            <li> After using a Polo brand shower gel for many years, the product vanished, and I was told that Polo would not reintroduce it. I literarily searched for years for a replacement with no success.  About a year ago, a Shikai representative gave me a sample of the Cucumber Melon Shower Gel at a local Central Market.  After one use, I was hooked. Smells great, lathers nicely, and feels wonderful. It really leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. If you&#x27;re the kind of guy (or gal) that lathers up daily, this is the shower gel for you!  PS - Buying the 3-pac at Amazon saves me almost $3 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This seems to help my very dry skin.  Plus the shower gel smells wonderful.  I think it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shower gels.  It&#x27;s very gentle and smells yummy.  It&#x27;s one of the few that keep the itchy winter skin at bay.  I wish it had no sulfates, but it gets along with my skin so I can&#x27;t complain.  Five stars if they replace the sulfates with something safer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years because of the  colloidal oatmeal it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I love the cucumber melon scent  which is light and fresh not cloying.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite shower gel, since our sister-in-law gave us a bottle years ago. The scent is very faint, next to unscented, and it&#x27;s quite soothing, just as the bottle says.</li>
            <li> Bothered by acne AND dry skin, I find Shikai to be the best body wash to make my skin feel better. Especially now that the winter dryness is setting in. The oatmeal-based gel softens without feeling &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s a word. I love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shower gel for many years in place of soap for daily cleansing.  Fragrance is soft and fresh, but not at all annoying or overpowering.  Provides a nice moisturizing effect without drying like soap.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin; additionally, strong fragrances give me migraines. So when I discovered Shikai, I was in heaven! Gentle to skin, with a barely noticeable cucumber scent, it leaves you feeling refreshed and smooth, with no lingering odor. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, but it has been getting harder to find in stores. Buying it in a three-pack with free shipping from Amazon saves a trip to the store, and is a great deal. Try this shower gel once, and you won&#x27;t be hooked!!!</li>
            <li> Great price. I originally bought this product at Whole Foods, but found cheaper on Amazon. Scent is pleasant and lathers nicely while using &amp;#34;glove scrubs&amp;#34; to apply on my body. BUT most importantly, this product IS NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shower gel. The soap is high-quality - it has a light feel when you put it on, and the aroma that rises from the lather is also light and very pleasant. (I use the yuzu fragrance, which is citrus-y.) It rinses off cleanly - my skin feels great afterward. I have sensitivity to soap, including glycerin soap which I used to use - now I use this.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:: The 3 pack is no longer available as part of Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program, I wish they would bring it back! The product still deserves 5 stars so I&#x27;ve left my original review but I&#x27;d like to suggest that the shower gel can be purchased by the gallon for around $45 - $48, we refill our bottles at a huge savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Shikai shower gel for my family for years. It has a fresh, natural aroma, very gender neutral, men feel comfortable using the florals and women using the sandalwood, traditionally a more masculine scent. It&#x27;s perfect if you suffer dry skin or eczema, the only shower gel or soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn or aggravate my kids skin when their eczema is flaring. During winter when the dry air can chafe or cause ashy dry skin my kids avoid hand washing. We can&#x27;t have that! Using Shikai at the sink as well as shower is the only way I can get them to wash up with whining. It&#x27;s around $10 per bottle in my area stores, buying it here on amazon with subscribe and save is like getting a bottle free!&lt;br /&gt;Or, as mentioned above, getting by the gallon saves a ton! The cucumber melon scent is very mild, fresh and clean, I also use it to bathe our dogs.&lt;br /&gt;Shikai has also come out with several awesome hand wash formulas that are wonderful and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I use this for showering and for some bubbles in the tub too.  I&#x27;ts so soothing to the skin.  The smell is nice...not overpowering or fake smelling.  I also mix this with my epsom salts and it makes for a wonderful bath.  Looking forward to trying the other scents out too.  Great product with a fair price.</li>
            <li> It is my very favorite shower get.  I have used it for years and my skin never dries out.  The Cucumber Melon is a wonderful smell...not too strong. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, even on face.  My son tried it and was very impressed at how moisturizing it felt on his face.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft and nourished. No dry skin here. I use this everyday and love it.  I&#x27;ll never use another shower gel</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and it is my pleasure to get it for her.  She says it is the best; and who am I to argue :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cross-posting my review to all variants of this Shikai shower gel as a warning. For my original review (proving I&#x27;ve been purchasing the product), see this link: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB9NM6DVMAQT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001ET7EAU&amp;linkCode&#x3D;&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;tag&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product). After using a very small amount of the product on my face over the past few YEARS, I recently (past ~6 months) developed severe dermatitis around my eyelid and scalp. The itchiness and redness were unbearable, and my dermatologist prescribed a topical steroid that helped somewhat. Unfortunately, the dermatitis always returned and yet I didn&#x27;t want to believe this was linked to some product I was using because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in years. It was tough to tell if this soap was the cause because the symptoms didn&#x27;t disappear quickly / seem to line up with my usage, but after finally going cold turkey a month or two ago the dermatitis has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this week, when I decided to do some research (why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner, I don&#x27;t know). This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This Shower Gel smells wonderfullllllllllllllllllllllllllll and our household also smells wonderfullllllllllllllllllllllllllllll after using it and others have also commented on this, and we have been using this one Shikai Cucumber Melon Shower Gel already MANY years and still LOVE it, and were delighted to find it on Amazon, with good pricing, shipping and customer support when needed. We try to keep a hefty supply of it on hand at all times, in case for some reason it is not in stock when we need to reorder. This Shower Gel also has a nice texture to it and is concentrated, so a bottle can last a fair amount of time and our bathroom and home and people all are scented nicely from having this Shower Gel in our household. WE LOOOOOOVE THIS SHOWER GEL. --- Also, another importance is that we find this Shower Gel gentle enough to use even on the super sensitive areas of our anatomies without any adverse or allergic reactions to this product which is a definite plus, because we have not been able to say that about all the Shower Gels and Body Washes on the market.  Thank you, Amazon. Blessings.</li>
            <li> The cucumber melon scent is luscious, and the gel cleans while leaving my skin soft.  I love this stuff, and will get it whenever I can.</li>
            <li> Wonderful - and no dry skin - just fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 20+ years. I love it. It is the only shower gel for me. Leaves my clean feeling soft and clean plus it is not heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful. It is gentle and feels good on my skin. I use it in the shower myself and my kids (3 and 5) use it in the bathtub. It foams up nicely for a gently bubble bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to see it offered on Amazon as a subscribe and save 3-pack. It is less expensive and saves me a 20 mile trip to Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this stuff every since I discovered it a couple of years ago.  While it&#x27;s expensive for shower gel, it goes a long way and the smell is just wonderful---NOT your typical &amp;#34;cucumber melon&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m not sure what it reminds me of exactly, but it&#x27;s great.  Getting it on Amazon is less expensive than getting it in the stores around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The last time I got the three-pack one of them was leaking a little bit, so all three bottles had to be washed off before being stored, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make an obvious difference in the level in the bottle that was leaking.</li>
            <li> wonderful smell.  great product.</li>
            <li> I use it for my soap for my dry hands instead of antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li> Delicious with arugula or just simple tossed greens. A little soapy at first, but once you get over that the sky&#x27;s the limit.</li>
