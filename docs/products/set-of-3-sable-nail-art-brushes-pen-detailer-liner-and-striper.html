            <li>They are nice and lite weight.</li>
            <li>But the brushes have come in handy with the detail work that I do.</li>
            <li>These pens r really neat they do an awesome job of detailing on your nail..</li>

            <li>The brush part kind of just separates after you used it</li>
            <li>You can never have to many good brushes.</li>
            <li>But for the price theyre nice.</li>
            <li>These are fairly nice quality brushes for the price.</li>

            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>Great for creating your own unique designs on your nails.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and goes on good..</li>
            <li>great for detailing and super price</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and handle.</li>
            <li>but they do not work very easily to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them many times doing my nails, and I love them!</li>
            <li>But they do have a fine tip which is good</li>
            <li>Got them early and they are perfect</li>
            <li>I do my own nails now and decide to branch out to doing more of my designs</li>
            <li>they are cheap plastic handles but the brushes seem good.</li>
            <li>but the pencil work well:) I have to wait son more weeks to see if they are still working good :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and look amazing.</li>
            <li>great item and priced right</li>
            <li>So easy to hold and do the work for me!</li>
            <li>They are great to practice and see if its worth investing in a better set.</li>
            <li>Good clean lines</li>
            <li>Just starting to do acquire the supplies to do my own nails, and these seem perfect for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Not overly priced so worth having around to be able to do a great job.</li>
            <li>but I would NOT suggest anyone buys this that intends on using them for fine details, they don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>It does feel very cheaply made</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but seem to be very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The handles are made of very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>and yes they look very cheap, like crafted out straw</li>
            <li>they are very cheap and dont lay my paint</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>

            <li>I would recommend these brushes but MAKE SURE you clean them!</li>
            <li>The longer ones did not make very clean lines, as they had some of the brush fibers halfway coming out, so I just trimmed them off with scissors</li>
            <li>It work pretty good for me, so now I can design my feet.</li>
            <li>The handles are plastic, and the bristles on the brushes are in pretty good condition.</li>
            <li>They work well and for the money are pretty good.</li>
            <li>they do a pretty good job</li>
            <li>its ok not crazy over them but for the price its great I would buy again because the price is right.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and don&#x27;t make fine lines at all</li>
            <li>PLUS HAVE A GREAT TIME INVENTING NEW ART ON MY NAILS</li>
            <li>nice grip and color coding helps you find then in your brush selection quickly.</li>
            <li>love it because I could handle it easy.</li>
            <li>It is great for me though because I practice nail art on my own nails only.</li>
            <li>It is great for me though because I practice nail art on my own nails only...</li>
            <li>Also, when you go to dip it into the nail polish, I am sure they will stick together just fine.</li>
            <li>i Bought This brushes and they are really good for Detailing and Fine Nail Art Work at First</li>
            <li>very easy to work with....very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about trying to trim away the stray bristles with scissors in hopes of it making my lines more precise when doing my nail art.</li>
            <li>These arrived early which was great.  </li>
            <li>loved em already wore mine out used so much.</li>
            <li>Fun gift for preteen/teen girl who enjoys designing their own nails</li>
            <li>They are worth a try, and I know know I will be able to do very fine art work.</li>
            <li>and these brushed are strong but very fine  &amp; work great for detail</li>
            <li>They make nail art so easy.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>As I examined these brushes is my opinion that they are not of high quality but is a fair product for the price.</li>
            <li>Easy for super fine lines and details!</li>
            <li>Pretty nice nail art set.</li>
            <li>i liked them when i first seen them but after having them for some time i realized that i had no use for them</li>
            <li>I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li>Fun for nail designs and makes it so easy!</li>
            <li>cheap and break easily.  </li>
            <li>I think he brushes are just fine; however, I need to learn how to use them.  </li>
            <li>but they work to do some fine line detail.</li>
            <li>it fine</li>
            <li>I am going to use these fine tipped brushes to make eye lashes on my people in my oil paintings.</li>
            <li>Make fine lines.</li>
            <li>It should work fine for its intended use.</li>
            <li>Quality of brushes were subpar but for the price they are fine</li>
            <li>Thanks for my set for Nail Art, those are cute and convenient!...</li>
            <li>1 out of 3 is sent in good condition, but the brushes still are not so great for nail art, it&#x27;s flimsy and is hard to make anything out of it.</li>
            <li>The longest brush is great for creating lines,the mid sized brush is great for the same and for making deigns and the smallest brush is great for smaller details.</li>
            <li>and they are really good and gives me precise lines and looks professional as my friends still think that I go to get my nails done.</li>
            <li>Feel disposable and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap material but gets the job done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap..</li>
            <li>SO cheap.</li>
            <li>instead, when it came it was basically ballpoint pens emptied out and filled with brush bristles.</li>
            <li>I rated this 3 stars because for the price being so cheap it didn&#x27;t hurt to try them out</li>
            <li>but I was worried they would be cheap.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really cheap and the handle of the brushes is basically a straw with a cap.</li>
            <li>but I guess I got what I payed for - cheap and</li>
            <li>they were cheap, and I&#x27;m getting into nail art.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and cheaply made just as a forewarning.</li>
            <li>I havent used these brushes yet, but I can tell that they are a cheap product.</li>
            <li>The 3 different sizes are great for doing any nail designs.</li>
            <li>Idk if acetone free nail polish remover would do any damage - i assume it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>These brushes were cheap and the bristles on them were messed up.</li>
            <li>This brushes are really cheap made I was painting my nails</li>
            <li>They are soo easy to clean off&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t for me, rather a birthday gift for my daughter, so I can&#x27;t say specifically whether she will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li>i just feel like they&#x27;re cheaply made</li>
            <li>Cheap but for the price what do you expect.</li>
            <li>they were cheap, which is what I paid for, I guess.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is so cheap ...</li>
            <li>Is what it is cheap.. will melt in acetone.</li>
            <li>Kinda cheaply made BUT</li>
            <li>so assuming so far so good on them.</li>
            <li>they were delivered early, which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>you apply &amp; easy to flick out for quick fine fast-looking lines.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using detail brushes but these are really easy to use on both hands, they are forgiving and give a nice light touch to the detail or design added to a manicure.</li>
            <li>I was excited about getting the brushes, but when I got them I saw how cheaply made they are.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good and the first time I used them they made straight lines</li>
            <li>Their OK there pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Takes forever to ship (about a month) but they are pretty cheap and they work well for most nail art.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them for any one doing their own nails at home</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with how fast this brush set came!</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with how fast this brush set came!</li>
            <li>I was excited, when I got it in my mailbox about 2 week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to get them</li>
            <li>I was really excited to have brought this item.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Do be aware that when u clean this brushes (which u should after each use, so the hair isn&#x27;t ruined) be sure to not get any acetone on the plastic part of the pen.</li>
            <li>I have tried different brushes for acrylic paint and these are the best so far.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way that the brush will paint clean stripes.  </li>
            <li>It took forever to clean up</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and do not paint very well.</li>
            <li>Cheap, arrived right on time, not damaged and exactly what i needed :) will absolutly buy all my nail supplies from here.</li>
            <li>but they are fine for right now.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t fall apart but what they did do is made cool designs...</li>
            <li>I know they say you get what you pay for and its true.  </li>
            <li>but overall the product is as described &amp; is a good deal.</li>
            <li>i love it so much i use it</li>
            <li>Good quality brushes and very low price.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t paint very well and are cheaply made!</li>
            <li>and I was not the least bit impressed</li>
            <li>The pens were literally pens w a brush as an end , not bad though.</li>
            <li>Very nice and got them quicker then expected.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>They are great, nothing I would change other</li>
            <li>Great pens for sharp lines</li>
            <li>They were ok but a little on flimsy side but for the price they were good</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and was intact.</li>
            <li>These came ratter quick, in just 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Received brushes quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to start off with how quickly they shipped.</li>
            <li>If you want super intricate details I wouldn&#x27;t start with these though ...</li>
            <li>these brushes have met my hopes tremendously...</li>
            <li>I do a lot of nail art on myself and these are perfect!I trimmed them down to a bit of a thinner brush for my own liking, other than that they&#x27;re find and work perfect!</li>
            <li>I had been looking for some decent, cheap fine brushes to  create nail art like the ones done by nail technicians.  </li>
            <li>Not only was I very pleased with these brushes but  the speed of which they arrived was quick.  </li>
            <li>took really really really long to arrive, but good brushes</li>
            <li>The brushes are long and good quality.</li>
            <li>Super good price, exactly the same one that I bought at sallys for $18...</li>
            <li>They are really skinny so its really easy to do outlines for nail art.</li>
            <li>I really like them!!</li>
            <li>I originally didn&#x27;t like these because the first ones I received the bristles were falling out.</li>
            <li>Honestly if you want to do desigN on nails, these brushes are to long, only good to maybe do lines, one brush I can&#x27;t eve use the brush was all messed up</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting, thank you!</li>
            <li>All of this sellers efforts were greatly appreciated by me!!</li>
            <li>the first brush i used came apart when i tried to clean it.</li>
            <li>The hairs didn&#x27;t hold up to remover the first time I used them and tried to clean them.  </li>
            <li>I used a cotton ball to wipe the bristles clean and the whole bristle casing popped right off the handle!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, they even came in all separate little bags.</li>
            <li>brushes are cheap but considering the price you should expect as much.  </li>
            <li>* Very flimsy and cheap materials&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait if you already have brushes to work with.</li>
            <li>Lastly &amp; more importantly they wash well for reuse  later on!</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t good if you really want to make nice thin, precise lines.</li>
            <li>but I had fun making birthday designs for my nails.</li>
            <li>the shortest one is the only one that really works in application; the second-longest is good for altering designs.</li>
            <li>They will also be useful for animal whiskers.</li>
            <li>I only tried the shortest one and that didn&#x27;t even work nicely on my nails.</li>
            <li>Not as thin of striper as I was looking for, but are great for the value!</li>
            <li>#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I think they are worth every bit of $2.95.</li>
            <li>Many people ask me how i could do such precise stripes</li>
            <li>Plus they were pretty cheap and they shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Holding up pretty good vs the more pricey one that I have brought in the past.</li>
            <li>Arrived when expected in good condition.</li>
            <li>My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work very well, had to re-do my daughter&#x27;s nails over and over again, weren&#x27;t very useful to detail with.</li>
            <li>They feel really lightweight but pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered some other ones that are better.</li>
            <li>likes the pen look would have been better if the hairs were better quality other than that</li>
            <li>I like these, but make sure you clean them right away and then put back in the plastic</li>
            <li>and they are long, is an okay product!</li>
            <li>They worked good other than that.</li>
            <li>The tips of the Brushes fell right out they where not even glued on .</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller &amp; they made it right by sending me another set.</li>
            <li>The price was just right</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>These are a pretty nice tool to use when doing different designs for your clients or even for yourself or a friend.</li>
            <li>I had no idea they made such fine brushes and had not found something this fine in the art stores.  </li>
            <li>Also, I can&#x27;t really tell if the bristles are true Sable or not, so theres another problem.</li>
            <li>for ability to draw fine lines but not very durable.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for something more durable.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and quick to dry too.</li>
            <li>They look cheap, they feel cheap, and they dont even work properly..</li>
            <li>but they work very well for a beginner or someone that hasn&#x27;t had much experience with detailed painting.</li>
            <li>nail design good price  good deal real thin brush</li>
            <li>Came very fast and as promised</li>
            <li>They are very precise, but they are actually quite a bit longer than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>They hold nail polish on them and the bristles stay together good so you can make little designs on your nail.</li>
            <li>While cheaply made, they are easier to clean than wooden brushes.</li>
            <li>They work really well for me, but the brush comes apart where the colored part ends and the white part begins very easily.</li>
            <li>Not sure why other people don&#x27;t like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture.</li>
            <li>It is good to have little brushes to be able to do the tiny stuff with.</li>
            <li>Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>the actual size of the brushed are perfect but the tops tend to come off (between the color and white)</li>
            <li>(from China) in case your interested.</li>
            <li>These brushes definitely helped me to layer and create interesting edges to each color when painted.</li>
            <li>the ends of the brushes (the bristles) fell out the first time i used them then</li>
            <li>First of all, these are not made of sable.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Overall ok</li>
            <li>love that they have three different sizes</li>
            <li>They fell apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise buying a higher quality set.</li>
            <li>and i got these first off</li>
            <li>exactly what is described in the description</li>
            <li>If you break one, it&#x27;s no big deal because you have two more</li>
            <li>tested them last week works as they should no fraying :)</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>oh and one of them  started loosing the bristles the first time I used it...</li>
            <li>MAKES VERY PRCISE STROKES!</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes thinking that they would hold up better than my last ones</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised how these work for as cheap as they were.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li>Came exactly when they was suppose t8.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>it was not well put together the first time i used one the quil came out of it</li>
            <li>The have made my life as a nail tech so much easier!</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I suggest just spending an extra $1 to get better ones faster.</li>
            <li>Brushes are great and will last me a long time!</li>
            <li>but so far has been just fine and had no issues expect after you wash the polish off, the hairs don&#x27;t stay straight together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not qualified to say they&#x27;re good or bad, so I&#x27;ll rate good.</li>
            <li>These came about a week earlier then expected in great condition.</li>
            <li>The hairs stray the more you use them, they also werent as thin as i wouldve liked them to be.</li>
            <li>I frequently change my nail polish&lt;br /&gt;and enjoy drawing designs but these nail art brushes do not hold up very well</li>
            <li>I love that handles are long and very sturdy!</li>
            <li>The package came very fast and I was very exited to use them.</li>
            <li>They are pretty janky, but for .89 you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be nice having brushes to dip into any polish I have and make stripes rather than buying every color in a striper, but it is hard to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will use but for under $2 I say its a fair deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just pure customer service.</li>
            <li>Pure junk, they came falling apart bristle hair was shedding</li>
            <li>Each brush paints very well and is easy to work with, the 3 different sizes make a world of differece depending on what nail art is being done.</li>
            <li>these will be ok but they are really cheaply made, and not very good for doing any sort of nail art.:</li>
            <li>these brushes are just fine nice and thin</li>
            <li>They make nice lines but still aren&#x27;t as fine and thin as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I use them with plain acrylic paints and seal with a top coat and it lasts!</li>
            <li>They are good quality; hard plastic with protective sheaths over the brush hairs.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very abstract.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t complain too much...</li>
            <li>They will keep the hairs from straying and keep them straight and neat.</li>
            <li>but what else should you expect from such a cheap product?</li>
            <li>Straight lines and no hairs have fallen out.</li>
            <li>This is a striper brush but very think.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really use in.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I guess you really get what you pay for....</li>
            <li>They make it soo much easier to use any color nail polish I want to make designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t played with them much</li>
            <li>The plastic slaw is quite flimsy, but it does the job in you are gentle with the way you store them.</li>
            <li>HIGH QUALITY!</li>
            <li>I really like these Nail Art Striper brushes.</li>
            <li>Just as described Thanks</li>
            <li>They came fast, and work very well.</li>
            <li>These brushes have really helped with that.</li>
            <li>These work very well for me.</li>
            <li>The Brussels of the brushes stink and overall there just cheap.</li>
            <li>I really like these stripers.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>The description of pen was very misleading.  </li>
            <li>My lines have to be redone like 4 times, too much of a hassle for me.</li>
            <li>so i dont use them much</li>
            <li>With this product, you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I got the order really fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These came really fast, within a week..</li>
            <li>I thought the brushes would be firmer so that I could draw a straight line on my nail.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for all</li>
            <li>But shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was much faster than expected, and my daughter will love them.</li>
            <li>I was just looking for a good starter brush set, and at least this was something to play with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for a good deal.</li>
            <li>While the brushes are good they seem to be a bit too thick.  </li>
            <li>Only thing  not so great, very hard to clean and when I do (with nail polish remover)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, except for the one with the long brush.  </li>
            <li>The other was ok.</li>
            <li>The other two in the set are okay.</li>
            <li>The handles are a bit flimsy and the brush part isn&#x27;t very high quality, but it&#x27;s a decent beginner set</li>
            <li>Love to mess around with nails and all the new items out right now for nail art.</li>
            <li>to really GRB onto paint and make a steady line.</li>
            <li>ive ordered 2 already only because I dont know how to clean them....</li>
            <li>brushes are very fine for doing intricate detail work, while the different lengths allow for different paint techniques to apply</li>
            <li>I grow my nails very long so these come in handy for designing my nails with different styles, I like them.</li>
            <li>I fixed them with tape, and they still work well, but it might be worth it to spend a few more dollars and get ones that don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>These are very cheap quality- separates when applying paint causing a mess and unwanted lines and smudges.</li>
            <li>Decent brushes, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>The longest one was the mist decent one.</li>
            <li>It came about a week earlier than I expected, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for these brushes.</li>
            <li>I do make sure to always rinse them out after use and put a little cuticle oil on them.</li>
            <li>one of the brushes were a little tattered, but I was able to fix it.</li>
            <li>these were very cheap and stiff.</li>
            <li>The hairs were wild couldn&#x27;t really use them&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Brought the fun back to painting my kids nails.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t heard from her lately to ask if she liked them.</li>
            <li>They also seem to be able to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I need to order a few more.</li>
            <li>the pen part is good sized for big or small hands.</li>
            <li>They make good thin lines.</li>
            <li>new pencils arrive in good condition :) They look like they are made from a chip chip plastic :(</li>
            <li>Now I have to go and find new ones.</li>
            <li>id recommend them to new starters.</li>
            <li>Was excited when I received this package in the mail, I went straight home and started doing my little girl&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>Other than that very good with no fly away hairs and goof for nail designs.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush feels a little cheap because it is hollow plastic, but the price was also cheap so it balances out.</li>
            <li>the tip is the exact same thing as a ballpoint pen tip with a brush coming out</li>
            <li>Getting better with them everyday!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised !</li>
            <li>they work and are a nice little set of nail brushes as long as you know how to use them</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t live near me though</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to throw away my old brushes and use my new brushes.</li>
            <li>I have used them a couple pf times and they are a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to order this product because some of the reviews mentioned how cheaply they were made.  </li>
            <li>The brushes come with clear plastic sleeves to slide over the brush hairs.</li>
            <li>but if you want some professional....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled, I thought the picture said it all, but it says far from it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are cheaply made and uneven...</li>
            <li>They feel like paint brushes I would buy my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>The hairs are really soft and even come with a plastic case thingy to protect them, I advise you not to throw it away.</li>
            <li>This brushes made my art look professional nail salon quality.</li>
            <li>but I at least would of love to try the product out.</li>
            <li>Bristles have held up to acetone and Polish so far.</li>
            <li>I got them really early too.</li>
            <li>I was prepared to wait until early June, but it came in today.  </li>
            <li>Also, I really appreciated the card you get when you open the package.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t professional, but they work.</li>
            <li>I was so upset because i only really use them like twice</li>
            <li>waste of money, i knew they were cheap</li>
            <li>But can&#x27;t complain too much when the price was so low</li>
            <li>These have done well so far.</li>
            <li>So far they work well,  </li>
            <li>But, they are not firm at all.</li>
            <li>She is 11 years old and is learning to design her nails.  </li>
            <li>These actually surprised me.  </li>
            <li>but the bristles are thin and will draw a nice line.</li>
            <li>The hairs on these nail art pens were really stiff and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>so easy to find storage because they are soo small in with</li>
            <li>The aren&#x27;t fine expensive quality but they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li>Three decent brushes at an extremely low price.</li>
            <li>Great for delicate small lines of detail .  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The brissels arent exatly what i expected but the brushes still work for what i need them for and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>* Hollow plastic held by hot glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a long time waiting for the product :/ I took contact with the seller :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the longer bristled brush (the green one), but I use the other two for pretty much all of my nail art detailing and freehand nail painting.</li>
            <li>It arrived very late, and they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>At first it wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all, but once I used them on my nails they worked so well!</li>
            <li>Granted that it was less than $1.50, I was not expecting the brushes to be hard to control (blue and green brushes), but the red brush is superb!</li>
            <li>The thinnest ones seemed so flimsy and not stiff enough, that I didn&#x27;t even try it.</li>
            <li>I think I need to steer well clear of that brand, in the future.</li>
            <li>when I ordered this product, I was expecting something above &#x27;thrown-together&amp;#34; and professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the blue one three times with no issues so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li>but it sounds like from everyone else&#x27;s reviews that this isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes for thin long lines.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a decent quality for the money paid, although I wish I had invested in something a bit more expensive that would actually last.</li>
            <li>I do my nail a lot with other brushes and have not had this much of a problem until now.</li>
            <li>They help me with straight lines and other designs.</li>
            <li>Good thing they weren&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m very careful I can get my moneys worth since I only paid .56 cents for them, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to ordering digital items online only.  </li>
            <li>Yes these were cheap, but the bristles are very flimsy and make it difficult to paint at all.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t professional quality, but far nicer than I expected for what I paid.</li>
            <li>Great for doing thin &amp; thick lines depending on the pressure  </li>
            <li>this is a classic case of NOT LOOKING AT THE PICTURE CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li>It is cheep and not as high quality as expected it said it was a three pack</li>
            <li>Not as high quality as I expected</li>
            <li>Cheap and not good quality.</li>
            <li>Cheap is never a good sign.</li>
            <li>made very cheap not impressed at all would rather spend the money and buy some where else would not recommend</li>
            <li>not very good after using it one time brush bristles started to fall right out.</li>

            <li> The longer ones did not make very clean lines, as they had some of the brush fibers halfway coming out, so I just trimmed them off with scissors</li>

            <li> It is great for me though because I practice nail art on my own nails only...</li>

            <li> 1 out of 3 is sent in good condition, but the brushes still are not so great for nail art, it&#x27;s flimsy and is hard to make anything out of it.</li>
            <li> The longest brush is great for creating lines,the mid sized brush is great for the same and for making deigns and the smallest brush is great for smaller details.</li>
            <li> and they are really good and gives me precise lines and looks professional as my friends still think that I go to get my nails done.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s cheap..</li>
            <li> SO cheap.</li>
            <li> instead, when it came it was basically ballpoint pens emptied out and filled with brush bristles.</li>
            <li> I rated this 3 stars because for the price being so cheap it didn&#x27;t hurt to try them out</li>
            <li> but I was worried they would be cheap.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really cheap and the handle of the brushes is basically a straw with a cap.</li>
            <li> but I guess I got what I payed for - cheap and</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li> i just feel like they&#x27;re cheaply made</li>
            <li> Cheap but for the price what do you expect.</li>
            <li> they were cheap, which is what I paid for, I guess.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is so cheap ...</li>
            <li> Is what it is cheap.. will melt in acetone.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheaply made BUT</li>
            <li> so assuming so far so good on them.</li>

            <li> I am new to using detail brushes but these are really easy to use on both hands, they are forgiving and give a nice light touch to the detail or design added to a manicure.</li>
            <li> I was excited about getting the brushes, but when I got them I saw how cheaply made they are.</li>

            <li> I was really excited to have brought this item.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Do be aware that when u clean this brushes (which u should after each use, so the hair isn&#x27;t ruined) be sure to not get any acetone on the plastic part of the pen.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brushes for acrylic paint and these are the best so far.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way that the brush will paint clean stripes.  </li>
            <li> It took forever to clean up</li>
            <li> They are very cheap and do not paint very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap, arrived right on time, not damaged and exactly what i needed :) will absolutly buy all my nail supplies from here.</li>
            <li> but they are fine for right now.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t fall apart but what they did do is made cool designs...</li>
            <li> I know they say you get what you pay for and its true.  </li>
            <li> but overall the product is as described &amp; is a good deal.</li>
            <li> i love it so much i use it</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes and very low price.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t paint very well and are cheaply made!</li>
            <li> and I was not the least bit impressed</li>
            <li> The pens were literally pens w a brush as an end , not bad though.</li>
            <li> Very nice and got them quicker then expected.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> They are great, nothing I would change other</li>
            <li> Great pens for sharp lines</li>
            <li> They were ok but a little on flimsy side but for the price they were good</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and was intact.</li>
            <li> These came ratter quick, in just 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Received brushes quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off with how quickly they shipped.</li>
            <li> If you want super intricate details I wouldn&#x27;t start with these though ...</li>
            <li> these brushes have met my hopes tremendously...</li>
            <li> I do a lot of nail art on myself and these are perfect!I trimmed them down to a bit of a thinner brush for my own liking, other than that they&#x27;re find and work perfect!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for some decent, cheap fine brushes to  create nail art like the ones done by nail technicians.  </li>
            <li> Not only was I very pleased with these brushes but  the speed of which they arrived was quick.  </li>
            <li> took really really really long to arrive, but good brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are long and good quality.</li>
            <li> Super good price, exactly the same one that I bought at sallys for $18...</li>
            <li> They are really skinny so its really easy to do outlines for nail art.</li>
            <li> I really like them!!</li>
            <li> I originally didn&#x27;t like these because the first ones I received the bristles were falling out.</li>
            <li> Honestly if you want to do desigN on nails, these brushes are to long, only good to maybe do lines, one brush I can&#x27;t eve use the brush was all messed up</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting, thank you!</li>
            <li> All of this sellers efforts were greatly appreciated by me!!</li>
            <li> the first brush i used came apart when i tried to clean it.</li>
            <li> The hairs didn&#x27;t hold up to remover the first time I used them and tried to clean them.  </li>
            <li> I used a cotton ball to wipe the bristles clean and the whole bristle casing popped right off the handle!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, they even came in all separate little bags.</li>
            <li> brushes are cheap but considering the price you should expect as much.  </li>
            <li> * Very flimsy and cheap materials&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait if you already have brushes to work with.</li>
            <li> Lastly &amp; more importantly they wash well for reuse  later on!</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t good if you really want to make nice thin, precise lines.</li>
            <li> but I had fun making birthday designs for my nails.</li>
            <li> the shortest one is the only one that really works in application; the second-longest is good for altering designs.</li>
            <li> They will also be useful for animal whiskers.</li>
            <li> I only tried the shortest one and that didn&#x27;t even work nicely on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not as thin of striper as I was looking for, but are great for the value!</li>
            <li> #34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I think they are worth every bit of $2.95.</li>
            <li> Many people ask me how i could do such precise stripes</li>
            <li> Plus they were pretty cheap and they shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Holding up pretty good vs the more pricey one that I have brought in the past.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected in good condition.</li>
            <li> My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work very well, had to re-do my daughter&#x27;s nails over and over again, weren&#x27;t very useful to detail with.</li>
            <li> They feel really lightweight but pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered some other ones that are better.</li>
            <li> likes the pen look would have been better if the hairs were better quality other than that</li>
            <li> I like these, but make sure you clean them right away and then put back in the plastic</li>
            <li> and they are long, is an okay product!</li>
            <li> They worked good other than that.</li>
            <li> The tips of the Brushes fell right out they where not even glued on .</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller &amp; they made it right by sending me another set.</li>
            <li> The price was just right</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> These are a pretty nice tool to use when doing different designs for your clients or even for yourself or a friend.</li>
            <li> I had no idea they made such fine brushes and had not found something this fine in the art stores.  </li>
            <li> Also, I can&#x27;t really tell if the bristles are true Sable or not, so theres another problem.</li>
            <li> for ability to draw fine lines but not very durable.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for something more durable.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and quick to dry too.</li>
            <li> They look cheap, they feel cheap, and they dont even work properly..</li>
            <li> but they work very well for a beginner or someone that hasn&#x27;t had much experience with detailed painting.</li>
            <li> nail design good price  good deal real thin brush</li>
            <li> Came very fast and as promised</li>
            <li> They are very precise, but they are actually quite a bit longer than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> They hold nail polish on them and the bristles stay together good so you can make little designs on your nail.</li>
            <li> While cheaply made, they are easier to clean than wooden brushes.</li>
            <li> They work really well for me, but the brush comes apart where the colored part ends and the white part begins very easily.</li>
            <li> Not sure why other people don&#x27;t like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture.</li>
            <li> It is good to have little brushes to be able to do the tiny stuff with.</li>
            <li> Love the different sizes.</li>
            <li> the actual size of the brushed are perfect but the tops tend to come off (between the color and white)</li>
            <li> (from China) in case your interested.</li>
            <li> These brushes definitely helped me to layer and create interesting edges to each color when painted.</li>
            <li> the ends of the brushes (the bristles) fell out the first time i used them then</li>
            <li> First of all, these are not made of sable.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Overall ok</li>
            <li> love that they have three different sizes</li>
            <li> They fell apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise buying a higher quality set.</li>
            <li> and i got these first off</li>
            <li> exactly what is described in the description</li>
            <li> If you break one, it&#x27;s no big deal because you have two more</li>
            <li> tested them last week works as they should no fraying :)</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> oh and one of them  started loosing the bristles the first time I used it...</li>
            <li> MAKES VERY PRCISE STROKES!</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes thinking that they would hold up better than my last ones</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised how these work for as cheap as they were.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Came exactly when they was suppose t8.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what it said.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> it was not well put together the first time i used one the quil came out of it</li>
            <li> The have made my life as a nail tech so much easier!</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I suggest just spending an extra $1 to get better ones faster.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great and will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> but so far has been just fine and had no issues expect after you wash the polish off, the hairs don&#x27;t stay straight together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not qualified to say they&#x27;re good or bad, so I&#x27;ll rate good.</li>
            <li> These came about a week earlier then expected in great condition.</li>
            <li> The hairs stray the more you use them, they also werent as thin as i wouldve liked them to be.</li>
            <li> I frequently change my nail polish&lt;br /&gt;and enjoy drawing designs but these nail art brushes do not hold up very well</li>
            <li> I love that handles are long and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> The package came very fast and I was very exited to use them.</li>
            <li> They are pretty janky, but for .89 you can&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be nice having brushes to dip into any polish I have and make stripes rather than buying every color in a striper, but it is hard to clean the brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will use but for under $2 I say its a fair deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just pure customer service.</li>
            <li> Pure junk, they came falling apart bristle hair was shedding</li>
            <li> Each brush paints very well and is easy to work with, the 3 different sizes make a world of differece depending on what nail art is being done.</li>
            <li> these will be ok but they are really cheaply made, and not very good for doing any sort of nail art.:</li>
            <li> these brushes are just fine nice and thin</li>
            <li> They make nice lines but still aren&#x27;t as fine and thin as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use them with plain acrylic paints and seal with a top coat and it lasts!</li>
            <li> They are good quality; hard plastic with protective sheaths over the brush hairs.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very abstract.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t complain too much...</li>
            <li> They will keep the hairs from straying and keep them straight and neat.</li>
            <li> but what else should you expect from such a cheap product?</li>
            <li> Straight lines and no hairs have fallen out.</li>
            <li> This is a striper brush but very think.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really use in.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I guess you really get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> They make it soo much easier to use any color nail polish I want to make designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t played with them much</li>
            <li> The plastic slaw is quite flimsy, but it does the job in you are gentle with the way you store them.</li>
            <li> HIGH QUALITY!</li>
            <li> I really like these Nail Art Striper brushes.</li>
            <li> Just as described Thanks</li>
            <li> They came fast, and work very well.</li>
            <li> These brushes have really helped with that.</li>
            <li> These work very well for me.</li>
            <li> The Brussels of the brushes stink and overall there just cheap.</li>
            <li> I really like these stripers.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> The description of pen was very misleading.  </li>
            <li> My lines have to be redone like 4 times, too much of a hassle for me.</li>
            <li> so i dont use them much</li>
            <li> With this product, you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got the order really fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These came really fast, within a week..</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes would be firmer so that I could draw a straight line on my nail.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for all</li>
            <li> But shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was much faster than expected, and my daughter will love them.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a good starter brush set, and at least this was something to play with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for a good deal.</li>
            <li> While the brushes are good they seem to be a bit too thick.  </li>
            <li> Only thing  not so great, very hard to clean and when I do (with nail polish remover)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, except for the one with the long brush.  </li>
            <li> The other was ok.</li>
            <li> The other two in the set are okay.</li>
            <li> The handles are a bit flimsy and the brush part isn&#x27;t very high quality, but it&#x27;s a decent beginner set</li>
            <li> Love to mess around with nails and all the new items out right now for nail art.</li>
            <li> to really GRB onto paint and make a steady line.</li>
            <li> ive ordered 2 already only because I dont know how to clean them....</li>
            <li> brushes are very fine for doing intricate detail work, while the different lengths allow for different paint techniques to apply</li>
            <li> I grow my nails very long so these come in handy for designing my nails with different styles, I like them.</li>
            <li> I fixed them with tape, and they still work well, but it might be worth it to spend a few more dollars and get ones that don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap quality- separates when applying paint causing a mess and unwanted lines and smudges.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The longest one was the mist decent one.</li>
            <li> It came about a week earlier than I expected, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for these brushes.</li>
            <li> I do make sure to always rinse them out after use and put a little cuticle oil on them.</li>
            <li> one of the brushes were a little tattered, but I was able to fix it.</li>
            <li> these were very cheap and stiff.</li>
            <li> The hairs were wild couldn&#x27;t really use them&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Brought the fun back to painting my kids nails.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t heard from her lately to ask if she liked them.</li>
            <li> They also seem to be able to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I need to order a few more.</li>
            <li> the pen part is good sized for big or small hands.</li>
            <li> They make good thin lines.</li>
            <li> new pencils arrive in good condition :) They look like they are made from a chip chip plastic :(</li>
            <li> Now I have to go and find new ones.</li>
            <li> id recommend them to new starters.</li>
            <li> Was excited when I received this package in the mail, I went straight home and started doing my little girl&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> Other than that very good with no fly away hairs and goof for nail designs.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush feels a little cheap because it is hollow plastic, but the price was also cheap so it balances out.</li>
            <li> the tip is the exact same thing as a ballpoint pen tip with a brush coming out</li>
            <li> Getting better with them everyday!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised !</li>
            <li> they work and are a nice little set of nail brushes as long as you know how to use them</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t live near me though</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to throw away my old brushes and use my new brushes.</li>
            <li> I have used them a couple pf times and they are a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order this product because some of the reviews mentioned how cheaply they were made.  </li>
            <li> The brushes come with clear plastic sleeves to slide over the brush hairs.</li>
            <li> but if you want some professional....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, I thought the picture said it all, but it says far from it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are cheaply made and uneven...</li>
            <li> They feel like paint brushes I would buy my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> The hairs are really soft and even come with a plastic case thingy to protect them, I advise you not to throw it away.</li>
            <li> This brushes made my art look professional nail salon quality.</li>
            <li> but I at least would of love to try the product out.</li>
            <li> Bristles have held up to acetone and Polish so far.</li>
            <li> I got them really early too.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to wait until early June, but it came in today.  </li>
            <li> Also, I really appreciated the card you get when you open the package.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t professional, but they work.</li>
            <li> I was so upset because i only really use them like twice</li>
            <li> waste of money, i knew they were cheap</li>
            <li> But can&#x27;t complain too much when the price was so low</li>
            <li> These have done well so far.</li>
            <li> So far they work well,  </li>
            <li> But, they are not firm at all.</li>
            <li> She is 11 years old and is learning to design her nails.  </li>
            <li> These actually surprised me.  </li>
            <li> but the bristles are thin and will draw a nice line.</li>
            <li> The hairs on these nail art pens were really stiff and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> so easy to find storage because they are soo small in with</li>
            <li> The aren&#x27;t fine expensive quality but they&#x27;re not bad.</li>
            <li> Three decent brushes at an extremely low price.</li>
            <li> Great for delicate small lines of detail .  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The brissels arent exatly what i expected but the brushes still work for what i need them for and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> * Hollow plastic held by hot glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a long time waiting for the product :/ I took contact with the seller :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the longer bristled brush (the green one), but I use the other two for pretty much all of my nail art detailing and freehand nail painting.</li>
            <li> It arrived very late, and they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> At first it wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all, but once I used them on my nails they worked so well!</li>
            <li> Granted that it was less than $1.50, I was not expecting the brushes to be hard to control (blue and green brushes), but the red brush is superb!</li>
            <li> The thinnest ones seemed so flimsy and not stiff enough, that I didn&#x27;t even try it.</li>
            <li> I think I need to steer well clear of that brand, in the future.</li>
            <li> when I ordered this product, I was expecting something above &#x27;thrown-together&amp;#34; and professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the blue one three times with no issues so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li> but it sounds like from everyone else&#x27;s reviews that this isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for thin long lines.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a decent quality for the money paid, although I wish I had invested in something a bit more expensive that would actually last.</li>
            <li> I do my nail a lot with other brushes and have not had this much of a problem until now.</li>
            <li> They help me with straight lines and other designs.</li>
            <li> Good thing they weren&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m very careful I can get my moneys worth since I only paid .56 cents for them, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to ordering digital items online only.  </li>
            <li> Yes these were cheap, but the bristles are very flimsy and make it difficult to paint at all.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t professional quality, but far nicer than I expected for what I paid.</li>
            <li> Great for doing thin &amp; thick lines depending on the pressure  </li>
            <li> this is a classic case of NOT LOOKING AT THE PICTURE CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> It is cheep and not as high quality as expected it said it was a three pack</li>
            <li> Not as high quality as I expected</li>
            <li> Cheap and not good quality.</li>
            <li> Cheap is never a good sign.</li>
            <li> made very cheap not impressed at all would rather spend the money and buy some where else would not recommend</li>
            <li> not very good after using it one time brush bristles started to fall right out.</li>
            <li> they are very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t offer much control and the bristles are stiff.</li>
            <li> It was a decent transaction, but after only a few weeks the bristles on my red brush fell out.</li>
            <li> The only brush I really use is the small short one.</li>
            <li> I just have trouble trying to paint anything with these, but again i&#x27;m sure it is in my error since I am not a good artist.</li>
            <li> wow these brushes feel odd in my hand, but they do relatively work well.</li>
            <li> they were really long so that was the only thing that i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> know how long they will last</li>
            <li> Were not smooth and I&#x27;m better off with the bottle of nail polish that come with a thin tip already.      </li>
            <li> They are very stiff and they really don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> These brushes worked really well for the very small dots and such on painted nails.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am not sure how to use but in my opinion, the are cheap and hard to use.</li>
            <li> and they look like fake cheap preschool brush don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to these long bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush set is not professional quality.</li>
            <li> The brush set is not professional quality..</li>
            <li> Wish the brush part weren&#x27;t so long.</li>
            <li> the hairs on the brush fluff out instantly and start falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional nail art specialist</li>
            <li> all they did was stick some hairs thru an empty ball point pen so the actual brush part was sticking out where the ink would come out......</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected especially delivering from overseas.</li>
            <li> but it is too long.</li>
            <li> got this product a week earlier than expected which was a plus.</li>
            <li> The long hair on the Striper brush go in all different directions, not straight, even with polish on.  </li>
            <li> I mean i didn&#x27; pay much for it</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t quite what I had hoped for, but I&#x27;ll definitely still be keeping these close at hand for other minor projects/nail designs.  </li>
            <li> not very high quality</li>
            <li> my only small &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that the numbers in the picture are different from mine, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> One of them has NO bristles at all and the other two have MAYBE a total of 10 between them.</li>
            <li> I like this because i can make some long lines with it!</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected they are to deliciate their just old pen cases and some little bristles comming out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these very much because the pens are literally just really REALLY thin and long brushes.</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking, makes nail art very difficult.</li>
            <li> DO NOT LET NAIL POLISH DRY</li>
            <li> The green and blue are the same size also.</li>
            <li> I normally do not use synthetic brushes because for me they do not rinse well and do not keep their shape.</li>
            <li> They broke after the first use, not happy.</li>
            <li> only down side if you are looking for nail art brushes</li>
            <li> The company sent me a second set and they were less stuff</li>
            <li> I only had to wait about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I receive the package about a week and a half earlier than I was told.  </li>
            <li> They are super expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> The bristles seperate easily which can make it hard to get a thin line.</li>
            <li> I guess with them only being a little ove a dollar</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they can sell it for so little especially since mailing is included.</li>
            <li> Was a little taken back by the product and the fact that you have to fill them yourself but for the price</li>
            <li> The hair is a little to fragile for me</li>
            <li> The handles are made of hollow plastic and don&#x27;t seem like they would take a lot of pressure without breaking.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful of the bristles because they don&#x27;t keep their sleek shape.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money buy regular paint brushes</li>
            <li> its a hollow piece of plastic and</li>
            <li> I waited a couple of weeks for their arrival but they were really not what i expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hollow plastic like a pen the brittsels kinda flare out.</li>
            <li> The handles are hollow plastic.</li>
            <li> The handle as well, is hollow.</li>
            <li> not very durable quality but</li>
            <li> I thought they were retractable detailing tools, not brushes ~ not what I expected.</li>
            <li> These brushes are about what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> till wet then flared..</li>
            <li> just plain white brushes with the colors at the start of the bristles</li>
            <li> but as far as designing things like hearts and stuff they are too long and thin..</li>
            <li> The shipping took a little long.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone other than a student practicing.</li>
            <li> The prices is nothing and this item was an add on to other purchases so there was no shipping involved.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am using item correctly, I have purchased some different ones.</li>
            <li> am not giving the a 5 star, because # 3 bristles were crooked and I am not sure if it will work at all</li>
            <li> So they are not exactly the sturdiest.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Will try other products.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand they were cheep.</li>
            <li> I expected loose hairs and uneven hairs.  </li>
            <li> They are very light and have a hollow plastic base.</li>
            <li> When i applied te nail polish to the brush it was hard to try to make a simple design.</li>
            <li> one of them is broken the red one on the red part has a little crack</li>
            <li> That may sound like a bad thing</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to make designs the brushes are small and thin.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the time you have to wait to get these.</li>
            <li> These ones dry crooked and don&#x27;t allow for thin striping lines.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t put it down.</li>
            <li> Might as well purchase a other brand!</li>
            <li> Waited for like a month and a half for these.</li>
            <li> 3 brushes for less than the price of 1.</li>
            <li> The #3 brush has a slight bend that shouldn&#x27;t be there, but hasn&#x27;t affected use yet.</li>
            <li> Although inexpensive, not really worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I had other brushes but they weren&#x27;t thin enough for striping.</li>
            <li> The brush is stained but for the price and as little as I use it, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> But were not 0, 1 &amp; 2 it was 1,2,3 and got here ride a little out of shape and bent.</li>
            <li> but when u remove the nail polish with remover and let it dry the brushes becomes stiff and hard to use.</li>
            <li> The detailer is not detailed, and using them once, they frayed.</li>
            <li> a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> i actually like that the barrels of these are plastic and thin because i find then easier to hold with just two fingers.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, hate to call it cheap feeling</li>
            <li> The brissles fell off on the nail and got messy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time wasting for it to get here.</li>
            <li> A few frayed ones, but nothing a pair of scissors can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> They are thin enough</li>
            <li> The brushes look like they have firm brushes, but are flimsy &amp; come apart.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiff but serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain much because of the price, but the brushes are flimsy and when mine came, half the tip was bent in a very weird angle.</li>
            <li> I had only tried stripes and they came out sloppy.</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes they were extremely stiff</li>
            <li> brush is stiff ..</li>
            <li> brush is stiff ..</li>
            <li> Since I am a wood bird carver I will not be using these on a daily basis, so I think they will do the job when painting some small and thin details on my carvings.  </li>
            <li> When I received the first set of these brushes one had badly frayed out bristles.</li>
            <li> The largest brush is about as thin as a mechanical pencil led, and about 2 inches long.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, very very cheap, waste of time.</li>
            <li> The brushes ripped right out of them, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little time to arrive, but i got them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are very cheap looking and feeling there just awful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sill an amateur using the brushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;i order alot of items from Asia and am usually pleased,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handles are a little long, makes using them with small hands a little awkward until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Its made of very thin plastic and all the brushes are basically the same length.</li>
            <li> After the first use, even when I properly cleaned them, they got hard and unusable and make the lines look terrible.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is very stiff, even after soaking.  </li>
            <li> it was to hard they will just bend and not have that stiffness it should have</li>
            <li> kinda hard to design</li>
            <li> the bristles are all separated and are really hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Also, the paint is hard to get out of the brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the bristles are hard and mines are bent wouldn&#x27;t buy this thing again</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for almost 6 months now, and at least twice a week, and they have done wonders for me.</li>
            <li> At least they were inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This creates lines that are way too thick.  </li>
            <li> The line is about an inch thick.  </li>
            <li> shipping was quite slow.</li>
            <li> and I think I knew the reason why it is so slow......</li>
            <li> i had put the bristles in acetone for a few seconds and when i went to wipe it the bristles came off!!</li>
            <li> With alot of nail polish on them and patience they can get the job done, but overall I was a little disappointed in the quality of the material.</li>
            <li> but i mean you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I hate this product so much after I used all three they dried out they&#x27;re so hard and know I can&#x27;t use them anymore!!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was one brush&#x27;s plastic protector had slipped off so the bristles were bent and spread apart.</li>
            <li> Brush hair is not good and its not stable material.</li>
            <li> Very hard to paint with these brushes</li>
            <li> The do not paint well at all &amp; the color is very very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> At least when I&#x27;m doing small jobs I can do it without my nails looking crazy.</li>
            <li> However I find it very hard to get really thin lines.</li>
            <li> The brushes were really thin</li>
            <li> They shed and not great at making designs.  </li>
            <li> They do create thin lines on paper</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose but not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I had to supper glue the base of the brush back</li>
            <li> Poor quality brush.</li>
            <li> The worse set of brushes i&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> and so sorry for the late review!</li>
            <li> These are thus far the worst nail brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> the product was missing :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed, but it will do.</li>
            <li> I think Ill find an use.</li>
            <li> I am a nail tech and these brushes are basically useless.  </li>
            <li> i was really not impressed i have been doing nail art for a while</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes were totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Received this today, Nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> but ill whenever i truly needed and if it breaks forever</li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> They are difficult to rinse and you need to sort to scrub the bristles between your fingers to get all the paint.</li>
            <li> The detail liners are made with a weird material.</li>
            <li> very very poor quality</li>
            <li> The brushes are very poorly made.</li>
            <li> it should be very thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are awful not worth the money or time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Horrible quality, not worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that if nail polish remover gets on them they will fall apart</li>
            <li> im afraid to used it</li>
            <li> If you do not then they wil get stale!</li>
            <li> I got so mad</li>
            <li> to...material was alright it wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that these are bad</li>
            <li> badly made..</li>
            <li> Absolutely disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy &#x3D;/</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Low quality, gOT wat I payed for here</li>
            <li> They broke after the first use, not happy.</li>
            <li> meh they are okay but not as good as others so for the price a great deal.</li>
            <li> At first it wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all, but once I used them on my nails they worked so well! I really like them!! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. I have the same brushes purchased at a nail supply store that I paid $10 for. Same quality. Worth the wait if you already have brushes to work with. Received about 5 days after my order was placed</li>
            <li> ....they are a bit flimsy. I won&#x27;t buy again but they are fine for right now. If youa re looking for something that stands the test of time I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> The best line brushes ever.</li>
            <li> The brushes were really thin it was to hard they will just bend and not have that stiffness it should have to...material was alright it wasn&#x27;t that bad but if you want some professional....these are not it!</li>
            <li> I thought the product was going to be good but it isn&#x27;t. kinda hard to design coz polish dries brush.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these brushes !!!!&lt;br /&gt;they are awful not worth the money or time.&lt;br /&gt;they are very cheap looking and feeling there just awful but i guess that why there cheap :p</li>
            <li> i love the assortment, the sizes. i was happy when they came, took these the longest to come, i would like to say, almost a month was passiing by. i ordered them the last week of May, i didnt get them until last week</li>
            <li> I do a lot of nail art on myself and these are perfect!I trimmed them down to a bit of a thinner brush for my own liking, other than that they&#x27;re find and work perfect!</li>
            <li> Great for detail work. Very easy to use and handle. Love the different sizes. Would recommend for beginners doing nail art.</li>
            <li> This product works well for both nail art and face painters.  nice grip and color coding helps you find then in your brush selection quickly.</li>
            <li> the actual size of the brushed are perfect but the tops tend to come off (between the color and white) when cleaning them. Other than that very good with no fly away hairs and goof for nail designs.</li>
            <li> Work great but they are not the best quality.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for some decent, cheap fine brushes to  create nail art like the ones done by nail technicians.  Not only was I very pleased with these brushes but  the speed of which they arrived was quick.  I have recommended these brushes to my nail-art  enthusiastic friends, that&#x27;s how well they work!  Great for doing thin &amp; thick lines depending on the pressure  you apply &amp; easy to flick out for quick fine fast-looking lines.  Lastly &amp; more importantly they wash well for reuse  later on!</li>
            <li> make nice lines on your fingernails</li>
            <li> cheap and break easily.  Imagine a BIC pen with a pit of paintbrush on the end!  The detailer is not detailed, and using them once, they frayed.</li>
            <li> At least when I&#x27;m doing small jobs I can do it without my nails looking crazy. I will continue to buy more products like this.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t professional quality, but far nicer than I expected for what I paid. Shipping was much faster than expected, and my daughter will love them. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to these long bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product&amp;service !! arrived on time!! Thanks</li>
            <li> Came on time and looks like the picture. It does feel very cheaply made but so far has been just fine and had no issues expect after you wash the polish off, the hairs don&#x27;t stay straight together.</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for... It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. I say you should buy it. You won&#x27;t put it down. It&#x27;s great for those detailed designs</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes. Looks very well made and they work wonderfully. (from China) in case your interested.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but seem to be very cheaply made.  I am afraid that if nail polish remover gets on them they will fall apart</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for almost 6 months now, and at least twice a week, and they have done wonders for me. No shedding or any fraying. They do everything i want them to, i have no complaints!</li>
            <li> It is cheep and not as high quality as expected it said it was a three pack and I only received 2</li>
            <li> Darling product, it get&#x27;s the job done as if a professionals was using this product their self.</li>
            <li> These work really good</li>
            <li> Love my brush gives great lines</li>
            <li> Great quality and I am very happy with this product. Great for creating your own unique designs on your nails.</li>
            <li> nice paint brushes! great for detail work.</li>
            <li> these brushes are great for making fine lines and detailing your nails. I would highly recommend them for any one doing their own nails at home</li>
            <li> Hopefully get better with use. Synthetic and not sof enough to really GRB onto paint and make a steady line. Very abstract.</li>
            <li> These brushes I Just Love Em So. They arrived promptly and in mint condition. If Your a nail tech or not ,just looking to purchase a starter nail art brush set, then these are for you.Made well.,You&#x27;ll love Them!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are alright...they are kind of cheap though...I guess with them only being a little ove a dollar you can&#x27;t complain too much...when you rinse the brushes the color doesn&#x27;t go anywhere...</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with how fast this brush set came! It was supposed to be here a week from now. The brush set is not professional quality. It is great for me though because I practice nail art on my own nails only. The handles are made of hollow plastic and don&#x27;t seem like they would take a lot of pressure without breaking. If you aren&#x27;t doing anything but nail art with these then they should work great though. There are three different sizes. The longest brush is great for creating lines,the mid sized brush is great for the same and for making deigns and the smallest brush is great for smaller details. The brushes come with clear plastic sleeves to slide over the brush hairs. KEEP THESE! They will keep the hairs from straying and keep them straight and neat. Over all I think this is a great product. Not the best quality, but very fair for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> These brushes definitely helped me to layer and create interesting edges to each color when painted. Only thing  not so great, very hard to clean and when I do (with nail polish remover) you have to be careful of the bristles because they don&#x27;t keep their sleek shape.</li>
            <li> Whatever coating they used to ship these brushes in, it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to come off. The brushes are maybe meant for acrylic paints?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, I thought the picture said it all, but it says far from it. The brushes are cheaply made and uneven...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> They are not horrible, but definately not the best.    Feel disposable and cheap.  They shed and not great at making designs.  Were not smooth and I&#x27;m better off with the bottle of nail polish that come with a thin tip already.      I was able to make a couple of dots and thats about it.    Might be good for beginners?</li>
            <li> The brushes aren&#x27;t good if you really want to make nice thin, precise lines. the bristles are all separated and are really hard to work with. but what else should you expect from such a cheap product?</li>
            <li> just got my item and to be honest they feel very cheap not just that they look so cheap and i kind of regret buying this item. did not get what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and came in perfect condition. Each brush paints very well and is easy to work with, the 3 different sizes make a world of differece depending on what nail art is being done. These brushes are a staple for nail art and a great buy!</li>
            <li> these will be ok but they are really cheaply made, and not very good for doing any sort of nail art.:(</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone other than a student practicing. I purchased this and the item I received is not the item pictured here. They look like it only cost 2 cents to manufacture all three brushes. Cheap and not good quality.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, but it will do.Lenght of the bristles are almost the same and syntetic.I think Ill find an use.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money buy regular paint brushes very very poor quality the ends of the brushes (the bristles) fell out the first time i used them then after i washed them i had no brush left  BOOOOO</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. Straight lines and no hairs have fallen out. Easy to clean and quick to dry too.</li>
            <li> A great item to make small designs on your nails, the price at the time was more than perfect and I received the brushes way before the time frame and they came appropriately packaged. I&#x27;m sill an amateur using the brushes but I had fun making birthday designs for my nails. Practice makes perfect and this is a nice addition to my nail art supplies.</li>
            <li> These brushes are quite flimsy and do not work well at all but hey, you get what you pay for I know. I&#x27;m thinking about trying to trim away the stray bristles with scissors in hopes of it making my lines more precise when doing my nail art. Good thing they weren&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li> these brushes are just fine nice and thin i use them and they do the job its better with water paint</li>
            <li> loved em already wore mine out used so much. Gonna order much more and tell my friends. LOve the plastic handles, great bristles, perfect fit great grip. LOVE EM</li>
            <li> I thought that the brushes were made of another material, but it is not, is plastic and it is so fragile.</li>
            <li> It looks like they took the inks out of pens and tried to put brushes in the casing. They are very cheap and do not paint very well. Also, the paint is hard to get out of the brush.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are really skinny so its really easy to do outlines for nail art. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Got them early and they are perfect</li>
            <li> I just have trouble trying to paint anything with these, but again i&#x27;m sure it is in my error since I am not a good artist. Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> BITS OF PLASTIC JUST GLUED TOGETHER TO MAKE CHEAP PRODUCT! I DO NOT RECOMMEND  THAT ANY ONE PURCHASE THIS ITEM!</li>
            <li> Cheap material but gets the job done</li>
            <li> Love to do nail art, even though I am not a pro at it.  Love to mess around with nails and all the new items out right now for nail art.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for just a striper brush.  This is a striper brush but very think.  Not find line for great detailing either.  This creates lines that are way too thick.  The line is about an inch thick.  I am a nail tech and these brushes are basically useless.  DO NOT PURCHASE...a waste of money.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t do my nails, but when I saw these I just have to try them when I am painting.  I had no idea they made such fine brushes and had not found something this fine in the art stores.  The prices is nothing and this item was an add on to other purchases so there was no shipping involved.  They are worth a try, and I know know I will be able to do very fine art work.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I do nails in a salon. I thought I was getting a deal... The brushes are very poorly made. I used a cotton ball to wipe the bristles clean and the whole bristle casing popped right off the handle! Very unhappy &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Not that great, oh well. It&#x27;s cheap.. The picture looks great but not that in person. it&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li> Is nice how i can draw with this brushes on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;It took a little time to arrive, but i got them!</li>
            <li> Just decided to share my viewpoint.  I think he brushes are just fine; however, I need to learn how to use them.  I&#x27;m not qualified to say they&#x27;re good or bad, so I&#x27;ll rate good.</li>
            <li> The longer brushes were bent and then frayed after once use. I guess you get what you pay for when it came to this item.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time. First of all, these are not made of sable.  The hairs are some kind of synthetic.  The handles are made of very cheap plastic. They feel like paint brushes I would buy my 3 year old. I put them to the test.  They do create thin lines on paper but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the bristles when trying to do nail art. I needed them to be sable brushes.  Sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> they work and are a nice little set of nail brushes as long as you know how to use them</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. SO cheap. I don&#x27;t know how they can sell it for so little especially since mailing is included.</li>
            <li> well they worked for like awhile then they started sheddding so it wasn&#x27;t that great but while it lasted they were good...</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with how fast this brush set came! The brush set is not professional quality..It is great for me though because I practice nail art on my own nails only...Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fun for nail designs and makes it so easy!</li>
            <li> These brushes arent as great as they seemed on the site. The hairs stray the more you use them, they also werent as thin as i wouldve liked them to be. But i cut them to fix that problem. but they work to do some fine line detail. I wouldnt recommend them to anyone but they&#x27;re good starters.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and they were pleased</li>
            <li> These are very cheap quality- separates when applying paint causing a mess and unwanted lines and smudges. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my brushes.I&#x27;m so glad I found them on here at the great price that I got them for! I do nails and they&#x27;re great design brushes!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Overall ok but they definitely wont last. They are great to practice and see if its worth investing in a better set.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes, can&#x27;t beat the price. Not for pro use but great for novice nail artists.</li>
            <li> I have bought these brushes for myself and all my friends as they work great for nail art.</li>
            <li> great I really like them great package and also very nice sent in package. love that they have three different sizes</li>
            <li> Was a little taken back by the product and the fact that you have to fill them yourself but for the price it fine and they are long, is an okay product!</li>
            <li> Glad to design my kids nails with these great brushes.  Brought the fun back to painting my kids nails.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I like these, but make sure you clean them right away and then put back in the plastic or else they won&#x27;t keep their shape.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, they even came in all separate little bags. They&#x27;re so cute and I use them all the time. They feel really lightweight but pretty strong. The hairs are really soft and even come with a plastic case thingy to protect them, I advise you not to throw it away. They&#x27;re so cute and all-in-all great!</li>
            <li> The price for these made them a great deal and they are perfect for beginners of Nail Art.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner at designing nails. This brushes made my art look professional nail salon quality. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I originally didn&#x27;t like these because the first ones I received the bristles were falling out. The company sent me a second set and they were less stuff and thankfully no bristles fell out. I do like using them. I&#x27;m just starting to branch out in nail art so these are perfect!</li>
            <li> The tips come off. I&#x27;m glad I ordered some other ones that are better. I was more tempted to try these just because Ive seen a lot of people use them. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t these though, because the quality isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li> They fell apart the first time I used them. The tips of the Brushes fell right out they where not even glued on .</li>
            <li> work good but strands come out so I couldn&#x27;t really use them.&lt;br /&gt;recommend for ability to draw fine lines but not very durable.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for something more durable. I frequently change my nail polish&lt;br /&gt;and enjoy drawing designs but these nail art brushes do not hold up very well&lt;br /&gt; kept loosing strands .</li>
            <li> Maybe I am not sure how to use but in my opinion, the are cheap and hard to use. I do my nail a lot with other brushes and have not had this much of a problem until now. I actually read reviews saying this but I purchased anyway. I purchased to do nail art but they do not work very easily to me. Maybe trained people know how to manipulate these to make them work to their advantage. I gave three stars because as with anything I have, I will find a use for it.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money to just go to a beauty supply shop and get quality brushes. These ones dry crooked and don&#x27;t allow for thin striping lines.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.  Polish clumps on the bristles and they are very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> this is a classic case of NOT LOOKING AT THE PICTURE CAREFULLY. when I ordered this product, I was expecting something above &#x27;thrown-together&amp;#34; and professional. instead, when it came it was basically ballpoint pens emptied out and filled with brush bristles. the shortest one is the only one that really works in application; the second-longest is good for altering designs. the longest one, I just couldn&#x27;t get a handle on.</li>
            <li> Waited for like a month and a half for these. They are pretty janky, but for .89 you can&#x27;t expect much. Hopefully they don&#x27;t fall apart when I use them.</li>
            <li> I was excited, when I got it in my mailbox about 2 week. It work pretty good for me, so now I can design my feet.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;d advise buying a higher quality set.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Alright brushes but the color tips fell off so easily on top of the brushes. Wish the brush part weren&#x27;t so long.</li>
            <li> For the price paid this are good brushes.  Since I am a wood bird carver I will not be using these on a daily basis, so I think they will do the job when painting some small and thin details on my carvings.  As I examined these brushes is my opinion that they are not of high quality but is a fair product for the price.</li>
            <li> i was really not impressed i have been doing nail art for a while and i got these first off they took like 2 months to get here and second they look like they were made in some guys garage! its a hollow piece of plastic and the tip is the exact same thing as a ballpoint pen tip with a brush coming out and it all comes apart! when i use the blue one the \\&quot;striper\\&quot; part comes off and falls on my nail and i will not even get into the absolutely horrible brush quality i will never buy this product again and i definitely do not recomend it</li>
            <li> Honestly if you want to do desigN on nails, these brushes are to long, only good to maybe do lines, one brush I can&#x27;t eve use the brush was all messed up and if I was to use it in paint it just Wouldn&#x27;t work out. I&#x27;m waiting to receive these short nail brushes I just bought I&#x27;m excited to get them I think they will work better on details on designs there on amazon n good price.</li>
            <li> longer have them. I got maybe 4 use from them. it was a good price. I will not buy them anymore.</li>
            <li> I rated this 3 stars because for the price being so cheap it didn&#x27;t hurt to try them out but I was worried they would be cheap. The aren&#x27;t fine expensive quality but they&#x27;re not bad. I thought it would be nice having brushes to dip into any polish I have and make stripes rather than buying every color in a striper, but it is hard to clean the brushes. I have to soak them in polish removed and rub it off then wash in soapy water. The brush is stained but for the price and as little as I use it, they get the job done. They make nice lines but still aren&#x27;t as fine and thin as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Got here the day that was supposed to. But were not 0, 1 &amp; 2 it was 1,2,3 and got here ride a little out of shape and bent. So I can&#x27;t really use in. I have to shape it back into place and that takes about two days. so beware because you might not be getting what you think you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li> These are great the price is wonderful please with how fast they arrived ive ordered 2 already only because I dont know how to clean them.... if anyone can give me a tip how I would appreciate it</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be a bit shorter. they were really long so that was the only thing that i didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I like these liners a lot. They are super expensive in stores. They help make awesome fun designs on nails.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast delivery. I received these way before 8/7..  They arrived in good condition. And they are what I have been looking for as a beginner doing nail art.</li>
            <li> When I received the first set of these brushes one had badly frayed out bristles. I contacted the seller &amp; they made it right by sending me another set.</li>
            <li> okay brushes. doesnt have discription name on each brush as in the picture. just plain white brushes with the colors at the start of the bristles</li>
            <li> Great for all thr nail art designs love the fact that its a set of 3 for a really great price it exactly what is described in the description</li>
            <li> I am new to using detail brushes but these are really easy to use on both hands, they are forgiving and give a nice light touch to the detail or design added to a manicure.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for these brushes.  They are very stiff and they really don&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails now and decide to branch out to doing more of my designs so ordered these and they are really good and gives me precise lines and looks professional as my friends still think that I go to get my nails done.</li>
            <li> Yes these were cheap, but the bristles are very flimsy and make it difficult to paint at all. Wouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little to fragile for me but... It&#x27;s still okay for the price. I was just expecting something better. 😃</li>
            <li> The nail art brushes never arrived. It has been over a month. I was really excited to have brought this item.</li>
            <li> While cheaply made, they are easier to clean than wooden brushes. If you break one, it&#x27;s no big deal because you have two more and they&#x27;re cheap. I&#x27;ve used the blue one three times with no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, them will buy more, and would recommend them to another person. They are great, nothing I would change other then I would like some more!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because I needed finer, thinner bristles for nail art detailing. These work perfectly. I don&#x27;t really use the longer bristled brush (the green one), but I use the other two for pretty much all of my nail art detailing and freehand nail painting.</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes were totally useless.  The other was ok.</li>
            <li> I guess you really get what you pay for.... So, I got crap! I ended up giving them to my kids to play with.</li>
            <li> If you do nails and your ALWAYS designing, you need these ASAP! I love these so much, they work amazing!</li>
            <li> the hairs on the brush fluff out instantly and start falling out. I would not buy this again its a waist of a dollar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional nail art specialist though I did work as one about 10 years ago. I have tried different brushes for acrylic paint and these are the best so far.</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my granddaughter- she loves doing her nails! She doesn&#x27;t live near me though and I haven&#x27;t heard from her lately to ask if she liked them. I&#x27;m sure she probably does though!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been waiting for over 2 months already and still haven&#x27;t recieve the product. I mean i didn&#x27; pay much for it but I at least would of love to try the product out. Unsatisfied</li>
            <li> fell apart when i unwrapped it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied and happy about my items, the sable nail art pens does wonders on my art designs that i create on my nails.</li>
            <li> This product is good for the price. It&#x27;s cheap line brushes for beginners great for my use. tested them last week works as they should no fraying :)</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, i felt like it did not work for me. When i applied te nail polish to the brush it was hard to try to make a simple design.</li>
            <li> yay got them yesterday in the mail haven&#x27;t used them yet so assuming so far so good on them. good buy</li>
            <li> you need use it work for nail design good price  good deal real thin brush good dealyou use it more once</li>
            <li> These brushes are good. They hold nail polish on them and the bristles stay together good so you can make little designs on your nail. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The packaging was good and the first time I used them they made straight lines but when u remove the nail polish with remover and let it dry the brushes becomes stiff and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain much because of the price, but the brushes are flimsy and when mine came, half the tip was bent in a very weird angle. 1 out of 3 is sent in good condition, but the brushes still are not so great for nail art, it&#x27;s flimsy and is hard to make anything out of it.</li>
            <li> It was good thought it would&#x27;ve looked better but it was exactly what I expected. I will deff be buying again.</li>
            <li> The brissels arent exatly what i expected but the brushes still work for what i need them for and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> great value! brushes are very fine for doing intricate detail work, while the different lengths allow for different paint techniques to apply</li>
            <li> the first brush i used came apart when i tried to clean it. i had put the bristles in acetone for a few seconds and when i went to wipe it the bristles came off!!</li>
            <li> Used items for nail decor. I am not sure if I am using item correctly, I have purchased some different ones. Because i did not like the results of using these. Item arrived quickly and was intact.</li>
            <li> Love them. They make it soo much easier to use any color nail polish I want to make designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use it all the time to do designs in our nails.&lt;br /&gt;I love it because I could handle it easy.</li>
            <li> made very cheap not impressed at all would rather spend the money and buy some where else would not recommend</li>
            <li> I am going to use these fine tipped brushes to make eye lashes on my people in my oil paintings. They will also be useful for animal whiskers. Just perfect</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these very much because the pens are literally just really REALLY thin and long brushes. The thinnest ones seemed so flimsy and not stiff enough, that I didn&#x27;t even try it. I had thought they were actual pens, not with bristles at the ends, but it was my fault for thinking that. I only tried the shortest one and that didn&#x27;t even work nicely on my nails. I had only tried stripes and they came out sloppy. I ended up throwing them away, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> These came ratter quick, in just 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;They look quite like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving the a 5 star, because # 3 bristles were crooked and I am not sure if it will work at all and yes they look very cheap, like crafted out straw</li>
            <li> I never give reviews but I think this one was merited....... Garbage.... Used them once and yeah... Garbage. Never again. These are thus far the worst nail brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. You get what you pay for for sure.</li>
            <li> Received brushes quickly. Not as thin of striper as I was looking for, but are great for the value!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! I have used all three and they work great! I would recommend these for anyone who loves to do their own designs and doesnt want to buy the stripe polishes in every color!</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for these brushes. I waited a couple of weeks for their arrival but they were really not what i expected. The bristles are really cheap and the handle of the brushes is basically a straw with a cap. Not what I was expecting at all. I guess we get what we pay for!</li>
            <li> These are very good quality and and at a fabulous, can&#x27;t beat price. Would buy again. No problems with the product.</li>
            <li> brushes are cheap but considering the price you should expect as much.  Works well enough</li>
            <li> Their OK there pretty cheap. It&#x27;s just hollow plastic like a pen the brittsels kinda flare out. But they do have a fine tip which is good</li>
            <li> I love these tools they are great i would repurchase these! they make  my nails look soooo much better. also great price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. All 3 are great for nail art, easy to use, and holds the polish or paint well.</li>
            <li> Love these. makes lines easier to make. It works for my needs.They also seem to be able to last a long time.  I have no complaints about these brushes.</li>
            <li> The best nail bar brushes ever! They are so perfect. Good clean lines no mistakes three different sizes the best</li>
            <li> Horrible quality, not worth the buy. Bristles flare after 1 use.</li>
            <li> These came about a week earlier then expected in great condition. If nail art is a hobby for you then i recommend getting these. i used mine in acrylic paint and nail polish, i didnt have any issues with cleaning them. i actually like that the barrels of these are plastic and thin because i find then easier to hold with just two fingers. my only small &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that the numbers in the picture are different from mine, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these, it took a month for me to recieve them. That&#x27;s the only down side if you are looking for nail art brushes</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes for nail art. Varied sizes for different sized lines. Handles are a little long, makes using them with small hands a little awkward until you get used to it. Bristles have held up to acetone and Polish so far. I do make sure to always rinse them out after use and put a little cuticle oil on them. Happy with the quality of these brushes and would suggest them to a friend.</li>
            <li> It was a decent transaction, but after only a few weeks the bristles on my red brush fell out. The brushes are a decent quality for the money paid, although I wish I had invested in something a bit more expensive that would actually last.</li>
            <li> These arrived early which was great.  The price was just right and they work great for nail art.  Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> If they are $0.96 You shouldn&#x27;t expect a lot but I liked them. Mine didn&#x27;t fall apart but what they did do is made cool designs...</li>
            <li> The hairs on these nail art pens were really stiff and cheap feeling. The longest one was the mist decent one.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes were below my expectations. Granted that it was less than $1.50, I was not expecting the brushes to be hard to control (blue and green brushes), but the red brush is superb! *WARNING DO NOT LET NAIL POLISH DRY ON BRUSHES*</li>
            <li> I am happy with these. Just starting to do acquire the supplies to do my own nails, and these seem perfect for a beginner.</li>
            <li> The pens were literally pens w a brush as an end , not bad though. I still like them they work for what I bought them for.</li>
            <li> Definitely my face brushes!</li>
            <li> they are cheap plastic handles but the brushes seem good. they will work for what I want them to do. not very high quality but the bristles are thin and will draw a nice line. I got them really early too.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I ordered. Absolutely superb.</li>
            <li> Cheap is never a good sign. i should&#x27;ve thought of that before buying these. They look cheap, they feel cheap, and they dont even work properly..</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I love these. This is the second time I am ordering and my last set has lasted over a year, i use them all the time. I actually ordered 2 sets this time. Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing they are sturdy and durable i was suppose to get the july 8th but got them wayy before on june 29th i recommend it to anyone its a great price</li>
            <li> Pretty nice nail art set. Haven&#x27;t played with them much but they&#x27;re okay with what I&#x27;ve done with them.</li>
            <li> That may sound like a bad thing but I am most satisfied when I get what I pay for. Great set.</li>
            <li> Got them!!! Exited to use them</li>
            <li> wow these brushes feel odd in my hand, but they do relatively work well. shipping and packing was very good. I just don&#x27;t like the feel off them, oh and one of them  started loosing the bristles the first time I used it... so, I won&#x27;t be getting these again..</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, hate to call it cheap feeling but let&#x27;s just say won&#x27;t last you years. Not sure if I will use but for under $2 I say its a fair deal.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and don&#x27;t make fine lines at all but I guess I got what I payed for - cheap and lousy!&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed but oh well they were like a buck - but I would NOT suggest anyone buys this that intends on using them for fine details, they don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Awful. The bristles are all smushed and not useable.</li>
            <li> They are nice and lite weight. The handles are hollow plastic. The only problem I had was of the brushes hairs was folded in shipping and I can not get it to straighten out.</li>
            <li> I bought them bc they were cheap, and I&#x27;m getting into nail art. they were delivered early, which is always a good thing. lol. one of the brushes were a little tattered, but I was able to fix it. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and cheaply made just as a forewarning. The plastic slaw is quite flimsy, but it does the job in you are gentle with the way you store them.</li>
            <li> They make nail art so easy. Love them!</li>
            <li> Awsome timing n awsome product</li>
            <li> These are great to out line your nail art.</li>
            <li> These are crap! I tried to use them but they performed horribly and ruined my nail art! I threw them away. If I could give them zero stars, I would have. I am 0 for 2 purchasing SHANY Cosmetics products. I think I need to steer well clear of that brand, in the future. I have learned my lesson!</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSHES! HIGH QUALITY! MAKES VERY PRCISE STROKES!</li>
            <li> I just received my set of the brushes and I love them! Makes it a lot easier to do my designs now. Now off to practice, thank you guys!</li>
            <li> I havent used these brushes yet, but I can tell that they are a cheap product. Like I said I have not used them yet i noticed 2 of the brushes have cracks on the ends. If I&#x27;m very careful I can get my moneys worth since I only paid .56 cents for them, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to ordering digital items online only.  Nail art supplies I need to inspect before I buy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disappointed with this order. Items are way cheaper than what is shown in the picture. Serves its purpose but not happy with the product. Its made of very thin plastic and all the brushes are basically the same length.</li>
            <li> After a long time waiting for the product :/ I took contact with the seller :)the product was missing :( he answer the next day and I got another one ship to my place :) Very happy with that :)&lt;br /&gt;The new pencils arrive in good condition :) They look like they are made from a chip chip plastic :( but the pencil work well:) I have to wait son more weeks to see if they are still working good :)&lt;br /&gt;But not complain since the price was just 3 dollars :)</li>
            <li> I really like these Nail Art Striper brushes. They help me with straight lines and other designs.</li>
            <li> Just as described Thanks</li>
            <li> The package came very fast and I was very exited to use them. I have used them a couple pf times and they are a little on the cheap side. With alot of nail polish on them and patience they can get the job done, but overall I was a little disappointed in the quality of the material.</li>
            <li> I was excited about getting the brushes, but when I got them I saw how cheaply made they are. I had to supper glue the base of the brush back int the handle b\c it kept falling out. Also, I can&#x27;t really tell if the bristles are true Sable or not, so theres another problem. But the brushes have come in handy with the detail work that I do. Just remember &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; I think they are worth every bit of $2.95.</li>
            <li> Not as high quality as I expected</li>
            <li> These brushes are AWFUL. One of them has NO bristles at all and the other two have MAYBE a total of 10 between them.</li>
            <li> Great pens for sharp lines</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the bristles are hard and mines are bent wouldn&#x27;t buy this thing again put the price is what you pay for</li>
            <li> The 3 different sizes are great for doing any nail designs. Do be aware that when u clean this brushes (which u should after each use, so the hair isn&#x27;t ruined) be sure to not get any acetone on the plastic part of the pen. It WILL disintegrate the plastic. Idk if acetone free nail polish remover would do any damage - i assume it doesn&#x27;t. However I use acetone so I can tell you that the plastic will melt if comes in contact with the handle. The handle as well, is hollow. So they are not exactly the sturdiest. But for the price, and sizes, this is a great deal nonetheless. I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 6 months, an they&#x27;re still in good condition.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes but MAKE SURE you clean them! If you do not then they wil get stale! So please take care of them and do not make the same mistake I did.</li>
            <li> Noooo. Very hard to paint with these brushes</li>
            <li> I received my brushes and they are great I plan ordering more from the company if you haven&#x27;t purchased and please do so their great tool to have</li>
            <li> The brissles fell off on the nail and got messy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting, thank you!</li>
            <li> These pens r really neat they do an awesome job of detailing on your nail.. Easy to use and goes on good..</li>
            <li> Received these pens, they dont even have the same writing on them as they do in this picture. they are not numbered 1, 2 or 3 they are numbered 0, 00, and 000.  Waste of money and time wasting for it to get here. BUT you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> These are crappy brushes.  They are like bic pens with hair instead of the ball tip.  The largest brush is about as thin as a mechanical pencil led, and about 2 inches long.  What use is that?!?!  The hairs didn&#x27;t hold up to remover the first time I used them and tried to clean them.  At least they were inexpensive.  I was just looking for a good starter brush set, and at least this was something to play with.</li>
            <li> They arrived in perfect condition, and do a great job of making straight, precise lines. The different sizes can be used for different sized stripes. They are good quality; hard plastic with protective sheaths over the brush hairs. I&#x27;ve used them many times doing my nails, and I love them!</li>
            <li> They came fast, and work very well. Many people ask me how i could do such precise stripes and I tell them its the stripers! I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments and look amazing. Let me tell you, BUY THESE!</li>
            <li> This are very fine point easy to use</li>
            <li> I bought these because I do a lot of nail art. After the first use, even when I properly cleaned them, they got hard and unusable and make the lines look terrible. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I like this because i can make some long lines with it! perfect nails, perfect designs! Perfect line finishing! Love them!</li>
            <li> i Bought This brushes and they are really good for Detailing and Fine Nail Art Work at First you Have to practice To know how to work with the brushes but then you,ll get used to working with the brushes</li>
            <li> Very good for doing designs on your nails. I would recommend these if you like doing designs on your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start off with how quickly they shipped. I was prepared to wait until early June, but it came in today.  I only had to wait about a week and a half. So 5 stars on that. Also, I really appreciated the card you get when you open the package. It&#x27;s just pure customer service. Nice to know that If I wasn&#x27;t happy, I would be getting help to make me more satisfied with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that these are bad brushes- they aren&#x27;t. However, you get what you pay for. Three decent brushes at an extremely low price. What more could you ask for? They aren&#x27;t professional, but they work. The handles are plastic, and the bristles on the brushes are in pretty good condition. A few frayed ones, but nothing a pair of scissors can&#x27;t handle. Also, when you go to dip it into the nail polish, I am sure they will stick together just fine. Great service, great timing. Very pleased. If I need more, I will be coming here. Worth the buy! Do it, do it, do it!</li>
            <li> Received this today, Nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> These brushes were cheap and the bristles on them were messed up. I know they say you get what you pay for and its true.  I thought they would be a good starter but i was sorely mistaken.</li>
            <li> these were very cheap and stiff. I was so upset because i only really use them like twice and when i tryed cleaning them off it was the worst the brushes dnt stick together at all then my darn dog got a hold of them and ate them to pieaces.</li>
            <li> great deal for daughter to learn and experiment with nail art</li>
            <li> great for detailing and super price</li>
            <li> Make fine lines. Happy :)</li>
            <li> This brushes are really cheap made I was painting my nails and when I washes them the brush hair just came off!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these over a week ago &amp; just got them yesterday. shipping was quite slow. it was part of my mother&#x27;s birthday, 4 days ago! but overall the product is as described &amp; is a good deal.</li>
            <li> one of them is broken the red one on the red part has a little crack &gt;.&lt; im afraid to used it but ill whenever i truly needed and if it breaks forever oh well its was only $4 plus shipping</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes thinking that they would hold up better than my last ones I was wrong they are very cheap and dont lay my paint well i would advise noone to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I am def glad that I bought these. I paint my nails a LOT and do many diff designs. These brushes have really helped with that. Plus they were pretty cheap and they shipped fast!</li>
            <li> They are soo easy to clean off&lt;br /&gt;And so easy to find storage because they are soo small in with</li>
            <li> The only brush I really use is the small short one. They are very light and have a hollow plastic base. When I got the brushes they were extremely stiff so I just cleaned them with some brush cleaner (purchased at my local beauty supply store). The longer ones did not make very clean lines, as they had some of the brush fibers halfway coming out, so I just trimmed them off with scissors</li>
            <li> While the brushes are good they seem to be a bit too thick.  They should be much more thinner since when you are makeing a stripe it should be very thin</li>
            <li> I received my stripers today. I&#x27;m very pleased. They are thin enough so I don&#x27;t have to cut them. I can&#x27;t wait to throw away my old brushes and use my new brushes. I&#x27;m a sucker for a good deal. 3 brushes for less than the price of 1.</li>
            <li> gift to my manicurist she loves them</li>
            <li> Great tool.. could not be happier.. :)</li>
            <li> Not sure why other people don&#x27;t like these, The brushes arrived in perfect condition,I received this package in the mail, the brush set is not professional quality, but It is great for me, because I practiced nail art on my own nails, make beautiful lines The handles are made of hard plastic, the only thing is the brushes that i purchased are not the same as the picture.</li>
            <li> The brush part kind of just separates after you used it so it couldn&#x27;take good lines and they were just plastic pens with a brush on the end</li>
            <li> I love them. Makes it much easier to make designs the brushes are small and thin. I should&#x27;ve bought them before. Thank you</li>
            <li> * Delivery was faster than expected.&lt;br /&gt;* Very flimsy and cheap materials&lt;br /&gt;* Hollow plastic held by hot glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how long they will last but once they are ruined I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with these. I received them very quickly and they&#x27;re great for what you pay. I haven&#x27;t had anything break or not work. These work very well for me.</li>
            <li> The review of the product was extremely mid leading. The Brussels of the brushes stink and overall there just cheap.</li>
            <li> great for graffix design painting not just nails</li>
            <li> I really like these stripers. Great for doing detailed nail art. Easy to clean. Holding up pretty good vs the more pricey one that I have brought in the past.</li>
            <li> Good price and nice sizes. It should work fine for its intended use. This wasn&#x27;t for me, rather a birthday gift for my daughter, so I can&#x27;t say specifically whether she will enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay. But the package could be better and it would be more usefull if there was a usersguide.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised how these work for as cheap as they were.  Great for practicing nail art. Getting better with them everyday!</li>
            <li> They are perfect for me painting my nail designs!! I love that handles are long and very sturdy! Will be buying myself another set soon!</li>
            <li> all they did was stick some hairs thru an empty ball point pen so the actual brush part was sticking out where the ink would come out......yea</li>
            <li> GOOD TO DESIGN MY NAILS HOW I WANT THEM TO LOOK. PLUS HAVE A GREAT TIME INVENTING NEW ART ON MY NAILS</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the shipping time. It arrived sooner than expected especially delivering from overseas. The quality of the brush feels a little cheap because it is hollow plastic, but the price was also cheap so it balances out.</li>
            <li> its ok not crazy over them but for the price its great I would buy again because the price is right.</li>
            <li> i love it so much they work great i love it so much i use it all the time love it</li>
            <li> Cheap, arrived right on time, not damaged and exactly what i needed :) will absolutly buy all my nail supplies from here. very happy customer</li>
            <li> The long hair on the Striper brush go in all different directions, not straight, even with polish on.  There&#x27;s no way that the brush will paint clean stripes.  The other two in the set are okay.</li>
            <li> Nail art stripper brushes, great price. I will recommend to others</li>
            <li> Easy to use, except for the one with the long brush.  It is nice that it makes fine lines but it is too long.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for nail art designs. I love them. I need to order a few more. You can never have to many good brushes.</li>
            <li> waste of money, i knew they were cheap but these are flimsy and useless.&lt;br /&gt;i order alot of items from Asia and am usually pleased,&lt;br /&gt; not this time</li>
            <li> so not buy this product! it was a total waist of money! made very cheaply and dose not work at all!</li>
            <li> 哈哈 买到了中国同胞的东西 异常开心:-D 快递慢的真正原因：D&lt;br /&gt;Wow I bought this thing from China~ I&#x27;m Chinese and I think I knew the reason why it is so slow......</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted these to make nail designs. They work well and for the money are pretty good.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes and thought they would be awesome! I finally used them and they literally fell apart as I was using them. All I was doing was striping a customers nails and the hairs literally came apart. It took forever to clean up and I had to start the design process all over again. Now I have to go and find new ones. Do not buy these. Save yourself the hassle.</li>
            <li> The bristles seperate easily which can make it hard to get a thin line. But for the price theyre nice.</li>
            <li> Came very fast and as promised</li>
            <li> Well... Let&#x27;s just say &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. I won&#x27;t be getting these again.</li>
            <li> not very durable quality but daughter loved it for her needs</li>
            <li> it came before schedule, and it is a good stuff that I need. Love to got this.</li>
            <li> It is good to have little brushes to be able to do the tiny stuff with. They work very well.</li>
            <li> Easy for super fine lines and details! Brushes are great and will last me a long time! No hairs falling out and are as described! Great item &amp; GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> Work great and can get good details painted on. It&#x27;s easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li> Saw someone post on FB - in an ad for oil painting hair strands  -  tried it  and these brushed are strong but very fine  &amp; work great for detail</li>
            <li> These are great brushes!</li>
            <li> terrible prouduct!!!!! do not buy. i threw this away</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for nail art. I love to paint with them. They make good thin lines. I give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These brushes worked really well for the very small dots and such on painted nails. They have helped my granddaughter create some stunning fingernails. A good quality item.</li>
            <li> got this product a week earlier than expected which was a plus. i like them i just feel like they&#x27;re cheaply made but i mean you get what you pay for so i cant complain. i&#x27;ve used them and work good. check out my instagram: ahah_ari, to see how they work</li>
            <li> Great for delicate small lines of detail .  Good quality brushes and very low price.  The shipping took a little long. But can&#x27;t complain too much when the price was so low</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected they are to deliciate their just old pen cases and some little bristles comming out. The green and blue are the same size also.</li>
            <li> I normally do not use synthetic brushes because for me they do not rinse well and do not keep their shape. These have done well so far. They are difficult to rinse and you need to sort to scrub the bristles between your fingers to get all the paint.</li>
            <li> The description of pen was very misleading.  I thought they were retractable detailing tools, not brushes ~ not what I expected.</li>
            <li> These are fairly nice quality brushes for the price. A good variety of brush lengths for nail art. I was pleasantly surprised !</li>
            <li> These are a pretty nice tool to use when doing different designs for your clients or even for yourself or a friend. Not overly priced so worth having around to be able to do a great job.</li>
            <li> took really really really long to arrive, but good brushes</li>
            <li> The detail liners are made with a weird material. My lines have to be redone like 4 times, too much of a hassle for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected in good condition. The bristles are a little stiff but serves its purpose. Good for nail art newbies.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to order this product because some of the reviews mentioned how cheaply they were made.  Seriously though, they are super inexpensive so I ordered them anyway.  So glad I did!  I had other brushes but they weren&#x27;t thin enough for striping. These are perfect!  Great for detailing!</li>
            <li> I lovve this item. I see alot of my youtube friends using them and now I have a set.  And the price was right.</li>
            <li> not the best when it comes to sway motion.... hooks more... brush is stiff ..&lt;br /&gt;not the best when it comes to sway motion.... hooks more... brush is stiff ..</li>
            <li> Takes forever to ship (about a month) but they are pretty cheap and they work well for most nail art. However I find it very hard to get really thin lines.</li>
            <li> i liked them when i first seen them but after having them for some time i realized that i had no use for them so i dont use them much but they are a good bye if your into nail art.</li>
            <li> Fun gift for preteen/teen girl who enjoys designing their own nails</li>
            <li> These brushes are about what I expected for the price. The handles are a bit flimsy and the brush part isn&#x27;t very high quality, but it&#x27;s a decent beginner set and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It came about a week earlier than I expected, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> For the price they&#x27;re good. The #3 brush has a slight bend that shouldn&#x27;t be there, but hasn&#x27;t affected use yet. Happy with them.</li>
            <li> With this product, you really get what you pay for. They work really well for me, but the brush comes apart where the colored part ends and the white part begins very easily. I fixed them with tape, and they still work well, but it might be worth it to spend a few more dollars and get ones that don&#x27;t break. Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Was excited when I received this package in the mail, I went straight home and started doing my little girl&#x27;s nails. They didn&#x27;t work very well, had to re-do my daughter&#x27;s nails over and over again, weren&#x27;t very useful to detail with. I got so mad I just threw them away! Never again will I be purchasing any brushes from seller.</li>
            <li> Doing my nails just got a but easier for the  its. I&#x27;m in love!!!!!! This is definitely a must have ladies and</li>
            <li> The brushes are long and good quality. the pen part is good sized for big or small hands. They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> great item and priced right</li>
            <li> I hate this product so much after I used all three they dried out they&#x27;re so hard and know I can&#x27;t use them anymore!! Might as well purchase a other brand!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Brushes are so cheap and dont hold nail polish well, and make lines uneven and messy.</li>
            <li> When I got them the brush part was bent</li>
            <li> Cheap but for the price what do you expect.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not pointed. Poor quality brush. I had to cut some of the hairs to make the line thinner and to make the brush pointer.</li>
            <li> The brushes look like they have firm brushes, but are flimsy &amp; come apart. The do not paint well at all &amp; the color is very very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Remember you get what you pay for, these are nothing fancy but overall do what they need to do. I only use them for stripes nothing else.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t quite what I had hoped for, but I&#x27;ll definitely still be keeping these close at hand for other minor projects/nail designs.  If you want super intricate details I wouldn&#x27;t start with these though ...</li>
            <li> Not the best brushes... they were cheap, which is what I paid for, I guess. They don&#x27;t offer much control and the bristles are stiff. I keep them around, as I can find use for them, but they aren&#x27;t the fluid brushes I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> these were awesome! very easy to work with....very easy to clean. definitely makes all the &amp;#34;harder&amp;#34; designs easier to do. a must have if you do any bit of nail art. I loved them!</li>
            <li> I need more practice but over all these work well. :)</li>
            <li> The hairs were wild couldn&#x27;t really use them&lt;br /&gt;I likes the pen look would have been better if the hairs were better quality other than that I got the order really fast</li>
            <li> Came exactly when they was suppose t8. Easy to use and I would recommend these brushes for doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Although inexpensive, not really worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, but it you know how to alter your brushes this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the time you have to wait to get these. I would not recommend buying these.</li>
            <li> I recieved my brushes yesterday and used them yesterday. So far they work well,  there weren&#x27;t any bristles falling off or anything. These definitely aren&#x27;t for an expert but they work very well for a beginner or someone that hasn&#x27;t had much experience with detailed painting. The shipping was faster than they had predicted. The only bad thing was one brush&#x27;s plastic protector had slipped off so the bristles were bent and spread apart. This may be fixable though.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is so cheap ... If I were you, I don&#x27;t buy it ....</li>
            <li> Is what it is cheap.. will melt in acetone. .works till wet then flared..</li>
            <li> Very nice and got them quicker then expected.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot. They are very precise, but they are actually quite a bit longer than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> They were ok but a little on flimsy side but for the price they were good</li>
            <li> They are horrible I can&#x27;t even do a line with these, the strands go every which way</li>
            <li> very good at making designs</li>
            <li> Its exactly what it said. Great brushes. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> The worse set of brushes i&#x27;ve ever purchased.  They are very cheap.  The brush itself is very stiff, even after soaking.  They do not work like they claim.  Horrible, very very cheap, waste of time.</li>
            <li> These came really fast, within a week.. line work they do a pretty good job but as far as designing things like hearts and stuff they are too long and thin.. great for beginners and people figuring out if they like to do nailart.. id recommend them to new starters.</li>
            <li> it was not well put together the first time i used one the quil came out of it and i havent been able to use it since</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> These brushes ROCK! The have made my life as a nail tech so much easier! So easy to hold and do the work for me! I use them with plain acrylic paints and seal with a top coat and it lasts!</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before I purchased this product. It arrived very late, and they are very cheaply made. I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I grow my nails very long so these come in handy for designing my nails with different styles, I like them.</li>
            <li> Pure junk, they came falling apart bristle hair was shedding and they look like fake cheap preschool brush don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered. Kinda cheaply made BUT it gets the job done perfectly!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t paint very well and are cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Definitely wish I had looked this over before ordering it. It was supposed to take a month to get here but never did. Since I don&#x27;t actually have it I can&#x27;t speak of its quality but it sounds like from everyone else&#x27;s reviews that this isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes would be firmer so that I could draw a straight line on my nail.  But, they are not firm at all.</li>
            <li> I just got these in today. Only the shorter two of the three were even close to useable. The longest one looked like a truck backed over it.</li>
            <li> Nice trio of brushes. Work as good as you can use them. They looked just like the ones pictured here.</li>
            <li> I receive the package about a week and a half earlier than I was told.  The brushes were shipped in a bubble wrap packet and the seller took the time to wrap the individual packets (2) of brushes in extra bubble wrap to doubly protect the brushes from damage in shipping.  I especially appreciate the extra effort the seller went to, protecting my brushes since I&#x27;m an artist and the condition of my brushes is critical in using them for my paintings.  I had the idea of nail art brushes in order to paint tiny details in faces and such in my paintings....these brushes have met my hopes tremendously...I am so thrilled with what I am able to do with these brushes in my paintings! In addition, the seller added a personal touch in including a card thanking me for my purchase and my patience in waiting for the arrival of my order.  I thought this gesture was wonderful and I will always, in the future, order from this seller when items I am looking for are offered by this seller!  Thank you very much to the seller!!!  All of this sellers efforts were greatly appreciated by me!!</li>
            <li> Its something you can make yourself, take the ink stick out of a pen and stick some feathers in in a vuala you have these. Would not reccomend anyone to buy these. Take forever to get to you and I was not the least bit impressed</li>
            <li> These are perfect for nail art.  they are really fine and work great.  I am happy with this purchase.  Price was great as well.</li>
            <li> Brush hair is not good and its not stable material. Plastic handle brush tip keep coming out of handle.</li>
            <li> These are horrible quality! I suggest just spending an extra $1 to get better ones faster. I honestly was expecting something I could use. These are coming apart and the ends don&#x27;t stay in! TERRIBLE! What a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Super good price, exactly the same one that I bought at sallys for $18...this is a deal!Fast and convinient!!!! Good for desings</li>
            <li> Worked great. Nice clean lines. Quality of brushes were subpar but for the price they are fine</li>
            <li> really good guality good handles</li>
            <li> Have not used it a lot. Still They fray a bit at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been better. Will try other products.</li>
            <li> The brushes ripped right out of them, I was really disappointed. They worked good other than that.</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking, makes nail art very difficult.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for thin long lines. Good price.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves them.  She is 11 years old and is learning to design her nails.  Great quality and great service.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Thanks for my set for Nail Art, those are cute and convenient!... The price, shipping and set are perfect!... Thanks for all and so sorry for the late review!</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughters are all caught up in this wild nail craze and this made the top of their wish list. They love it but now I want one for my craft room.</li>
            <li> These actually surprised me.  For the price I paid I expected loose hairs and uneven hairs.  What I got were even hairs and no hairs falling out.  Great buy and very useful!</li>
            <li> not very good after using it one time brush bristles started to fall right out. But on the other hand they were cheep.</li>
            <li> Came to me broke and bristles where frayed out... badly made.. I threw them away the day I got them. But shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap brushes , I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
