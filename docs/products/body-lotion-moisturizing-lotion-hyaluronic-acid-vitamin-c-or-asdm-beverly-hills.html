            <li> I will use it up because it&#x27;s far too expensive to just toss or even give away, but I will not purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this along with bio oil and a pair of exfoliating gloves when I bathe for the stretch marks that I have on my stomach from child birth for the past couple of weeks.</li>

            <li> Returned item, had strong odor.</li>
            <li> I also the lotion, but don&#x27;t care for the smell&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too strong&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion - has a mild Rose scent....very moisturizing...skin stays moisturized</li>
            <li> I know some people complained about the rose scent, but it doesn&#x27;t hang with you all day. I can maybe smell it for an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lotion.  I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I give this lotion 5 stars I live in Spokane and my skin has never felt so moist arised all day long. I have ordered my second bottle and I use it very sparingly because of the cost. Wish I could get this at a cheaper price but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good! It really helped my skin because of the hyaluronic acid, which helps with dark spots. It has also helped my keratosis pilaris. It has natural ingredients and it feels great. My husband loves the smell too :)</li>
            <li> Creamy, makes your skin feel wonderful.  Just what dry summer months need!!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion very much.  It hydrates the skin a lot.  I would order this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE M.C.S. AND STRONG SMELLS DID CAUSE ME TO HAVE A SERVERE REACTION --&lt;br /&gt; PLEASE CAN I RETURN THIS  ??</li>
            <li> I was not real happy with this product because it has Rose Extract or water in it &amp; I&#x27;m not too keen on that scent.  But I used it &amp; I might re-Order it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice. It is hydrating and the smell is absolutely wonderful. The best smelling lotion that I have ever used hands down. I have been using this along with bio oil and a pair of exfoliating gloves when I bathe for the stretch marks that I have on my stomach from child birth for the past couple of weeks. All I can say is wow. My stretch marks have almost diminished I give it about another couple of weeks and they will probably be completely gone!</li>
            <li> smells nice feels great -like the consistency of the lotion</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. You need to make a different scent, something more &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smelling and not roses.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking that if something was expensive then it had to work and be the best, right?  Not so in this case.  For the price paid, this lotion should have turned me into a goddess all the while singing and dancing and solving the war on terror.  It does, however, have some redeeming qualities.  My hands are soft, and I enjoy the fresh herbal/floral scent.  I will use it up because it&#x27;s far too expensive to just toss or even give away, but I will not purchase this again.  I will go back to my CeraVe SA.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  I honestly can see the firmess on my neck every since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Not for me -- it smells intensely of roses.  It might be great for women, I guess...</li>
            <li> Great product ... moisturizes and firms skin.</li>
            <li> I like the product, just don&#x27;t like the smell....too much of a rose smell for me.</li>
            <li> was what expected and seller ships fast</li>
