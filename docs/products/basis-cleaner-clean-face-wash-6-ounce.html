            <li>this is still available online.  </li>
            <li>Love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product several years ago, and find it to be a great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>People, there is a reason this cleanser is so cheap compared to others, because they use cheap ingredients.</li>
            <li>So cheap and works wonders.</li>
            <li>Great facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it has natural ingredients and smells really nice without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so I use a separate product for weekly exfoliating to get rid of dead skin cells (which is important for skin to look its best).  </li>
            <li>First, this thing smells like paradise!!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does a pretty damn good job at cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use much at all, as it foams up very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective at removing makeup  without stripping your skin of essential moisture.  </li>
            <li>This is BY FAR a superior clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Gets your skin squeaky clean and keeps it blemish free.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses it and our skin looks pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>is very fresh smelling and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It rinses off quickly, with a fantastic light scent.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a male) and it works good to get off the oils from post-workout or after a run/bike/hike and easy on the body as well</li>
            <li>I love this Basis wash -- it&#x27;s the most gentle and economical face wash I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I remember why I love it so much!</li>
            <li>So glad, and to purchase it in a bundle really helps!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it leaves my face feeling very clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>but even he commented on the clean smell.</li>
            <li>I like Cetaphil, but it wasn&#x27;t leaving my face feeling quite as squeaky clean as I like.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years to clean my face  </li>
            <li>It also has a clean and neutral scent, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with cologne or aftershaves.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 and will continue to use Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash.</li>
            <li>it just feels clean and washes away all of the oils and dirt.</li>
            <li>but you can feel how clean your face is after each use.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin with a bit of a T zone issue and it cleans all of my face along with being a great make-up remover.  </li>
            <li>I miss my Olay cleanser that lathered with a creamy foam and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t lather as well, but it does seem to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Basis cleaner clean for over 8 years.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It starts to foam up, smells clean, and makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and not oily after using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>Smells great and my normal skin definitely looks more radiant without over drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It completely removes my makeup, which I love, and it even claims to remove pollution!</li>
            <li>Sure, if you start with a clean face it will clean your face, but it absolutely does NOT remove makeup.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, I will be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and smells fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>it it clean smelling, lathers up nicely and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use; when my skin is breaking out I clense with this first and then apply acne medication.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive or normal skin.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li>Love this product, really cleans well without over drying.</li>
            <li>this one is and it makes your face feel super clean.</li>
            <li>This is good for daily use.</li>
            <li>but your face becomes super clean.</li>
            <li>Product has a nice, gentle scent and it a nice enough cleanser.</li>
            <li>Such a good deal.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this gentle yet thorough cleanser for me to try instead of the more aggressive one I had been using.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that my skin was producing its own excess oil to combat the natural oils that were being stripped away.</li>
            <li>This has a light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Basis&amp;#34; face wash has been my go-to facial cleanser for over a year, and I&#x27;ve found it to be quite a good product.</li>
            <li>and it works great to not dry my skin out too much after I use it.</li>
            <li>Everyone is right; this stuff is amazing, soft and naturally clean.</li>
            <li>Great product for oily skin like mine or any other skin type.  </li>
            <li>It gets my face clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Your face feels so fresh and so clean after.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean and cuts through the oil that builds up over night or throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser that was mild yet cleaned my face well</li>
            <li>I really like how light and smooth</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to be able to find a source to get this from on a regular basis</li>
            <li>For the quality and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Cleaner clean is about right.</li>
            <li>Nice product, gentle but gets all the makeup off and smells light and natural.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this face cleaner which was recommended to me by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Deeply clean, rich suds immediately, soft, gentle cleaner that leaves you with a very refreshed face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the face wash does have a nice, clean scent and a bottle of this will last you a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good basic cleaner leaves your skin</li>
            <li>So, I tried looking for a cheaper product that would just clean my face gently yet give me a clean feel</li>
            <li>I also cannot say how it works on acne because I have not suffered from that since my teenage years (thankfully!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: a very good basic skin cleanser for men and women at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>If you use the gel straight, it would be too drying for your skin, but if you dilute in water (use a soap-pump), it&#x27;s FANTASTIC for a face-wash.</li>
            <li>This does a great job at cleansing without being harsh or drying.</li>
            <li>I really like light</li>
            <li>The price is totally  worth it.</li>
            <li>This face wash is a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled that Amazon sells Basis facial wash, as I can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li>Others on the market charge much more for what I feel is a far inferior product.</li>
            <li>but I have skin that is sensitive to most  products (I get a burning feeling within seconds if the product doesn&#x27;t work for me)</li>
            <li>This is a nice basic face wash.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell that is gender neutral--not too floral or feminine, and not too masculine either (such as pine or musk).  </li>
            <li>This one is actually better: just as gentle, leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; clean &amp; not at all irritated.  </li>
            <li>though I wouldn&#x27;t use it for body-wash since you&#x27;d go through it all pretty quick.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like cream washes, just want something that will gently foam up when you get it wet, smells nice and clean and this is IT!  </li>
            <li>Soft, non drying, clean light scent, and comes in a 4 pack</li>
            <li>Product has a decent odor, however I think there are too many skin irritants in this product, like a lot of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which my skin really does not appreciate.</li>
            <li>I use it right before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>, even waterproof mascara dissolves right off.</li>
            <li>This face wash is just right.</li>
            <li>Basis cleanser does not foam up right out of the bottle like the Aveeno, but rather it&#x27;s a gel like consistency and needs to be rubbed together in your hands to build up the lather.  </li>
            <li>Light breakouts as I&#x27;ve gotten older are diminished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, and leaves my face clean.</li>
            <li>The Basis smells nice, with a light slightly floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Over four weeks of using this product caused my mild acne to become more than moderate.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this amazing product is hard to find and I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I tried it after trying several other brands and stuck with it because it is the absolute best out there.  </li>
            <li>I know it will arrive at exactly the right time</li>
            <li>I use it under more expensive moisturizers and have a great result.</li>
            <li>The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle wash.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle, but thorough face cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle</li>
            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>This cleanser works so well, very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff IS VERY CONCENTRATE, so you&#x27;ll get your money worth.  </li>
            <li>My regular store has discontinued carrying it or even being able to order it for me...</li>
            <li>I only wished it came in a more convenient pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, especially the scent.</li>
            <li>As a side note I don&#x27;t remember how I received it that year because I wasn&#x27;t living on campus, but so very grateful I did!</li>
            <li>I would be willing to try this product again if it was truly made of natural/organic components (no lauryl/laureth sulfates) and is 100% not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Basis for years when I first found in at Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this after getting a sample in a race bag over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>My local CVS sells it for more than $6</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial wash.  </li>
            <li>the only face wash that i love but can&#x27;t find anywhere except on amazon</li>
            <li>I first bought this product at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and makes your skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get more basic than this!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Love this line for daily use.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I just go this in the mail, turned it over and saw sodium laureth sulfate in one of the first ingredients.</li>
            <li>My daughter pairs it with a Neutrogena gel that is sadly no longer in production.  </li>
            <li>but when she uses it consistently her skin is noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product highly, would purchase again and again!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons - this one smells great, removes my makeup (I typically do two quick washes if I&#x27;m using it at night) and is totally affordable.</li>
            <li>2/3 of it left so you can tell that the result weren&#x27;t as great as expected.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so clean and clear.</li>
            <li>it was it would clean and clear your face</li>
            <li>get the &amp;#34;all clean an clear bar&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Skin is clean and soft.</li>
            <li>And I like the soft and clean fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>It smells really softly like mint or basil and it really great for cleaning, it&#x27;s not harsh at all and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin is soft and clean after use.  </li>
            <li>Its gentle on my skin and still is potent enough to get rid of my waterproof eye make up.</li>
            <li>Instead, they combine to create a unique smell that is slightly citrus, light, and fresh without smelling chemical or artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin and reasonable cost!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an all-in-one product but does exactly what I would hope for from a gentle face wash.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and even then you can only smell it while applying it.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;m over a certain age</li>
            <li>It foams very well and lasts long enough for you to get a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and refreshed and it&#x27;s the kind of clean that feels like there is no residue left behind.</li>
            <li>It leaves me with the very clean feeling I was looking for, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>A few weeks later, when I followed up with my dermatologist and he asked what I was using, I told him how great Basis was working for me.  </li>
            <li>My husband even likes it because it isn&#x27;t very fragrant and it only has a light hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet it cleans my face thoroughly.</li>
            <li>subscribe and save, this product is really affordable.</li>
            <li>It came in a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser took off my make-up and really gave me balanced results--</li>
            <li>My wife says this washes her face very well.</li>
            <li>Makes you take a second out of your day to enjoy what you are doing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely gentle as well.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup well and feels gentle.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid Neutrogena, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Not so gentle around the eyes</li>
            <li>I have never noticed anything offensive or unusual about its smell as some have commented on.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li>It gently removes dirt make up and excess oil without skin irratation.</li>
            <li>My acne becomes very inflamed and all I see is redness.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want to buy 4</li>
            <li>Buying a face cleanser is really about what type of skin you have, how your skin is affected during the season and so on.</li>
            <li>this is a real reliable winner.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest it!</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>I still moisturize it (with Lancome Bienfait Multivital for those interested), but immediately after washing it still feels normal.</li>
            <li>but it does control acne very well and cleans my shave area very well</li>
            <li>it really did wash my face very well.</li>
            <li>gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Basis is a non-soap cleanser that is gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>break me out and the scent is very neutral, not over powering at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t foam too much and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipment</li>
            <li>works very well cleansing your face, helps get rid of the oils.</li>
            <li>It foams nicely and removes make-up, even heavy eye make-up, with ease.</li>
            <li>It may be because some part of my face it more oily than the other?</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands costing much more, but this face wash works for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cleanser for a few months now, and I have only positive things to say about it (though I will try to critique it fairly for helpful feedback).</li>
            <li>I just turned 40 and this product is mild enough for me to use, but does the job very well.</li>
            <li>and I still love it even though I rarely get acne minus the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>Mostly due to it being oil free, but I enjoy how simple it is, without the frills.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon, as I was able to purchase my cleanser for less than I would pay at the store, including the shipping.</li>
            <li>It is extremely likely that I will be buying more Basis when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li>I like this skin cleaner and use it everyday for almost two years, cheap and powerful</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teen age daughter who has mild acne.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I have used this face wash since I was in high school</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I find that a little astringent on a cloth ball works well to remove leftover makeup, but then again, it might just make better sense to use a makeup remover to begin with.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re low maintenance and want a cleanser that will do it all and leave your skin clean and soft</li>
            <li>(Side note, I&#x27;ve tried the facial wipes and they don&#x27;t clean off make up nearly as well as the bar or the liquid.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to find</li>
            <li>It has a good gel-like consistency that lathers and spreads well, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the face and only ocassionally leaves my skin a tad dry but less so than any other face wash I have found (I have super sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>While I may be picky, it does not feel as clean as some of the other facial scrubs that exfoliate, as well as clean.  </li>
            <li>the Basis Sensitive Skin cleanser does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up well, and rinses cleanly without leaving my skin dry feeling.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is said to be for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Whenever I get a facial I&#x27;m always told I have small pores and good skin.  </li>
            <li>Normally, cleansers leave my face feeling tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally order the 4-pack</li>
            <li>Save your face the trouble and get something that is actually healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>SLS and perfume don&#x27;t bother you, it&#x27;s probably worth the buy, but I&#x27;d probably try one tube from a local drugstore before buying a 4-pack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite, but I always have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li>Perhaps because it looks very basic and does the basic thing it needs to do very well; foam, lather and rinse, with clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I tried other formulas that are made for sensitive skin (Cetaphil) and found those to be too gentle that it didn&#x27;t give me the clean feeling I wanted.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin that is not SUPER sensitive, I&#x27;m sure you can use this.</li>
            <li>Years ago my dermatologist recommended Basis bar soap for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It has never bothered my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it never has bothered my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like, the first time you used the Dove soap bar after years of using Ivory or Irish Spring soap bar.</li>
            <li>Tube design has no flaws and sits upright without leaking or becoming messy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, low odor, and makes his face feel clean.</li>
            <li>It makes skin super soft, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, but also doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li>A definite deep clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brand that I can use that actually leaves my faces feeling clean an hour after I wash with it.</li>
            <li>The basis sponge will come clean and the other won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin but cleans very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular cleaner for years but for some reason I can barely find it in stores now.  </li>
            <li>This seems to dry up the problem areas on my face better than other stuff.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>The clear gel contains no oils and no soap.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was goin tobe like the all clear bar</li>
            <li>I bought this because Basis&#x27; All Clear Antibacterial bar, seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li>It keeps his face clear from breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me, so I order it from Amazon and stay stocked up at all times.</li>
            <li>I do still use a follow-up age appropriate moisturizer since I&#x27;m in my late 30s.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and even the Basis bar soap can irritate my face.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>It removes the oil from my pores but is gentle enough not to cause any flare ups or redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, cleans well without drying out your skin, all natural.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was 18 years old, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I only really stopped to switch to the oil cleanse method of face washing.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and/or soft water this washes off and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin can be sensitive sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>now I think they put some soap and water and added the old sent to it and Saling it</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t realize this) so pleasantly surprised about that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other \\&quot;pros\\&quot;: it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have severe allergies and sensitive skin, and this wash has never given me a problem.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There no harsh clensers or acne medication in it.  </li>
            <li>Well, not really a fragrance, just a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Basis is very gentle on it, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>So when I searched several local retailers and they didn&#x27;t carry it, I turned to Amazon and found it right away.</li>
            <li>and you only need a tiny amount in order to get the right amount for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different face washes over the years ranging from Neutrogena to Clean &amp; Clear and even more expensive stuff from my dermatologist but</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle cleanser that would not strip all the natural oils from her face because acne treatments are already pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li>My husband talked me into buying this product as we thought it was a &#x27;green&#x27; product that was eco friendly and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>All that makes for skin that is clean, but harshly so.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little to wash the entire face and each tube lasts me more than two months.</li>
            <li>This really works for me keeps my skin clear and not too dry.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased it because it was a soft, non-detergent type of product that would take off my water proof mascara easily without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li>Seems to calm down and help my Rosacea.</li>
            <li>glad Amazon carries it, because it&#x27;s hard to find locally anymore.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, removes makeup and oil, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>My entire family uses this gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very sensitive skin, with occasional break outs.</li>
            <li>It would clean my skin, without causing it to be extra tight like some face washes can do.  </li>
            <li>Using a scrub causes major issues.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin which is also sensitive - oily t-zone with dry or normal for the rest.  </li>
            <li>Smells very flowery...cleans my face well its cheap and lasts a long time as you only need a small amount</li>
            <li>I have tried many other, some very expensive, products, but it is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>, citrus scents in general.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear with only washing with this followed by Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In case this is conditional, my current skin care routine only involves using this and the aforementioned moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Things about my lifestyle that may affect how this works for me: I&#x27;m 20 years old, I exercise on a regular basis, and I stay away from fast food.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and this is the only face wash that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the only face wash my 18 year old son will use.</li>
            <li>I hate cleansers that are too thin/watery because you end up using more and ultimately spending more.  </li>
            <li>We have using this product for quite sometime, it cuts down any oil, make up and keep our faces clean and it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin ( big plus!).</li>
            <li>I have been using Basis Cleaner Clean facewash for at least 7 years now.  </li>
            <li>It has been especially helpful for my adult acne since the ingredients are simple.  </li>
            <li>I started using this, and while nothing is instant, within two weeks, my skin had adjusted to the simple and natural formula.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for ALL skin types, but especially acne-prone, oily, combination, and sensitive.</li>
            <li>No dry patches.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>When I was done with the first, I grabbed one from the storage bin to discover the plastic tube had split down the middle and spilled soap everywhere.</li>
            <li>I often get mistaken for being 10+ years younger, but I also attribute that to my Bare Minerals make-up.</li>
            <li>I had minor breakouts as an adult</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t break out and when I do it&#x27;s right before my period.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a subtle and clean smell.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple and the dry spots have cleared up.</li>
            <li>feels refreshed the only con is that i feel like its drying the skin a little to much.</li>

            <li> Of course, you also need to make sure you don&#x27;t touch your face with unwashed hands.</li>
            <li> okay for the price.  </li>
            <li> Most stores quit carrying this product</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it and thought I would check Amazon to see if I could buy it from home and cheaper, both.  </li>
            <li> What more could you want?  </li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleanser whose price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for more?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.  </li>

            <li> Love It</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Basis since my dermatologist recommended it years ago, and I really love this product.</li>
            <li> works great, smells good and really only need a dime size.</li>
            <li> I have combination, acne-prone skin, and I have tried many cleansers, irrespective of the price.  </li>

            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.....cleans off all my makeup without drying me out</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>

            <li> I love this product and use Subscribe and Save for it.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> We love this soap.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing quality, I believe it has mint and rosemary</li>
            <li> The result is better than the  prescription acne medication she used to have.  </li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it online.</li>
            <li> I used this facewash for a couple years and found it to be very nice for skin and with cleansing, took off makeup pretty well and was a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> Gets you nice and clean but without drying.</li>
            <li> It foams nicely and leaves a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;m 2 tubes down out of the 4-pack and am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I love Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash!</li>
            <li> leave your face feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> You really need to try this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin nice and cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s new product of cleansing pads is a great hypo allergenic product.</li>
            <li> Is a great natural product!</li>
            <li> It leaves my oily/combo face feeling squeaking clean!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for any type of skin, from dry (like mine) to oily!</li>
            <li> I like how clean my face is after using it!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, this is the most fantastic wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, washes off makeup no problem, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any abrasive ingredients like alcohol which is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> a great face cleanser, even for those with combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for $7.xx at a drug store and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash for many years.</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing - not flowery or powdery, just clean.</li>
            <li> And the tube packaging makes it easy to toss in my gym bag without fear that it will leak like a pump</li>
            <li> It cleans well and rinses off easily without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this delightfully clean smelling face wash.</li>
            <li> Amazing face wash your skin feels so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Nice fresh clean botanical scent.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever but really dries out your face - don&#x27;t use it more than once a day and moisturize if you can!</li>
            <li> I am loyal to this brand and have loved the all clear bar for many years and thought I would try another in their line.</li>
            <li> But this is by far the best cleanser for my sensitive</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this product but after purchasing a 4-pack, I&#x27;m happy to be placing my 2nd order.</li>
            <li> Light and non-residue.</li>
            <li> I have used this facial cleanser since college when it was included in a welcome pack.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> I panicked but was relieved to find it available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and this face wash in gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Great for facial skin issues.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived earlier than projected even.</li>
            <li> this is still available online.  </li>
            <li> Love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product several years ago, and find it to be a great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> People, there is a reason this cleanser is so cheap compared to others, because they use cheap ingredients.</li>
            <li> So cheap and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> it has natural ingredients and smells really nice without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so I use a separate product for weekly exfoliating to get rid of dead skin cells (which is important for skin to look its best).  </li>
            <li> First, this thing smells like paradise!!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does a pretty damn good job at cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to use much at all, as it foams up very nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective at removing makeup  without stripping your skin of essential moisture.  </li>
            <li> This is BY FAR a superior clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Gets your skin squeaky clean and keeps it blemish free.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses it and our skin looks pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> is very fresh smelling and leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It rinses off quickly, with a fantastic light scent.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a male) and it works good to get off the oils from post-workout or after a run/bike/hike and easy on the body as well</li>
            <li> I love this Basis wash -- it&#x27;s the most gentle and economical face wash I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I remember why I love it so much!</li>
            <li> So glad, and to purchase it in a bundle really helps!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and it leaves my face feeling very clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> but even he commented on the clean smell.</li>
            <li> I like Cetaphil, but it wasn&#x27;t leaving my face feeling quite as squeaky clean as I like.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years to clean my face  </li>
            <li> It also has a clean and neutral scent, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with cologne or aftershaves.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and will continue to use Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash.</li>
            <li> it just feels clean and washes away all of the oils and dirt.</li>
            <li> but you can feel how clean your face is after each use.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin with a bit of a T zone issue and it cleans all of my face along with being a great make-up remover.  </li>
            <li> I miss my Olay cleanser that lathered with a creamy foam and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t lather as well, but it does seem to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Basis cleaner clean for over 8 years.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It starts to foam up, smells clean, and makes you feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and not oily after using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my normal skin definitely looks more radiant without over drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It completely removes my makeup, which I love, and it even claims to remove pollution!</li>
            <li> Sure, if you start with a clean face it will clean your face, but it absolutely does NOT remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, I will be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean and smells fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> it it clean smelling, lathers up nicely and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use; when my skin is breaking out I clense with this first and then apply acne medication.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive or normal skin.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> Love this product, really cleans well without over drying.</li>
            <li> this one is and it makes your face feel super clean.</li>
            <li> This is good for daily use.</li>
            <li> but your face becomes super clean.</li>
            <li> Product has a nice, gentle scent and it a nice enough cleanser.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this gentle yet thorough cleanser for me to try instead of the more aggressive one I had been using.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my skin was producing its own excess oil to combat the natural oils that were being stripped away.</li>
            <li> This has a light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Basis&amp;#34; face wash has been my go-to facial cleanser for over a year, and I&#x27;ve found it to be quite a good product.</li>
            <li> and it works great to not dry my skin out too much after I use it.</li>
            <li> Everyone is right; this stuff is amazing, soft and naturally clean.</li>
            <li> Great product for oily skin like mine or any other skin type.  </li>
            <li> It gets my face clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Your face feels so fresh and so clean after.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean and cuts through the oil that builds up over night or throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser that was mild yet cleaned my face well</li>
            <li> I really like how light and smooth</li>
            <li> and I am so glad to be able to find a source to get this from on a regular basis</li>
            <li> For the quality and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Cleaner clean is about right.</li>
            <li> Nice product, gentle but gets all the makeup off and smells light and natural.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this face cleaner which was recommended to me by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Deeply clean, rich suds immediately, soft, gentle cleaner that leaves you with a very refreshed face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the face wash does have a nice, clean scent and a bottle of this will last you a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good basic cleaner leaves your skin</li>
            <li> So, I tried looking for a cheaper product that would just clean my face gently yet give me a clean feel</li>
            <li> I also cannot say how it works on acne because I have not suffered from that since my teenage years (thankfully!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: a very good basic skin cleanser for men and women at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> If you use the gel straight, it would be too drying for your skin, but if you dilute in water (use a soap-pump), it&#x27;s FANTASTIC for a face-wash.</li>
            <li> This does a great job at cleansing without being harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> I really like light</li>
            <li> The price is totally  worth it.</li>
            <li> This face wash is a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that Amazon sells Basis facial wash, as I can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Others on the market charge much more for what I feel is a far inferior product.</li>
            <li> but I have skin that is sensitive to most  products (I get a burning feeling within seconds if the product doesn&#x27;t work for me)</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic face wash.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell that is gender neutral--not too floral or feminine, and not too masculine either (such as pine or musk).  </li>
            <li> This one is actually better: just as gentle, leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; clean &amp; not at all irritated.  </li>
            <li> though I wouldn&#x27;t use it for body-wash since you&#x27;d go through it all pretty quick.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like cream washes, just want something that will gently foam up when you get it wet, smells nice and clean and this is IT!  </li>
            <li> Soft, non drying, clean light scent, and comes in a 4 pack</li>
            <li> Product has a decent odor, however I think there are too many skin irritants in this product, like a lot of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which my skin really does not appreciate.</li>
            <li> I use it right before I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> , even waterproof mascara dissolves right off.</li>
            <li> This face wash is just right.</li>
            <li> Basis cleanser does not foam up right out of the bottle like the Aveeno, but rather it&#x27;s a gel like consistency and needs to be rubbed together in your hands to build up the lather.  </li>
            <li> Light breakouts as I&#x27;ve gotten older are diminished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, and leaves my face clean.</li>
            <li> The Basis smells nice, with a light slightly floral fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Over four weeks of using this product caused my mild acne to become more than moderate.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this amazing product is hard to find and I have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I tried it after trying several other brands and stuck with it because it is the absolute best out there.  </li>
            <li> I know it will arrive at exactly the right time</li>
            <li> I use it under more expensive moisturizers and have a great result.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle wash.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle, but thorough face cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle</li>
            <li> Very gentle</li>
            <li> This cleanser works so well, very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff IS VERY CONCENTRATE, so you&#x27;ll get your money worth.  </li>
            <li> My regular store has discontinued carrying it or even being able to order it for me...</li>
            <li> I only wished it came in a more convenient pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, especially the scent.</li>
            <li> As a side note I don&#x27;t remember how I received it that year because I wasn&#x27;t living on campus, but so very grateful I did!</li>
            <li> I would be willing to try this product again if it was truly made of natural/organic components (no lauryl/laureth sulfates) and is 100% not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Basis for years when I first found in at Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this after getting a sample in a race bag over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> My local CVS sells it for more than $6</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial wash.  </li>
            <li> the only face wash that i love but can&#x27;t find anywhere except on amazon</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and makes your skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get more basic than this!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Love this line for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I just go this in the mail, turned it over and saw sodium laureth sulfate in one of the first ingredients.</li>
            <li> My daughter pairs it with a Neutrogena gel that is sadly no longer in production.  </li>
            <li> but when she uses it consistently her skin is noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product highly, would purchase again and again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons - this one smells great, removes my makeup (I typically do two quick washes if I&#x27;m using it at night) and is totally affordable.</li>
            <li> 2/3 of it left so you can tell that the result weren&#x27;t as great as expected.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so clean and clear.</li>
            <li> it was it would clean and clear your face</li>
            <li> get the &amp;#34;all clean an clear bar&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Skin is clean and soft.</li>
            <li> And I like the soft and clean fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> It smells really softly like mint or basil and it really great for cleaning, it&#x27;s not harsh at all and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin is soft and clean after use.  </li>
            <li> Its gentle on my skin and still is potent enough to get rid of my waterproof eye make up.</li>
            <li> Instead, they combine to create a unique smell that is slightly citrus, light, and fresh without smelling chemical or artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle on your skin and reasonable cost!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an all-in-one product but does exactly what I would hope for from a gentle face wash.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and even then you can only smell it while applying it.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;m over a certain age</li>
            <li> It foams very well and lasts long enough for you to get a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and refreshed and it&#x27;s the kind of clean that feels like there is no residue left behind.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with the very clean feeling I was looking for, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, when I followed up with my dermatologist and he asked what I was using, I told him how great Basis was working for me.  </li>
            <li> My husband even likes it because it isn&#x27;t very fragrant and it only has a light hint of citrus.</li>

            <li> subscribe and save, this product is really affordable.</li>
            <li> It came in a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser took off my make-up and really gave me balanced results--</li>
            <li> My wife says this washes her face very well.</li>
            <li> Makes you take a second out of your day to enjoy what you are doing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely gentle as well.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup well and feels gentle.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid Neutrogena, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Not so gentle around the eyes</li>
            <li> I have never noticed anything offensive or unusual about its smell as some have commented on.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> It gently removes dirt make up and excess oil without skin irratation.</li>
            <li> My acne becomes very inflamed and all I see is redness.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t want to buy 4</li>
            <li> Buying a face cleanser is really about what type of skin you have, how your skin is affected during the season and so on.</li>
            <li> this is a real reliable winner.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest it!</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li> I still moisturize it (with Lancome Bienfait Multivital for those interested), but immediately after washing it still feels normal.</li>
            <li> but it does control acne very well and cleans my shave area very well</li>
            <li> it really did wash my face very well.</li>
            <li> gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Basis is a non-soap cleanser that is gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> break me out and the scent is very neutral, not over powering at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t foam too much and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipment</li>
            <li> works very well cleansing your face, helps get rid of the oils.</li>
            <li> It foams nicely and removes make-up, even heavy eye make-up, with ease.</li>
            <li> It may be because some part of my face it more oily than the other?</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands costing much more, but this face wash works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for a few months now, and I have only positive things to say about it (though I will try to critique it fairly for helpful feedback).</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and this product is mild enough for me to use, but does the job very well.</li>
            <li> and I still love it even though I rarely get acne minus the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> Mostly due to it being oil free, but I enjoy how simple it is, without the frills.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon, as I was able to purchase my cleanser for less than I would pay at the store, including the shipping.</li>
            <li> It is extremely likely that I will be buying more Basis when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> I like this skin cleaner and use it everyday for almost two years, cheap and powerful</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen age daughter who has mild acne.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash since I was in high school</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I find that a little astringent on a cloth ball works well to remove leftover makeup, but then again, it might just make better sense to use a makeup remover to begin with.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re low maintenance and want a cleanser that will do it all and leave your skin clean and soft</li>
            <li> (Side note, I&#x27;ve tried the facial wipes and they don&#x27;t clean off make up nearly as well as the bar or the liquid.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to find</li>
            <li> It has a good gel-like consistency that lathers and spreads well, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the face and only ocassionally leaves my skin a tad dry but less so than any other face wash I have found (I have super sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> While I may be picky, it does not feel as clean as some of the other facial scrubs that exfoliate, as well as clean.  </li>
            <li> the Basis Sensitive Skin cleanser does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up well, and rinses cleanly without leaving my skin dry feeling.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is said to be for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a facial I&#x27;m always told I have small pores and good skin.  </li>
            <li> Normally, cleansers leave my face feeling tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally order the 4-pack</li>
            <li> Save your face the trouble and get something that is actually healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li> SLS and perfume don&#x27;t bother you, it&#x27;s probably worth the buy, but I&#x27;d probably try one tube from a local drugstore before buying a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite, but I always have trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because it looks very basic and does the basic thing it needs to do very well; foam, lather and rinse, with clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried other formulas that are made for sensitive skin (Cetaphil) and found those to be too gentle that it didn&#x27;t give me the clean feeling I wanted.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin that is not SUPER sensitive, I&#x27;m sure you can use this.</li>
            <li> Years ago my dermatologist recommended Basis bar soap for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has never bothered my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it never has bothered my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like, the first time you used the Dove soap bar after years of using Ivory or Irish Spring soap bar.</li>
            <li> Tube design has no flaws and sits upright without leaking or becoming messy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, low odor, and makes his face feel clean.</li>
            <li> It makes skin super soft, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, but also doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li> A definite deep clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only brand that I can use that actually leaves my faces feeling clean an hour after I wash with it.</li>
            <li> The basis sponge will come clean and the other won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry your skin but cleans very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular cleaner for years but for some reason I can barely find it in stores now.  </li>
            <li> This seems to dry up the problem areas on my face better than other stuff.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> The clear gel contains no oils and no soap.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was goin tobe like the all clear bar</li>
            <li> I bought this because Basis&#x27; All Clear Antibacterial bar, seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> It keeps his face clear from breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me, so I order it from Amazon and stay stocked up at all times.</li>
            <li> I do still use a follow-up age appropriate moisturizer since I&#x27;m in my late 30s.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and even the Basis bar soap can irritate my face.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> It removes the oil from my pores but is gentle enough not to cause any flare ups or redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, cleans well without drying out your skin, all natural.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 18 years old, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I only really stopped to switch to the oil cleanse method of face washing.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or soft water this washes off and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin can be sensitive sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> now I think they put some soap and water and added the old sent to it and Saling it</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t realize this) so pleasantly surprised about that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other \\&quot;pros\\&quot;: it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have severe allergies and sensitive skin, and this wash has never given me a problem.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There no harsh clensers or acne medication in it.  </li>
            <li> Well, not really a fragrance, just a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and Basis is very gentle on it, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> So when I searched several local retailers and they didn&#x27;t carry it, I turned to Amazon and found it right away.</li>
            <li> and you only need a tiny amount in order to get the right amount for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different face washes over the years ranging from Neutrogena to Clean &amp; Clear and even more expensive stuff from my dermatologist but</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle cleanser that would not strip all the natural oils from her face because acne treatments are already pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li> My husband talked me into buying this product as we thought it was a &#x27;green&#x27; product that was eco friendly and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> All that makes for skin that is clean, but harshly so.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to wash the entire face and each tube lasts me more than two months.</li>
            <li> This really works for me keeps my skin clear and not too dry.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased it because it was a soft, non-detergent type of product that would take off my water proof mascara easily without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> Seems to calm down and help my Rosacea.</li>
            <li> glad Amazon carries it, because it&#x27;s hard to find locally anymore.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, removes makeup and oil, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My entire family uses this gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, with occasional break outs.</li>
            <li> It would clean my skin, without causing it to be extra tight like some face washes can do.  </li>
            <li> Using a scrub causes major issues.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin which is also sensitive - oily t-zone with dry or normal for the rest.  </li>
            <li> Smells very flowery...cleans my face well its cheap and lasts a long time as you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> I have tried many other, some very expensive, products, but it is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li> , citrus scents in general.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear with only washing with this followed by Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In case this is conditional, my current skin care routine only involves using this and the aforementioned moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Things about my lifestyle that may affect how this works for me: I&#x27;m 20 years old, I exercise on a regular basis, and I stay away from fast food.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and this is the only face wash that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the only face wash my 18 year old son will use.</li>
            <li> I hate cleansers that are too thin/watery because you end up using more and ultimately spending more.  </li>
            <li> We have using this product for quite sometime, it cuts down any oil, make up and keep our faces clean and it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin ( big plus!).</li>
            <li> I have been using Basis Cleaner Clean facewash for at least 7 years now.  </li>
            <li> It has been especially helpful for my adult acne since the ingredients are simple.  </li>
            <li> I started using this, and while nothing is instant, within two weeks, my skin had adjusted to the simple and natural formula.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for ALL skin types, but especially acne-prone, oily, combination, and sensitive.</li>
            <li> No dry patches.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> When I was done with the first, I grabbed one from the storage bin to discover the plastic tube had split down the middle and spilled soap everywhere.</li>
            <li> I often get mistaken for being 10+ years younger, but I also attribute that to my Bare Minerals make-up.</li>
            <li> I had minor breakouts as an adult</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t break out and when I do it&#x27;s right before my period.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a subtle and clean smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and supple and the dry spots have cleared up.</li>
            <li> feels refreshed the only con is that i feel like its drying the skin a little to much.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not good, but</li>
            <li> My T-zone is the only part of my face that gets oily and the rest of my face is pretty normal-to a little dry.</li>
            <li> Also, it has NEVER dried my skin out like other brands do.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to buying products I normally have to do a little research on it because I can&#x27;t always trust what everyone&#x27;s results are.</li>
            <li> Use it daily, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, acne is totally gone.</li>
            <li> this stuff just flat out &#x27;feels&#x27; amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time, from back when breakouts were my biggest concern to now when they would just get lost in my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Use a tiny drop on firmly,  but not too tightly closed eyelids, gently rub over the eyelashes and rinse thouroughly.     </li>
            <li> Not bad, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive face washes only to return to Basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different cleaners from really cheap to really expensive because let&#x27;s face it, you will pay anything to keep your face from breaking out.</li>
            <li> It was tingly and I felt good about using a natural product but felt bad about paying $15+ for a small tube of it.</li>
            <li> This not only cleans every spec of dirt off your face is DOESN&#x27;T dry it out!</li>
            <li> My face does not break out or over dry with daily use even during dry winters or humid summer.</li>
            <li> I have never liked a product as much as I have like this one.  </li>
            <li> My wife is a long time user of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> If you hate dry skin and want a clean fresh feeling, try this out.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts me a long time.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist long ago.</li>
            <li> I will buy it as long as it&#x27;s sold!</li>
            <li> I have found only 1 other product that cleans my face without breaking it out or causing blotchiness and that is Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to use other brands since trying Basis; however, I keep going back to Basis because nothing compares.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always come back to this even if I tried other things along the way.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> One tube lasts for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> dry parts were cleaned without over drying and oily parts were cleaned and unwanted oils were removed.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin; my chin, eye and cheek areas tend to be dry and my nose and forehead tend to be oily.</li>
            <li> so my face is not too oily or dry</li>
            <li> and it still felt too dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product years ago when traveling and had really dry skin from the hotel soaps.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> that cleans well but leaves my skin feeling really dry.  </li>
            <li> but I have a combination of oily to dry skin.</li>
            <li> It must be used with a moisturizer, or it tends to dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> My forehead and nose are oily, but my cheeks and chin are dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I have relatively dry skin save for a sometimes oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> And does not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> and it cured my dry skin problems.  </li>
            <li> It cleans thoroughly, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it, too, because it&#x27;s soap-free and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and my husband even keeps a bottle for himself.</li>
            <li> I have passed it down to my teenage son who has skin problems.</li>
            <li> The 6-ounce tube lasts for a long time too, b/c you only need a little to wash your face.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, if my skin gets too dry it becomes tight and red.  </li>
            <li> Only use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Cons\\&quot;: not many stores stock it (and we are in a major metro area), meaning you must plan ahead and stock up when you see it or buy ahead online to avoid running out.  </li>
            <li> so I am just left with a little bit of eyeliner/mascara residue.</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet tough.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this at my local Walmart and it was half the price of any other cleanser on the shelf.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more painful than when I get shampoo/soap suds in my eyes.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, I went on a trip to discover that another tube had split on the side, flooding my toiletries bag with gel soap.</li>
            <li> In any case, I used to switch around between several brands; Biore, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, to name a few.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am careful about what I use on my face, and this product works for me.  </li>
            <li> Getting harder to find on a store shelves, so I order 6 at a time.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few face cleansers that hasn&#x27;t given me an allergic reaction or left my face feeling stripped and unnaturally</li>
            <li> I would advise someone who has used traditional acne cleanser to give this a try becuase it is not as harsh as the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> deep cleans, washing away the days make up, without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My face is oily and it helps to control that when other face washes couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Only need a small bit.  </li>
            <li> And, for me, some part of my face \\&quot;rinsed\\&quot; faster than the other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is never any of that residue feeling that you get with other soaps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to contact other ways.</li>
            <li> Oh, and as with all other cleansers, it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup like mascara or eye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than some of the other cleansers on the market</li>
            <li> A tube of Basis lasts a long time--a few months.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this in the local stores, but I would not buy online again.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and then just add a little bit of water and rub your hands together to create a lather.  </li>
            <li> Hard to go through 4-6 bottles though, unless you have a giant face I guess.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally, thank goodness</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t completely clear up breakouts, but it does not make them worse.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy Clinique which is expensive but much prefer this at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products in the past few weeks</li>
            <li> This is only $3 at stores - I realized this bulk buy was a rip off too late.</li>
            <li> Be careful with storage!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it, my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry like it usually does after cleansing it.</li>
            <li> &quot; and immediately thought it was all-natural without the harsh sudsing agents and other stuff.</li>
            <li> The only negative was that it has a heavy perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Feels less chemically than some others</li>
            <li> Since using Basis, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores have become less visible and my skin is smoother and less oily.</li>
            <li> Given all the negative press for SLS lately, and because that I&#x27;m trying to find something for my sensitive skin, I have to return it (and with no free shipping, either).</li>
            <li> When I rinse it off it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight because it stripped all the moisture from it or filmy like it didn&#x27;t all rinse off.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight either</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel tight</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d dropped something on it, swore at myself a little since I now had to wash my toiletries, and got on with my life.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn, not even a little bit, so</li>
            <li> my face breaks out usually with other cleansers but not with this one.</li>
            <li> but Bed and Bath has it for a little over $4.</li>
            <li> I have only realized this year that this only happens during the winter or really cold months.  </li>
            <li> When I was travelling I accidentally left my expensive face wash in a hotel and was forced to pick up something from a local drug store.  </li>
            <li> Basically, the soap feels just like I have used hand soap on my face--too harsh.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something &#x27;green&#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been few months now and the tube has still</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Basis cleans my oily complexion without a residue or a feeling of dried out skin.  </li>
            <li> Not available everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Basis face wash for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I buy it 4 bottles at a time a few times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it as my everyday face wash</li>
            <li> We use it year &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> But sometimes we have trouble finding Basis at the stores in our area.</li>
            <li> its gets all the makeup off without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> This time the only thing in the bag was clothing, so I&#x27;m assuming the packaging design is either flawed or hates me.</li>
            <li> how the squeezeable stand-up tube leaves everything neat (no more gooey and slimey bars in a soap dish).  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually sold out.</li>
            <li> I can usually get it at Walgreens or WalMart</li>
            <li> /&gt;With just a small amount (dime size)</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this product when I was in grade school and it came in a small cake form.</li>
            <li> my favorite at an insane value.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on past reviews on amazon.com  </li>
            <li> My past cleanser had exfoliating particles as well as an alpha/beta-hydroxy treatment, which was causing my skin to be uncharacteristically oily.</li>
            <li> I will never use a harsh cleanser again!</li>
            <li> I must admit, this cleanser works just as well if not better than the pricey ones.  </li>
            <li> Once we began using Basis, breakouts became a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> and I usually have a tube by the sink and in the shower</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find locally</li>
            <li> Basis leaves no dirt or makeup behind like the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than other cleansers and does just as well.  </li>
            <li> In fact I bought four of them because it&#x27;s hard for me to find them in my town</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it, and when I seen it on Amazon, I immediately signed up for the auto delivery service.</li>
            <li> and I have had a hard time finding anything I like as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find in stores and when I do..</li>
            <li> It is hard to find around town</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the stores sometimes</li>
            <li> at least none that I&#x27;ve looked in.  </li>
            <li> and it lasts me at least 6mo.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble skin and used to swear by expensive department store face wash.  </li>
            <li> I can no longer use this because it does dry my cheeks out too bad</li>
            <li> I began researching why and its called seasonal acne, and its very common to see during this type of season.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at either of my usual stores.</li>
            <li> However, it became difficult to find</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the store where I shop doesn&#x27;t always carry it so</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s expensive, and then Amazon decided to remove it from the Subscribe and Save program, so I decided to give this cleanser a try</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the four pack for the selling price.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I cannot use this anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Am crazy about expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Since this cold weather has started I began breaking out a lot on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got all the Laureths, Lauryls and Laurates and suds up like crazy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ACNE or anything crazy</li>
            <li> This product is lousy!</li>
            <li> I would be very sad.</li>
            <li> Literally nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;ve have not noticed any bad reactions or issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that Walmart is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that I cannot find it on the shelf anymore, and turned to amazon to find it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and I received it in two days. Do not have to run out ever again and Amazon made that a good thing. The price is totally  worth it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for one month.  It rinses off quickly, with a fantastic light scent.  It helps with my oily and acne-prone skin.  This stuff IS VERY CONCENTRATE, so you&#x27;ll get your money worth.  I recommend putting this gel into a soap-pump, then dilute with water.  If you use the gel straight, it would be too drying for your skin, but if you dilute in water (use a soap-pump), it&#x27;s FANTASTIC for a face-wash.</li>
            <li> I have some teen skin problems with my face even though I am in my mid 20&#x27;s.  This seems to dry up the problem areas on my face better than other stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Basis. It cleans my face without overdrying it. It&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s gentle yet it cleans my face thoroughly. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this Face wash it is the best! Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This face cleaner is my most favorite product  it only takes a fingertip to lather up.just love it...</li>
            <li> It cleanses without over-drying and has a nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;With subscribe and save, this product is really affordable. It only takes a little to wash the entire face and each tube lasts me more than two months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash for many years. It is the only product I can wash my face with and not have a reaction with my skin. After it was no longer sold in the stores I found it online and have continued to purchase it over the last several years. It is a wonderful product and a perfect combination of ingredients for my skin. I will buy it as long as it&#x27;s sold!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin which is also sensitive - oily t-zone with dry or normal for the rest.  I&#x27;ve been using Basis Cleaner Clean Face wash for over 5 years, it leaves my face feeling great.  I only need to use it once a day.  Breakouts are virtually gone.  My regular store has discontinued carrying it or even being able to order it for me...so here I am at Amazon - wish I had thought of them before!</li>
            <li> Loved this!! It came in a reasonable time.  It smells clean, fresh &amp; kind of fruity!! My face is oily and it helps to control that when other face washes couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Basis Face wash for over 10 years now. It gets my face clean and feeling fresh. The scent is wonderful. And this stuff gets all of my makeup. I love it. Its gentle on my skin and still is potent enough to get rid of my waterproof eye make up.</li>
            <li> Best facewash ever! Must keep buying this so I&#x27;ll have some forever!</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this once, I liked the gentler (for me) chemistry of this product. I bought 4 at once to save on shipping. One for the shower, one for traveling, two in a storage bin. When I was done with the first, I grabbed one from the storage bin to discover the plastic tube had split down the middle and spilled soap everywhere. I figured I&#x27;d dropped something on it, swore at myself a little since I now had to wash my toiletries, and got on with my life. A few weeks later, I went on a trip to discover that another tube had split on the side, flooding my toiletries bag with gel soap. This time the only thing in the bag was clothing, so I&#x27;m assuming the packaging design is either flawed or hates me.Be careful with storage!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser that was mild yet cleaned my face well and I&#x27;ve finally found it! I was reluctant to try this product but after purchasing a 4-pack, I&#x27;m happy to be placing my 2nd order. This is great stuff and smells super clean. My husband doesn&#x27;t notice smells but even he commented on the clean smell. I just turned 40 and this product is mild enough for me to use, but does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome basic face cleanser. I love how it smells, lathers, rinses, and how my face feels afterwards. Skin is clean and soft. This cleanser is said to be for normal to oily skin. But if you have sensitive skin that is not SUPER sensitive, I&#x27;m sure you can use this. That&#x27;s the kind of skin I have. I tried other formulas that are made for sensitive skin (Cetaphil) and found those to be too gentle that it didn&#x27;t give me the clean feeling I wanted. This cleanser took off my make-up and really gave me balanced results--dry parts were cleaned without over drying and oily parts were cleaned and unwanted oils were removed. I stopped using this cleanser for a while only because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries it and at an even better price than before since I&#x27;m using Subscribe and Save. I highly recommend this cleanser. I only wished it came in a more convenient pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;Last note: Make sure you do not get this stuff in your eyes. I feel like when it gets in my eyes, it&#x27;s more painful than when I get shampoo/soap suds in my eyes. It might be effects of the minty botanicals... but just heed my caution.</li>
            <li> Gives off a good clean feel. I use it right before I go to sleep. It keeps my skin nice and cool. Cleans most of the dirt off my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, especially the scent. In fact I bought four of them because it&#x27;s hard for me to find them in my town and I didn&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> Any product by Basis is a good product. My wife says this washes her face very well. The only negative was that it has a heavy perfume smell. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The product was packaged well and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> This face wash is a breath of fresh air. I love going into the shower, putting in on my hands and holding my hands over my face. The aroma to this face wash is SO relaxing. Makes you take a second out of your day to enjoy what you are doing. Your face feels so fresh and so clean after. This is a very gentle wash. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash about 7 years ago.  I have never liked a product as much as I have like this one.  It is very effective at removing makeup  without stripping your skin of essential moisture.  I even use it to wash my makeup brushes and sponges.     Here&#x27;s a hint for removing water-proof mascara.  Use a tiny drop on firmly,  but not too tightly closed eyelids, gently rub over the eyelashes and rinse thouroughly.     It rinses clean and smells fresh and light.  It has been especially helpful for my adult acne since the ingredients are simple.  Although I&#x27;ve heard some users complain about the wash over drying their skin, I have found that the water quality was to blame, not the product.    It also makes a great jewelry cleaner since it is so good at removing skin oils and rinsing clean.    Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> I have been using Basis face wash gel for about 10 years. I love it. My skin is soft and supple and the dry spots have cleared up. This is a great product -- easy to pack for travel, too.</li>
            <li> Love Basis face wash.  Light and non-residue. Cleans well without drying. Smells refreshing - not flowery or powdery, just clean. Face feels great all day.  Only need a small bit.  Try their face cloths too for travel or after gym - they are equally great.  This is best face wash i&#x27;ve ever tried and i&#x27;ve tried about 18 different ones over the years.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price plus i didn&#x27;t have to go out to get it.</li>
            <li> Years ago my dermatologist recommended Basis bar soap for my very sensitive skin.  Now I need to use a wash on my face rather than bar soap, and I have found this a particularly refreshing product.  A bonus - it&#x27;s a very good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read it was great for oily skin.  I don&#x27; t notice any difference in my skin when using.  Not bad, but not great.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried tons - this one smells great, removes my makeup (I typically do two quick washes if I&#x27;m using it at night) and is totally affordable. I use it under more expensive moisturizers and have a great result.</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet tough. Just like I like my...well, face soap. My wife is a long time user of Cetaphil. I like Cetaphil, but it wasn&#x27;t leaving my face feeling quite as squeaky clean as I like. After some research, I came across Basis. I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;m 2 tubes down out of the 4-pack and am a happy camper. I have sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any problems. It leaves me with the very clean feeling I was looking for, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It is extremely likely that I will be buying more Basis when my supply runs low.</li>
            <li> I have trouble skin and used to swear by expensive department store face wash.  When I was travelling I accidentally left my expensive face wash in a hotel and was forced to pick up something from a local drug store.  As it turns out, this is the most fantastic wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores near me, so I order it from Amazon and stay stocked up at all times.</li>
            <li> I have used this facial cleanser since college when it was included in a welcome pack. As a side note I don&#x27;t remember how I received it that year because I wasn&#x27;t living on campus, but so very grateful I did! In any case, I used to switch around between several brands; Biore, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, to name a few. I&#x27;m 35 now and have received innumerable compliments on my skin. I often get mistaken for being 10+ years younger, but I also attribute that to my Bare Minerals make-up. I have combination skin; my chin, eye and cheek areas tend to be dry and my nose and forehead tend to be oily. This is BY FAR a superior clean. It foams nicely and removes make-up, even heavy eye make-up, with ease. When I rinse it off it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight because it stripped all the moisture from it or filmy like it didn&#x27;t all rinse off. It has a very light scent that is pleasant and unobtrusive. My favorite part about this cleanser is that I can suds up my face real good, even on my eyes, and open my eyes WITH THE CLEANSER ON THEM and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn, not even a little bit, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle as well. When stores within a 100 mile radius from me stopped selling this wonderful product I think I tried everything in this price range and even more than double this range and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that held a candle to it. So glad to have found it online!!</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using it for years and hope to continue for years to come.  Gentle on your skin and reasonable cost!  What more can you want?</li>
            <li> Love this product, really cleans well without over drying.</li>
            <li> My husband talked me into buying this product as we thought it was a &#x27;green&#x27; product that was eco friendly and not tested on animals. This is not the case--if you find out otherwise let me know. Basically, the soap feels just like I have used hand soap on my face--too harsh. I have regular skin so my face is not too oily or dry and it still felt too dry. However, the face wash does have a nice, clean scent and a bottle of this will last you a while. I would be willing to try this product again if it was truly made of natural/organic components (no lauryl/laureth sulfates) and is 100% not tested on animals. Makeup products should never be tested on something as frivolous as beauty products. That being said if you want something to choose from besides the regular face wash companies give it a try. If you are looking for something &#x27;green&#x27; this is not it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years to clean my face  I mainly purchased it because it was a soft, non-detergent type of product that would take off my water proof mascara easily without irritating my eyes. I love it.</li>
            <li> Basis in the ONLY Cleaner I use! The ONLY cleaner I LIKE!  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I don&#x27;t like the scrubies they put in cleaners, don&#x27;t like cream washes, just want something that will gently foam up when you get it wet, smells nice and clean and this is IT!  I&#x27;ve used Basis for years when I first found in at Wal-mart.  Now you can&#x27;t find in any retail store, at least none that I&#x27;ve looked in.  One tube lasts me 6+ months, but I only wash my face in the morning.  I buy the 4 pack and it lasts me 2 years so it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. I had a hard time finding it, and when I seen it on Amazon, I immediately signed up for the auto delivery service. It is gentle, yet effective. The only cleaner I will use on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I never order just one. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Love it!  It keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever. I love the smell. Only use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Smells very flowery...cleans my face well its cheap and lasts a long time as you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> Great product for my skin type, and I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at either of my usual stores. Thank goodness for Amazon, as I was able to purchase my cleanser for less than I would pay at the store, including the shipping.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that Amazon sells Basis facial wash, as I can no longer find it in stores. It leaves my oily/combo face feeling squeaking clean!  And I like the soft and clean fragrance, too. Well, not really a fragrance, just a fresh smell. Great price, and it never has bothered my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a review in a women&#x27;s magazine.  The 4-pack has lasted about a year.  It&#x27;s not moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin.  It removes makeup well and feels gentle.  I do still use a follow-up age appropriate moisturizer since I&#x27;m in my late 30s.  This doesn&#x27;t completely clear up breakouts, but it does not make them worse.  I also need to exfoliate occasionally.  It&#x27;s not an all-in-one product but does exactly what I would hope for from a gentle face wash.</li>
            <li> Smells great, washes off makeup no problem, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my sensitive skin. Give it a chance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Basis cleaner clean for two years now and have had good results.  The clear gel foams up easily and smells great!  I have had great results using this product.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product years ago when traveling and had really dry skin from the hotel soaps.  It&#x27;s perfect for the face and only ocassionally leaves my skin a tad dry but less so than any other face wash I have found (I have super sensitive skin).  It also has a clean and neutral scent, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with cologne or aftershaves.      If you hate dry skin and want a clean fresh feeling, try this out.</li>
            <li> I have used this Basis gel cleaner for years.  I have found only 1 other product that cleans my face without breaking it out or causing blotchiness and that is Aveeno.  This Basis cleaner does a good job cleaning your face, smells nice, and is good for sensitive skin.  FYI the Basis Sensitive Skin cleanser does not work very well.  This face wash is gender neutral (not ultra girlie), so even my husband will use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am careful about what I use on my face, and this product works for me.  Plus it is a great value.  The 6-ounce tube lasts for a long time too, b/c you only need a little to wash your face.  The drug stores I shop at have stopped carrying this product, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve uses this face cleaner with a buff buff for over 20 years.  Whenever I get a facial I&#x27;m always told I have small pores and good skin.  I&#x27;m 64 and will continue to use Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash.</li>
            <li> I have been using some organic/honey/cucumber face wash product based on my wife&#x27;s friend&#x27;s suggestion. It was tingly and I felt good about using a natural product but felt bad about paying $15+ for a small tube of it. So, I tried looking for a cheaper product that would just clean my face gently yet give me a clean feel and I found this product. I&#x27;ve seen this around for a while but for some reason never gotten around to trying it, so, I got one from a local drug store to try it out before buying in bulk here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been few months now and the tube has still 2/3 of it left so you can tell that the result weren&#x27;t as great as expected. The product foam up and lathers well but what I didn&#x27;t like about it is the slippery feeling left on your skin after the initial rinse. It&#x27;s like, the first time you used the Dove soap bar after years of using Ivory or Irish Spring soap bar. You feel like you still have soap on you after rinsing so you keep on rinsing to until that feeling is gone. Same with this facewash. You have to rinse a bit to get rid of that feeling. And, for me, some part of my face \\&quot;rinsed\\&quot; faster than the other. It may be because some part of my face it more oily than the other? I still tried it for about 2 weeks but I&#x27;ve stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t get use to this \\&quot;something&#x27;s still on my face\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m using the [[ASIN:B003BMI628 Neutrogena Fragrance Free Liquid Neutrogena, Facial Cleansing Formula, 8 Ounce]] product and liking it much better. Perhaps because it looks very basic and does the basic thing it needs to do very well; foam, lather and rinse, with clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face. Works good. Nothing fancy. Just what it is. I subscribe to this product. It is cheaper that way.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but 2 out of 4 tubes came cracked &amp; leaked in the package.  I had a hard time finding this in the local stores, but I would not buy online again.  Amazon was great about the return however.  I kept the 2 that were still in tact &amp; they refunded me for the 2 that were cracked.  So 5 stars for Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> I love Basis Cleaner Clean Face Wash! Not so gentle around the eyes but it is the BEST for removing light makeup and in the morning time.&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing and smells beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop selling these &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and never had a problem finding it in stores until about 2 years ago.  I panicked but was relieved to find it available through Amazon.  I love how the squeezeable stand-up tube leaves everything neat (no more gooey and slimey bars in a soap dish).  You only need a small amount and then just add a little bit of water and rub your hands together to create a lather.  One tube lasts me a long time.  I have never noticed anything offensive or unusual about its smell as some have commented on.  All I know is it cleans well without being overly drying.  Its price also makes it a good choice.  Others on the market charge much more for what I feel is a far inferior product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Basis Cleaner Clean facewash for at least 7 years now.  I tried it after trying several other brands and stuck with it because it is the absolute best out there.  I have tried to use other brands since trying Basis; however, I keep going back to Basis because nothing compares.  Basis leaves no dirt or makeup behind like the other brands.  To test this, try washing your makeup sponge with both Basis and another brand.  The basis sponge will come clean and the other won&#x27;t.  Also, it has NEVER dried my skin out like other brands do.  It has the perfect balance of cleansing and moisturizing!  I always get compliments on my skin, and I always give the props to Basis face wash!!</li>
            <li> I love this Basis wash -- it&#x27;s the most gentle and economical face wash I&#x27;ve used.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and even the Basis bar soap can irritate my face.  This cleans and tightens my skin without drying.  No breakouts.  No dry patches. The clear gel contains no oils and no soap.  I only wish Basis would make this in smaller travel tubes since I have to transfer it when I use carry-on luggage only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> Many years ago this was recommended by a dermatologist I was seeing. I used it for years. However, it became difficult to find so I used another cleanser until I found it once again on Amazon. I remember why I love it so much! Plus, with subscribe and save I know it will arrive at exactly the right time so I never run out &amp; it&#x27;s at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li> Basis is an excellant product.  I have tried other more expensive face washes only to return to Basis. This time I went back to the Basis..For good!</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this four pack of Basis face wash. Prior to using it, I was using Murad Anti-Aging Acne wash (which costs about the same for one bottle).  I started using this, and while nothing is instant, within two weeks, my skin had adjusted to the simple and natural formula.  It would clean my skin, without causing it to be extra tight like some face washes can do.  It calmed the redness that I sometimes get around my chin and nose.  One tube lasts for a very long time.  You really don&#x27;t have to use much at all, as it foams up very nicely.  And the tube packaging makes it easy to toss in my gym bag without fear that it will leak like a pump sometimes does.  A few weeks later, when I followed up with my dermatologist and he asked what I was using, I told him how great Basis was working for me.  He told me that he used to recommend it all the time, that it&#x27;s a great face wash, but sometimes can be a challenge to find.  Thanks to amazon, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.</li>
            <li> I first tried this after getting a sample in a race bag over 10 years ago. I have been a fan ever since. Gets you nice and clean but without drying.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought it because it was on clearance at CVS and LOVED it but now they don&#x27;t have it anymore. I love that I don&#x27;t have to use two products to take off my makeup, even waterproof mascara dissolves right off. Smells great and my normal skin definitely looks more radiant without over drying. If you&#x27;re low maintenance and want a cleanser that will do it all and leave your skin clean and soft this is it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different face washes over the years ranging from Neutrogena to Clean &amp; Clear and even more expensive stuff from my dermatologist but this stuff just flat out &#x27;feels&#x27; amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is never any of that residue feeling that you get with other soaps it just feels clean and washes away all of the oils and dirt. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight either, it just feels - clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find this at my local stores anymore so I order 4 at a time from Amazon so I always have a stock. My wife loves this stuff too and she&#x27;s been through all of the fancy face washes on the market. You really need to try this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> very nice face wash that is oil-free.  I can only find it on Amazon now.</li>
            <li> I like it. My oily skin feels so squeaky after using this BUT it is no makeup remover (as claimed on the product description). Forget eye makeup, I can&#x27;t even get any foundation/powder off. I find that a little astringent on a cloth ball works well to remove leftover makeup, but then again, it might just make better sense to use a makeup remover to begin with. Great as a face wash!....but lacking as one claiming that it removes makeup...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. Very gentle yet very effective in cleaning and refreshing skin.</li>
            <li> This really works for me keeps my skin clear and not too dry.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.  I have fairly sensitive combination skin and this face wash in gentle but effective. I used to buy Clinique which is expensive but much prefer this at a fraction of the price. It removes the oil from my pores but is gentle enough not to cause any flare ups or redness. The 4 pack is a deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different cleaners from really cheap to really expensive because let&#x27;s face it, you will pay anything to keep your face from breaking out. I really like how light and smooth this one is and it makes your face feel super clean. I use this cleaner with my clarsonic and it works great. My husband even likes it because it isn&#x27;t very fragrant and it only has a light hint of citrus. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is good for daily use. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but you can feel how clean your face is after each use. The price for the 4 pack can&#x27;t be beat. My local CVS sells it for more than $6 and it&#x27;s usually sold out.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product almost 10 years ago and I LOVE it.  I can usually get it at Walgreens or WalMart but that&#x27;s a hit or a miss.  I ran out 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been searching all over for it.  I am so happy to find it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using hubby&#x27;s Neutrogen that cleans well but leaves my skin feeling really dry.  I&#x27;ve tried several products in the past few weeks but I have skin that is sensitive to most  products (I get a burning feeling within seconds if the product doesn&#x27;t work for me) and I cannot wait to go back to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like most about Basis is how well it cleans my skin without over drying it plus it has natural ingredients and smells really nice without being overwhelming.  I have dry skin with a bit of a T zone issue and it cleans all of my face along with being a great make-up remover.  (Side note, I&#x27;ve tried the facial wipes and they don&#x27;t clean off make up nearly as well as the bar or the liquid.)  My skin is clear with only washing with this followed by Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and I am so glad to be able to find a source to get this from on a regular basis - I will never let myself run out again!</li>
            <li> Been using this cleanser for 18 years and so happy I am able to find it on Amazon! Gentle, removes makeup and oil, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a cleanser to do anything more for me.  It is perfect from price to packaging to performance.</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever! Been using this for 14 years now and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried that dissolves all your makeup right off..skin feels nice and refreshed afterwards...sometimes I follow up with another cleanser if I have a break out...would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> I love basis face wash.  Basis deep cleans, washing away the days make up, without irritating my sensitive skin.  And it&#x27;s affordable.  It&#x27;s the only face wash I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s favorite face wash. Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean and cuts through the oil that builds up over night or throughout the day. Feels less chemically than some others and, well, I guess the name says it all. Cleaner clean is about right.</li>
            <li> The product itself is solid.  Basis products have been around since my dad was a kid and they&#x27;ve always worked.  However, I would caution against getting them from Amazon.  Mine arrived and 2 of the 4 had busts at the top and leaked out.  The packaging was inadequate and they were squeezed and popped.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle, but thorough face cleaner.  Perfect for any type of skin, from dry (like mine) to oily!</li>
            <li> This is a mild face wash good for all skin types. It gently removes dirt make up and excess oil without skin irratation. It&#x27;s good for men and women. I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li> I miss my Olay cleanser that lathered with a creamy foam and rinses clean.  This doesn&#x27;t lather as well, but it does seem to clean.  I am switching back.  Olay makes great products that feel great and always work well.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I have had trouble finding it in the stores. Glad to have it again in my home. Whew</li>
            <li> This product is lousy! Sure, if you start with a clean face it will clean your face, but it absolutely does NOT remove makeup. You still have it in after washing with this! ICK!</li>
            <li> Since this cold weather has started I began breaking out a lot on my T-zone. My acne becomes very inflamed and all I see is redness. I have only realized this year that this only happens during the winter or really cold months.  I began researching why and its called seasonal acne, and its very common to see during this type of season. From the many websites I read, it suggests that finding a cleanser that contains aloe and this is one of them. So, I decided to find it online but Amazon has a pack of 4 and I really didn&#x27;t want to buy 4 when I don&#x27;t know how well it works. I looked at stores that carry this product and thankfully, my closest Walmart had it. Since yesterday (when I bought it), I&#x27;ve been washing my face twice a day and I already see a big difference when I woke up this morning. The redness has alleviated greatly and my pimples are drying up :). I don&#x27;t know how well this will work for everyone but I have a combination of oily to dry skin. My T-zone is the only part of my face that gets oily and the rest of my face is pretty normal-to a little dry. When it comes to buying products I normally have to do a little research on it because I can&#x27;t always trust what everyone&#x27;s results are. Buying a face cleanser is really about what type of skin you have, how your skin is affected during the season and so on. Of course, you also need to make sure you don&#x27;t touch your face with unwashed hands. I hope this helps you guys.</li>
            <li> While I may be picky, it does not feel as clean as some of the other facial scrubs that exfoliate, as well as clean.  Not bad, not good, but okay for the price.  Nothing special, I will be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial wash.  Most stores quit carrying this product and I have had a hard time finding anything I like as well.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon and a great value with Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Getting harder to find on a store shelves, so I order 6 at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, cleans well without drying out your skin, all natural.  When used with a good moisturizer it&#x27;s an unbeatable combination.</li>
            <li> my face breaks out usually with other cleansers but not with this one. great product had to buy it here since Walmart stopped carrying it in there stores.</li>
            <li> Great face wash at a great price.  Good for sensitive skin.  I have had no issues with breakouts or drying out my skin.  It has a lovely fresh scent.</li>
            <li> the only face wash that i love but can&#x27;t find anywhere except on amazon so I&#x27;m happy to get it in bulk and get four for a great price!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Basis cleans my oily complexion without a residue or a feeling of dried out skin.  I&#x27;m disappointed that Walmart is discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at Walmart.  I really enjoyed it and thought I would check Amazon to see if I could buy it from home and cheaper, both.  Voila!  There it was.  It&#x27;s a gel consistency with a nice aroma, does a nice yet gentile job of cleaning my face, and the price is great.  What more could you want?  I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was 18 years old, it was recommended by my dermatologist.I am now in my 40&#x27;s and still swear by it. I have passed it down to my teenage son who has skin problems. He comments that it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; and smells good.</li>
            <li> I used this facewash for a couple years and found it to be very nice for skin and with cleansing, took off makeup pretty well and was a nice mild scent. I only really stopped to switch to the oil cleanse method of face washing.</li>
            <li> It took many years for me to find a good reliable and affordable face cleanser. Since using Basis, I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores have become less visible and my skin is smoother and less oily. I have combination skin and this is one of the few face cleansers that hasn&#x27;t given me an allergic reaction or left my face feeling stripped and unnaturally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just a small amount (dime size) this cleanser works wonders on your face. Basis leaves your skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering (which is a plus) and you won&#x27;t feel any residue after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this face cleanser for almost a year now, and it&#x27;s become part of my daily skin care regimen. If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and reliable face cleanser, use Basis. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I have sensitive skin and Basis is very gentle on it, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist long ago.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleanser whose price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Great product for oily skin like mine or any other skin type.  A tiny amount goes a long way.  I even bought the travel wipes.  My friends tried them and loved it too.</li>
            <li> Is a great natural product!</li>
            <li> Great for facial skin issues. Very mild!</li>
            <li> I wish I had looked up the ingredients on this before buying. It&#x27;s got all the Laureths, Lauryls and Laurates and suds up like crazy. It also has Butylene (Butane), Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Chloride etc. All that makes for skin that is clean, but harshly so. I&#x27;m like the reviewer who looked at the name, \\&quot;basis,\\&quot; and immediately thought it was all-natural without the harsh sudsing agents and other stuff. This left my skin feeling stripped for several hours after use. Definitely not something I can use. I might try using it as a hair shampoo and see what happens.</li>
            <li> its not working for me, but my teen son like it. its seems to work for him. so..there you go.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of face wash! They used to carry it at CVS, but no longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now I resort to Amazon and buy it in three-packs. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. This does a great job at cleansing without being harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as a pack of four, and I received three. I&#x27;ve bought this before and never has an issue. The package is torn open like it either fell out or was taken. I&#x27;ve tried to contact other ways.</li>
            <li> CLEANS FACE WELL BUT DRIES IT OUT AFTERWARDS</li>
            <li> I have always loved this face cleaner which was recommended to me by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;Deeply clean, rich suds immediately, soft, gentle cleaner that leaves you with a very refreshed face.&lt;br /&gt;My number one or two face product all time. I have tried tons of face cleaners this is a real reliable winner.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It cleans my face the best and I have oily skin without drying out feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this item from Amazon packaged in bulk. The product is wonderful and I was pleased with the price!It is very fresh smelling and leaves your skin feeling clean. I recommend this product to others. For the quality and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I keep this stocked in my bathroom.  My dermatologist recommended this years ago.  Every time I go in for a check-up she is happy that I continue using it.  It is very gentle yet it cleans well.  It&#x27;s not expensive.  It smells nice.  Who could ask for more?  i&#x27;ve used many expensive products and I keep coming back to this.  I hope Basis never quits making this cleanser. I would be very sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.  Unfortunately, the store where I shop doesn&#x27;t always carry it so I decided to order it on line.  It doesn&#x27;t have any abrasive ingredients like alcohol which is great for sensitive skin.  I would recommend this product highly. Leaves your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My mother told me about this product when I was in grade school and it came in a small cake form. I still use it 60 years later.&lt;br /&gt;Pat L.</li>
            <li> This 6 oz. tube is only $2.49 at Ulta!! Glad I checked before buying FOUR of them. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Great face wash. Definite recommend. Hard to go through 4-6 bottles though, unless you have a giant face I guess.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived earlier than projected even.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this amazing product is hard to find and I have been using it for many years. So when I searched several local retailers and they didn&#x27;t carry it, I turned to Amazon and found it right away. Love the 4-pack deal because I never want to run out. My entire family uses this gentle facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for a year or so, and my local Walmart is no longer keeping it in stock. Luckily I was able to find it here. Now I don&#x27;t have to change face wash. I have combination skin, and live in a very dry climate. This face wash is just right.</li>
            <li> We have using this product for quite sometime, it cuts down any oil, make up and keep our faces clean and it doesn&#x27;t dry our skin ( big plus!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 10+ yrs (Derm Recommended) and I never want to use anything else. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, but removes ALL my makeup w one simple wash. Highly suggest it!</li>
            <li> This product cleans your face very well without harmful chemicals, smells great&lt;br /&gt;and makes your skin smooth and soft.  I have been using this for many years and&lt;br /&gt;will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  It&#x27;s THAT good.  Literally nothing bad to say about this product. It exceeds in every possible area.  Please Basis, NEVER discontinue!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this face saop</li>
            <li> I like this skin cleaner and use it everyday for almost two years, cheap and powerful</li>
            <li> Best face wash.  My whole family uses it.  Very gentle but your face becomes super clean.</li>
            <li> Amazing face wash your skin feels so fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Love this cleaner! I have used it for years, and could not find it locally anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this face wash religiously for years. It&#x27;s simple, low odor, and makes his face feel clean. You can&#x27;t get more basic than this!</li>
            <li> my favorite face wash for more than 10 years!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! It removes all my toughest to get off makeup in just a tiny drop of the product. Walmart stopped carrying it in store, so I bought it here for the best price.  It must be used with a moisturizer, or it tends to dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face cleansers out there. My face feels very clean and refreshed and it&#x27;s the kind of clean that feels like there is no residue left behind. Light breakouts as I&#x27;ve gotten older are diminished.</li>
            <li> my favorite at an insane value. Soft, non drying, clean light scent, and comes in a 4 pack so I got to turn my mom and grandmother onto it. they both love it too!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally, thank goodness this is still available online.  This has been my favorite face cleaner for years.</li>
            <li> Have used basis for years.  If you have sensitive skin and/or soft water this washes off and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin.  My forehead and nose are oily, but my cheeks and chin are dry.  Additionally, if my skin gets too dry it becomes tight and red.  I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno&#x27;s Ultra Calming foaming face wash for some time now with great success.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s expensive, and then Amazon decided to remove it from the Subscribe and Save program, so I decided to give this cleanser a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Basis cleanser does not foam up right out of the bottle like the Aveeno, but rather it&#x27;s a gel like consistency and needs to be rubbed together in your hands to build up the lather.  It lathers up well, and rinses cleanly without leaving my skin dry feeling. The Basis smells nice, with a light slightly floral fragrance.  After using the Basis for weeks now I&#x27;ve have not noticed any bad reactions or issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great face cleanser, even for those with combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin can be sensitive sometimes.  Using a scrub causes major issues.  I once used a dove face wash that played nice with my skin, but they stopped selling it at the store.  This one is actually better: just as gentle, leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; clean &amp; not at all irritated.  It even smells nice &amp; has a pleasant color.  I&#x27;ll be using this product for some time.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleaner my wife will use!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite facial cleansers.  Love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for a few months now, and I have only positive things to say about it (though I will try to critique it fairly for helpful feedback). I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I have relatively dry skin save for a sometimes oily T-zone. I usually don&#x27;t break out and when I do it&#x27;s right before my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely wonderful and light, so for anyone bothered by fragrance this should be okay. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and even then you can only smell it while applying it. The scent it does have is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry like it usually does after cleansing it. I still moisturize it (with Lancome Bienfait Multivital for those interested), but immediately after washing it still feels normal. Normally, cleansers leave my face feeling tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleanser daily and despite having used it for just over 2 months, I still haven&#x27;t run out! I use it once a day and you only need a tiny amount in order to get the right amount for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It completely removes my makeup, which I love, and it even claims to remove pollution! I say claims because there is no way for me to test this out, of course :p Oh, and as with all other cleansers, it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup like mascara or eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had never had problem skin, since using this product my skin is the clearest it has ever been. Even my pre-menstrual breakouts seem to be better. In case this is conditional, my current skin care routine only involves using this and the aforementioned moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Things about my lifestyle that may affect how this works for me: I&#x27;m 20 years old, I exercise on a regular basis, and I stay away from fast food.</li>
            <li> I use every day. Love It</li>
            <li> I have been using Basis cleaner clean for over 8 years. It cleans well lathers well and is a good pre and post-shave face wash. Not available everywhere but Bed and Bath has it for a little over $4. Seems to calm down and help my Rosacea. Has a subtle and clean smell.Wont be without it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in stores for quite some time so order them 4 to a pack.  This stuff gets rid of make up, and deep cleans my skin. I have combination, sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s not soap so it doesn&#x27;t strip or irritate my skin. Leaves my skin smooth, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it&#x27;s a great buy! You can&#x27;t go wrong with the four pack for the selling price.</li>
            <li> I got this product a year back from Walmart. I loved it. Am crazy about expensive stuff. But this is by far the best cleanser for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It controls my breakout. And does not leave my skin dry. Cheap yet effective and best budget regular cleanser. Try !!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s new product of cleansing pads is a great hypo allergenic product. Love this line for daily use. I got it way cheaper in Amazon.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I got this product cause I thought it was goin tobe like the all clear bar was but it&#x27;s not, back in the day it was it would clean and clear your face now I think they put some soap and water and added the old sent to it and Saling it, it&#x27;s not for me get the &amp;#34;all clean an clear bar&amp;#34; back</li>
            <li> i love it. cheap and great!</li>
            <li> I can no longer use this because it does dry my cheeks out too bad but it does control acne very well and cleans my shave area very well (I am guy). It foams very well and lasts long enough for you to get a good cleaning. It does make my face feel tight but I actually like that. I would advise someone who has used traditional acne cleanser to give this a try becuase it is not as harsh as the salicylic acid. I am sorry I cannot use this anymore it really did wash my face very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Basis face wash for a few years.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, and leaves my face clean.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product several years ago, and find it to be a great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than some of the other cleansers on the market but it does as well or better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it, because it&#x27;s hard to find locally anymore.  I buy it 4 bottles at a time a few times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Basis&#x27; All Clear Antibacterial bar, seems to have been discontinued. I am loyal to this brand and have loved the all clear bar for many years and thought I would try another in their line. Product has a nice, gentle scent and it a nice enough cleanser. However, if you have oily or acne prone skin this may not be the solution for you. Over four weeks of using this product caused my mild acne to become more than moderate. Wish it worked for me, but I will be looking for an anti-bacterial wash or bar.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite face wash and one of mine. It cleans really well and the smell is the best! I hope they never change the formula. I get this with subscribe and save it is that good.</li>
            <li> Best face wash for the price. Does not dry your skin but cleans very well</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my makeup brushes. Didn&#x27;t care for it as my everyday face wash</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic face wash. It does the job for a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular cleaner for years but for some reason I can barely find it in stores now.  I was so happy to find it on amazon!  I normally order the 4-pack and it lasts me at least 6mo.  Such a good deal.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on past reviews on amazon.com  I never heard about this brand before but decided to give it a try anyway. It&#x27;s a pretty good basic cleaner leaves your skin feels refreshed the only con is that i feel like its drying the skin a little to much.</li>
            <li> Product has a decent odor, however I think there are too many skin irritants in this product, like a lot of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which my skin really does not appreciate. People, there is a reason this cleanser is so cheap compared to others, because they use cheap ingredients. Save your face the trouble and get something that is actually healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using for years...it&#x27;s the best light weight, gentle cleanser I&#x27;ve used. My face does not break out or over dry with daily use even during dry winters or humid summer. I also like its scent too... Very light and citrus. It&#x27;s so hard to find in stores and when I do.. There is only 2 or 3 in stock so thankfully I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This not only cleans every spec of dirt off your face is DOESN&#x27;T dry it out! Cleans better than the over priced cleansers!!</li>
            <li> Everyone is right; this stuff is amazing, soft and naturally clean. This is great, it does come in a pack of 4 (I didn&#x27;t realize this) so pleasantly surprised about that. It smells really softly like mint or basil and it really great for cleaning, it&#x27;s not harsh at all and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I don&#x27;t have ACNE or anything crazy (I&#x27;m a male) and it works good to get off the oils from post-workout or after a run/bike/hike and easy on the body as well though I wouldn&#x27;t use it for body-wash since you&#x27;d go through it all pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I started using basis facewash as a teenager when my dermatologist recommended it to help with my acne. 10 years later and I still love it even though I rarely get acne minus the occasional pimple. What I love about this facewash is it gets all your makeup off including the loads of mascara that I use. Not to mention that it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I got many of my friends to use it and they love it. It&#x27;s kind of hard to find but I&#x27;ve seen it at longs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for about three years now and it is the best! It makes skin super soft, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, but also doesn&#x27;t make it oily. I have acne-prone,sensitive, semi-oily skin and this is very light and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. It is hypoallergenic and oil-free. I would definitely recommend it for ALL skin types, but especially acne-prone, oily, combination, and sensitive.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this gentle yet thorough cleanser for me to try instead of the more aggressive one I had been using. My past cleanser had exfoliating particles as well as an alpha/beta-hydroxy treatment, which was causing my skin to be uncharacteristically oily. I told her that I was using the exfoliating/acid cleanser because that was the only thing I had tried which deep cleansed my pores and got rid of greasy excess sebum. I didn&#x27;t realize that my skin was producing its own excess oil to combat the natural oils that were being stripped away. I had never heard of Basis, but decided to give it a try. I will never use a harsh cleanser again!</li>
            <li> good cleanser w/o oil</li>
            <li> My husband loves this face wash and he convinced me to try it.  Before using Basis I had tried dozens of cleansers over the years including many expensive ones from department stores and day spas.  I must admit, this cleanser works just as well if not better than the pricey ones.  It cleans well and rinses off easily without drying my skin.  It has a very nice smell that is gender neutral--not too floral or feminine, and not too masculine either (such as pine or musk).  The manufacturer says it has mint, chamomile, and lemongrass, but I would say that none of those smells dominate.  Instead, they combine to create a unique smell that is slightly citrus, light, and fresh without smelling chemical or artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other \\&quot;pros\\&quot;: it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  No greasy residue.  Takes off make-up well.  Tube design has no flaws and sits upright without leaking or becoming messy.  It has a good gel-like consistency that lathers and spreads well, so a little goes a long way.  I hate cleansers that are too thin/watery because you end up using more and ultimately spending more.  A tube of Basis lasts a long time--a few months.  And I like sharing the same cleanser with my husband because it reduces the clutter in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Cons\\&quot;: not many stores stock it (and we are in a major metro area), meaning you must plan ahead and stock up when you see it or buy ahead online to avoid running out.  Also it does not exfoliate so I use a separate product for weekly exfoliating to get rid of dead skin cells (which is important for skin to look its best).  I also cannot say how it works on acne because I have not suffered from that since my teenage years (thankfully!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: a very good basic skin cleanser for men and women at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This face wash is godly. So cheap and works wonders. It starts to foam up, smells clean, and makes you feel refreshed. Nothing bad to say about it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 13 years.  I hope they never stop making it, because my face will not be happy.  My skin is sensitive, and this is the only face wash that has ever worked for me.  It smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever but really dries out your face - don&#x27;t use it more than once a day and moisturize if you can!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Basis for about 4 years now.  It foams nicely and leaves a clean scent.  It is not oily or drying either.  I have severe allergies and sensitive skin, and this wash has never given me a problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this face wash since I was in high school so about 12 years now. I like how clean my face is after using it! It is hard to find around town so I buy it in bulk on amazon when I need it. It is cheapest that way, and it last forever! I have pretty oily skin and it works great to not dry my skin out too much after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. it it clean smelling, lathers up nicely and leaves the skin soft. I can recommend it without reservations.</li>
            <li> We, as a family, have been using this for years.  I had minor breakouts as an adult and my daughter had them in her teens.  Once we began using Basis, breakouts became a thing of the past.  Basis is a non-soap cleanser that is gentle on the skin.  We use it year &#x27;round.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so once I find a product I like I stick with it.  This is hard to find in the stores sometimes and I usually have a tube by the sink and in the shower so I found a multipack here for a great price.  Nice product, gentle but gets all the makeup off and smells light and natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for probably 6years + and I&#x27;ve always come back to this even if I tried other things along the way.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t break me out and the scent is very neutral, not over powering at all.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t foam too much and doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It does clean/break most of my make up so I am just left with a little bit of eyeliner/mascara residue.</li>
            <li> This is only $3 at stores - I realized this bulk buy was a rip off too late. My mistake.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very sensitive skin, with occasional break outs. I saw this item and the price and decided to give it a shot. Now both my daughter and I are using this face wash. Excellent price!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great!  Gets your skin squeaky clean and keeps it blemish free.  Much less expensive than other cleansers and does just as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by basis and has for years, now she&#x27;s got me using it and it cured my dry skin problems.  I know it sounds like i&#x27;m a paid spokes person but now that I&#x27;m over a certain age it&#x27;s about time I did something nice for my skin!</li>
            <li> Cleans well I workout a bit and have oily skin.  Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  It gives very nice clean feeling.  Need to apply lotion to replenish moisture after deep cleaning with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser. I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Basis since my dermatologist recommended it years ago, and I really love this product. I haven&#x27;t had any skin problems since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Now my husband uses it also. But sometimes we have trouble finding Basis at the stores in our area. It&#x27;s nice that we can get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> works great, smells good and really only need a dime size.</li>
            <li> I have combination, acne-prone skin, and I have tried many cleansers, irrespective of the price.  This is my favorite.  It cleans thoroughly, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  The fact that it is inexpensive is a pleasant bonus.  I will continue to buy and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Is perfect, I love basis is the best.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and not just for my face.  I place it in a pump bottle and use as a body wash in the shower, I haven&#x27;t used soap in years and this product is why!  Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Basis cleaner cleans off all my make up. Even my waterproof mascara. This is the only face wash my 18 year old son will use. It keeps his face clear from breakouts.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.....cleans off all my makeup without drying me out</li>
            <li> Thanks. I received them yesterday.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this facial cleanser. Mostly due to it being oil free, but I enjoy how simple it is, without the frills. I used to purchase this at my local Walmart and it was half the price of any other cleanser on the shelf. I am extremely disappointed that I cannot find it on the shelf anymore, and turned to amazon to find it! So glad, and to purchase it in a bundle really helps!</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial cleanser before but my wife used a big brand name one. When we discovered this one, she switched to this cleanser and we both love it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works so well, very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. It cleanses my skin and does not leave me with make up residue. My skin feels clean and not oily after using it.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best! Non drying, removes makeup effortlessly.  Nice fresh clean botanical scent.  I have tried others and have never been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Use this for years great price</li>
            <li> The only face wash I&#x27;ve used for over 12 years.  I really like light, citrus scents in general.  This has a light fresh scent.  So glad Amazon carries these.</li>
            <li> I have used this for quite a while. I have tried other brands costing much more, but this face wash works for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time, from back when breakouts were my biggest concern to now when they would just get lost in my wrinkles.  I have tried many other, some very expensive, products, but it is still my favorite.  It has never bothered my very sensitive skin.  The scent is nice and it leaves my face feeling very clean but not dry.  It is difficult to find locally (I did see it in one beauty supply store for $5/tube) and am very happy to have it available for a very good price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This face wash has a pleasant scent - not overpowering, not &#x27;artificial&#x27; smelling. It leaves my face feeling clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> Met expectations of my girlfriend.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  Skin is soft and clean after use.  I use with my clarasonic, its gets all the makeup off without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> I just go this in the mail, turned it over and saw sodium laureth sulfate in one of the first ingredients. Given all the negative press for SLS lately, and because that I&#x27;m trying to find something for my sensitive skin, I have to return it (and with no free shipping, either). There&#x27;s also perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If SLS and perfume don&#x27;t bother you, it&#x27;s probably worth the buy, but I&#x27;d probably try one tube from a local drugstore before buying a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have used it for years!  I often give a tube as a gift and everyone I&#x27;ve shared it with has ordered it, too.  Even the hubs enjoys a bubbly in the spa tub with me and the delightful and refreshing cleanser makes a wonderful, gentle bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use Subscribe and Save for it.  You just need a dime-size dollop to remove make-up and mascara.  In the morning, I&#x27;ll use it again. My husband uses it, too, because it&#x27;s soap-free and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face. I originally bought this product for $7.xx at a drug store and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it now.</li>
            <li> I have used this face was for about 13 years.  It&#x27;s my favorite, but I always have trouble finding it in stores. When I see it, I buy it in bulk. There no harsh clensers or acne medication in it.  It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use; when my skin is breaking out I clense with this first and then apply acne medication.  Great for sensitive or normal skin.  I was very pleased to see the price on amazon.  I will no longer have to shop around trying to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Use it daily, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, acne is totally gone. Love the smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years to help with acne. I just wish they would bring back their moisturizer. It was amazing for oil and acne control.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. The whole family uses it and our skin looks pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> This smells nice, and it very effective on cleaning your face.  A definite deep clean.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash my face feels so good!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Basis&amp;#34; face wash has been my go-to facial cleanser for over a year, and I&#x27;ve found it to be quite a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen age daughter who has mild acne.  I was looking for a gentle cleanser that would not strip all the natural oils from her face because acne treatments are already pretty harsh.  I tried this myself one day and I&#x27;m hooked.  It&#x27;s not soap but it does contain some ingredients found in face and body washes (sodium laurel whatever).  It also has aloe and plant extracts so it cleans but doesn&#x27;t strip.  It doesn&#x27;t lather as nuch as soap, but it does get foamy and it does what is claims to do-- leave your face feeling very clean.  It has a refreshing quality, I believe it has mint and rosemary and it smells wonderful.  My daughter pairs it with a Neutrogena gel that is sadly no longer in production.  The result is better than the  prescription acne medication she used to have.  It&#x27;s not perfect but when she uses it consistently her skin is noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> Love this delightfully clean smelling face wash.</li>
            <li> First, this thing smells like paradise!!&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does a pretty damn good job at cleaning my face. I use it with the clarosonic.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s so cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a winner in my book!</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser.  This cleanser I would purchase again. Thank you for the fast shipment</li>
            <li> works very well cleansing your face, helps get rid of the oils. would recommend this product highly, would purchase again and again!!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It&#x27;s the only brand that I can use that actually leaves my faces feeling clean an hour after I wash with it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and my husband even keeps a bottle for himself. So glad I found it online.</li>
