            <li>It&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely wonderful and I am sure my family will like them in their Christmas stockings!</li>

            <li>Great product and shipping, on time</li>
            <li>The soap smells great and holds its fragrance.</li>
            <li>Aramis is a great soap; I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I remember how great the scent is.</li>
            <li>Wish it lasted longer but smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells like Aramis which is great smelling and so soothing.</li>
            <li>Gave to my son and he has always loved Aramis.  </li>
            <li>So though I will order it again because Aramis keeps up a good quality control, I will find another company to order it from.</li>
            <li>Thrilled to find soap on a rope</li>
            <li>/&gt;It honestly smells like a combination of:&lt;br /&gt;-Burnt</li>
            <li>Aramis (orginal) is truly a classic fragrance that will carry on its&#x27; legendary status for generations to come, imo.</li>
            <li>Love this soap I just bought four more bars to give away for Valentines Day!</li>
            <li>Very nice soap - makes you smell nice, easy to hang from your shower caddy or shower head, and you don&#x27;t drop it easily if you use the rope.</li>
            <li>I have used it for two weeks now and it is fading; I am sure it will fall off the rope eventually</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this bar of soap, although it is a lot cheaper than the Aramis soap without the rope.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box (need a better jacket for soap)</li>
            <li>I think that most fragrances containing oakmoss has a sort of aphrodesiac affect, esp.</li>
            <li>glad I could find it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>I bought this soap for my husband because I love Aramis products.  </li>
            <li>I shoud have bought more and used them for my sons for Fathers Day.  </li>
            <li>If you like the scent of Aramis you&#x27;ll love this fine, hard-milled soap.</li>
            <li>Old School great scent</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay a bit more for the nostalgia and novelty, but I doubt I will purchase one more than once or twice a year.</li>
            <li>a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wanted to enjoy the experience again</li>
            <li>Purchased for hubby &amp; the scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>this is a fabulous shower waiting to happen-you dry off feeling great every time.</li>
            <li>I tossed it out and purchasing my go-to Musgo Real as it smells clean and fresh, lasts long, and the best soap-on-a-rope out there.</li>
            <li>sweet overtones of cut grass</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, four bucks for what amounted to hundreds of dollars worth of products.</li>
            <li>But they raised the price to 18.00 right before Christmas when my family wanted to give it to me as a gift.  </li>
            <li>Scent to clean: mission accomplished</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, but not very masculine, but that was not my reason for purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>Are they genuine or are they just years old?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll begin by saying that the Aramis soap is as good as it ever was, however, the company that ships it takes far too long to get it to customers.</li>
            <li>Smells sexy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>They put the damaged items into these large laundry type bags and sold the whole bag to employees for, as I remember then, $4.</li>
            <li>Hard to find soap and good price.</li>
            <li>The Only difficulty has been  locating where it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending it.</li>
            <li>and you really want to take a shower every time you walk in just because of the sensual smell of this soap/shampoo.</li>
            <li>and everyone agreed it was absolutely horrendous smelling.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Aramis products in quite some time, mainly because of the newer generation of fragrances out there which are in abundance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to feel alive.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not as rich and the soap does not generate the suds expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li>My 80 year old dad loves this.  </li>
            <li>Mom would come home with several bags a couple of times per year and this got me started with Aramis soap on a rope and the bars as well, plus the after shave products, all high quality.</li>

            <li> I had not used soap on a rope since I was a kid and I wanted to enjoy the experience again and I have.  The fragrance is nice, but not very masculine, but that was not my reason for purchasing it.  I have used it for two weeks now and it is fading; I am sure it will fall off the rope eventually but it is holding up well just now.  I was willing to pay a bit more for the nostalgia and novelty, but I doubt I will purchase one more than once or twice a year.</li>
            <li> Everyone will notice you with that shampoo body shampoo</li>
            <li> this is a fabulous shower waiting to happen-you dry off feeling great every time. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to feel alive.</li>
            <li> came  on timesmells great</li>
            <li> Purchased for hubby &amp; the scent is fantastic.  Came packaged well &amp; size of soap is great.  Except for price, I was very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping, on time</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for forty years or so. My mom worked as a book keeper for Estee Lauder on Long Island. When a store returned a product to Estee because of damage to packaging, they didn&#x27;t repackage. They put the damaged items into these large laundry type bags and sold the whole bag to employees for, as I remember then, $4. That&#x27;s right, four bucks for what amounted to hundreds of dollars worth of products. Usually there would be like thirty or fourty items per bag. The bags weren&#x27;t transparent so you didn&#x27;t know what you were buying. Mom would come home with several bags a couple of times per year and this got me started with Aramis soap on a rope and the bars as well, plus the after shave products, all high quality. Been using them ever since. The soap smells great and holds its fragrance. A bar lasts about a month if you shower every day.</li>
            <li> These were ordered for a friend who couldn&#x27;t purchase them at Macys or Nordstroms. He likes the produce.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I bought it for my hubby. It is actually hard to get in department store. Came in time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> brother- in- law loves this soap</li>
            <li> Aramis is a great soap; I&#x27;ve been using it for years. The Only difficulty has been  locating where it&#x27;s available.Thanks for sending it.</li>
            <li> Gave to my son and he has always loved Aramis.  I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> As Agreed and happy with purchase! Would Buy it again if needed!  Very good product!  I am very happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> My 80 year old dad loves this.  It is almost impossible to find in stores.  Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I reorder all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll begin by saying that the Aramis soap is as good as it ever was, however, the company that ships it takes far too long to get it to customers. So though I will order it again because Aramis keeps up a good quality control, I will find another company to order it from. BTW, to make it clear, this was NOT shipped by Amazon, but one of the other company&#x27;s that show up on the listing.</li>
            <li> The packaging for the bar of soap was torn and ripped up then re taped, the problem is that this was a present. So I am very disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Scent to clean: mission accomplished</li>
            <li> I have been using this Aramis Soap on a rope for years from various vendors but these are different. We are somewhat disappointed. The aroma is not as rich and the soap does not generate the suds expected. Are they genuine or are they just years old?</li>
            <li> if you want luxury this is it.</li>
            <li> I love this bar of soap, although it is a lot cheaper than the Aramis soap without the rope. There is Aramis shaving soap that you can buy, but if you use the round bars strictly for shaving, then one bar can last you for one year. Pro-rated that means the price of Aramis shaving soap bars can be a lot cheaper than to buy than the canned shaving soaps bought in the drug stores across America.</li>
            <li> excellent soap, the rope is a pain</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of Aramis you&#x27;ll love this fine, hard-milled soap.</li>
            <li> Very nice soap - makes you smell nice, easy to hang from your shower caddy or shower head, and you don&#x27;t drop it easily if you use the rope.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Aramis products in quite some time, mainly because of the newer generation of fragrances out there which are in abundance. When I opened the box (need a better jacket for soap) I remember how great the scent is. I think that most fragrances containing oakmoss has a sort of aphrodesiac affect, esp. for me. Aramis (orginal) is truly a classic fragrance that will carry on its&#x27; legendary status for generations to come, imo.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this product. Not easily available in stores except around holidays.</li>
            <li> Love this soap I just bought four more bars to give away for Valentines Day! The soap also makes the bathroom smell wonderful and you really want to take a shower every time you walk in just because of the sensual smell of this soap/shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted longer but smells great.</li>
            <li> Old School great scent</li>
            <li> Smells like Aramis which is great smelling and so soothing. Thank You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aramis since 1973 and reason is it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything else. It&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> glad I could find it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> Strange perfume scent not a fan</li>
            <li> Hard to find soap and good price.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed that the Aramis soap had been discontinued.  Thrilled to find soap on a rope so my husband doesn&#x27;t have to change soaps and scents after all these years.</li>
            <li> 16 years overseas. An Infantry Veteran. I work now for the Railroad as a Thru-Freight Conductor, and Snore like a Garbage Truck crashing through a plate-glass window during a War ; In short , &amp;#34;A Man&#x27;s Man&amp;#34;. I received this as a gift 2 years ago , and am now on my 4th Bar that I&#x27;ve bought myself .. Enough said ; now Go buy it .</li>
            <li> The soap and the cologne just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  Sorry</li>
            <li> Smells sexy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my husband because I love Aramis products.  The price was right but the shipping charge were so expensive.  I shoud have bought more and used them for my sons for Fathers Day.  Oh well next time</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these for Christmas presents.  The smell is absolutely wonderful and I am sure my family will like them in their Christmas stockings!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but I wish they would do away with the rope. They used to sell a 3-bar box that I bouight regularly, but I can no longer find it.</li>
            <li> My goodness this smells horrible. I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many 5-star reviews. I wanted to switch things up from my usual premium soap on a rope (Musgo Real), and boy was that a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It honestly smells like a combination of:&lt;br /&gt;-Burnt Hair&lt;br /&gt;-Burnt Tires&lt;br /&gt;-And sweet overtones of cut grass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so appalled by the smell I took it to work and everyone agreed it was absolutely horrendous smelling. Yuck. I tossed it out and purchasing my go-to Musgo Real as it smells clean and fresh, lasts long, and the best soap-on-a-rope out there. Hope this helps and saves others money!</li>
            <li> 5 stars at 14.00 a bar.  But they raised the price to 18.00 right before Christmas when my family wanted to give it to me as a gift.  It&#x27;s back down, now that the holidays are over. That pisses me off.</li>
