    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Once again the collective wisdom of the Amazon community led me to the discovery of THE BEST SHAMPOO I&#x27;VE</li>
            <li>I Have to say that this is the best psoriasis treatment that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim and have been very impressed.</li>
            <li>Excellent shampo and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Aside from prescription-strength treatment...this is the best on the market to control my psorasis.</li>
            <li>The best routine I&#x27;ve found is to wash my hair with it as soon as I get into the shower, then do everything else I need to do (shave/wash etc.)</li>
            <li>it was awesome.  </li>
            <li>Because of some do-gooder, I know that thousands are without the best product that ever was made for our problem.</li>

            <li>It may not have the most pleasant smell of any soaps, but I swear this shampoo works wonders.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing Product, ordered for my son, I was trying to avoid the Dermatologist Visit and fees, the product save me...</li>
            <li>Coal Tar is amazing adittion to a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think that it would be nice to know in the shipping information this kind of things.    </li>
            <li>I was using a prescription foam for my scalp, that worked at the onset, but then stopped being effective.</li>
            <li>The shampoo if effective and I am a repeat user.</li>
            <li>but my heair looked nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really effective.  </li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>nice product..</li>
            <li>I just use a nice smelling conditioner after.</li>
            <li>A nice shampoo</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>It worked great and smelled pretty good, considering.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, most effective treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alternate using it with a mild baby shampoo, and use a good conditioner and you should have good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As advertised, great price &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years with better than good results.</li>
            <li>Get a good conditioner to use afterward and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used the shampoo twice, and hair cream as needed and I am already getting excellent results.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best psoriasis product I&#x27;ve ever used and intend to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>very quick delivery!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much, as it foams up really great.  </li>
            <li>Works beautifully and really curbd the itching.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on very light, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>It also smells better than most coal tar based formulas.</li>
            <li>I have tried many coal tar shampoos with dismal results.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work great.   </li>
            <li>Still I did think it was better then nothing.</li>
            <li>I found Mg 217 Intensive Strength Medicated Tar Ointment for Psoriasis 3.8 Oz having the highest review start number by many people.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly safe for adults.  </li>
            <li>you were to ask which product is produced a better result</li>
            <li>Works better than the store bought one.  </li>
            <li>Works better than what i&#x27;ve bought in stores.</li>
            <li>It is OK .</li>
            <li>I will definatley be using this more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having more recurrences now than before</li>
            <li>I tried every medication on the market - most work for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>For me, I got better results when I did the laser every two weeks</li>
            <li>then those are more than sufficient to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li>I searched online and found something that was supposed to be even better, Ala Seb T, which added coal tar to Ala Seb&#x27;s salicylic acid and</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;d gladly deal with the odor to get rid of the flakes and itching.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo ever, I am already on my second bottle and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Really is a magic potion for hubby&#x27;s dandruff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most noticable in the shower and on my brush.</li>
            <li>I am glad that this product exist.  </li>
            <li>I used to see a noticeable sprinkle of dandruff at the top of my head each day...</li>
            <li>Works better for me then Neutrogena TSAL</li>
            <li>While I love this shampoo, it is stripping my hair colour.  </li>
            <li>Seems to make my scalp feel better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased and relieved that I found Mg 217.</li>
            <li>Glad it is online.</li>
            <li>The women love it and follow me in droves.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has worked better than anything else I had tried.</li>
            <li>We tried every dandruff shampoo available in the store and even went to our Dr and got a prescription shampoo!</li>
            <li>Most shampoos have some thickness to it, a richness you expect.</li>
            <li>It seems as if I lose more than I use with each shampoo.  </li>
            <li>do not plan on buying it again, there are better medicated shampoos on the market, that are thicker and they lather up when used.  </li>
            <li>that as I said you lose more than you use.  </li>
            <li>After opening the package and smelling the potent smell, I read the packaging which states:</li>
            <li>but my head/hair feels better than it has in over a year.</li>
            <li>Even better than shampoo that was prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased and relieved.  </li>
            <li>You have to use it a couple of times before you&#x27;ll notice that your scalp feels better and the dandruff is under control.</li>
            <li>Have tyred many shampoos for my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Better nutrition seems to be the answer for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more in a month.</li>
            <li>If only, it was cheaper but amazon has some of the best prices.  </li>
            <li>My scalp feels so MUCH BETTER....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I had many dermatologist visits and tried many steroids.</li>
            <li>I top it off with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>believe me you will love it,</li>
            <li>when it was used alone...it worked ok...</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty good for my stubborn dandruff but at a cost-</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my hair look pretty darned good - doesn&#x27;t look like</li>
            <li>Have had the problem for many years and this seems to help quite a bit and also has some conditioners in it and smells fine.</li>
            <li>New packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t enjoy the smell, but I love the outcome.</li>
            <li>I have tried other shampoo&#x27;s for psoriasis and this works the best.</li>
            <li>In combination with this shampoo, I saw very quick results.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a strong medicinal smell to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be a bit too strong on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell</li>
            <li>strong chemical smell-</li>
            <li>but it also doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong as the T/Gel.  </li>
            <li>There is definitely a strong tar/gasoline smell but this smell is not a reason to avoid the product.</li>
            <li>So far so good:)</li>
            <li>The best psoriasis and dandruff shampoo out there, hands down.</li>
            <li>I think I would get better results if I were more consistent in using the product.</li>
            <li>- - so fine - - lets try it.&lt;br /&gt;Coal</li>
            <li>I would also use a fine tooth comb to help loosen and remove the flakes</li>
            <li>Does a fine job to relieve the scaling and helps to promote skin healing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li>The flaking and itching were disappearing so quickly it was as if I was imagining it!  </li>
            <li>Non drying which is a huge plus over the beta.</li>
            <li>Huge difference.</li>
            <li>I Recommended the Shampoo to my sister and she got the same great results.</li>
            <li>For me, the coal tar is the important part to any scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting great results and only use it twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy it is back and the formula has not changed</li>
            <li>I am not flake free, but has helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Works great, the only shampoo that leaves no dandruff, wish they had a body wash for psoriasis too!</li>
            <li>I bougth this items just by surfing trhu teh amazon&#x27;s page web, and catch my attntion, I decided to get it and gave it to a relative who used this product, having great results.</li>
            <li>Do they really need to include a Carcinogen to make this stuff effective??  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist, and is no longer available at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>But I did get a good clear year</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work and clearly states this item has a good chance of causing cancer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it does it&#x27;s job!!</li>
            <li>It is very effective against scalp conditions, especially for children.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a VO5 Hot Oil man, not because it was 99 cents, but because I imagined cool people like Burt Renyolds and David Hasselhoff using it on their nice full heads of hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I will keep using it and am pretty confident it is going to remove all the scabs on my head.</li>
            <li>Worth the smell for the relief!</li>
            <li>Originally I used a dermatologist prescribed shampoo.</li>
            <li>It helped but the original itching, burning and flaking is still with me.,</li>
            <li>this product is a strong coal tar product, way higher in concentration than comparable Neutrogena, but remember that if you have seborrheic dermatitis, you shouldn&#x27;t go gung-ho with all the strong products, as your dermatitis (which is not curable once and indefinitely) builds up tolerance to anything you use against</li>
            <li>The lather is rich and it rinses cleanly, but it does smell.</li>
            <li>While most young girls were told you shouldn&#x27;t wash your hair every day, most times</li>
            <li>We have no flaking, itching, or burning of our scalp between shampoos &amp; it leaves our hair clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>My scalp is so clean now.</li>
            <li>Boy was I right!</li>
            <li>The laser is like a super strong dose of sun concentrated on your lesions and you definitely have to avoid the sun while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you will have to see your dermatologist about the Excimer treatments, but until then, this product was better than most medications prescribed.  </li>
            <li>My scalp psoriasis did not improve after a full bottle was used over a month.</li>
            <li>I can see how this may work for true psoriasis sufferers.</li>
            <li>I think a 8 0z can last me a good 2 months.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product so I don&#x27;t have enough use to give a really good review.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this product, if you aren&#x27;t sure about it then you should just go for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had used T-Gel regularly with good results, but I wanted to try something stronger.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job, but man I wish they could make it smell better.</li>
            <li>My psoriasis is probably in the heatof its outbreak so thats why its not working real big good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only one that controls my psoriasis and the price is good.</li>
            <li>And again, it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell, just a tar smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has a kind of dander that usually has to be taken care of with a prescription shampoo, but with this and rotating with another couple kind of specialty otc shampoos, his hair and scalp is fine and we don&#x27;t have to buy the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, it IS pretty strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day (and neither do they).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked like magic and the best part, it really left my hair looking fabulous not dried out like so many other products I tried.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 25 years &amp; can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended originally by my dermatologist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had mild psoriasis on my scalp for a year or so.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly with no hassles at all.</li>
            <li>By the end of the month, my condition had improved again to the &#x60;mild&#x27; stage.  </li>
            <li>well then again I am bold...</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t see results the first couple of days of course, but around day 3 up until now I have not seen a flake and my face is smooth again.</li>
            <li>The odor was a little strong but it seems to help with  the flaking and itching, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>After first week using it 2x, my scalp was significantly cleared up.  </li>
            <li>This product is effective, the smell is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as it was initially, but it still works.  </li>
            <li>Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall This product works and the smell is definitely worth dealing with if you suffer.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d alternate their Coal Tar shampoo with the exfoliant one (which I really liked for the anti-itch properties of the Menthol)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>; T-Gel had stopped working for me at this point (not to mention, it made my usually soft and healthy hair feel like straw).</li>
            <li>If you have psoriasis or irritation of any kind on your scalp, this is the next step in treating it.</li>
            <li>....was able to clear the psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing again, I’m not awkwardly scratching at my head everywhere</li>
            <li>Within the first week of using it the itchy feeling lessened tremendously.</li>
            <li>so I use a fair amount each time, but I rotate it with two other shampoos (salicylic acid and nizoral/ketokonazole), so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>My son used this twice a week and used head and shoulders on the off days and his scalp cleared right up.  </li>
            <li>Great price for coal tar shampoo with a high percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li>While this is true, the shampoo has a very distinctive &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; smell to it, I&#x27;ve never found this to be a problem.</li>
            <li>Happily it does leave your hair nice and soft, and the product doesn&#x27;t feel caustic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true- it does smell like straight up gasoline.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I have ever been able to find that really works!!     </li>
            <li>Has more of the active ingredient, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I find I works best if you shampoo with a regular shampoo first, then the MG 217, and leave it to soak for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>for experimental reasons I went a month without using it and after two weeks the first patches started appearing, by 4 weeks they were completely back, so don&#x27;t be tricked into thinking that the flaking is gone for good.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam very much</li>
            <li>Thank you very much MG217.</li>
            <li>and it arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li>Hi, thank you very much</li>
            <li>After more than fifteen years of suffering I finally found something that does work.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos, even prescription ones that cost 120 dollars per bottle!  </li>
            <li>I use it 2 times a week and do a VO5 Hot Oil treatment in between.  </li>
            <li>(and I hope I&#x27;ve typed enough words to be able to submit this).</li>
            <li>I do a MG217 Shampoo on Sundays, and Thursdays, and a VO5 Hot Oil Treatment on Tuesdays.     </li>
            <li>but it did not clean my scalp at all.wasted 30$ on this shampoo.anyways if you&#x27;re suffering from seborrheic dermatitis/scaly scalp i dont think this shampoo will do the trick.go for something more strong.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do on the label.</li>
            <li>After using this (I am still on my first bottle)</li>
            <li>Smells funny, but goes away after your hair dries.  </li>
            <li>I would say they are similar, the tar % is higher on this product and the liquid is more viscous.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better even with having excimer laser treatments, this is what finally helps.</li>
            <li>The first shampoo I tried worked pretty well, so I thought this brand would as well.</li>
            <li>When I first put it in my had</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my husband!  </li>
            <li>and I am almost completely flake free.</li>
            <li>, this is the first he uses that really works!</li>
            <li>it first arrived, my mother would cover my head in coconut oil</li>
            <li>There was just smooth soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I am continuing to use this once a week just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but I&#x27;m still on the fence.</li>
            <li>I know I sound like one of those people from a commercial, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I have only been able to use it once</li>
            <li>My local stores that used to carry it don&#x27;t offer it any more.</li>
            <li>I used the ointment in conjunction with the shampoo (which I used every day for the first week)-and thank God, after using these products for 2 months</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t scrub those problem areas so well.  </li>
            <li>stopped the itch with first use</li>
            <li>Seemed to work the first week.</li>
            <li>this has helped me clear up a lot, it is VERY liquidy, not thick at all so other than that it is amazing &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>after reading good reviews i ordered this shampoo as i am from different country i had to pay total 30$ for this shampoo.when</li>
            <li>I was pretty astounded and it really added some perk to my day.</li>
            <li>I know that is hard to know what kind of rules run on every border, but if Amazon wants to sell products abroad I think this kind of transparency is something Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s Partners definitely need to improve in the selling process.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going into winter which means dry air and more outbreaks of this.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking, not too dry as some of these types of shampoos can be.</li>
            <li>I say settling because the strong fragrance of the Neutrogena was a big compromise on my part.</li>
            <li>It does not take me a large amount to fully get the desired results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product fairly certain it wouldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I had great results within a few uses, but beware because this stuff will leave your hair smelling pretty chemically for several hours.</li>
            <li>I can use this daily and am pretty much dandruff free.</li>
            <li>Mg 217 was discovered on one of my experimentation buys and worked as well as the prescription clobetasol, better that all of the other concoctions I had tried to that point, and the cost was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>With only one wash, my inflamed skin had subsided tremendously!</li>
            <li>While nothing I have tried over the last 50+ years clears it up completely, this product does a fine job of &amp;#34;controlling&amp;#34; it!</li>
            <li>Just use a little teaspoon at a time, hand scrub with warm water, let sit, then rinse off.  </li>
            <li>and therefore I&#x27;m responsible for any damage that this product may cause to people here.    </li>
            <li>However tar based ointments do work very well for my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>i used it for the first time the shampoo did not lather (like the normal shampoos do)</li>
            <li>This shampoo has given me very noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I used it for 7 days straight.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product over prescription Betamethazone!</li>
            <li>With my head held high!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li>and it is very liquidy and runny.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely NOTHING that could ever take the place of Pentrax Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Dont see any real difference.</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn dandruff</li>
            <li>Nothing really helped, and some things made</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It makes your hair reasonably moisturized...</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really delivers all that it promises.  </li>
            <li>Really helped with the psoriasis after a week.</li>
            <li>very runny.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered it and tried it for about a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helps control the psoriasis in the scalp.</li>
            <li>It also does not foam/lather up very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice it affecting my symptoms much.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Really like the shampoo, it gives my hair a lot of body,</li>
            <li>and it really works well.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>I like it so far and was really surprised how clean my hair feels</li>
            <li>I no longer felt the familiar cleansing effect, so I ordered this stuff which has 3 times the amount of coal tar that Neutrogena Extra Strength T-Gel has (3% vs 1%).    </li>
            <li>When I use it, that familiar &#x27;cleasing&#x27; feeling is back that I used to get with Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>Relieves symptoms better than other formulations that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Works better other products even prescription.  </li>
            <li>I found it&#x27;s better than any of the other shampoos out there for dandruff or, for me, Psoriasis which also causes flaking.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but it isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell, better than 1 other coal tar shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li>A healthy gut is linked to allergies and other skin problems.</li>
            <li>I used to need only a few drops of this shampoo to create a nice lather, but now I need over a tablespoon!</li>
            <li>Much more liquid consistency so a little hard to apply to hair but overall good stuff!</li>
            <li>I also used a mild topical prescription steroid with this shampoo, and now my scalp is ready for summer sun.</li>
            <li>It not only stops all my symptoms dead in their tracks for days, but the shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>After a week of use most of the red patches were smaller.  </li>
            <li>The more expensive products are also better at what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>main pro</li>
            <li>I had a severe case of psoriasis last year and tried many different prescriptions and shampoos and none seemed to work.</li>
            <li>Now, one month later after using it just 2x per week and using Head &amp; Shdrs Refresh daily dandruff shampoo, my scalp is finally healthy and normal.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have had to use tar shampoos since my high school days.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is basically a high powered T-Gel.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for highly rated products and bought this.  </li>
            <li>Came highly recommended....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gone from normal shedding to a decent amount of my hair ending up EVERYwhere.</li>
            <li>Far better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Second wash was done the day after the first and omg no scales, no flakes, no itchy scalp and of course no inflamed skin!</li>
            <li>A little more than year ago, I did a search for over the counter psoriasis shampoos and came across this one.  </li>
            <li>It got a little better with the first bottle, the second bottle is what really made the difference.</li>
            <li>I need to find a conditioner that will keep my hair from smelling like this, but I&#x27;ve been in so much pain from using different shampoos that had fragrance in them that I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, unlike most other treatment shampoos, which leave it feeling like soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild psoriasis of the scalp for many, many years, but due to other health conditions, over the past year or so it has become unbearable.</li>
            <li>I use 2+ times a week and sulfate free shampoo/conditioner on other days.</li>
            <li>So far I am not seeing major results but it is the first week.  </li>
            <li>I keep going back to Clobex, which works like a charm but is only available by prescription.</li>
            <li>I’ve never been so happy with a product in my life because honestly before this, I was miserable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with scalp psoriasis my whole life, and practically no other over-the-counter shampoo comes close to MG217.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked great for clearing up my psoriasis no more flaky scalp or avoiding wearing black shirts because my psoriasis was so noticable...highly recommend it</li>
            <li>By the second week all of the patches were gone, like they were never there in the first place.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out of it recently, I got more MG217 locally but ordered extra off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After 3 uses my scalp psorasis has almost cleared up completely!</li>
            <li>Bought at a local pharmacy the first time and again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Tried this product after many year or trying other similar, but not tar based products.</li>
            <li>I worried that I had developed an immunity to it&#x27;s effects... until I read the label and saw that they stopped adding the coal tar!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I have used that seems to knock out the dandruff and itching immediately upon the first use.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work better, IT also actually lathers unloke some other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li>products, in regular dosages, go toward higher strength/effectiveness like this&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>No more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;The heavy scent of freshly-paved road is a welcome bonus.</li>
            <li>routine is to apply it full strength to the problem areas and let it sit for 15 min while I do other things.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I noticed relief right after the first few shampoos.   </li>
            <li>There is almost no itching, the redness has been reduced to mild pink rash that is still fading, and the scaling and lesions are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>and I do feel significant result with less scalp itch</li>
            <li>Stinks but works great</li>
            <li>If you suffer from psoriasis, this may just be your ticket to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>around 2007 Pentrax was inexplicably withdrawn, the producer giving a manufacturing issue excuse--not a credible reason after so many years on the market.  </li>
            <li>But I do want to make clear, this product does not cure the psoriasis nor puts it into remission but it does provide some relief.</li>
            <li>My scalp was/is 95% clear now.</li>
            <li>I was mostly clear for quite some time.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight medicated smell, but I consider the scent to smell clean and outdoorsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally a shampoo that really does what it says.</li>
            <li>It worked so well in fact that it completely cleared all of my psoriasis</li>
            <li>It completely resolved my scalp problems.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a couple weeks, and so far it has dramatically improved my scalp flaking.</li>
            <li>I no longer have intense itching all day, the flaking is almost all gone, and my scalp no longer looks like it was burned by a curling iron (yes it was that red!).</li>
            <li>It worked somewhat but lately I had been noticing much more plaque build up.  </li>
            <li>So far, after three applications, I find my itching worsens when using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a rite-aid near my office</li>
            <li>You just may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 22 year old son who has a problem with scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 years old</li>
            <li>Came across this product and find that it at least takes the itching away and many of the flakes.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of washing my scalp was completely cleared.</li>
            <li>I tried dozens of shampoos - some were prescribed, some were completely natural, some were OTC but designed for psoriasis.</li>
            <li>it made me so self conscious to go to work and do my activities.</li>
            <li>As someone who prefers the natural approach to everything, it made me uneasy to put something this chemical-laden on my head.</li>
            <li>After a month, the psoriasis was completely cleared.  </li>
            <li>I actually gagged and had to hold my nose the whole time.</li>
            <li>This has stopped the itching completely.</li>
            <li>did not make flakes completely go away..</li>
            <li>so  soft  </li>
            <li>I mix it with a bit of water and apply directly to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>, it leaves my hair more manageable than any shampoo I have used lately.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers well, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so much: head &amp; shoulders, selsun blue, T-Gel, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put up with the odor because it leaves my hair as soft as a baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I  squirt it directly onto my scalp onto my problem areas and use my hair to scrub scrub and exfoliate my scalp.</li>
            <li>I recently developed what seems like scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I worried that the shampoo would be too harsh on my hair, but am really pleased that it left my hair manageable, without needing an additional conditioner, which is something I always need/use.  </li>
            <li>The last bottle I purchased with the new bottle design is a watered down version of the original.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MG 217 is green and watery in appearance, but it takes very little to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t write a better review, but this would be my first choice in treating psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>But if it is really necessary , buy this product w/o qualms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also feel free to comment and ask anything about s. dermatitis in the comments, I&#x27;ve had it for more than a decade and seen  several acclaimed dermatologists in that period, and come to be a bit of an expert on the topic, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help the psoriasis, it also leaves my hair soft!!  </li>
            <li>Looks like I found the right active ingredient (coal tar)</li>
            <li>It is not clear to me why a product with 3% coal tar would work better than one with 5%, but I do not really care so long as it works--and IT DOES.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty rough, but it WORKS.  </li>
            <li>Always seems to make my hair soft and shiny and the smell is no where near as intense as other psoriasis shampoos with coal tar as an ingredient.</li>
            <li>I noticed that Neutrogena changed the formula to a new scent and in the process they obviously reduced the strength of the product.  </li>
            <li>I have used a few Psoriasis shampoos and this is the only that I noticed a huge difference in reduction of flakes and buildup.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and conditioned, not dry</li>
            <li>They stung my scalp, were messy, time consuming and they really did not provide much in the way of relief.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo a few weeks ago and really didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li>Although as runny as it is most of it will run out of your hand and down your arm, or down the sink, or all over the floor...  </li>
            <li>Even though MG217 is rated at only 3%, as opposed to the 5% of Pentrax and PsoriaTrax, it works MUCH better, fully relieving ALL symptoms, and without the usual burning sensation produced by PsoriaTrax!  </li>
            <li>Once I received this shampoo I used it right away along with the coal tar black soap for my face, I must say I am amazed.</li>
            <li>Tried several other products without success.</li>
            <li>Great results, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad like some tar based shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>A great product and it does not smell as bad as some think it does.</li>
            <li>At 32, I&#x27;ve had scapld psoriasis since age 12 - and have tried the entire gauntlet of products to clear my scalp.</li>
            <li>Then by the end of the second month after using this shampoo, the psoriasis had gone completely into remission.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked so far for both my son and I.  </li>
            <li>My husband has psoriasis and this is the only this we have found that completely clears up his scalp.</li>
            <li>and she said that she could barely even tell I had scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li>apparently I am allergic to something in it.  </li>
            <li>and actually kind of like it (call me weird).  </li>
            <li>would recommend this product highly to others with dry, itching scaling scalps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously been using the Denorex - which worked pretty well for me - -&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course you won&#x27;t get salon results but considering other coal tar shampoos, it really does leave my hair managable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you should start with the least strong products (zinc in my list), and switch to a stronger alternative or higher dosage only when necessary, especially the group indicated as (1) in the list is extremely tolerance-building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have smelled  way worse (see burning hair comment above :-)).</li>
            <li>So I gave my bottle to my mom, who also suffers with psoriasis, and a later she told me that it was really good.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t have enough coal tar to be effective for me.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this a month ago for moderate scalp psoriasis I&#x27;ve had for 6 yrs that no other product seemed to work for.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a positive difference in terms of less scaling after about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Apply everyday when you first start, then after all the patches are gone/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different dandruff shampoos and they all make mine worse, coal tar is the only thing that seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>wash my hair every four days and after 4 or 5 washings I noticed a dramatic change in my psoriasis condition, it was now more &#x27;moderate&#x27; than &#x27;severe&#x27; which was verified by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>did I discover the true nature of my skin problems, almost wholly centered on the scalp and areas of facial hair--I have had a beard since my late teens.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it will work for you, every scalp is a little different, but invest in only one bottle at first.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who also suffers from scalp psoriasis, and this product works better than the shampoo her doctor prescribed!</li>
            <li>I will look for an alternate as the old MG 217 lasted a very long time.</li>

            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product, ordered for my son, I was trying to avoid the Dermatologist Visit and fees, the product save me...</li>
            <li> Coal Tar is amazing adittion to a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think that it would be nice to know in the shipping information this kind of things.    </li>
            <li> I was using a prescription foam for my scalp, that worked at the onset, but then stopped being effective.</li>
            <li> The shampoo if effective and I am a repeat user.</li>

            <li> As advertised, great price &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years with better than good results.</li>

            <li> Works beautifully and really curbd the itching.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on very light, bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> It also smells better than most coal tar based formulas.</li>
            <li> I have tried many coal tar shampoos with dismal results.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work great.   </li>
            <li> Still I did think it was better then nothing.</li>
            <li> I found Mg 217 Intensive Strength Medicated Tar Ointment for Psoriasis 3.8 Oz having the highest review start number by many people.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly safe for adults.  </li>
            <li> you were to ask which product is produced a better result</li>
            <li> Works better than the store bought one.  </li>
            <li> Works better than what i&#x27;ve bought in stores.</li>
            <li> It is OK .</li>
            <li> I will definatley be using this more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having more recurrences now than before</li>
            <li> I tried every medication on the market - most work for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> For me, I got better results when I did the laser every two weeks</li>
            <li> then those are more than sufficient to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li> I searched online and found something that was supposed to be even better, Ala Seb T, which added coal tar to Ala Seb&#x27;s salicylic acid and</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;d gladly deal with the odor to get rid of the flakes and itching.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever, I am already on my second bottle and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Really is a magic potion for hubby&#x27;s dandruff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most noticable in the shower and on my brush.</li>
            <li> I am glad that this product exist.  </li>
            <li> I used to see a noticeable sprinkle of dandruff at the top of my head each day...</li>
            <li> Works better for me then Neutrogena TSAL</li>
            <li> While I love this shampoo, it is stripping my hair colour.  </li>
            <li> Seems to make my scalp feel better.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased and relieved that I found Mg 217.</li>
            <li> Glad it is online.</li>
            <li> The women love it and follow me in droves.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked better than anything else I had tried.</li>
            <li> We tried every dandruff shampoo available in the store and even went to our Dr and got a prescription shampoo!</li>
            <li> Most shampoos have some thickness to it, a richness you expect.</li>
            <li> It seems as if I lose more than I use with each shampoo.  </li>
            <li> do not plan on buying it again, there are better medicated shampoos on the market, that are thicker and they lather up when used.  </li>
            <li> that as I said you lose more than you use.  </li>
            <li> After opening the package and smelling the potent smell, I read the packaging which states:</li>
            <li> but my head/hair feels better than it has in over a year.</li>
            <li> Even better than shampoo that was prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased and relieved.  </li>
            <li> You have to use it a couple of times before you&#x27;ll notice that your scalp feels better and the dandruff is under control.</li>
            <li> Have tyred many shampoos for my scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Better nutrition seems to be the answer for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more in a month.</li>
            <li> If only, it was cheaper but amazon has some of the best prices.  </li>
            <li> My scalp feels so MUCH BETTER....</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I had many dermatologist visits and tried many steroids.</li>
            <li> I top it off with coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> believe me you will love it,</li>
            <li> when it was used alone...it worked ok...</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> This works pretty good for my stubborn dandruff but at a cost-</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my hair look pretty darned good - doesn&#x27;t look like</li>
            <li> Have had the problem for many years and this seems to help quite a bit and also has some conditioners in it and smells fine.</li>
            <li> New packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t enjoy the smell, but I love the outcome.</li>
            <li> I have tried other shampoo&#x27;s for psoriasis and this works the best.</li>
            <li> In combination with this shampoo, I saw very quick results.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strong medicinal smell to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be a bit too strong on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell</li>
            <li> strong chemical smell-</li>
            <li> but it also doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong as the T/Gel.  </li>
            <li> There is definitely a strong tar/gasoline smell but this smell is not a reason to avoid the product.</li>
            <li> So far so good:)</li>
            <li> The best psoriasis and dandruff shampoo out there, hands down.</li>
            <li> I think I would get better results if I were more consistent in using the product.</li>
            <li> - - so fine - - lets try it.&lt;br /&gt;Coal</li>
            <li> I would also use a fine tooth comb to help loosen and remove the flakes</li>
            <li> Does a fine job to relieve the scaling and helps to promote skin healing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li> The flaking and itching were disappearing so quickly it was as if I was imagining it!  </li>
            <li> Non drying which is a huge plus over the beta.</li>
            <li> Huge difference.</li>
            <li> I Recommended the Shampoo to my sister and she got the same great results.</li>
            <li> For me, the coal tar is the important part to any scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting great results and only use it twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy it is back and the formula has not changed</li>
            <li> I am not flake free, but has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Works great, the only shampoo that leaves no dandruff, wish they had a body wash for psoriasis too!</li>
            <li> I bougth this items just by surfing trhu teh amazon&#x27;s page web, and catch my attntion, I decided to get it and gave it to a relative who used this product, having great results.</li>
            <li> Do they really need to include a Carcinogen to make this stuff effective??  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist, and is no longer available at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> But I did get a good clear year</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and clearly states this item has a good chance of causing cancer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it does it&#x27;s job!!</li>
            <li> It is very effective against scalp conditions, especially for children.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a VO5 Hot Oil man, not because it was 99 cents, but because I imagined cool people like Burt Renyolds and David Hasselhoff using it on their nice full heads of hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I will keep using it and am pretty confident it is going to remove all the scabs on my head.</li>
            <li> Worth the smell for the relief!</li>
            <li> Originally I used a dermatologist prescribed shampoo.</li>
            <li> It helped but the original itching, burning and flaking is still with me.,</li>
            <li> this product is a strong coal tar product, way higher in concentration than comparable Neutrogena, but remember that if you have seborrheic dermatitis, you shouldn&#x27;t go gung-ho with all the strong products, as your dermatitis (which is not curable once and indefinitely) builds up tolerance to anything you use against</li>
            <li> The lather is rich and it rinses cleanly, but it does smell.</li>
            <li> While most young girls were told you shouldn&#x27;t wash your hair every day, most times</li>
            <li> We have no flaking, itching, or burning of our scalp between shampoos &amp; it leaves our hair clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> My scalp is so clean now.</li>
            <li> Boy was I right!</li>
            <li> The laser is like a super strong dose of sun concentrated on your lesions and you definitely have to avoid the sun while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you will have to see your dermatologist about the Excimer treatments, but until then, this product was better than most medications prescribed.  </li>
            <li> My scalp psoriasis did not improve after a full bottle was used over a month.</li>
            <li> I can see how this may work for true psoriasis sufferers.</li>
            <li> I think a 8 0z can last me a good 2 months.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product so I don&#x27;t have enough use to give a really good review.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this product, if you aren&#x27;t sure about it then you should just go for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used T-Gel regularly with good results, but I wanted to try something stronger.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job, but man I wish they could make it smell better.</li>
            <li> My psoriasis is probably in the heatof its outbreak so thats why its not working real big good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only one that controls my psoriasis and the price is good.</li>
            <li> And again, it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell, just a tar smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband has a kind of dander that usually has to be taken care of with a prescription shampoo, but with this and rotating with another couple kind of specialty otc shampoos, his hair and scalp is fine and we don&#x27;t have to buy the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> Also, it IS pretty strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day (and neither do they).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked like magic and the best part, it really left my hair looking fabulous not dried out like so many other products I tried.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 25 years &amp; can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended originally by my dermatologist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had mild psoriasis on my scalp for a year or so.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly with no hassles at all.</li>
            <li> By the end of the month, my condition had improved again to the &#x60;mild&#x27; stage.  </li>
            <li> well then again I am bold...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t see results the first couple of days of course, but around day 3 up until now I have not seen a flake and my face is smooth again.</li>
            <li> The odor was a little strong but it seems to help with  the flaking and itching, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> After first week using it 2x, my scalp was significantly cleared up.  </li>
            <li> This product is effective, the smell is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as it was initially, but it still works.  </li>
            <li> Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall This product works and the smell is definitely worth dealing with if you suffer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d alternate their Coal Tar shampoo with the exfoliant one (which I really liked for the anti-itch properties of the Menthol)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> ; T-Gel had stopped working for me at this point (not to mention, it made my usually soft and healthy hair feel like straw).</li>
            <li> If you have psoriasis or irritation of any kind on your scalp, this is the next step in treating it.</li>
            <li> ....was able to clear the psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing again, I’m not awkwardly scratching at my head everywhere</li>
            <li> Within the first week of using it the itchy feeling lessened tremendously.</li>
            <li> so I use a fair amount each time, but I rotate it with two other shampoos (salicylic acid and nizoral/ketokonazole), so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> My son used this twice a week and used head and shoulders on the off days and his scalp cleared right up.  </li>
            <li> Great price for coal tar shampoo with a high percentage of active ingredient.</li>
            <li> While this is true, the shampoo has a very distinctive &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; smell to it, I&#x27;ve never found this to be a problem.</li>
            <li> Happily it does leave your hair nice and soft, and the product doesn&#x27;t feel caustic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true- it does smell like straight up gasoline.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever been able to find that really works!!     </li>
            <li> Has more of the active ingredient, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I find I works best if you shampoo with a regular shampoo first, then the MG 217, and leave it to soak for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> for experimental reasons I went a month without using it and after two weeks the first patches started appearing, by 4 weeks they were completely back, so don&#x27;t be tricked into thinking that the flaking is gone for good.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam very much</li>
            <li> Thank you very much MG217.</li>
            <li> and it arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li> Hi, thank you very much</li>
            <li> After more than fifteen years of suffering I finally found something that does work.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos, even prescription ones that cost 120 dollars per bottle!  </li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a week and do a VO5 Hot Oil treatment in between.  </li>
            <li> (and I hope I&#x27;ve typed enough words to be able to submit this).</li>
            <li> I do a MG217 Shampoo on Sundays, and Thursdays, and a VO5 Hot Oil Treatment on Tuesdays.     </li>
            <li> but it did not clean my scalp at all.wasted 30$ on this shampoo.anyways if you&#x27;re suffering from seborrheic dermatitis/scaly scalp i dont think this shampoo will do the trick.go for something more strong.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do on the label.</li>
            <li> After using this (I am still on my first bottle)</li>
            <li> Smells funny, but goes away after your hair dries.  </li>
            <li> I would say they are similar, the tar % is higher on this product and the liquid is more viscous.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better even with having excimer laser treatments, this is what finally helps.</li>
            <li> The first shampoo I tried worked pretty well, so I thought this brand would as well.</li>
            <li> When I first put it in my had</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my husband!  </li>
            <li> and I am almost completely flake free.</li>
            <li> , this is the first he uses that really works!</li>
            <li> it first arrived, my mother would cover my head in coconut oil</li>
            <li> There was just smooth soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I am continuing to use this once a week just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come back.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but I&#x27;m still on the fence.</li>
            <li> I know I sound like one of those people from a commercial, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I have only been able to use it once</li>
            <li> My local stores that used to carry it don&#x27;t offer it any more.</li>
            <li> I used the ointment in conjunction with the shampoo (which I used every day for the first week)-and thank God, after using these products for 2 months</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t scrub those problem areas so well.  </li>
            <li> stopped the itch with first use</li>
            <li> Seemed to work the first week.</li>
            <li> this has helped me clear up a lot, it is VERY liquidy, not thick at all so other than that it is amazing &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> after reading good reviews i ordered this shampoo as i am from different country i had to pay total 30$ for this shampoo.when</li>
            <li> I was pretty astounded and it really added some perk to my day.</li>
            <li> I know that is hard to know what kind of rules run on every border, but if Amazon wants to sell products abroad I think this kind of transparency is something Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s Partners definitely need to improve in the selling process.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going into winter which means dry air and more outbreaks of this.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking, not too dry as some of these types of shampoos can be.</li>
            <li> I say settling because the strong fragrance of the Neutrogena was a big compromise on my part.</li>
            <li> It does not take me a large amount to fully get the desired results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product fairly certain it wouldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I had great results within a few uses, but beware because this stuff will leave your hair smelling pretty chemically for several hours.</li>
            <li> I can use this daily and am pretty much dandruff free.</li>
            <li> Mg 217 was discovered on one of my experimentation buys and worked as well as the prescription clobetasol, better that all of the other concoctions I had tried to that point, and the cost was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> With only one wash, my inflamed skin had subsided tremendously!</li>
            <li> While nothing I have tried over the last 50+ years clears it up completely, this product does a fine job of &amp;#34;controlling&amp;#34; it!</li>
            <li> Just use a little teaspoon at a time, hand scrub with warm water, let sit, then rinse off.  </li>
            <li> and therefore I&#x27;m responsible for any damage that this product may cause to people here.    </li>
            <li> However tar based ointments do work very well for my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> i used it for the first time the shampoo did not lather (like the normal shampoos do)</li>
            <li> This shampoo has given me very noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I used it for 7 days straight.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product over prescription Betamethazone!</li>
            <li> With my head held high!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li> and it is very liquidy and runny.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NOTHING that could ever take the place of Pentrax Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Dont see any real difference.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn dandruff</li>
            <li> Nothing really helped, and some things made</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It makes your hair reasonably moisturized...</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really delivers all that it promises.  </li>
            <li> Really helped with the psoriasis after a week.</li>
            <li> very runny.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered it and tried it for about a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helps control the psoriasis in the scalp.</li>
            <li> It also does not foam/lather up very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice it affecting my symptoms much.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Really like the shampoo, it gives my hair a lot of body,</li>
            <li> and it really works well.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> I like it so far and was really surprised how clean my hair feels</li>
            <li> I no longer felt the familiar cleansing effect, so I ordered this stuff which has 3 times the amount of coal tar that Neutrogena Extra Strength T-Gel has (3% vs 1%).    </li>
            <li> When I use it, that familiar &#x27;cleasing&#x27; feeling is back that I used to get with Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> Relieves symptoms better than other formulations that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Works better other products even prescription.  </li>
            <li> I found it&#x27;s better than any of the other shampoos out there for dandruff or, for me, Psoriasis which also causes flaking.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but it isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell, better than 1 other coal tar shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li> A healthy gut is linked to allergies and other skin problems.</li>
            <li> I used to need only a few drops of this shampoo to create a nice lather, but now I need over a tablespoon!</li>
            <li> Much more liquid consistency so a little hard to apply to hair but overall good stuff!</li>
            <li> I also used a mild topical prescription steroid with this shampoo, and now my scalp is ready for summer sun.</li>
            <li> It not only stops all my symptoms dead in their tracks for days, but the shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> After a week of use most of the red patches were smaller.  </li>
            <li> The more expensive products are also better at what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> main pro</li>
            <li> I had a severe case of psoriasis last year and tried many different prescriptions and shampoos and none seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Now, one month later after using it just 2x per week and using Head &amp; Shdrs Refresh daily dandruff shampoo, my scalp is finally healthy and normal.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have had to use tar shampoos since my high school days.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically a high powered T-Gel.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for highly rated products and bought this.  </li>
            <li> Came highly recommended....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gone from normal shedding to a decent amount of my hair ending up EVERYwhere.</li>
            <li> Far better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Second wash was done the day after the first and omg no scales, no flakes, no itchy scalp and of course no inflamed skin!</li>
            <li> A little more than year ago, I did a search for over the counter psoriasis shampoos and came across this one.  </li>
            <li> It got a little better with the first bottle, the second bottle is what really made the difference.</li>
            <li> I need to find a conditioner that will keep my hair from smelling like this, but I&#x27;ve been in so much pain from using different shampoos that had fragrance in them that I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft, unlike most other treatment shampoos, which leave it feeling like soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild psoriasis of the scalp for many, many years, but due to other health conditions, over the past year or so it has become unbearable.</li>
            <li> I use 2+ times a week and sulfate free shampoo/conditioner on other days.</li>
            <li> So far I am not seeing major results but it is the first week.  </li>
            <li> I keep going back to Clobex, which works like a charm but is only available by prescription.</li>
            <li> I’ve never been so happy with a product in my life because honestly before this, I was miserable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with scalp psoriasis my whole life, and practically no other over-the-counter shampoo comes close to MG217.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great for clearing up my psoriasis no more flaky scalp or avoiding wearing black shirts because my psoriasis was so noticable...highly recommend it</li>
            <li> By the second week all of the patches were gone, like they were never there in the first place.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out of it recently, I got more MG217 locally but ordered extra off Amazon.  </li>
            <li> After 3 uses my scalp psorasis has almost cleared up completely!</li>
            <li> Bought at a local pharmacy the first time and again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Tried this product after many year or trying other similar, but not tar based products.</li>
            <li> I worried that I had developed an immunity to it&#x27;s effects... until I read the label and saw that they stopped adding the coal tar!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I have used that seems to knock out the dandruff and itching immediately upon the first use.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work better, IT also actually lathers unloke some other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> products, in regular dosages, go toward higher strength/effectiveness like this&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> No more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;The heavy scent of freshly-paved road is a welcome bonus.</li>
            <li> routine is to apply it full strength to the problem areas and let it sit for 15 min while I do other things.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I noticed relief right after the first few shampoos.   </li>
            <li> There is almost no itching, the redness has been reduced to mild pink rash that is still fading, and the scaling and lesions are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> and I do feel significant result with less scalp itch</li>
            <li> Stinks but works great</li>
            <li> If you suffer from psoriasis, this may just be your ticket to clear it up.  </li>
            <li> around 2007 Pentrax was inexplicably withdrawn, the producer giving a manufacturing issue excuse--not a credible reason after so many years on the market.  </li>
            <li> But I do want to make clear, this product does not cure the psoriasis nor puts it into remission but it does provide some relief.</li>
            <li> My scalp was/is 95% clear now.</li>
            <li> I was mostly clear for quite some time.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight medicated smell, but I consider the scent to smell clean and outdoorsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo that really does what it says.</li>
            <li> It worked so well in fact that it completely cleared all of my psoriasis</li>
            <li> It completely resolved my scalp problems.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple weeks, and so far it has dramatically improved my scalp flaking.</li>
            <li> I no longer have intense itching all day, the flaking is almost all gone, and my scalp no longer looks like it was burned by a curling iron (yes it was that red!).</li>
            <li> It worked somewhat but lately I had been noticing much more plaque build up.  </li>
            <li> So far, after three applications, I find my itching worsens when using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a rite-aid near my office</li>
            <li> You just may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 22 year old son who has a problem with scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old</li>
            <li> Came across this product and find that it at least takes the itching away and many of the flakes.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of washing my scalp was completely cleared.</li>
            <li> I tried dozens of shampoos - some were prescribed, some were completely natural, some were OTC but designed for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> it made me so self conscious to go to work and do my activities.</li>
            <li> As someone who prefers the natural approach to everything, it made me uneasy to put something this chemical-laden on my head.</li>
            <li> After a month, the psoriasis was completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> I actually gagged and had to hold my nose the whole time.</li>
            <li> This has stopped the itching completely.</li>
            <li> did not make flakes completely go away..</li>
            <li> so  soft  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a bit of water and apply directly to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> , it leaves my hair more manageable than any shampoo I have used lately.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so much: head &amp; shoulders, selsun blue, T-Gel, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put up with the odor because it leaves my hair as soft as a baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I  squirt it directly onto my scalp onto my problem areas and use my hair to scrub scrub and exfoliate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I recently developed what seems like scalp psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I worried that the shampoo would be too harsh on my hair, but am really pleased that it left my hair manageable, without needing an additional conditioner, which is something I always need/use.  </li>
            <li> The last bottle I purchased with the new bottle design is a watered down version of the original.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MG 217 is green and watery in appearance, but it takes very little to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t write a better review, but this would be my first choice in treating psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> But if it is really necessary , buy this product w/o qualms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also feel free to comment and ask anything about s. dermatitis in the comments, I&#x27;ve had it for more than a decade and seen  several acclaimed dermatologists in that period, and come to be a bit of an expert on the topic, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help the psoriasis, it also leaves my hair soft!!  </li>
            <li> Looks like I found the right active ingredient (coal tar)</li>
            <li> It is not clear to me why a product with 3% coal tar would work better than one with 5%, but I do not really care so long as it works--and IT DOES.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty rough, but it WORKS.  </li>
            <li> Always seems to make my hair soft and shiny and the smell is no where near as intense as other psoriasis shampoos with coal tar as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> I noticed that Neutrogena changed the formula to a new scent and in the process they obviously reduced the strength of the product.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few Psoriasis shampoos and this is the only that I noticed a huge difference in reduction of flakes and buildup.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and conditioned, not dry</li>
            <li> They stung my scalp, were messy, time consuming and they really did not provide much in the way of relief.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo a few weeks ago and really didn&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
            <li> Although as runny as it is most of it will run out of your hand and down your arm, or down the sink, or all over the floor...  </li>
            <li> Even though MG217 is rated at only 3%, as opposed to the 5% of Pentrax and PsoriaTrax, it works MUCH better, fully relieving ALL symptoms, and without the usual burning sensation produced by PsoriaTrax!  </li>
            <li> Once I received this shampoo I used it right away along with the coal tar black soap for my face, I must say I am amazed.</li>
            <li> Tried several other products without success.</li>
            <li> Great results, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad like some tar based shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> A great product and it does not smell as bad as some think it does.</li>
            <li> At 32, I&#x27;ve had scapld psoriasis since age 12 - and have tried the entire gauntlet of products to clear my scalp.</li>
            <li> Then by the end of the second month after using this shampoo, the psoriasis had gone completely into remission.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked so far for both my son and I.  </li>
            <li> My husband has psoriasis and this is the only this we have found that completely clears up his scalp.</li>
            <li> and she said that she could barely even tell I had scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> apparently I am allergic to something in it.  </li>
            <li> and actually kind of like it (call me weird).  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product highly to others with dry, itching scaling scalps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been using the Denorex - which worked pretty well for me - -&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course you won&#x27;t get salon results but considering other coal tar shampoos, it really does leave my hair managable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you should start with the least strong products (zinc in my list), and switch to a stronger alternative or higher dosage only when necessary, especially the group indicated as (1) in the list is extremely tolerance-building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have smelled  way worse (see burning hair comment above :-)).</li>
            <li> So I gave my bottle to my mom, who also suffers with psoriasis, and a later she told me that it was really good.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t have enough coal tar to be effective for me.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this a month ago for moderate scalp psoriasis I&#x27;ve had for 6 yrs that no other product seemed to work for.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a positive difference in terms of less scaling after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Apply everyday when you first start, then after all the patches are gone/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different dandruff shampoos and they all make mine worse, coal tar is the only thing that seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> wash my hair every four days and after 4 or 5 washings I noticed a dramatic change in my psoriasis condition, it was now more &#x27;moderate&#x27; than &#x27;severe&#x27; which was verified by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> did I discover the true nature of my skin problems, almost wholly centered on the scalp and areas of facial hair--I have had a beard since my late teens.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it will work for you, every scalp is a little different, but invest in only one bottle at first.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who also suffers from scalp psoriasis, and this product works better than the shampoo her doctor prescribed!</li>
            <li> I will look for an alternate as the old MG 217 lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li> Psoriasis is very hard to be cured, and maybe other people will receive better effects after they use this product, but not for my mom.</li>
            <li> I had tried every shampoo on the market, changed my diet and tried some extreme measures ( one that included putting Vaseline directly on my scalp-</li>
            <li> After starting back on MG217, my scalp returned to a decent state again -- not perfect -- but 80-90% better using the MG217 everyday!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried so many other ones in he past, including prescription types, that did little or nothing.  </li>
            <li> When people complain about the smell of certain products, I usually tell them to just grow a pair and deal with it.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to lose this product (like when Pentrax was discontinued) as the price rises every time i purchase it, and now they effectively reduced its soap concentration to about half of what it once was.</li>
            <li> I saw at least a 50% improvement in the area of irritation after the first use.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil only provided minor relief.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, there was some minor itching, but instead of scratching, I took a soft bristled brush and brushed my entire scalp thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have suffered (and I mean SUFFERED) from intense itching, flaking, and burning scalp for over 10 years!</li>
            <li> In less than two weeks, my scalp was clear again, symptoms</li>
            <li> Well, when you use it, it looks and smells somewhat ugly, but later your hair is nice and shiny look and feel.  </li>
            <li> I was always having to brush away or blow dry my flakes off - I haven&#x27;t had to do that recently.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have psoriasis, but I have skin that is oily and dry on my face and especially my scalp.</li>
            <li> While my scalp hasn&#x27;t cleared completely, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t end up with visible flaking constantly and my scalp has cleared up quite a bit with just a few uses.</li>
            <li> For minor itching, try brushing your hair down to the scalp with a soft bristled brush, it might be the scabs from the healing lesions that are causing the itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For minor itching, try brushing your hair down to the scalp with a soft bristled brush, it might be the scabs from the healing lesions that are causing the itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has a flaky scalp and he noticed the difference after a few uses I was surprised!</li>
            <li> After moving from Hawaii to Georgia I think a mixture of stress and serious changes in water cause me to develop scalp psoriasis for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> The third month I used this shampoo once a week, and the fourth month every other week.  </li>
            <li> I have had small itchy spots on my scalp since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> I used dad&#x27;s T-Gel and other \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; shampoos and they simply made my dandruff super worse.  </li>
            <li> It was a huge hassle and expensive though</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks like most medicated shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Stinks, but it works better the OTC shampoos</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has this shampoo provided me with total relief from the constant itching and scratching, but it left my hair as soft and manageable as some of the expensive shampoos that I generally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condition of my scalp psoriasis was diagnosed as severe.  </li>
            <li> There is still a tiny bit of flaking, but not much.  </li>
            <li> and I began a long, fruitless search for a product that would help my itchy, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually very similar to wet paint.</li>
            <li> Wish I had got this a long time age.</li>
            <li> Open the capsule and empty the contents into a handful of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Open the capsule and empty the contents into a handful of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I no longer even scratch my scalp, which I now realize I did perpetually before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use Polytar, but it is off the shelf for a long time.</li>
            <li> Have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> This one actually does condition, unlike other products in its category.</li>
            <li> I avoided using the product for 4 days prior to treatment and for two days after due to an increase in blistering when used during this phase.  </li>
            <li> He have tried several other products before but none solved his problem</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out like the ones that have salynic acid in them.</li>
            <li> However, a little goes a long way, and you only use it a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products, even prescriptions from my dermatologist that didn&#x27;t work half as well as the MG217.</li>
            <li> : scalp is noticeably different, less itchy,</li>
            <li> Not that it makes your hair grow back, but hair fall that seems to be associated with sebum build-up and associated scalp condition is less when using MG217.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone suffering from mild to mediocre psoriasis.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll admit I use it everyday, and will continue till 100% clear, then I&#x27;ll probably go down to twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had thick hair, both long and short (currently short.)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they is much real product in the bottle for the money, since at least half of it is water.</li>
            <li> Have moderate scalp psoriasis (and little hair).</li>
            <li> , I could shake tiny little flakes out.  </li>
            <li> Word of advice, you have to actually let it sit for a few minutes to get it to condition.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that this product is not readily available.  </li>
            <li> It is doing the job I expected.</li>
            <li> Have just stating using this but seems to be working as expected</li>
            <li> I still do itch a bit, but not nearly as much as before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only a few uses</li>
            <li> I had been to a few dermatologists and all their potions, lotions, ointments, oils and sprays never had any lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on a few minutes, then rinse and shampoo with my regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It is a liquid, not a cream, so just be careful how you pour it into your hand.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in time expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on a rough spot on my finger and, boom, after about a month that part of me healed too.</li>
            <li> Like any coal tar shampoos, it is rough on your hair and frankly smells like coal tar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and I have had absolutely no flare ups.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my wet scalp and let it sit for a couple of minutes (no longer), and then rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a faint tar smell, but it&#x27;s worth it for relief.  </li>
            <li> It has no real form (thickness) to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used it in a few months and now I am getting the psoriasis back again.</li>
            <li> Had to see dermatologist as the product did not give me the relief I expected.</li>
            <li> The itching is gone and the flakes are minimal.</li>
            <li> I self-diagnosed an early onset of scalp psoriasis (thick flakes in 2 spots that returned when I removed them, bleeding skin).</li>
            <li> My rating won&#x27;t really matter as I&#x27;ve been unable to find any other possible substitute for Tegrin</li>
            <li> Significantly less concentrated and viscous than other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past, such that have to use 3x the amount for the same efficacy.</li>
            <li> The next time I did, no more pink or white patches of dried skin on my freshly-washed scalp.  </li>
            <li> Recently I was laying down on a pilates machine (Don&#x27;t judge me) when the instructor noticed that when I got up, I left behind some white flakes.</li>
            <li> For years I have suffered with the back of my scalp being covered in pimples and raw spots.</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, I could shake my hair like crazy and not one white speck came out.  </li>
            <li> a  little  goes a  long  way.  </li>
            <li> I tried T-Gel, which did not even come close to controlling symptoms; Tarsum, by Summers Laboratories, rated at 2% coal tar, and it helped, but very little; then came PsoriaTrax 5% Coal Tar Shampoo, billed as the successor to Pentrax, and thought that somebody had finally \\&quot;gotten it,\\&quot; but the symptoms remained, and even seemed to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was particularly irritating and embarrassing because I have thick black hair that shows white flakes very obviously, and my upper neck had such a thick/inflamed plaque</li>
            <li> Then it accrued to me to check on Amazon and to trust the experiences of other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I began reading up on other shampoos.</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> Any other dandruff/psoriasis shampoo does not work.</li>
            <li> I tried tea tree oil, medicated shampoo and sprays and other at home remedies before a hair stylist recommended finding a tar based shampoo.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was pretty skeptical when contemplating purchasing this and ended up doing so based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> so it may be that this product needs to be alternated with other treatments to maintain effectiveness over time; However, I would still recommend it without qualm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have psorisis, but I do have seborrheic dermatitis (extreme dandruff).</li>
            <li> : it definitely eases symptoms (flaking and itching) after a few washes!</li>
            <li> I had tried other products, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I have used this and other coal tar shampoos for 20+ years.    </li>
            <li> They discontinued it and a lot of other things which brought me here to purchase it.    </li>
            <li> If you try it, I would recommend using it for about a month every other day before you decide if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> He uses it every other shampooing and that seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> use this shampoo 1-2 times per week, work it in and leave it one while I go about my other shower duties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this every other day.</li>
            <li> even every other day doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After 1 use the itch throughout my day was very minimal, and there were almost no flakes.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for something new because my Psoriasis was getting worse</li>
            <li> I recently started a new round of biologics but since they take some time to work, was growing frustrated at trying to clear up my scalp.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells a little, but after my regular shampoo, there&#x27;s no more smell.  </li>
            <li> Initially I used Tegrin, but by my late twenties it no longer fully relieved the problems of itching, redness, and scaling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> so I still have to shampoo with one of these products on a daily basis in order to keep my dandruff under control, but at least I have a solution.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can use it long term for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only negative is the smell but</li>
            <li> But will make the flacking from the psoriasis go down.  </li>
            <li> Let me break it down into pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stuff is watered down, though that I wonder how it can work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, I am in remission from psoriasis due to the Excimer Laser treatments -yay!  </li>
            <li> I have used other coal tar shampoos in the past and found them to be so slow acting that I ended up just passing on them because they were too harsh on my hair for the minimal results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;30 some odd years</li>
            <li> there.flakes were less</li>
            <li> Tar equivalent on this is LESS than for Denorex - -</li>
            <li> I see significantly less flakes these days.</li>
            <li> less problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you not squeeze the bottle or you will end up with about half of it in you hand.</li>
            <li> I typically use T-Sal and Scalpactin when I have a flare-up, but this last one lasted much longer than usual, and the symptoms were exceptionally bad.</li>
            <li> But I am okay with it as long as I&#x27;m not wearing nasty flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 4 uses in, and I already see a reduction in my flakes and my head itches so much less than it did a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I would catch myself waking up all night long, unable to sleep because of the constant itching and burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling psoriasis for 8 years now, trying every prescription, home remedies and just about every OTC product with little to sometimes no results, until I decided to look again.  </li>
            <li> You can use a little of your scented conditioner after using the shampoo to lessen the tar scent.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Use a little raspberry ketone with your shampoo.  </li>
            <li> You can use a little of your scented conditioner after using the shampoo to lessen the tar scent.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Use a little raspberry ketone with your shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this about 2 weeks, usually every other day.  </li>
            <li> Then I started seeing a dermatologist and using a prescription shampoo that helped a little, but never cleared it up.  </li>
            <li> Nothing cures it, but it keeps it in check, sometimes with as little as 1x/wk application.</li>
            <li> Some say the tar treatments are carcinogenic but anyone who suffers from psoriasis over a large portion of their body realizes there is life</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Coal Tar shampoos and ended up settling for the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> It progressivly got worse to the point where I was actually leaving bits of my scalp on her machine.</li>
            <li> She ran out for a few days and she started getting the sores and flakes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, the symptom has even turned worse, especially when she used the Tar Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had used the MG217 ointment for spots on my arms a few years ago at the recommendation of my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Use as directed: twice a week I lather up, then leave on while I shave shave (says to keep on for a few minutes, not just lather and rinse)</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off now for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but dried scalp.  </li>
            <li> Specifically you must leave it in for a few minutes after you apply it.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my flakiness and itching within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must be something in the formulation as I have tried stronger concentrations of coal tar in the past with no success.  </li>
            <li> This product is a waste of my money, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a waste of time</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with psoriasis for over 20 years and have tried everything, including perscriptions.  </li>
            <li> It is so runny that I have trouble getting it from my hand and onto my hair without it runny off my hand before I can use it to  lather-up and wash my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I use it a few time and during and after my wash my scalp was itchy.</li>
            <li> Using MG217 every day for a few weeks cleared it up.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the Psoriatrax shampoo since I was having trouble finding the Denorex with coal tar.  </li>
            <li> Many other &amp;#34;psoriasis&amp;#34; shampoos I&#x27;ve tried make my hair feel terribly dry.&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable</li>
            <li> other product reviews seems to say negative things about the smell.</li>
            <li> my psoriasis even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this shampoo as a last-ditch effort to finally tame my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d also get a small, thick, pink patch or two.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works like a charm, stinks to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos I had tried previously were disappointing, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith that this one would be any different.</li>
            <li> me just say however that this stuff does stink, pretty bad.</li>
            <li> However lately it seems to be severely watered down.  </li>
            <li> My stylist used to have me sit with it at least 3 times, but now we are down to once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had real bad flaking psoriasis in my scalp since I was in 3rd grade elementary and nothing had worked for me.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo worked as advertised but it was a little hard for my wife to deal with the odor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, in desperation, I tried MG217, which I had seen on the shelves of several pharmacies--primarily CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens (inexplicably, Duane Reade, and other regional chains do not carry it--bad purchasing practice).  </li>
            <li> It was so bad it would come off in large noticeable clumps looking like he had frosting in his hair or something.</li>
            <li> this Pilates instructor very nicelky told me that I needed Coal Tar Shampoo and that even though it smells bad it would help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use it in the shower, shampoo my hair, put on a plastic cap, wash the rest of my body and then rinse this out.</li>
            <li> I went back to the expensive bottle from the supermarket.</li>
            <li> So not sure if that could also be an issue.</li>
            <li> It might have been okay if my hair didn&#x27;t smell like the awful stuff afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can endure the scent day in and day out.</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Very green almost slimy looking.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy at first because some of the reviews said it smelled bad - it really doesn&#x27;t smell that bad!</li>
            <li> It is hard to get at drug stores.</li>
            <li> A quality product, but it&#x27;s hard to find anything that works well for this problem.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter what I did, how hard I scrubbed or didn&#x27;t or lathered, rinsed, repeated</li>
            <li> My daughter has Psoriasis bad on her scalp and this helps considerably.  </li>
            <li> , I could need hair dye and at least I never had to buy tampons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of cutting back on the foam, and hope to transition to just the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 2 or 3 prescription shampoos, denorex, t-gel, Psoriasis shampoo, scalpicin, prescription ointments, and nothing has worked, at least for</li>
            <li> I plan on cutting back to just 1x per week for routine maintenance.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something, at least.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any side effects after using this shampoo for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It is slowly working.  </li>
            <li> But if all that&#x27;s wrong is that smell isn&#x27;t like my other shampoos, then it&#x27;s hardly something that I&#x27;d stop using it</li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad, but works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Works for my scalp Psoriasis where other products have failed.</li>
            <li> Out of all the shampoos and ointments I have bought even very expensive ones, this is the only one that has helped me with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say this one cause my problem was serious.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work miracles for my head, but it does keep serious psoriasis outbreaks from occurring.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it smells horrible compared to standard products</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but then, all of the shampoos for psoriasis seem to be.</li>
            <li> The scent is the only bad thing.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells really bad but used 2 or 3 times a week, double application, helped a lot with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I  had some really bad scaling on the back of my head, which I couldn&#x27;t see, but felt with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> With a solution equivalent to 3% coal tar, compared to &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34; OTC shampoos like Head and Shoulders at 0.5% to 1.0%, this is not surprising.</li>
            <li> Another dermatologist recommended the cortisone shots, these were very painful and messy, however, the itching, burning, and constant scratching would resume.  </li>
            <li> gone!&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for any future flare-ups, and recommend this for anyone who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis!</li>
            <li> My usual brand is way too expensive in this country (Steifel polytar liquid), so i wanted to try something else</li>
            <li> I am 23 and to deal with psoriasis is very hard.</li>
            <li> It could be worse though</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, she felt the itching and inflammation even got worse.     </li>
            <li> Just a bit thin and runny.</li>
            <li> this product contains chemicals that dries out the scalp and makes my scalp itch, witch makes my PS worse</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in the seventh month the psoriasis started to return, so this shampoo needs to be used at least once a month for me to remain in remission, but it is still a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I had a flair up just behind my ear that would not go away.  </li>
            <li> It really does smell awful, though.</li>
            <li> I really hate the smell of this shampoo but it gets the job done,I only have to use it once every week or two</li>
            <li> My psoriasis is actually worse on my scalp then anywhere else on my body.</li>
            <li> It got worse.</li>
            <li> It became so much worse this year</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my belly button so washing it every day is impossible.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with my Seborrheic dermatitis but gawd does it smell disgusting, Smell does not rinse out so am using a regular conditioner to try to minimize the odor, not sure if that is hurting its ability to get rid of the &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of psoriasis on my lower legs, knees and elbows that appeared a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a few washes to see a difference because mine was so bad, but you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> They cleared up my scalp, but as soon as I stopped using them, within a few days my scalp was as bad as ever.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every dandruff shampoo, lotions, expensive psoriasis &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;, I have gotten prescription shampoo and lotions (with and without steroids).</li>
            <li> I waited a couple months and my scalp suffered poorly!  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> it was scary looking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately - it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to mousse, hair spray and the like but just HAVE to use it sometimes; my scalp instantly gets awful, but this stuff can truly manage it.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this for my blind friend with psoriasis on her scalp.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it went into the trash.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it´s linked to some forms of cancer.</li>
            <li> It is a really thin shampoo as others stated-but desperate times call for desperate measures and it works.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist recommended I buy Ala Seb and it worked well, but buying it from him was expensive and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> And the smell is as I expected- nasty.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who suffers like I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using DHS cold tar and Denorex.</li>
            <li> I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> Dermatologists scripts are no help, just very expensive.</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a terrible product, as with the nature of Psoriasis, what works for some may not work for others.</li>
            <li> it became impossible to find the stuff online anymore.  </li>
            <li> Before I received this item my scalp psoriasis was so bad it burned and every where I sat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have psoriasis just bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> The bleeding and itching was unbearable, and the dandruff was so bad that I was embarrassed to go anywhere.</li>
            <li> : smells bad,</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, if I don&#x27;t then I return to my bad scalp.</li>
            <li> What I do have is fairly bad recurrent dandruff, flaking, and scalp itching.  </li>
            <li> So my son had a bad issue with severe flaking of the scalp.</li>
            <li> I am not as concerned with the bad odor as I am with how runny this shampoo is.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
            <li> I had scalp plaque psoriasis so badly that I was ripping my hair out.</li>
            <li> but it is taking a while this time because I have psoriasis so bad on my head</li>
            <li> When a doctor or pharmacist recommends coal tar shampoo for scalp conditions, you may want to say &amp;#34;Oh no.&amp;#34; because it would seem to be ugly.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed to see known carcinogens in a package that is supposed to improve the health of one&#x27;s scalp...</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too bad and it cures that God awful itch!</li>
            <li> Too bad it can&#x27;t make the grays go away!  </li>
            <li> But, I can attest to the necessity of using coal tar for psoriasis since I had very bad problems with it as a child and this is what the dermatologist made me use (as well as a thicker coal tar preparation for my hands).  </li>
            <li> I had a horrible head of scales and this product cleared 75% of them.</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>
            <li> The smell of coal tar shampoo is terrible but my scalp began to heal from the moment I used it.</li>
            <li> The itching was awful.</li>
            <li> I get terrible dandruff and this stuff solved the problem of my itchy scalp and flaking.</li>
            <li> The fragrance could be improved upon, nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great results, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad like some tar based shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Coal Tar shampoos and ended up settling for the Neutrogena. I say settling because the strong fragrance of the Neutrogena was a big compromise on my part. Then it accrued to me to check on Amazon and to trust the experiences of other reviewers. Boy was I right! Once again the collective wisdom of the Amazon community led me to the discovery of THE BEST SHAMPOO I&#x27;VE TRIED IN YEARS!!! Thank you guys.</li>
            <li> Yes it stops the itching, yes it helps control the breaks in scalp and seeping sores. The scent is the only bad thing. Just wish that they could eliminate the medicated odor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for my scalp psoriasis for years.  It&#x27;s not as effective as it was initially, but it still works.  However lately it seems to be severely watered down.  I used to need only a few drops of this shampoo to create a nice lather, but now I need over a tablespoon!</li>
            <li> Used this product for years. Solved all my head problems except for thinking.</li>
            <li> PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo that really does what it says. Noticed improvement in days and has totally worked to stop flaking. It also smells better than most coal tar based formulas. Smell does not linger after you rinse.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local Rite Aid store (it was hiding in the shampoo department). I have tried many coal tar shampoos with dismal results. This one actually does condition, unlike other products in its category. Word of advice, you have to actually let it sit for a few minutes to get it to condition. I usually use it in the shower, shampoo my hair, put on a plastic cap, wash the rest of my body and then rinse this out. Of course you won&#x27;t get salon results but considering other coal tar shampoos, it really does leave my hair managable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had real bad flaking psoriasis in my scalp since I was in 3rd grade elementary and nothing had worked for me.  I&#x27;ve tried prescription shampoos, ointments, creams, but NOTHING got rid of it.  My case had gotten so severe that I was starting to go bald in the places where the patches were biggest.  At the verge of giving up trying to find a product that worked, I read a post in a forum recommending this shampoo so i gave it try and OMG this shampoo rocks!!!  For starters I went and got my hair shaved and the patches looked like they came out of a horror film.  After a week of use most of the red patches were smaller.  By the second week all of the patches were gone, like they were never there in the first place.  After more than fifteen years of suffering I finally found something that does work.  But beware. . . for experimental reasons I went a month without using it and after two weeks the first patches started appearing, by 4 weeks they were completely back, so don&#x27;t be tricked into thinking that the flaking is gone for good.  You have to keep using this shampoo if you want to keep the flaking away.........Apply everyday when you first start, then after all the patches are gone/ wiped out/terminated, you can go ahead and use it three times a week to make the bottle last longer.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from psoriasis, this may just be your ticket to clear it up.  I have moderate/severe psoriasis if I don&#x27;t treat it.  I used to use Extra Strength Neutrogena T-Gel for my scalp, and it worked well for a couple of years.  It worked so well in fact that it completely cleared all of my psoriasis and I was able to stop taking the expensive prescription meds like Olux.  However, about 6 months ago I started having some scalp problems again.  I noticed that Neutrogena changed the formula to a new scent and in the process they obviously reduced the strength of the product.  I no longer felt the familiar cleansing effect, so I ordered this stuff which has 3 times the amount of coal tar that Neutrogena Extra Strength T-Gel has (3% vs 1%).    Wow!!!  After two washes, my psoriasis went back into remission &amp; problem solved.  When I use it, that familiar &#x27;cleasing&#x27; feeling is back that I used to get with Neutrogena.  My only concern is that this product is not readily available.  So, my advice: stock up while you can!  Good stuff like this has a tendency to disappear.</li>
            <li> I knew that italian border tax police (Dogana - Guardia di Finanza) sometimes stops stuff from Amazon US to charge for italian VAT (we call it IVA).  What I didn&#x27;t know is that for personal care products I needed to sign a document for the Italian Health Ministry!    So, actually the shampoo is \\&quot;hostage\\&quot; in Milan Airport (I&#x27;m in Rome) waiting for my signature on this document, where I will declare that I know that this chemical product has not been authorized/analyzed in Italy and therefore I&#x27;m responsible for any damage that this product may cause to people here.    I think that it would be nice to know in the shipping information this kind of things.    I know that is hard to know what kind of rules run on every border, but if Amazon wants to sell products abroad I think this kind of transparency is something Amazon and Amazon&#x27;s Partners definitely need to improve in the selling process.</li>
            <li> I have used MD 217 for over three years. It completely resolved my scalp problems. If I discontinue even for a week I start to have problems. If I discontinue for two weeks it is a big problem. This is the best product I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos, even prescription ones that cost 120 dollars per bottle!  None of them took care of the intense itching, heavy flaking, redness, and scaling.  I found this one at CVS pharmacy.  I thought I&#x27;d try it knowing that it just wouldn&#x27;t work.  The first time I tried it, I loved it.  The itching is gone!  The scaling and redness are gone.  There is still a tiny bit of flaking, but not much.  I use it 2 times a week and do a VO5 Hot Oil treatment in between.  My hair is shinny and my scalp doesn&#x27;t keep me awake all night.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo started working for me after one use! I use it twice a week and it has dramatically turned it around</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple weeks, and so far it has dramatically improved my scalp flaking.</li>
            <li> I have had to use tar shampoos since my high school days.  Initially I used Tegrin, but by my late twenties it no longer fully relieved the problems of itching, redness, and scaling.  Not until I turned thirty and saw a dermatologist did I discover the true nature of my skin problems, almost wholly centered on the scalp and areas of facial hair--I have had a beard since my late teens.  The doctor prescribed Tetracycline, with a one-month regimen, and Pentrax Coal Tar Shampoo.  That did the trick, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then around 2007 Pentrax was inexplicably withdrawn, the producer giving a manufacturing issue excuse--not a credible reason after so many years on the market.  I tried T-Gel, which did not even come close to controlling symptoms; Tarsum, by Summers Laboratories, rated at 2% coal tar, and it helped, but very little; then came PsoriaTrax 5% Coal Tar Shampoo, billed as the successor to Pentrax, and thought that somebody had finally \\&quot;gotten it,\\&quot; but the symptoms remained, and even seemed to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in desperation, I tried MG217, which I had seen on the shelves of several pharmacies--primarily CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens (inexplicably, Duane Reade, and other regional chains do not carry it--bad purchasing practice).  Even though MG217 is rated at only 3%, as opposed to the 5% of Pentrax and PsoriaTrax, it works MUCH better, fully relieving ALL symptoms, and without the usual burning sensation produced by PsoriaTrax!  It is not clear to me why a product with 3% coal tar would work better than one with 5%, but I do not really care so long as it works--and IT DOES.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used  any of it yet as I&#x27;m still on my last container of Tegrin shampoo.  My rating won&#x27;t really matter as I&#x27;ve been unable to find any other possible substitute for Tegrin (and I hope I&#x27;ve typed enough words to be able to submit this).</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever been able to find that really works!!     I do a MG217 Shampoo on Sundays, and Thursdays, and a VO5 Hot Oil Treatment on Tuesdays.     It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I started using this Shampoo, and there is no sign of flaking, itching, nothing!  I noticed relief right after the first few shampoos.   This stuff really does work great.   5 stars!</li>
            <li> Recently I was laying down on a pilates machine (Don&#x27;t judge me) when the instructor noticed that when I got up, I left behind some white flakes. It progressivly got worse to the point where I was actually leaving bits of my scalp on her machine. (with they were made of gold)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this Pilates instructor very nicelky told me that I needed Coal Tar Shampoo and that even though it smells bad it would help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 some odd years I&#x27;ve been a VO5 Hot Oil man, not because it was 99 cents, but because I imagined cool people like Burt Renyolds and David Hasselhoff using it on their nice full heads of hair. Imagine my suprise when I go to the market and realise that this thing costs 8 bucks for 5 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was definitly an Amazon moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it was not meant to be... this shampoo is too runny and doesn&#x27;t to the job. I went back to the expensive bottle from the supermarket. It could be worse though, I could need hair dye and at least I never had to buy tampons.</li>
            <li> I was using a prescription foam for my scalp, that worked at the onset, but then stopped being effective. In combination with this shampoo, I saw very quick results.  I&#x27;m in the process of cutting back on the foam, and hope to transition to just the shampoo.  Looks possible at this point.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet but hope it works well for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Works well as a shampoo for psoriasis, not did not work like a treatment. It did not reduced symptoms. My scalp psoriasis did not improve after a full bottle was used over a month. Still I did think it was better then nothing. However tar based ointments do work very well for my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> after reading good reviews i ordered this shampoo as i am from different country i had to pay total 30$ for this shampoo.when i used it for the first time the shampoo did not lather (like the normal shampoos do) i had to wash twice even after washing twice the creamy sticky stuff (seb derm) on my scalp was still there.flakes were less but it did not clean my scalp at all.wasted 30$ on this shampoo.anyways if you&#x27;re suffering from seborrheic dermatitis/scaly scalp i dont think this shampoo will do the trick.go for something more strong.</li>
            <li> i had used Pentrax shampoo for years and it worked great. When i could no longer buy it I began reading up on other shampoos. I ordered MH217 and it burned my scalp plus my hair fell out in an inflamed spot. the doctor did a biopsy which showed alopecia areata but I had never had any indication of this before. Therefore I have to conclude it was the shampoo so be careful!</li>
            <li> This product is effective, the smell is a little overwhelming. However, it worked well to treat my scalp psoriasis. I have a friend who also suffers from scalp psoriasis, and this product works better than the shampoo her doctor prescribed! I also used a mild topical prescription steroid with this shampoo, and now my scalp is ready for summer sun. Just keep it out of your eyes, it is 3% tar.</li>
            <li> Great item and have used for over 10 years. Does exactly what it says it will do on the label. My scalp feels great even in heat of 100 degrees.</li>
            <li> My daughter has Psoriasis bad on her scalp and this helps considerably.  She ran out for a few days and she started getting the sores and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it does it&#x27;s job!!</li>
            <li> I Have to say that this is the best psoriasis treatment that I have ever tried. I have suffered (and I mean SUFFERED) from intense itching, flaking, and burning scalp for over 10 years! I have tried every dandruff shampoo, lotions, expensive psoriasis &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;, I have gotten prescription shampoo and lotions (with and without steroids). NOTHING worked - I even had one lotion that smelled like burning hair!! After using this (I am still on my first bottle) I no longer have intense itching all day, the flaking is almost all gone, and my scalp no longer looks like it was burned by a curling iron (yes it was that red!). I was hesitant to buy at first because some of the reviews said it smelled bad - it really doesn&#x27;t smell that bad! I have smelled  way worse (see burning hair comment above :-)). My hair is soft and conditioned, not dry and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother after I compared all the Psoriasis products on Amazon. I found Mg 217 Intensive Strength Medicated Tar Ointment for Psoriasis 3.8 Oz having the highest review start number by many people. So I bought it along with this shampoo , and another product by Mg 217.  My mother has used them for one moth, but there has been not even a tiny effect. In fact, the symptom has even turned worse, especially when she used the Tar Shampoo. After using this shampoo, she felt the itching and inflammation even got worse.     Psoriasis is very hard to be cured, and maybe other people will receive better effects after they use this product, but not for my mom. If I could, I would give 0 star for this product.</li>
            <li> My scalp psoriasis is almost gone after about 3 weeks of daily use!  Smell is not the best, but it&#x27;s worth it after trying just about everything else on the market as well as prescription shampoo.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It may not have the most pleasant smell of any soaps, but I swear this shampoo works wonders. For years I have suffered with the back of my scalp being covered in pimples and raw spots. This shampoo has taken all the pain away. A must have for anyone who suffers like I did.</li>
            <li> At 32, I&#x27;ve had scapld psoriasis since age 12 - and have tried the entire gauntlet of products to clear my scalp. The biggest struggle with scalp products is application - which is why I decided to try this shampoo. I had used the MG217 ointment for spots on my arms a few years ago at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I recently started a new round of biologics but since they take some time to work, was growing frustrated at trying to clear up my scalp. I ordered this on a whim and have been very impressed. I have used other coal tar shampoos in the past and found them to be so slow acting that I ended up just passing on them because they were too harsh on my hair for the minimal results. This shampoo has given me very noticeable results. While my scalp hasn&#x27;t cleared completely, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t end up with visible flaking constantly and my scalp has cleared up quite a bit with just a few uses. I think I would get better results if I were more consistent in using the product.</li>
            <li> Use as directed: twice a week I lather up, then leave on while I shave shave (says to keep on for a few minutes, not just lather and rinse) then I rinse, and it keeps scaling/flaking in check.</li>
            <li> A great product and it does not smell as bad as some think it does.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. My stylist used to have me sit with it at least 3 times, but now we are down to once. It&#x27;s helping my condition a lot</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo gave me a head ach</li>
            <li> This product does work. I had a horrible head of scales and this product cleared 75% of them.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo that works on my scalp. T-gel. Nope. Head and shoulders. Nope. Any other dandruff/psoriasis shampoo does not work. This does.</li>
            <li> The shampoo if effective and I am a repeat user. It does not take me a large amount to fully get the desired results.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampo and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> It does not work on psoriasis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling psoriasis for 8 years now, trying every prescription, home remedies and just about every OTC product with little to sometimes no results, until I decided to look again.  I stumbled on this product with rave reviews, so I decided to give it a shot.  With only one wash, my inflamed skin had subsided tremendously! Second wash was done the day after the first and omg no scales, no flakes, no itchy scalp and of course no inflamed skin! Absolutely love it.  I can finally get a haircut without feeling embarrassed after 8 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off now for a few years.  It works exceedingly well on my scalp with severe dandruff.  When I ran out of it recently, I got more MG217 locally but ordered extra off Amazon.  I waited a couple months and my scalp suffered poorly!  I used dad&#x27;s T-Gel and other \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; shampoos and they simply made my dandruff super worse.  Even regular Costco shampoo and baby stuff did not work well.  After starting back on MG217, my scalp returned to a decent state again -- not perfect -- but 80-90% better using the MG217 everyday!  Just use a little teaspoon at a time, hand scrub with warm water, let sit, then rinse off.  Smells funny, but goes away after your hair dries.  I have not experienced any side effects after using this shampoo for a few years.  Too bad it can&#x27;t make the grays go away!  Perfectly safe for adults.  Try it out for dandruff and don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> actually works! Finally!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff but dried scalp.  It flakes a lot during the winter.  This product seems to work.  I also use Neutrogena T-gel.  I would say they are similar, the tar % is higher on this product and the liquid is more viscous.  Neutrogena T-gel lathers better.&lt;br /&gt;If you were to ask which product is produced a better result, I&#x27;d say this one cause my problem was serious.  There&#x27;s a strong medicinal smell to it but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as this product for both hair AND scalp.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have three patches of psoriasis on my scalp and this shampoo helps to exfoliate and relieve the itching.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better even with having excimer laser treatments, this is what finally helps.</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Definitely not worth it. I couldn&#x27;t wash the smell out of my hair for days.</li>
            <li> Works better than the store bought one.  Just remember it has tar in it so you will smell like asphalt.  But will make the flacking from the psoriasis go down.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out like the ones that have salynic acid in them.</li>
            <li> The best psoriasis and dandruff shampoo out there, hands down. You will never use another dandruff product again! I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  Good for psoriasis scalp problems.  New packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have had mild psoriasis on my scalp for a year or so.  I eventually saw a dermatologist who prescribed a sticky gel.  It worked somewhat but lately I had been noticing much more plaque build up.  I have had to cancel hair appointments because of this problem.  So after reading enough reviews and treatment options, I tried this shampoo.  I used it for 7 days straight.  I does cause some tingling if you have removed plaques recently, however, after 7 days my psoriasis cleared up.  No itching or flaking for 3 weeks now.  My dermatologist said that was great but that I should use any treatment sparingly because the effectiveness does not last forever.  I am extremely happy I found this shampoo.  It works!!!  Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I used coal tar shampoos as a teenager in the 1950&#x27;s, and when itchy scalp returned 60 years later, I turned to them again. The first shampoo I tried worked pretty well, so I thought this brand would as well. Wrong. So far, after three applications, I find my itching worsens when using this product. Maybe it will work for you, every scalp is a little different, but invest in only one bottle at first.</li>
            <li> After 3 uses my scalp psorasis has almost cleared up completely! I went from about 75-80% scaled coverage on the scalp to about 10% in only 3 uses. I highly recommend this product over prescription Betamethazone! Non drying which is a huge plus over the beta. I&#x27;m looking forward to my next salon visit. With my head held high!</li>
            <li> It is doing the job I expected.</li>
            <li> I am 23 and to deal with psoriasis is very hard. Flakes and scalp itch has been the hardest thing for me to manage. I have tried 2 or 3 prescription shampoos, denorex, t-gel, Psoriasis shampoo, scalpicin, prescription ointments, and nothing has worked, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a rite-aid near my office and I saw this stuff and I decided to give it a try. When I first put it in my had it was scary looking. It reminded me a like a vegetable drink of only greens. Very green almost slimy looking. But I went ahead and used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 use the itch throughout my day was very minimal, and there were almost no flakes. I was pretty astounded and it really added some perk to my day. At this point I have been using it a couple weeks and while the redness is still there I have almost 0 flakes and no itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say however that this stuff does stink, pretty bad. You will want to use a conditioner or similar after it to remove the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall This product works and the smell is definitely worth dealing with if you suffer.</li>
            <li> Works better than what i&#x27;ve bought in stores. Helps eliminate existing scales, but haven&#x27;t deen any reduction in scales coming back.</li>
            <li> 100 recommended blindly% very good product I will remove dandruff yojana my daughter and my wife josefa roa</li>
            <li> Works great.  Did a lot of research on this product.  Bought at a local pharmacy the first time and again on Amazon.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my husband!  We will be ordering it again!  It came quickly with no hassles at all.</li>
            <li> Have just stating using this but seems to be working as expected</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with psoriasis and promptly put on a regimen of clobetasol shampoo.  The cost was rather steep so I began searching for an alternative.  Mg 217 was discovered on one of my experimentation buys and worked as well as the prescription clobetasol, better that all of the other concoctions I had tried to that point, and the cost was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> this is a product you need to keep using to see the results. it minimized the itching and the scaling, but the day I dont use it, guaranteed the itching and scaling returns ! keep using it !</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF. DOES WHAT IS SAYS IT WILL DO.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my Psoriasis, but I use it after rinsing off my DHS Zinc shampoo (which did wonders for my condition) and it does a great job at cleaning and moisturizing my hair. It leaves your hair soft, unlike most other treatment shampoos, which leave it feeling like soft. The smell isn&#x27;t too bothersome, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable unless you condition afterwards. Overall, I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like mothballs.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like a charm, stinks to high heaven. I&#x27;m a repeat customer of this product. I had great results within a few uses, but beware because this stuff will leave your hair smelling pretty chemically for several hours. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> After moving from Hawaii to Georgia I think a mixture of stress and serious changes in water cause me to develop scalp psoriasis for the first time ever. I tried tea tree oil, medicated shampoo and sprays and other at home remedies before a hair stylist recommended finding a tar based shampoo. Within the first week of using it the itchy feeling lessened tremendously. About a month in now and I am almost completely flake free. It recommends using it twice a week but I&#x27;ll admit I use it everyday, and will continue till 100% clear, then I&#x27;ll probably go down to twice a week. This shampoo does smell like coal!!!! But I am okay with it as long as I&#x27;m not wearing nasty flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I added 5 drops of tea tree oil to mine to help with smell and irritation.</li>
            <li> As good product for this problem as there is.</li>
            <li> I chose this item to try and see if it was good.  Only used it once.  It is OK . I will try it again.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do the job.  The more expensive products are also better at what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> For the price, Mg 217 is the best buy available. Its effectiveness matches that of shampoo almost double the price.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was pretty skeptical when contemplating purchasing this and ended up doing so based on the reviews. Well am I glad I did! I&#x27;ve tried numerous products, even prescriptions from my dermatologist that didn&#x27;t work half as well as the MG217. I&#x27;ve had scalp psoriasis for over 5 years and have been embarrassed over the flakes it causes on my shoulders and back. I&#x27;m happy to say that after just 3 weeks (using product 2-3x a week) the flakes are gone and the scalp build-up is 75% improved! If you&#x27;re thinking of trying this, I say go ahead and do it. You just may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 22 year old son who has a problem with scalp psoriasis.  He had 3 big patches of red and inflamed skin on his scalp when I got this.  After using it once or twice, the redness disappeared and the patches were smoothing out.  This stuff works.  My son used this twice a week and used head and shoulders on the off days and his scalp cleared right up.  Take a chance on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Before I received this item my scalp psoriasis was so bad it burned and every where I sat I left flakes every where. It went from my scalp to my hair line to my face. Even my face burned. I couldn&#x27;t use anything to get relief. Once I received this shampoo I used it right away along with the coal tar black soap for my face, I must say I am amazed. It didn&#x27;t see results the first couple of days of course, but around day 3 up until now I have not seen a flake and my face is smooth again. No scales here. I will definatley be using this more often.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for something new because my Psoriasis was getting worse so I thought my current shampoo wasn&#x27;t doing the trick anymore.  Turns out not to be the case, but anyhow I&#x27;m still happier with the Extra Strength Neutrogena that I&#x27;ve been using. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old and I&#x27;ve had psorasis on my scalp since the age of six. I have tried everything. Aside from prescription-strength treatment...this is the best on the market to control my psorasis.</li>
            <li> This is about the only product I have ever tried that helped with my Psoriasis.  Have had the problem for many years and this seems to help quite a bit and also has some conditioners in it and smells fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and it works well. I&#x27;d had scalp psoriasis for almost two year before I found this shampoo and nothing the dermatologist had given me worked as well MG 217. I&#x27;m having more recurrences now than before so it may be that this product needs to be alternated with other treatments to maintain effectiveness over time; However, I would still recommend it without qualm.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of psoriasis on my lower legs, knees and elbows that appeared a few years ago.  I tried every medication on the market - most work for a couple of weeks and then the psoriasis flares up even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I am in remission from psoriasis due to the Excimer Laser treatments -yay!  For me, I got better results when I did the laser every two weeks (some take the treatments once or twice per week).  This product provided me some relief prior to trying the laser.  And when I started the laser treatments, I found it enhanced the results if used two days after the treatments and up to 5 days before.  I avoided using the product for 4 days prior to treatment and for two days after due to an increase in blistering when used during this phase.  The laser is like a super strong dose of sun concentrated on your lesions and you definitely have to avoid the sun while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you will have to see your dermatologist about the Excimer treatments, but until then, this product was better than most medications prescribed.  Some say the tar treatments are carcinogenic but anyone who suffers from psoriasis over a large portion of their body realizes there is life and there is quality life - you have to make the choice for yourself.  But I do want to make clear, this product does not cure the psoriasis nor puts it into remission but it does provide some relief.</li>
            <li> Could have been 5 stars if not for the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my scalp. I suffer from an overly oily scalp which results in red soars on my head as well as lots of flakes. In order for this product to be successful, you MUST follow the instructions. Specifically you must leave it in for a few minutes after you apply it. The best routine I&#x27;ve found is to wash my hair with it as soon as I get into the shower, then do everything else I need to do (shave/wash etc.) while the formula sets it. I use the product about 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product reviews seems to say negative things about the smell. While this is true, the shampoo has a very distinctive &amp;#34;tar&amp;#34; smell to it, I&#x27;ve never found this to be a problem. If you use a conditioner or any type of product on your hair (such as styling gel or mousse) then those are more than sufficient to cover up the smell. You only have to put up with the smell while you&#x27;re washing your hair. And again, it&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell, just a tar smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great item for Poriasis and rasonable shopping to Australia.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I started noticing flakes and itching on my sideburns and the back of my scalp.  The dermatologist recommended I buy Ala Seb and it worked well, but buying it from him was expensive and inconvenient.  I searched online and found something that was supposed to be even better, Ala Seb T, which added coal tar to Ala Seb&#x27;s salicylic acid and it was awesome.  It cleared up my flakiness and itching within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it became impossible to find the stuff online anymore.  I bought a shampoo that had salicylic acid from Amazon called Home Health Everclean Dandruff Shampoo but it didn&#x27;t work, the flakes and itching came back.  I then searched Amazon for a shampoo with coal tar in it, figuring it was the coal tar that helped my condition...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...enter MG 217 psoriasis shampoo.  This shampoo works just as well as Ala Seb T even without the salicylic acid.  Within a couple of days of using it my flakiness and itching went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MG 217 is green and watery in appearance, but it takes very little to work up a good lather.  It smells like what you would expect coal tar to smell like, so don&#x27;t expect something fruity or pleasant.  Still, I&#x27;d gladly deal with the odor to get rid of the flakes and itching.  I find I works best if you shampoo with a regular shampoo first, then the MG 217, and leave it to soak for a few minutes.  I use it daily.  Also, I use a conditioner to get rid of the coal tar smell in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great shampoo to relieve itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I don&#x27;t have psorisis, but I do have seborrheic dermatitis (extreme dandruff). So far, I&#x27;ve used the shampoo twice, and hair cream as needed and I am already getting excellent results. Prior to use, I had white scaly skin by my ears and the front of my hair line. I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works. I&#x27;ve already, recommended to friends who have dandruff. You can actually see my scalp. And I don&#x27;t use the shampoo often either. I use it once per week. I wish I had found this stuff sooner.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and really curbd the itching.</li>
            <li> Ordered this a month ago for moderate scalp psoriasis I&#x27;ve had for 6 yrs that no other product seemed to work for.  After first week using it 2x, my scalp was significantly cleared up.  Now, one month later after using it just 2x per week and using Head &amp; Shdrs Refresh daily dandruff shampoo, my scalp is finally healthy and normal.  Must be something in the formulation as I have tried stronger concentrations of coal tar in the past with no success.  This stuff is worth every cent.  I plan on cutting back to just 1x per week for routine maintenance.</li>
            <li> Out of all the shampoos and ointments I have bought even very expensive ones, this is the only one that has helped me with my psoriasis. Best shampoo ever, I am already on my second bottle and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is used for various scalp conditions and has worked well.  When a doctor or pharmacist recommends coal tar shampoo for scalp conditions, you may want to say &amp;#34;Oh no.&amp;#34; because it would seem to be ugly.  Well, when you use it, it looks and smells somewhat ugly, but later your hair is nice and shiny look and feel.  It is very effective against scalp conditions, especially for children.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and could not find locally. Just received. The only shampoo I found that helps with the scaling and itching</li>
            <li> Really is a magic potion for hubby&#x27;s dandruff. He has had the flakiest scalp for years. Especially in the winter. ALL GONE!! Just a bit thin and runny. Hubby has dementia so I have to do his hair and it is very liquidy and runny.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells really bad but used 2 or 3 times a week, double application, helped a lot with my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Always seems to make my hair soft and shiny and the smell is no where near as intense as other psoriasis shampoos with coal tar as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> I am trying to be neutral on this review.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a bit too strong on my scalp. I don&#x27;t think I have psoriasis just bad dandruff. So not sure if that could also be an issue. I can see how this may work for true psoriasis sufferers.</li>
            <li> All I need to say if if your looking at these reviews then I assure you this is what your looking for. It saved my scalp! I have hair down to my belly button so washing it every day is impossible. This shampoo took away all the itching, flaking, and inflammation even with me only using it twice a week. You don&#x27;t need to search anymore, just get it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he simply loved it! He have tried several other products before but none solved his problem, this is the first he uses that really works! I recommend.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product! He has a flaky scalp and he noticed the difference after a few uses I was surprised! He&#x27;s so happy I got this for him.</li>
            <li> this has helped me clear up a lot, it is VERY liquidy, not thick at all so other than that it is amazing &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Has improved my quality of life - Have not needed to go to a dermatologist - I use 2+ times a week and sulfate free shampoo/conditioner on other days.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been a miracle cure for me.  I have had psoriasis for about 15 years now and nothing has helped (even prescriptions).  My scalp was/is 95% clear now.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good for my stubborn dandruff but at a cost- I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gone from normal shedding to a decent amount of my hair ending up EVERYwhere. It&#x27;s most noticable in the shower and on my brush. Not a big deal. And the smell is as I expected- nasty. It is a really thin shampoo as others stated-but desperate times call for desperate measures and it works.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this, and is very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> Great product Great price and quick great to deal with. I will buy again and tell my friends to do the same</li>
            <li> My husband has a kind of dander that usually has to be taken care of with a prescription shampoo, but with this and rotating with another couple kind of specialty otc shampoos, his hair and scalp is fine and we don&#x27;t have to buy the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> I noticed zero benefits with this. Did not affect my psoriasis at all. The plus side is it smells fairly good. It&#x27;s also fairly concentrated. But yeah, no change in flakes or redness.</li>
            <li> After reading the many great reviews, I was hopeful that this would be the OTC shampoo that would do the trick. Unfortunately - it doesn&#x27;t. Happily it does leave your hair nice and soft, and the product doesn&#x27;t feel caustic. I keep going back to Clobex, which works like a charm but is only available by prescription.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NOTHING that could ever take the place of Pentrax Shampoo.  I have tried just about everything on the market.  Came across this product and find that it at least takes the itching away and many of the flakes.  Pentrax was sued by one man and was taken off the market because of a stinking warning label.  Because of some do-gooder, I know that thousands are without the best product that ever was made for our problem.</li>
            <li> this product contains chemicals that dries out the scalp and makes my scalp itch, witch makes my PS worse, I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell but my heair looked nice. It did not sry it out. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells like tar.. But helps</li>
            <li> Amazing Product, ordered for my son, I was trying to avoid the Dermatologist Visit and fees, the product save me... very quick delivery! Thanks</li>
            <li> have been using it for over a month. Dont see any real difference.</li>
            <li> I am glad that this product exist.  I combine it with Dermastatin and I literally feel nothing!  I think a 8 0z can last me a good 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product and gave excellent results. Within 2 weeks of washing my scalp was completely cleared. I Recommended the Shampoo to my sister and she got the same great results.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s all hope that the government powers that &amp;#34;be&amp;#34; don&#x27;t ban all pine tar products. For some of us psoriasis sufferers, tar is the only relief out there! While nothing I have tried over the last 50+ years clears it up completely, this product does a fine job of &amp;#34;controlling&amp;#34; it! That&#x27;s something, at least.</li>
            <li> I typically use T-Sal and Scalpactin when I have a flare-up, but this last one lasted much longer than usual, and the symptoms were exceptionally bad. The bleeding and itching was unbearable, and the dandruff was so bad that I was embarrassed to go anywhere. I had considered going back to the dermatologist, then I found Mg217. I combined this with the scalp cream Nioxin during the day, and my symptoms started clearing in three days. In less than two weeks, my scalp was clear again, symptoms gone!&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for any future flare-ups, and recommend this for anyone who suffers from seborrheic dermatitis!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really effective.  Relieves symptoms better than other formulations that I&#x27;ve tried.  Has more of the active ingredient, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been using the Denorex - which worked pretty well for me - -&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d alternate their Coal Tar shampoo with the exfoliant one (which I really liked for the anti-itch properties of the Menthol)&lt;br /&gt;But - - when they changed their packaging (bottles looked the same but only held 10 oz instead of 12 - for the SAME PRICE)&lt;br /&gt;I went looking for something else.&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Reviews on Amazon were through the roof for THIS product - - so fine - - lets try it.&lt;br /&gt;Coal Tar equivalent on this is LESS than for Denorex - - and if I do NOT use it 3 - 4 times per week, the problem comes back.&lt;br /&gt;My routine is to apply it full strength to the problem areas and let it sit for 15 min while I do other things.&lt;br /&gt;Then shower it off.&lt;br /&gt;So in the final analysis - it seems to work - but for me, is NOT the answer</li>
            <li> Great price for coal tar shampoo with a high percentage of active ingredient. It doesn&#x27;t foam very much so I use a fair amount each time, but I rotate it with two other shampoos (salicylic acid and nizoral/ketokonazole), so it lasts longer. I have very stubborn dandruff so I still have to shampoo with one of these products on a daily basis in order to keep my dandruff under control, but at least I have a solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from scalp psoriasis since I was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived, my mother would cover my head in coconut oil and I&#x27;d use T-Gel, which definitely helped the symptoms. I was mostly clear for quite some time. When I began college, my psoriasis returned with a vengeance and I began a long, fruitless search for a product that would help my itchy, flaky scalp. It was particularly irritating and embarrassing because I have thick black hair that shows white flakes very obviously, and my upper neck had such a thick/inflamed plaque I couldn&#x27;t wear ponytails without someone worriedly asking, &amp;#34;What happened to your neck?!&amp;#34; T-Gel had stopped working for me at this point (not to mention, it made my usually soft and healthy hair feel like straw). Coconut oil only provided minor relief. I tried dozens of shampoos - some were prescribed, some were completely natural, some were OTC but designed for psoriasis. I tried various creams and ointments and foams. Nothing really helped, and some things made my psoriasis even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this shampoo as a last-ditch effort to finally tame my psoriasis. I&#x27;m about 4 uses in, and I already see a reduction in my flakes and my head itches so much less than it did a few weeks ago. Let me break it down into pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The main pro: it definitely eases symptoms (flaking and itching) after a few washes! I used to see a noticeable sprinkle of dandruff at the top of my head each day...it made me so self conscious to go to work and do my activities. I was always having to brush away or blow dry my flakes off - I haven&#x27;t had to do that recently. I see significantly less flakes these days. I still do itch a bit, but not nearly as much as before.&lt;br /&gt;-It makes your hair reasonably moisturized...non-drying. Many other &amp;#34;psoriasis&amp;#34; shampoos I&#x27;ve tried make my hair feel terribly dry.&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable price&lt;br /&gt;-Available OTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Very strong chemical smell- it&#x27;s actually very similar to wet paint. As someone who prefers the natural approach to everything, it made me uneasy to put something this chemical-laden on my head. Not sure if I can use it long term for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I definitely recommend this psoriasis shampoo. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but it definitely helps. I&#x27;m planning to modify my diet (gluten, for example, is a known psoriasis trigger) and see if that can make the rest of my psoriasis disappear. For now, I&#x27;ll continue to use this shampoo!</li>
            <li> The smell of coal tar shampoo is terrible but my scalp began to heal from the moment I used it. I saw at least a 50% improvement in the area of irritation after the first use. I need to find a conditioner that will keep my hair from smelling like this, but I&#x27;ve been in so much pain from using different shampoos that had fragrance in them that I&#x27;m willing to put up with it. If you have psoriasis or irritation of any kind on your scalp, this is the next step in treating it.</li>
            <li> My Son uses this product all the time.  It really works.</li>
            <li> Tried this product after many year or trying other similar, but not tar based products. Wish I had got this a long time age. Worked within a week. Itching has gone and I am using to 3 times a week. Does not smell great as you use it, but that is fairly unnoticeable when washed out. I recommend.</li>
            <li> The best I have used!</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT for folks with scalp issues that the OTC stuff just can&#x27;t handle.  It smells pretty rough, but it WORKS.  Also, it makes my hair look pretty darned good - doesn&#x27;t look like a medicated shampoo was used!  I&#x27;m allergic to mousse, hair spray and the like but just HAVE to use it sometimes; my scalp instantly gets awful, but this stuff can truly manage it.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Only a few uses and I already love it!  Helps with itching, redness,  and flakes. . So far so good!  Much more liquid consistency so a little hard to apply to hair but overall good stuff! Works better for me then Neutrogena TSAL</li>
            <li> Very good for psoriasis</li>
            <li> Used for a week now and I do feel significant result with less scalp itch</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I also got the ointment.  We use it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp psoriasis, and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I was spectacle with this type of shampoo, but my psoriasis was getting out of hand. Even after two weeks of use with this product it showed a difference. The itching has lessened &amp; the scalp is getting clearer.</li>
            <li> Works great for my brother with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really delivers all that it promises.  It does have a slight medicated smell, but I consider the scent to smell clean and outdoorsy.&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this shampoo provided me with total relief from the constant itching and scratching, but it left my hair as soft and manageable as some of the expensive shampoos that I generally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condition of my scalp psoriasis was diagnosed as severe.  I had been to a few dermatologists and all their potions, lotions, ointments, oils and sprays never had any lasting effect.  They stung my scalp, were messy, time consuming and they really did not provide much in the way of relief.  Another dermatologist recommended the cortisone shots, these were very painful and messy, however, the itching, burning, and constant scratching would resume.  Then I tried Mg 217shampoo and these are my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this shampoo it had a soothing effect on my scalp instead of the usual stinging.  After a few hours, there was some minor itching, but instead of scratching, I took a soft bristled brush and brushed my entire scalp thoroughly. I think the lesions drying up caused the itching.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every four days and after 4 or 5 washings I noticed a dramatic change in my psoriasis condition, it was now more &#x27;moderate&#x27; than &#x27;severe&#x27; which was verified by my dermatologist.  By the end of the month, my condition had improved again to the &#x60;mild&#x27; stage.  Then by the end of the second month after using this shampoo, the psoriasis had gone completely into remission.  The itching had stopped and all the lesions on my head had healed.  There was just smooth soft skin.  The third month I used this shampoo once a week, and the fourth month every other week.  The fifth month I only used it once, and in the sixth month, I did not use the shampoo at all.  Unfortunately, in the seventh month the psoriasis started to return, so this shampoo needs to be used at least once a month for me to remain in remission, but it is still a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I would like to share some facts and tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) always shake the bottle thoroughly before each use.&lt;br /&gt;2) If the smell of the shampoo is off-putting, try shampooing at night since by morning the smell seems to dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;3) You can use a little of your scented conditioner after using the shampoo to lessen the tar scent.&lt;br /&gt;4) For minor itching, try brushing your hair down to the scalp with a soft bristled brush, it might be the scabs from the healing lesions that are causing the itch.&lt;br /&gt;5) Use a little raspberry ketone with your shampoo.  Raspberry ketone (the weight loss product) is known for its anti-inflammatory properties.  Open the capsule and empty the contents into a handful of the shampoo.  Mix it in with the shampoo with your finger and massage the concoction into your scalp.  It is soothing and it smells good.  Aside from a weight loss product, raspberry ketone used topically helps the hair to grow in thinner areas.&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;Google&#x27; raspberry ketone for scalp and hair treatments&#x27; to get all the facts.&lt;br /&gt;5) As of now, there is no cure for the psoriasis condition, but it can be both managed and controlled.  Mg 217 Shampoo for Psoriasis might be a way to control your condition, for me it has put my psoriasis into remission, which is as good as it gets.emission, but it is still a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I would like to share some facts and tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) always shake the bottle thoroughly before each use.&lt;br /&gt;2) If the smell of the shampoo is off-putting, try shampooing at night since by morning the smell seems to dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;3) You can use a little of your scented conditioner after using the shampoo to lessen the tar scent.&lt;br /&gt;4) For minor itching, try brushing your hair down to the scalp with a soft bristled brush, it might be the scabs from the healing lesions that are causing the itch.&lt;br /&gt;5) Use a little raspberry ketone with your shampoo.

            <li> I was using Neutrogena T/Gel to keep my scalp psoriasis under control.  I used it only when I started to have a problem and it seemed to take care of it.  I don&#x27;t know what happened but I had a flair up just behind my ear that would not go away.  After a month of using T/Gel I started thinking about going back to the dermatologist.  I tried this as a last ditch effort.  And it worked!  Not only did it work but it also doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong as the T/Gel.  I am continuing to use this once a week just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t come back.  So far so good.  UPDATE:  While I love this shampoo, it is stripping my hair colour.  Looks like I found the right active ingredient (coal tar) but I need to find one without sulfates.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works as directed.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product so I don&#x27;t have enough use to give a really good review. I like it so far and was really surprised how clean my hair feels and it smells nice. My psoriasis has not cleared up 100% but it also has not worsened.</li>
            <li> Seems to work the best out of all the product I have tried. Eliminates frosted flakes from your shoulders. Chicks dig me now.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  Seems to make my scalp feel better.  Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically a high powered T-Gel.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles for my head, but it does keep serious psoriasis outbreaks from occurring.</li>
            <li> Have used MG 217 for years.  It definitely helps the itching; does not cure psoriasis, but helps deal with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 2 weeks, usually every other day.  I leave it on a few minutes, then rinse and shampoo with my regular shampoo.  It is slowly working.  Yes, it smells a little, but after my regular shampoo, there&#x27;s no more smell.  It is a liquid, not a cream, so just be careful how you pour it into your hand.  You don&#x27;t need very much, as it foams up really great.  I will keep using it and am pretty confident it is going to remove all the scabs on my head.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after the first use.  It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked so far for both my son and I.  I would recommend this shampoo for any one experiencing issues of build up, itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> DO NOT DO NONE FOR MY SCALP</li>
            <li> Does a great job of purifying your scalp paired with an apple cider rinse. My husband has trouble with rashes on his scalp, and this really helps. Don&#x27;t expect it to smell good and pay attention to the label. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on very light, bleached hair.  Otherwise, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s doctor recommended this for him.  He has suffered from Psoriasis all his life.  This  helped with the scratching and flaking.  Good product.  He will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to my son-in-law ran you wonder</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  Arrived in time expected.</li>
            <li> 2nd bottle purchased for psoriasis of scalp. Works better other products even prescription.  Just use lots of conditioning after.</li>
            <li> Smells like a driveway, but I have been using it for a couple weeks, and it seems to be helping my psoriasis when regular T-gel didn&#x27;t help anymore. Worth the smell for the relief!</li>
            <li> As advertised, great price &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> Love it. ....was able to clear the psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Really helped with the psoriasis after a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo once, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will work to remove the psoriasis from my scalp.  I worried that the shampoo would be too harsh on my hair, but am really pleased that it left my hair manageable, without needing an additional conditioner, which is something I always need/use.  I will write a follow-up when I can report about its effectiveness.    FOLLOW UP:  I  had some really bad scaling on the back of my head, which I couldn&#x27;t see, but felt with my fingers.  I have now used this shampoo about 5 times and most of the scaling is gone!!  I had tried other products, but nothing worked.  I am so pleased and relieved that I found Mg 217.</li>
            <li> it lathers up real good and seam to stop the itching right away it has a medicine smell to it</li>
            <li> Best product for my needs.  It always works to control dandruff. It is hard to get at drug stores. Glad it is online.</li>
            <li> I self-diagnosed an early onset of scalp psoriasis (thick flakes in 2 spots that returned when I removed them, bleeding skin). Neutrogena helped a bit, but putting hand cream in my hair was not a long-term solution. I self-prescribed myself this shampoo and after using it for 5 days I can feel a difference. No more flakes.&lt;br /&gt;The heavy scent of freshly-paved road is a welcome bonus. It stays with me all day.The women love it and follow me in droves.</li>
            <li> A quality product, but it&#x27;s hard to find anything that works well for this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with scalp psoriasis my whole life, and practically no other over-the-counter shampoo comes close to MG217. It not only stops all my symptoms dead in their tracks for days, but the shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy. Another great thing about this is that it does not leave that embarrassing \\&quot;medication\\&quot; smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> Had a fungus that broke out on my scalp. Tried several other products without success. This stuff stamped it out within abut 3 days.</li>
            <li> Really, really good. I&#x27;ve had scalp psoriasis since 8th grade, I&#x27;m in college now and I&#x27;ve had enough.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this on a whim and I&#x27;m super glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smells bad, very runny.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: scalp is noticeably different, less itchy, less problems.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell, but I love the outcome. I use this shampoo everytime I wash my hair, if I don&#x27;t then I return to my bad scalp. So use it everytime.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser has noticed it and said that my scalp looks good. I really appreciate this product, if you aren&#x27;t sure about it then you should just go for it.&lt;br /&gt;It took me a few washes to see a difference because mine was so bad, but you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> This works well. Put it on your head maybe twice a week. Let it sit there while you&#x27;re singing in the shower and washing your nether regions. Wash it off. You&#x27;ll be good to go. I&#x27;ve also used it on a rough spot on my finger and, boom, after about a month that part of me healed too. Good product</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my blind friend with psoriasis on her scalp.  After 2 washes it was gone.  Now she keeps it for recurrences and praises it.</li>
            <li> For me, the coal tar is the important part to any scalp treatment. I have used this and other coal tar shampoos for 20+ years.    Originally I used a dermatologist prescribed shampoo. It worked great and smelled pretty good, considering. It was a huge hassle and expensive though so I eventually switched to Denorex with coal tar solution. I used that for years when suddenly my scalp started having issues again. I worried that I had developed an immunity to it&#x27;s effects... until I read the label and saw that they stopped adding the coal tar! I felt betrayed.    My local Albertsons carried MG217 so I started using it. They discontinued it and a lot of other things which brought me here to purchase it.    Like any coal tar shampoos, it is rough on your hair and frankly smells like coal tar. I use a good conditioner though.    The bottom line is it works for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t (to my knowledge) have psoriasis.  What I do have is fairly bad recurrent dandruff, flaking, and scalp itching.  I had used T-Gel regularly with good results, but I wanted to try something stronger.  I found MG217 shampoo on the internet and went to my local Walgreen&#x27;s to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great.  It&#x27;s the only thing I have used that seems to knock out the dandruff and itching immediately upon the first use.  In addition, when shampooing my hair, I spread some of the shampoo over my face where I get red, flaky, itchy skin which I think is related to the dandruff.  It eliminates that problem, too... leaving my facial skin much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does smell, but I am used to that and actually kind of like it (call me weird).  Also, it IS pretty strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day (and neither do they).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternate using it with a mild baby shampoo, and use a good conditioner and you should have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has also helped with my hair-loss.  Not that it makes your hair grow back, but hair fall that seems to be associated with sebum build-up and associated scalp condition is less when using MG217.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I suffered for a couple of years with severe psoriasis all over my scalp.  Every time I turned my head, flakes would fall.  The itching was awful. I tried everything I could think of.  Then I started seeing a dermatologist and using a prescription shampoo that helped a little, but never cleared it up.  A little more than year ago, I did a search for over the counter psoriasis shampoos and came across this one.  I ordered it and tried it for about a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  So I gave my bottle to my mom, who also suffers with psoriasis, and a later she told me that it was really good.  I decided to order it again and use it for a longer period of time.  After a month, the psoriasis was completely cleared.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and I have had absolutely no flare ups.  I put it on my wet scalp and let it sit for a couple of minutes (no longer), and then rinse it out.  I think different products work for different people.  This one worked for me.  If you try it, I would recommend using it for about a month every other day before you decide if it works for you.  It sure worked for me!!</li>
            <li> Stops the itch on the 1st shampoo.  It smells good, too. I highly recommend it. Thank you very much MG217.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with my Seborrheic dermatitis but gawd does it smell disgusting, Smell does not rinse out so am using a regular conditioner to try to minimize the odor, not sure if that is hurting its ability to get rid of the &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo a few weeks ago and really didn&#x27;t expect too much.  I&#x27;d tried so many other ones in he past, including prescription types, that did little or nothing.  It was probably only the second time I used it when I could not get over the difference.  The flaking and itching were disappearing so quickly it was as if I was imagining it!  This is by far the best psoriasis product I&#x27;ve ever used and intend to keep using it.  I&#x27;m getting great results and only use it twice a week.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 only because I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.  But if all that&#x27;s wrong is that smell isn&#x27;t like my other shampoos, then it&#x27;s hardly something that I&#x27;d stop using it because.  This is one great product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t have enough coal tar to be effective for me.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a terrible product, as with the nature of Psoriasis, what works for some may not work for others.</li>
            <li> When people complain about the smell of certain products, I usually tell them to just grow a pair and deal with it. However when I jumped in the shower to use this shampoo, I became one of those people. I actually gagged and had to hold my nose the whole time. It might have been okay if my hair didn&#x27;t smell like the awful stuff afterwards. It works pretty well, but I&#x27;m still on the fence. I&#x27;m not sure I can endure the scent day in and day out.</li>
            <li> I know I sound like one of those people from a commercial, but it&#x27;s true. I tried practically every shampoo on the market for the psoriasis on my scalp, to NO avail.  None made a dent in the flakes.  Then I tried MG 217. After the first time I used it, I could tell a difference.  And after using it a couple days, my flakes are TOTALLY GONE.  Now I know not everything works for everybody, but this has truly been a dream product.  A can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  I hope it works as well for you!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked better than anything else I had tried.</li>
            <li> So my son had a bad issue with severe flaking of the scalp. It was so bad it would come off in large noticeable clumps looking like he had frosting in his hair or something.He was so Embarrassed about it! We tried every dandruff shampoo available in the store and even went to our Dr and got a prescription shampoo! I would also use a fine tooth comb to help loosen and remove the flakes (daily) so I decided to try something geared towards a skin condition. I found this and tried it. What do ya know...he doesn&#x27;t have a flake in his head! He uses it every other shampooing and that seems to do the trick. Amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years with better than good results. The last bottle I purchased with the new bottle design is a watered down version of the original. I am sorry to lose this product (like when Pentrax was discontinued) as the price rises every time i purchase it, and now they effectively reduced its soap concentration to about half of what it once was. I will look for an alternate as the old MG 217 lasted a very long time.</li>
            <li> For years I searched for something that worked as well as Sebutone for my scalp and beard booly-booly. Dermatologists scripts are no help, just very expensive. Found MG217 while doing searching for a Sebutone cache. It works really well. Nothing cures it, but it keeps it in check, sometimes with as little as 1x/wk application.</li>
            <li> nice product..it helps a lot ..thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad, but works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of my money, I use it everyday and it&#x27;s a waste of time well then again I am bold...</li>
            <li> I have used a few Psoriasis shampoos and this is the only that I noticed a huge difference in reduction of flakes and buildup. It really does the job, but man I wish they could make it smell better.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with psoriasis for over 20 years and have tried everything, including perscriptions.  This is the one product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have Psoriatic Arthritis and battle with psoriasis on my scalp and hands.  This shampoo is amazing!  Not only does it help the psoriasis, it also leaves my hair soft!!  Yes, it does have a faint tar smell, but it&#x27;s worth it for relief.  I have tried other shampoo&#x27;s for psoriasis and this works the best.</li>
            <li> I have had small itchy spots on my scalp since I was in high school. When I moved to a hotter, drier climate the condition worsened.&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo 1-2 times per week, work it in and leave it one while I go about my other shower duties. It&#x27;s true- it does smell like straight up gasoline. But it also got rid- repeat, RID- of ever itchy spot on my scalp after two washes. I no longer even scratch my scalp, which I now realize I did perpetually before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this shampoo to two people who have also had great results.&lt;br /&gt;Now if we could just work on getting it strawberry scented life would be perfect. :)</li>
            <li> Try it and you will never use anything else.  I was upset they changed the packaging and I could not find it was unavailable for a while.  I am so happy it is back and the formula has not changed</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great for clearing up my psoriasis no more flaky scalp or avoiding wearing black shirts because my psoriasis was so noticable...highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This has stopped the itching completely. I have been using DHS cold tar and Denorex. This seems to work better, IT also actually lathers unloke some other medicated shampoos.</li>
            <li> Helpful for psoriasis on scalp</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked as advertised but it was a little hard for my wife to deal with the odor. It is shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working. I have been using it for about 2 1/2 weeks. No complaints on the product. Bob</li>
            <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that works for me. All the others work for 1-2 shampoos then stop. I can use this daily and am pretty much dandruff free.</li>
            <li> Stinks but works great</li>
            <li> doesnt do as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Glad to have a fairly priced source for this excellent product. This shampoo really helps control the psoriasis in the scalp.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks like most medicated shampoos.  I am not as concerned with the bad odor as I am with how runny this shampoo is.  I suppose its wouldn&#x27;t work if it didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in it that makes it stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is watered down, though that I wonder how it can work.  Most shampoos have some thickness to it, a richness you expect. This does NOT!!! It has no real form (thickness) to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you not squeeze the bottle or you will end up with about half of it in you hand. Although as runny as it is most of it will run out of your hand and down your arm, or down the sink, or all over the floor...  It is so runny that I have trouble getting it from my hand and onto my hair without it runny off my hand before I can use it to  lather-up and wash my scalp.  It seems as if I lose more than I use with each shampoo.  It also does not foam/lather up very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not plan on buying it again, there are better medicated shampoos on the market, that are thicker and they lather up when used.  And they are not so watery that as I said you lose more than you use.  I don&#x27;t think they is much real product in the bottle for the money, since at least half of it is water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat buyer. This stuff works great on my psoriasis and I&#x27;m not allergic to the smell like I am with the Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> been using this shampoo for over 3 months now..did not make flakes completely go away..scalp is still itchy and flaky...</li>
            <li> GOOD  WORKS AS ADVERTISED.  WILL USE AGIAN.</li>
            <li> I had a severe case of psoriasis last year and tried many different prescriptions and shampoos and none seemed to work. As soon as I used this shampoo my scalp psoriasis disappeared. It stayed in remission for a year. I have not used it in a few months and now I am getting the psoriasis back again. I am going to start using it again and if it works the same as before I will definitely give it 5 stars. But I am reserving judgement because those of us who suffer from this know that what works once may not work again. But I did get a good clear year and that is something!</li>
            <li> if  you  have  issues  with  your  scalp,  buy  this!  when  I  use  this I  put  it  on  my  finger  tips  and  rub  it  in.  a  little  goes a  long  way.  this  takes  care  of itchy, scabby scalp.  ive  had  issues  since I  was a  baby  this  stuff  cures  it. not  smell  good,  but  it  works  and  your  hair  will  be  so  so  soft  after.</li>
            <li> Great for psoriasis.  I mix it with a bit of water and apply directly to my scalp.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair with it.  It&#x27;s a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I use this product as directed. This winter, which is when I have the biggest issue with plaque build up, everything seems under control.</li>
            <li> It helped but the original itching, burning and flaking is still with me.,</li>
            <li> After opening the package and smelling the potent smell, I read the packaging which states: Ingredient known to the state of California to cause cancer.  Needless to say, it went into the trash. I am disappointed to see known carcinogens in a package that is supposed to improve the health of one&#x27;s scalp...</li>
            <li> Just received my order yesterday and I have only been able to use it once but my head/hair feels better than it has in over a year. Even better than shampoo that was prescribed by a doctor.</li>
            <li> This was the third winter in a row I was dealing with itchy, bleeding sores on my scalp.  When I finally figured out that it was psoriasis, I decided to try this shampoo.  I figured it probably couldn&#x27;t hurt, and may even help...I was desperate.  It worked!  I am so pleased and relieved.  Not only that, it leaves my hair more manageable than any shampoo I have used lately.  It really does smell awful, though.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job to relieve the scaling and helps to promote skin healing. Does not cure only helps with the symptoms.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and it arrived very fast.  Will differently purchase again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is incredible at controlling dandruff. With a solution equivalent to 3% coal tar, compared to &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34; OTC shampoos like Head and Shoulders at 0.5% to 1.0%, this is not surprising. The lather is rich and it rinses cleanly, but it does smell. Get a good conditioner to use afterward and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and for the price and performance, this is the best. A must buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Had to see dermatologist as the product did not give me the relief I expected.</li>
            <li> I really hate the smell of this shampoo but it gets the job done,I only have to use it once every week or two</li>
            <li> My husband has psoriasis and this is the only this we have found that completely clears up his scalp. A little expensive, but then, all of the shampoos for psoriasis seem to be. However, a little goes a long way, and you only use it a couple times a week. We will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that works for me. My psoriasis is actually worse on my scalp then anywhere else on my body. IT was driving me nuts! This shampoo actually did what it said it would do. It does not leave your hair stripped feeling or smelly.</li>
            <li> Hi, thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this every other day. I also use head and shoulders on the off days. My psoriasis is probably in the heatof its outbreak so thats why its not working real big good.I would have given it 5 stars if it would have instantly healed my head like some of the reviews said it was did. But it didn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll keep using it till about gone but probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Then I couldn&#x27;t find this until I saw it here, both the ointment and shampoo. The shampoo lathers well, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft. You have to use it a couple of times before you&#x27;ll notice that your scalp feels better and the dandruff is under control. Finally I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed with the constant itching and flaky anymore.</li>
            <li> Have tyred many shampoos for my scalp psoriasis. Nothing has help as good as this shampoo. I am not flake free, but has helped a lot. Recomend this product!</li>
            <li> I saw a ton of reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.  The odor was a little strong but it seems to help with  the flaking and itching, so that&#x27;s good.  All in all, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> have been using it for 1.5 months and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product several years ago and started using it to help with my scalp psoriasis. I use it a few times a week and I haven&#x27;t had to fill my prescriptions at all. takes away the itch and keeps the scalp patches under control. Only negative is the smell but any good tar shampoo has it. I just use a nice smelling conditioner after. Terrific product. My local stores that used to carry it don&#x27;t offer it any more. Amazon saved the day!</li>
            <li> A nice shampoo but I didn&#x27;t notice it affecting my symptoms much.  Better nutrition seems to be the answer for me</li>
            <li> Psoriasis has already stopped itching and redness is going away.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product highly to others with dry, itching scaling scalps.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with the dryness and flakes. Not a cure for my condition but it does seem to be helping. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
            <li> Significantly less concentrated and viscous than other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past, such that have to use 3x the amount for the same efficacy.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and clearly states this item has a good chance of causing cancer. who would want this item?</li>
            <li> great stuff for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, the only shampoo that leaves no dandruff, wish they had a body wash for psoriasis too!</li>
            <li> Stinks, but it works better the OTC shampoos</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Smell isn&#x27;t too bad and it cures that God awful itch!</li>
            <li> The shampoo works as advertised. I get terrible dandruff and this stuff solved the problem of my itchy scalp and flaking.</li>
            <li> use this product once a week, and it has done a good job holding psoriasis at bay on scalp area</li>
            <li> I bougth this items just by surfing trhu teh amazon&#x27;s page web, and catch my attntion, I decided to get it and gave it to a relative who used this product, having great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild psoriasis of the scalp for many, many years, but due to other health conditions, over the past year or so it has become unbearable. I would catch myself waking up all night long, unable to sleep because of the constant itching and burning. For years I just put up with it, but 2 months ago when I looked with a mirror at the severe condition of my scalp, I knew I couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore and started looking on line for products that could offer relief. I purchased this product fairly certain it wouldn&#x27;t help. Other shampoos I had tried previously were disappointing, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of faith that this one would be any different. I started using the ointment 4 times a day the day it arrived, and within 3 or 4 days, I began to notice a difference. I used the ointment in conjunction with the shampoo (which I used every day for the first week)-and thank God, after using these products for 2 months, my scalp is healing! There is almost no itching, the redness has been reduced to mild pink rash that is still fading, and the scaling and lesions are almost completely gone. This product does what it says it can do. I now use the shampoo twice a week and the ointment only when I feel the itchiness return. I am thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> Thus product has helped with my child&#x27;s dandruff. He uses it once a week and that sufficient.</li>
            <li> Have used 4x/week for 2.5 months. Have moderate scalp psoriasis (and little hair). Noticed a positive difference in terms of less scaling after about two weeks. Saw my derm last week and she said that she could barely even tell I had scalp psoriasis. There is definitely a strong tar/gasoline smell but this smell is not a reason to avoid the product. It works. I leave it in for 5 minutes then after rinsing it out I use a conditioner to help to remove any lingering smell (which I&#x27;ve never noticed). Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old son.  It seems to have helped some, I&#x27;m keeping my eye on his scalp with school being out.  The Scalp Psoriasis may mellow too without school stress.  I&#x27;ll know more in a month.</li>
            <li> It really works. After using 3 times only, it has worked.</li>
            <li> Really like the shampoo, it gives my hair a lot of body,which&lt;br /&gt;I needed in my hair. I am very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for about one month. But I will keep using see any effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have psoriasis, but I have skin that is oily and dry on my face and especially my scalp. I&#x27;ve also had thick hair, both long and short (currently short.)  While most young girls were told you shouldn&#x27;t wash your hair every day, most times even every other day doesn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;ve tried so much: head &amp; shoulders, selsun blue, T-Gel, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried psoriasis shampoos before.  But I still got that dandruff, -especially- around the hairline.  It didn&#x27;t matter what I did, how hard I scrubbed or didn&#x27;t or lathered, rinsed, repeated, I could shake tiny little flakes out.  And I&#x27;d still have that white around my hairline (and by the sideburn area, just in front of the ears.  sigh).  Maybe it&#x27;s stress but I&#x27;d also get a small, thick, pink patch or two.  I searched Amazon for highly rated products and bought this.  I swear to you, it works.  The first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t scrub those problem areas so well.  The next time I did, no more pink or white patches of dried skin on my freshly-washed scalp.  For the first time in years, I could shake my hair like crazy and not one white speck came out.  It sounds corny, but I could have cried.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had need for this shampoo and it really works well.  I found it&#x27;s better than any of the other shampoos out there for dandruff or, for me, Psoriasis which also causes flaking.  It&#x27;s going into winter which means dry air and more outbreaks of this.  I just bought another 6 bottles.  If only, it was cheaper but amazon has some of the best prices.  Just watch for sales and stock up.</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended....apparently I am allergic to something in it.  Made my neck and ears itch.  Also dried out my hair entirely too much.</li>
            <li> It works well for keeping psoriasis in check on the scalp. Not a cure but does help.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from Psoriasis as my Son &amp; I do this is the shampoo for you. We have no flaking, itching, or burning of our scalp between shampoos &amp; it leaves our hair clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it works for me. I use it a few time and during and after my wash my scalp was itchy.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by itchy flaking scalp for years. I was recently diagnosed with psoriasis and this shampoo works well to control these conditions. The only drawback is it smells horrible compared to standard products but the results are terrific. I&#x27;ll put up with the odor because it leaves my hair as soft as a baby&#x27;s hair. I will be using this regularly.</li>
            <li> My usual brand is way too expensive in this country (Steifel polytar liquid), so i wanted to try something else and this had the best reviews. I found it to be very good. It does the job and leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking, not too dry as some of these types of shampoos can be.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> This is what helped me with my severe Dandruff... Nothing worked until I tried this.. Twice a wk and I&#x27;m back using dandruff shampoo and just used this one time a week... Trying not to use it all up... I just cut back on it.. Finally found the product that help my psoriasis.. My scalp feels so MUCH BETTER....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 25 years &amp; can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended originally by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;My local pharmacy stopped stocking it on their shelf but would order for me --- found it cheaper on Amazon.com !</li>
            <li> stopped the itch with first use</li>
            <li> When I read the great reviews I ordered on the spot. That was two weeks ago and It is definitely helping .  Far better than other products I have tried. I would recommend this product and I plan to stay with it in the future.</li>
            <li> So far I am not seeing major results but it is the first week.  I am hoping for better results as I continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had scalp plaque psoriasis so badly that I was ripping my hair out. I was waking up with nightmares scratching at my head. It got to the point where I had visited three different doctors. Things weren’t going well.  I had tried every shampoo on the market, changed my diet and tried some extreme measures ( one that included putting Vaseline directly on my scalp- it didn’t work. ) On a whim I searched on Amazon and this product came up and it has been life changing. It got a little better with the first bottle, the second bottle is what really made the difference. Now I am on my third bottle and I use it weekly. My hair is growing again, I’m not awkwardly scratching at my head everywhere I go. I’ve never been so happy with a product in my life because honestly before this, I was miserable.  Also, I  squirt it directly onto my scalp onto my problem areas and use my hair to scrub scrub and exfoliate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I still have not had to use MG 217 for a scalp lesion I had because it went away on it&#x27;s own.  But, I can attest to the necessity of using coal tar for psoriasis since I had very bad problems with it as a child and this is what the dermatologist made me use (as well as a thicker coal tar preparation for my hands).  I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t write a better review, but this would be my first choice in treating psoriasis.  Be cautious if you color or bleach your hair, though, as it will stain your hair the color of the tar in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in only 4 uses</li>
            <li> Coal Tar is amazing adittion to a shampoo. Unfortunately it´s linked to some forms of cancer. Here in Braizil I can´t find any shampoo with coal tar anymore. I used to use Polytar, but it is off the shelf for a long time. As I have a psoriasis that insists in stay with me, this is the only product that control it.</li>
            <li> I had dandruff for several years. I tried several shampoo contains, Salicylic acid. None of those shampoos improve my scalp condition. It got worse. So, I looked up several skin conditions and the treatments. I found this product on Amazone with good reviews. Finally, I ended up using this shampoo. I used only once and my flakes were gone.  This is unbelievable. My scalp is so clean now. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I had many dermatologist visits and tried many steroids. They cleared up my scalp, but as soon as I stopped using them, within a few days my scalp was as bad as ever.  Using MG217 every day for a few weeks cleared it up. Huge difference. My dermatologist poo-poo&#x27;ed coal tar treatments, but after hundreds of dollars of co-pays on prescriptions, this OTC $11 remedy has been the best remedy. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but it isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell, better than 1 other coal tar shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li> Good product to use when you have a breakout of seborrhea dermatitis and when your scalp itches a lot. Once I got it &amp;#34;under controlled&amp;#34; I started a detox cleansing diet. A healthy gut is linked to allergies and other skin problems. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I been suffering from Dermatitis from post Radiation.  I tried everything!  So I googled how to fix this and it said coal Tar can ease the redness and swelling.  This product has been a god send!  it works!!  I use it shampoo and body wash.  I top it off with coconut oil.  So far so good:)</li>
            <li> Work with me as havven</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I recently developed what seems like scalp psoriasis.  After doing nothing for several months i decided i had to try something,  I found this on amazon and went for it.  This stuff knocked it out immediately.  Still using it after a month but im thinking about stopping now.  Im hoping it doesnt come back.  The reason Im giving 4 stars is that the ingredient label states that this shampoo contains a chemical that is known to cause cancer by the State of California.  Do they really need to include a Carcinogen to make this stuff effective??  I guess I will look for a safer product next time.</li>
            <li> This product is so excellent it shows results as soon as you use it,  you have to try the best shampoo I,have ever used&lt;br /&gt;And believe me you will love it,</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo it&#x27;s the only one that controls my psoriasis and the price is good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who has issues with his scalp....when it was used alone...it worked ok...but he prefers to use it in between his prescribed shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema for 20 years. This shampoo works the best in relieving the symptoms in my scalp. It was recommended by my dermatologist, and is no longer available at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Works for my scalp Psoriasis where other products have failed.</li>
            <li> Have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, most effective treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work the first week. Maybe I was just being optimistic. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me anymore.</li>
            <li> I mix it with body wash on my loofa and do the works. Big relief, you get what you need.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, good price</li>
            <li> this product is a strong coal tar product, way higher in concentration than comparable Neutrogena, but remember that if you have seborrheic dermatitis, you shouldn&#x27;t go gung-ho with all the strong products, as your dermatitis (which is not curable once and indefinitely) builds up tolerance to anything you use against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;common products, in regular dosages, go toward higher strength/effectiveness like this&lt;br /&gt;4 zinc products 3 salyclic acid products 2 coal tar products 1 products with ingredients like ketoconazole, cortizone etc.,either prescription or OTC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you should start with the least strong products (zinc in my list), and switch to a stronger alternative or higher dosage only when necessary, especially the group indicated as (1) in the list is extremely tolerance-building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you can stick with lower dosage coal tar products and deal with the dermatitis attack, spare mg 217 for a later emergency. But if it is really necessary , buy this product w/o qualms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also feel free to comment and ask anything about s. dermatitis in the comments, I&#x27;ve had it for more than a decade and seen  several acclaimed dermatologists in that period, and come to be a bit of an expert on the topic, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different dandruff shampoos and they all make mine worse, coal tar is the only thing that seems to work for me. I ordered this along with the Psoriatrax shampoo since I was having trouble finding the Denorex with coal tar.  This works just as well.  I noticed 95% improvement with just one wash.</li>
            <li> Awesome product but it is taking a while this time because I have psoriasis so bad on my head</li>
            <li> tried everything to get rid of red irritation on my scalp. this shampoo along with the &#x27;mg217 ointment&#x27; did the trick in no time!</li>
            <li> Worked like magic and the best part, it really left my hair looking fabulous not dried out like so many other products I tried.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with scalp psoriasis for years now. It became so much worse this year and I feel like I tried everything to help control it. This has been the ONLY thing that has worked! The itching is gone and the flakes are minimal. I do not notice any scales like I used to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone suffering from mild to mediocre psoriasis. Using this product, according to the directions, has help keep my condition in-check. The fragrance could be improved upon, nasty.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks of use and my scalp problems are all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Great price. 100% worked for me.</li>
