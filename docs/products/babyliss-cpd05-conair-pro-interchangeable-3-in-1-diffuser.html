            <li>Fits perfect in my blowdryer too :)</li>
            <li>You have to put your shoulder into it when you wedge it onto the hair dryer, but once you do, it stays on perfectly while you&#x27;re using it, while still twisting off easily when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>This product is just what I needed, and is good quality and works as it should.  </li>

            <li>I actually love my hair now!</li>
            <li>Love that it includes 3 interchangeable options!</li>
            <li>I like the diffuser it dries my hair with amazing curls and the frizz of my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this to fit on my Babyliss hair dryer and it does a great job and fits nicely.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This makes your hair so nice and curly.</li>
            <li>but it dries my waves nicely.</li>
            <li>That was effective</li>
            <li>It comes with 3 diffusers which is also nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice unit.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I liked the 3-in-1 idea with interchangeable heads, but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser fits very nice on most hairdryers however it gets VERY VERY hot!!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with my new Babylyss dryer, BaByliss Pro BABTTW5586</li>
            <li>Fits great; used this as a quick replacement for my Remington blowdryer.</li>
            <li>It was so full of volume and so many curls!!</li>
            <li>I have the Babyliss 2800 and it&#x27;s a good fit.</li>
            <li>and it was blowing my hair everywhere as I tried to style (very fine hair).  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this attachment!  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery!!</li>
            <li>The curls are more consistant.</li>
            <li>so I know :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The air is diffused better, creating no blowing.  </li>
            <li>My hair drys faster and my curls turn out better.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with it falling off while using, just make sure it&#x27;s on snugly.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>and I love the rubberized fingers on one of the three attachments.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with both my BaByliss Pro BABP6685N Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer and Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer, Red BABTT053</li>
            <li>fits well on my hairdryer, love it.</li>
            <li>You squeeze it over the end of your dryer and it will end up staying on :)</li>
            <li>3 more words.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this versitle tool.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if this works,,,Except for the fact that their hair looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have natural wave but doesn&#x27;t carry it&#x27;s own good pattern.</li>
            <li>Fits the Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer perfectly and the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer loosely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this diffuser is just fine on compatible dryers, but I bought it hoping to attach to a Conair 1875 Watt Dual Voltage Folding Handle Hair Dryer</li>
            <li>This was a great buy for my old model Revlon hairdryer; it fits easily and</li>
            <li>Easy to take off, doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>Fits blow dryer easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easily attaches to my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out it was easy to get it off</li>
            <li>I believe the combination of a larger drying area and, most importantly, a better job of diffusing the air, is what makes this diffuser a superior product.</li>
            <li>Fit my BabyBliss dryer perfectly - easy to take on and off of my dryer.</li>
            <li>Fits just fine on my dryer</li>
            <li>the soft finger diffuser is great for my curly hair and when I want to straighten my hair, I first blow out most of the moisture with the screen cover on.</li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser based off the comment(s) in the questions section that it would fit a 2 3/8&amp;#34; barrel.  </li>
            <li>, I think it would have fit.  </li>
            <li>It fits my hairdryer securely.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser fit the blow dryer I just bought</li>
            <li>Will fit on any hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Does fit on well.</li>
            <li>Bit cheap feeling</li>
            <li>I put in a few before products, lots of mousse and some gel and after 20 minutes my hair came out beautiful!</li>
            <li>Fit well and does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Stays put and is light.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit correctly on my Conair hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It fit the BaByliss Pro BABP2800...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>I have a drier that is very powerful</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it first.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get too hot like many others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>but I imagine it would fit most large size hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>Some may see the weight as flimsy, but my toddler has done his best to destroy the diffuser without success.</li>
            <li>As far as doing what the diffuser is designed to do this product works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice unit and while I certainly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried in on all types of driers, I would believe it is a universal fit based on the way it attaches to the drier</li>
            <li>I was hesitant based on other reviews, but this is working great with my Babyliss dryer.</li>
            <li>It was super close</li>
            <li>Because of the way it fits on and is designed, I think it I truly universal and would fit any dryer since the inside kind of adjusts the deeper you put the dryer in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of super cheap plastic, very bendable.</li>
            <li>Fun to try out each of the three fittings.</li>
            <li>My favorite one has the soft fingers that help separate and lift my hair while drying.</li>
            <li>Bought this to go with a babyliss blow dryer and it slides right on and diffuses my hair.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product especially if you have wavy hair that needs more curl to it!</li>
            <li>There are 2 other plates that come with it and fit on top of the one unit.  </li>
            <li>It has 3 different heads (very easy to change) that work very well for volume and styling.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 8 months, at that time she dropped it and it shattered.  </li>
            <li>So hot that when I accidently touched it, burned my finger tips and I dropped the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>And she looks hot</li>
            <li>It does heat up, but never too hot to touch,</li>
            <li>This fits my Babyliss 2000 Pro Ceramix Xtreme really well!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also not difficult to get on and off.</li>
            <li>I perfer the Hot Sock Diffuser for the Travel Dryer since it is easier to pack.</li>
            <li>They do pop off from time to time but pops right back on pretty easily.</li>
            <li>There are plastic tabs that hold the diffuser onto barrel of the dryer, and when the dryer gets warm, the plastic must bend back to much, allowing the diffuser to simply slide right</li>
            <li>My very first diffuser when I was 14 lasted no less than 10 years</li>
            <li>Very versatile defuser.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the result in my curly hair after using it</li>
            <li>The whole process takes fewer than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>(can be very hot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It is a universal fit, so it slips onto the tube of your hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Although it says universal fit on the package, it pops out of the hairdryer after 30 seconds of using it.</li>
            <li>My hair was noticeably more curly and less frizzy when I used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Even though it said it was universally sized, it did not fit my fairly standard-sized dryer.</li>
            <li>This worked very well to give enough air and heat while diffusing the powerful airflow.</li>
            <li>Decent.  </li>
            <li>although I only use it for about 5 - 10 minutes at a time; it&#x27;s possible it could heat up more if used for longer.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is also very lightweight, which I love b/c it doesn&#x27;t add to an already heavy hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a high end blow dryer and no matter what I do</li>
            <li>.this item is not really interchangeable and doesn&#x27;t fit a hair dryer we bought</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have a lot to say other than this diffuser works just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is particularly helpful for my naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>The one unit comes with very soft nubs.  </li>
            <li>It is larger than the diffuser that came with my Conair 1875 which at first I did not like.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought the head that came attached was stuck, but it does take a bit of muscle to initially loosen.</li>
            <li>I did not realize how much my old hair dryer was drying my hair out until I bought this new one.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure you put the diffuser all the way down as far as possible on the drier</li>
            <li>The best you can do is use the soft nubs base and mash them against your scalp.  </li>
            <li>so I considered keeping my old diffuser and returning the product.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that I am always battling fuzziness.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it comes with 3 different attachments.</li>
            <li>I prefer the soft finger attachment but</li>
            <li>Plus it doesnt do nearly as well as my standrad diffuser.</li>
            <li>: Push this as far as it will go onto your hair dryer -</li>
            <li>I purchased this diffuser because I have naturally curly hair and wanted soft curls and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>I really like how it has three different attachments that can be used to diffuse my hair-  </li>
            <li>My blowdryer is an old off-brand that has served me well over the years, but apparently doesn&#x27;t have a diffuser, so rather than buy a whole new setup, I decided to look into universal diffusers.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I had an old Conair that it would fit on - but not worth it for the trouble.</li>
            <li>About the diffuser not being &amp;#34;universal,&amp;#34; the opening where it attaches to the dryer is tight (about 2.5&amp;#34; in diameter) and wouldn&#x27;t fit my larger Conair dryers.</li>
            <li>It is large and requires a hairdryer with a long enough nose.  </li>
            <li>This results in very little frizz, which is easily finished by using a large round brush and the Babyliss Pro BABP2800 2000-Watt Dryer without the diffuser on.</li>
            <li>so I only ever just use the soft pronged one.</li>
            <li>This came with a &amp;#34;soft finger&amp;#34; diffuser, a firm diffuser (I think this is shown in picture here) and a screen to put over the large space just for soft diffused air flow.</li>
            <li>Not only are the holes far too big on this unit, it never seems to hold on my dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a major difference between when I use the different diffuser heads</li>
            <li>Dries my half curly-half straight hair in record time with no frizz.  </li>

            <li> and I love the rubberized fingers on one of the three attachments.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with both my BaByliss Pro BABP6685N Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer and Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer, Red BABTT053</li>
            <li> fits well on my hairdryer, love it.</li>
            <li> You squeeze it over the end of your dryer and it will end up staying on :)</li>
            <li> 3 more words.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this versitle tool.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if this works,,,Except for the fact that their hair looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have natural wave but doesn&#x27;t carry it&#x27;s own good pattern.</li>
            <li> Fits the Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer perfectly and the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer loosely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this diffuser is just fine on compatible dryers, but I bought it hoping to attach to a Conair 1875 Watt Dual Voltage Folding Handle Hair Dryer</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for my old model Revlon hairdryer; it fits easily and</li>
            <li> Easy to take off, doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> Fits blow dryer easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easily attaches to my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out it was easy to get it off</li>
            <li> I believe the combination of a larger drying area and, most importantly, a better job of diffusing the air, is what makes this diffuser a superior product.</li>
            <li> Fit my BabyBliss dryer perfectly - easy to take on and off of my dryer.</li>
            <li> Fits just fine on my dryer</li>
            <li> the soft finger diffuser is great for my curly hair and when I want to straighten my hair, I first blow out most of the moisture with the screen cover on.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser based off the comment(s) in the questions section that it would fit a 2 3/8&amp;#34; barrel.  </li>
            <li> , I think it would have fit.  </li>
            <li> It fits my hairdryer securely.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser fit the blow dryer I just bought</li>
            <li> Will fit on any hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Does fit on well.</li>
            <li> Bit cheap feeling</li>
            <li> I put in a few before products, lots of mousse and some gel and after 20 minutes my hair came out beautiful!</li>
            <li> Fit well and does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Stays put and is light.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit correctly on my Conair hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> It fit the BaByliss Pro BABP2800...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a drier that is very powerful</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it first.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get too hot like many others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but I imagine it would fit most large size hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> Some may see the weight as flimsy, but my toddler has done his best to destroy the diffuser without success.</li>
            <li> As far as doing what the diffuser is designed to do this product works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice unit and while I certainly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried in on all types of driers, I would believe it is a universal fit based on the way it attaches to the drier</li>
            <li> I was hesitant based on other reviews, but this is working great with my Babyliss dryer.</li>
            <li> It was super close</li>
            <li> Because of the way it fits on and is designed, I think it I truly universal and would fit any dryer since the inside kind of adjusts the deeper you put the dryer in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of super cheap plastic, very bendable.</li>
            <li> Fun to try out each of the three fittings.</li>
            <li> My favorite one has the soft fingers that help separate and lift my hair while drying.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with a babyliss blow dryer and it slides right on and diffuses my hair.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product especially if you have wavy hair that needs more curl to it!</li>
            <li> There are 2 other plates that come with it and fit on top of the one unit.  </li>
            <li> It has 3 different heads (very easy to change) that work very well for volume and styling.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 8 months, at that time she dropped it and it shattered.  </li>
            <li> So hot that when I accidently touched it, burned my finger tips and I dropped the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> And she looks hot</li>
            <li> It does heat up, but never too hot to touch,</li>
            <li> This fits my Babyliss 2000 Pro Ceramix Xtreme really well!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also not difficult to get on and off.</li>
            <li> I perfer the Hot Sock Diffuser for the Travel Dryer since it is easier to pack.</li>
            <li> They do pop off from time to time but pops right back on pretty easily.</li>
            <li> There are plastic tabs that hold the diffuser onto barrel of the dryer, and when the dryer gets warm, the plastic must bend back to much, allowing the diffuser to simply slide right</li>
            <li> My very first diffuser when I was 14 lasted no less than 10 years</li>
            <li> Very versatile defuser.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the result in my curly hair after using it</li>
            <li> The whole process takes fewer than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> (can be very hot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It is a universal fit, so it slips onto the tube of your hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Although it says universal fit on the package, it pops out of the hairdryer after 30 seconds of using it.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably more curly and less frizzy when I used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Even though it said it was universally sized, it did not fit my fairly standard-sized dryer.</li>
            <li> This worked very well to give enough air and heat while diffusing the powerful airflow.</li>
            <li> Decent.  </li>
            <li> although I only use it for about 5 - 10 minutes at a time; it&#x27;s possible it could heat up more if used for longer.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is also very lightweight, which I love b/c it doesn&#x27;t add to an already heavy hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a high end blow dryer and no matter what I do</li>
            <li> .this item is not really interchangeable and doesn&#x27;t fit a hair dryer we bought</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a lot to say other than this diffuser works just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is particularly helpful for my naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> The one unit comes with very soft nubs.  </li>
            <li> It is larger than the diffuser that came with my Conair 1875 which at first I did not like.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought the head that came attached was stuck, but it does take a bit of muscle to initially loosen.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how much my old hair dryer was drying my hair out until I bought this new one.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure you put the diffuser all the way down as far as possible on the drier</li>
            <li> The best you can do is use the soft nubs base and mash them against your scalp.  </li>
            <li> so I considered keeping my old diffuser and returning the product.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that I am always battling fuzziness.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it comes with 3 different attachments.</li>
            <li> I prefer the soft finger attachment but</li>
            <li> Plus it doesnt do nearly as well as my standrad diffuser.</li>
            <li> : Push this as far as it will go onto your hair dryer -</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser because I have naturally curly hair and wanted soft curls and no frizz.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it has three different attachments that can be used to diffuse my hair-  </li>
            <li> My blowdryer is an old off-brand that has served me well over the years, but apparently doesn&#x27;t have a diffuser, so rather than buy a whole new setup, I decided to look into universal diffusers.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I had an old Conair that it would fit on - but not worth it for the trouble.</li>
            <li> About the diffuser not being &amp;#34;universal,&amp;#34; the opening where it attaches to the dryer is tight (about 2.5&amp;#34; in diameter) and wouldn&#x27;t fit my larger Conair dryers.</li>
            <li> It is large and requires a hairdryer with a long enough nose.  </li>
            <li> This results in very little frizz, which is easily finished by using a large round brush and the Babyliss Pro BABP2800 2000-Watt Dryer without the diffuser on.</li>
            <li> so I only ever just use the soft pronged one.</li>
            <li> This came with a &amp;#34;soft finger&amp;#34; diffuser, a firm diffuser (I think this is shown in picture here) and a screen to put over the large space just for soft diffused air flow.</li>
            <li> Not only are the holes far too big on this unit, it never seems to hold on my dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a major difference between when I use the different diffuser heads</li>
            <li> Dries my half curly-half straight hair in record time with no frizz.  </li>
            <li> The hard nubs actually extend past the top of the cup, which they do not appear to do in the product pictured.</li>
            <li> It brings three different attachments to put on, softer fingers, firmer fingers and a flat one with a screen.</li>
            <li> Because the diameter is larger I can dry larger sections of hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> - excuse the pun - just a hair larger</li>
            <li> just the flat waffle weave</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, this attachment does not fit on the Conair Pro hair dryer - that hair dryer is too large for the attachment.  </li>
            <li> I constantly kept slipping off my dryer.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s a 10), comb it with a wide tooth comb, and then use a couple of different curl products before blow drying.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, this pops off mid blowdry with my conair 1875 watt tourmaline dryer.</li>
            <li> Now its dry without being frizzy and without looking fried.</li>
            <li> Dry my hair without making it frizzy and encouraging the curl.</li>
            <li> if i blow dry my hair longer than 15-20 mins.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy/curly hair and this diffuser does exactly what i needed it to do.</li>
            <li> When my Babyliss dryer heats up, this Conair Pro CPD05 diffuser falls every single time, and the interchangeable head detaches when it hits the floor.</li>
            <li> The other is just a flat screen.  </li>
            <li> so I typically just use the same one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item less than a year and the inner prong peices the rubber band fits around have melted.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit tight on my dryer initially, but fits and accomplishes my goal of tamed curls!</li>
            <li> (simply slides over the barrel until it fits tightly).  </li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> Does not fit universally.</li>
            <li> made it a lot easier to blow dry my wavy hair with less frizz in the summer.</li>
            <li> At first I considered it could be that we were using it on the wrong hair dryer</li>
            <li> like the twist and lock head attachment system - other diffusers don&#x27;t have that</li>
            <li> I ordered a universal defuser a conair product for a conair blow dryer and it does not fit!(</li>
            <li> It comes with 3 diffusers: one with hard prongs, one with soft prongs and one that&#x27;s like a flat hard screen.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so front heavy that it kept falling off my hair dryer as I was trying to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hard to change the three different diffuser.</li>
            <li> Fits on my hairdryer like a glove and has firm fingers, loose fingers, and one without fingers to style with less frizz.</li>
            <li> but lately my hair has gotten very gross</li>
            <li> have long  thick wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> Fits tightly</li>
            <li> It has a tight grip</li>
            <li> A little bit too tight, it pops off my Conair dryer sometimes.</li>
            <li> My hair dried faster and because their was no blowing my curls have less fuzz.</li>
            <li> This thing jumps off the end of my blow dryer after it warms up a little.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the attachment did not fit my hair dryer</li>
            <li> I read in some reviews that this diffuser did not fit the Conair 1875.  </li>
            <li> Works well but will not fit all conairs</li>
            <li> and it does NOT fit.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well, keeps popping off.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my Babyliss dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a hair dryer before so after watching a few YouTube videos</li>
            <li> should state online that it does not fit EVERY Conair dryer</li>
            <li> Did not fit my hair dryer!</li>
            <li> One has nubs that are hard.  </li>
            <li> Hard to fix it to the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> After using it twice, I threw it in the donation pile table in my apartment complex.</li>
            <li> While waiting for this product I attached my broken diffuser to my hairdryer with duct tape.  </li>
            <li> If anyone else is confused as I was...  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I had to send it back. :(</li>
            <li> I find the hard pronged one too painful to use</li>
            <li> I bunch my hair up into the diffuser and use my fingers to comb out the crazy parts.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fits my Rusk weightless dryer. Lots of options.</li>
            <li> I bought this and my hair dryer actually melted the internals after like the 5th use. Had to spend time to repackage and return. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair so nice and curly. I have natural wave but doesn&#x27;t carry it&#x27;s own good pattern. This gives it one. The curls are more consistant. I use it often in Florida with these humid days..</li>
            <li> It fits well and came with three different type diffuser faces that are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser it dries my hair with amazing curls and the frizz of my hair it keeps under control</li>
            <li> My blowdryer is an old off-brand that has served me well over the years, but apparently doesn&#x27;t have a diffuser, so rather than buy a whole new setup, I decided to look into universal diffusers.  I bought this diffuser based off the comment(s) in the questions section that it would fit a 2 3/8&amp;#34; barrel.  It does not!  It was super close but I couldn&#x27;t get it to accept the nozzle, if it had been - excuse the pun - just a hair larger, I think it would have fit.  The diffuser looked very nice but unfortunately I had to send it back. :(</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  I did not realize how much my old hair dryer was drying my hair out until I bought this new one.  Now its dry without being frizzy and without looking fried.</li>
            <li> So this fits, it just doesn&#x27;t stay on too well, you have to hold it  but it dries my waves nicely.</li>
            <li> Fits on my hairdryer like a glove and has firm fingers, loose fingers, and one without fingers to style with less frizz. This is particularly helpful for my naturally wavy/curly hair. A must have piece for great looking hair.</li>
            <li> This thing jumps off the end of my blow dryer after it warms up a little.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy/curly hair and this diffuser does exactly what i needed it to do. Dry my hair without making it frizzy and encouraging the curl. It brings three different attachments to put on, softer fingers, firmer fingers and a flat one with a screen. It also fits perfectly with my Babylis Pro BABTT5585 dryer.</li>
            <li> great addition to the Babyliss dryer</li>
            <li> Fits the Babyliss Pro 6685 perfectly. Easy to take off, doesn&#x27;t fall off. Very good deal</li>
            <li> Both the Babyliss hair dryer and the diffusers work great. I would definitely recommend them and the seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and daughter.  I have no idea if this works,,,Except for the fact that their hair looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> The one unit comes with very soft nubs.  There are 2 other plates that come with it and fit on top of the one unit.  One has nubs that are hard.  The other is just a flat screen.  Because of the way it fits on and is designed, I think it I truly universal and would fit any dryer since the inside kind of adjusts the deeper you put the dryer in.  I have the Conair Infiniti Pro and it fits perfectly.  I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strive to provide helpful reviews, so if this was helpful/insightful, please &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; it so I know :)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this attachment!  Dries my half curly-half straight hair in record time with no frizz.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, this pops off mid blowdry with my conair 1875 watt tourmaline dryer. I&#x27;ll stick with the one it came with, but if I&#x27;m patient, I&#x27;ll try this again.</li>
            <li> Worked with my dryer and I love that it has three options for diffuser style!! Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Fits blow dryer easily</li>
            <li> When my Babyliss dryer heats up, this Conair Pro CPD05 diffuser falls every single time, and the interchangeable head detaches when it hits the floor. There are plastic tabs that hold the diffuser onto barrel of the dryer, and when the dryer gets warm, the plastic must bend back to much, allowing the diffuser to simply slide right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product!</li>
            <li> Arrived immediately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the attachment did not fit my hair dryer</li>
            <li> I bought this to fit on my Babyliss hair dryer and it does a great job and fits nicely. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser because the diffuser that came with my Conair Ion Shine 1875 broke.  I read in some reviews that this diffuser did not fit the Conair 1875.  It fits my hairdryer securely.  It is large and requires a hairdryer with a long enough nose.  It is larger than the diffuser that came with my Conair 1875 which at first I did not like.  While waiting for this product I attached my broken diffuser to my hairdryer with duct tape.  That was effective so I considered keeping my old diffuser and returning the product.  I am so glad I tried it first.  It is amazing.  I have naturally curly hair that I am always battling fuzziness.  The air is diffused better, creating no blowing.  This made a noticeable difference.  My hair dried faster and because their was no blowing my curls have less fuzz. Because the diameter is larger I can dry larger sections of hair at a time.  My hair drys faster and my curls turn out better.  I believe the combination of a larger drying area and, most importantly, a better job of diffusing the air, is what makes this diffuser a superior product.</li>
            <li> This works well and best of all fits on most hairdryers.</li>
            <li> Not only are the holes far too big on this unit, it never seems to hold on my dryer. This was a recommended accessory when I purchased my Babyliss hair dryer. After using it twice, I threw it in the donation pile table in my apartment complex. Perhaps someone else will have a Conair dryer they could use this for but BEWARE, it was not designed or intended for a Babyliss dryer in any form. Period.</li>
            <li> Fits well, doesn&#x27;t fall off like some reviewers said.  I dont use the diffuser, just the concentrator.  blah blah blah</li>
            <li> I constantly kept slipping off my dryer.  Bad design.</li>
            <li> The diffuser fit the blow dryer I just bought but it pops off several times while drying my hair. The interchangeable head pops off after it hits the floor. It&#x27;s just a hassle. Prefer a blow dryer that has a fitted diffuser.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it comes with 3 different attachments. I have the Babyliss 2800 and it&#x27;s a good fit. They do pop off from time to time but pops right back on pretty easily. I prefer the soft finger attachment but just the flat waffle weave one is great too.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this versitle tool.  However, when I bend over and use it, it tends to fall off my dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser about a month or so ago and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. The prongs of the diffuser are totally warped from the heat of my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Too big and falls off while using.</li>
            <li> Works well but will not fit all conairs</li>
            <li> Even though it said it was universally sized, it did not fit my fairly standard-sized dryer. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this diffuser is just fine on compatible dryers, but I bought it hoping to attach to a Conair 1875 Watt Dual Voltage Folding Handle Hair Dryer and it does NOT fit.</li>
            <li> Does not fit universally. Keeps popping off my hair dryer and when it hits the floor, it comes apart.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Was a bit tight on my dryer initially, but fits and accomplishes my goal of tamed curls!</li>
            <li> Very versatile defuser. Will fit on any hair dryer. I have not had any problems with it falling off while using, just make sure it&#x27;s on snugly.</li>
            <li> I got this a day after i ordered it! fastest shipping i have ever had on anything! it is better than the picture i am soooo happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant based on other reviews, but this is working great with my Babyliss dryer. It comes with 3 diffusers which is also nice.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I needed, and is good quality and works as it should.  My hairdresser recommended one.  Good idea!  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It us just okay. As others have said, it pops off when heated. Does fit on well. That is it</li>
            <li> It fits my blow dryer perfectly and distribute the air uniform...I really like the result in my curly hair after using it</li>
            <li> This came with a &amp;#34;soft finger&amp;#34; diffuser, a firm diffuser (I think this is shown in picture here) and a screen to put over the large space just for soft diffused air flow. I LOVE this. the soft finger diffuser is great for my curly hair and when I want to straighten my hair, I first blow out most of the moisture with the screen cover on. This results in very little frizz, which is easily finished by using a large round brush and the Babyliss Pro BABP2800 2000-Watt Dryer without the diffuser on. They make a great team!</li>
            <li> As far as doing what the diffuser is designed to do this product works amazingly well.  It helps my wife have that spring in her hair that she desires.  The only reason that I am giving it 3 stars is because I have to keep buying them.  The first one lasted about 8 months, at that time she dropped it and it shattered.  However, Prior to dropping it I had already ordered its replacement because all of the tines inside the diffuser had all melted and curled causing a lot of deformity in the shape of the diffuser.  At first I considered it could be that we were using it on the wrong hair dryer but it is the diffuser recommended for her Babyliss hair dryer.  If you like spending $15 every six to eight months then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly on my Babybliss Pro blow dryer and does an awesome job on my curls. I don&#x27;t see a major difference between when I use the different diffuser heads so I typically just use the same one all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair I spary leave in conditioner in it (It&#x27;s a 10), comb it with a wide tooth comb, and then use a couple of different curl products before blow drying. I bunch my hair up into the diffuser and use my fingers to comb out the crazy parts. The whole process takes fewer than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for my old model Revlon hairdryer; it fits easily and securely!&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are awesome for wavy/curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with a babyliss blow dryer and it slides right on and diffuses my hair.  Easy to use and I like that there are three different attachments for the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well, keeps popping off. I do not recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my new Babylyss dryer, BaByliss Pro BABTTW5586 TT Tourmaline Titanium 5000 Dryer. Fits tightly and I love the rubberized fingers on one of the three attachments. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice unit and while I certainly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried in on all types of driers, I would believe it is a universal fit based on the way it attaches to the drier (simply slides over the barrel until it fits tightly).  It has 3 different heads (very easy to change) that work very well for volume and styling.  I have a drier that is very powerful and it was blowing my hair everywhere as I tried to style (very fine hair).  This worked very well to give enough air and heat while diffusing the powerful airflow. It also doesn&#x27;t get too hot like many others I&#x27;ve tried.  Just be sure you put the diffuser all the way down as far as possible on the drier so you don&#x27;t get any airflow out the back (can be very hot!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice unit.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  My hair was noticeably more curly and less frizzy when I used this for the first time.  If you like to scrunch your hair, this works great.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with both my BaByliss Pro BABP6685N Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer and Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer, Red BABTT053T  Although you might not need it with the travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my hair dryer! My dryer was a Conair.</li>
            <li> Attaches perfectly to my hair dryer. thank you for this.  made it a lot easier to blow dry my wavy hair with less frizz in the summer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the Conair diffuser that cups your hair inside, this isn&#x27;t quite it.  The best you can do is use the soft nubs base and mash them against your scalp.  The hard nubs actually extend past the top of the cup, which they do not appear to do in the product pictured.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my Babyliss dryer. Not even close. Did not pay enough for it to send it back. Nice product but can&#x27;t use it. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, this attachment does not fit on the Conair Pro hair dryer - that hair dryer is too large for the attachment.  Luckily, I had an old Conair that it would fit on - but not worth it for the trouble.</li>
            <li> Fits my Rusk Speed Freak dryer and works great.</li>
            <li> Fit my BabyBliss dryer perfectly - easy to take on and off of my dryer. Fun to try out each of the three fittings.</li>
            <li> This diffuser fits very nice on most hairdryers however it gets VERY VERY hot!! So hot that when I accidently touched it, burned my finger tips and I dropped the hair dryer. It&#x27;s made of super cheap plastic, very bendable. I almost feel like it going to melt if i blow dry my hair longer than 15-20 mins. Plus it doesnt do nearly as well as my standrad diffuser.</li>
            <li> Decent.  Bit cheap feeling but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay on keeps popping off... I have a high end blow dryer and no matter what I do it pops off</li>
            <li> fits well on my hairdryer, love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser I have ever purchased. It is a universal fit, so it slips onto the tube of your hair dryer. I switch back and forth between the different heads. My favorite one has the soft fingers that help separate and lift my hair while drying. The screen head is helpful to deliver air without making your hair blow around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the twist and lock head attachment system - other diffusers don&#x27;t have that and the heads would fall off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Push this as far as it will go onto your hair dryer - otherwise it could slip off.</li>
            <li> Thankful to have a diffuser to attach to my babybliss 2000!!  If anyone else is confused as I was...  You squeeze it over the end of your dryer and it will end up staying on :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with the Babyliss Ceramix hair dryer. I was happy to find that it fits on that model hair dryer perfectly. It comes with 3 diffusers: one with hard prongs, one with soft prongs and one that&#x27;s like a flat hard screen. I find the hard pronged one too painful to use so I only ever just use the soft pronged one. It feels good on my head and I can give my scalp mini massages with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have long  thick wavy/curly hair. I&#x27;m used to air drying it but lately my hair has gotten very gross so I wanted to try diffusing it. I&#x27;ve never owned a hair dryer before so after watching a few YouTube videos I gave it a go. I put in a few before products, lots of mousse and some gel and after 20 minutes my hair came out beautiful! It was so full of volume and so many curls!! I actually love my hair now! I was so close to chopping it all off. My hair can last up to 3 days now especially if I rewet it and diffuse it for about 5 min in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product especially if you have wavy hair that needs more curl to it!</li>
            <li> Does not stay on my dryer</li>
            <li> I ordered a universal defuser a conair product for a conair blow dryer and it does not fit!(</li>
            <li> Fit well and does the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser because I have naturally curly hair and wanted soft curls and no frizz.  This diffuser is so front heavy that it kept falling off my hair dryer as I was trying to dry my hair.  I liked the 3-in-1 idea with interchangeable heads, but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I am returning this one and will try a different one.</li>
            <li> .this item is not really interchangeable and doesn&#x27;t fit a hair dryer we bought</li>
            <li> My wife gives this attachment 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This does not stay on my dryer! I even have the same brand (Conair).</li>
            <li> My wife never used one of these before I bought it for her, based on reviews I read, and she actually loves what it does to help her with her hair during the drying process.</li>
            <li> Hard to change the three different diffuser. Hard to fix it to the hair dryer. It&#x27;s possible that with time it won&#x27;t fix anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Babyliss Pr BABTTW5586 TT Tourmaline Titanium 5000 Dryer. It slid off after only one minute of use. It&#x27;s also cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Fits great; used this as a quick replacement for my Remington blowdryer. Did not seem to fall off or loosen. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it, but the wifey says it works. And she looks hot so it must. 3 more words.</li>
            <li> It fits my Babybliss Ceramic Xtreme dryer!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Fits my Babyliss hair dryer perfectly but I imagine it would fit most large size hair dryers.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! Love that it includes 3 interchangeable options!</li>
            <li> should state online that it does not fit EVERY Conair dryer</li>
            <li> Stays put and is light.  Does a great job on my wavy hair.  Give a great deal more volume than just air drying.</li>
            <li> drying in the curls; works great</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit correctly on my Conair hairdryer.  It pops off and hits me in the head.  I have to hold it on.</li>
            <li> Fits well on BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer, BUT too restrictive.  Causes dryer to overheat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a lot to say other than this diffuser works just fine.  You have to put your shoulder into it when you wedge it onto the hair dryer, but once you do, it stays on perfectly while you&#x27;re using it, while still twisting off easily when you&#x27;re done.  It does heat up, but never too hot to touch, although I only use it for about 5 - 10 minutes at a time; it&#x27;s possible it could heat up more if used for longer.</li>
            <li> I bought a baby bliss hair dryer but it didn&#x27;t come with a diffuser. This was recommended to use with this dryer. Fits well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple diffuser attachment and does what it says.  Fits just fine on my dryer and I&#x27;d see it doing the same on any &amp;#34;gun&amp;#34; type of dryer.  Comes with three attachments too.</li>
            <li> Although it says universal fit on the package, it pops out of the hairdryer after 30 seconds of using it. Will return it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like how it has three different attachments that can be used to diffuse my hair-  Easily attaches to my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It fit the BaByliss Pro BABP2800...&lt;br /&gt;Conair.</li>
            <li> A little bit too tight, it pops off my Conair dryer sometimes.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser. Fit my Rusk W8less dryer perfectly!</li>
            <li> Annoying. .Keeps coming off my dryer.  Going back</li>
            <li> This was a knock off. I end up returning it.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Fits perfect in my blowdryer too :)</li>
            <li> This fits my Babyliss 2000 Pro Ceramix Xtreme really well! It has a tight grip and I don&#x27;t feel like it will fall off, but it&#x27;s also not difficult to get on and off. The diffuser is also very lightweight, which I love b/c it doesn&#x27;t add to an already heavy hair dryer. Some may see the weight as flimsy, but my toddler has done his best to destroy the diffuser without success. As for the three heads, I&#x27;ve only used one of them so can&#x27;t give an opinion on the difference between them. At first, I thought the head that came attached was stuck, but it does take a bit of muscle to initially loosen. Once I figured that out it was easy to get it off/on. About the diffuser not being &amp;#34;universal,&amp;#34; the opening where it attaches to the dryer is tight (about 2.5&amp;#34; in diameter) and wouldn&#x27;t fit my larger Conair dryers. Measure your dryer before ordering.</li>
            <li> Fits the Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer perfectly and the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer loosely.  I perfer the Hot Sock Diffuser for the Travel Dryer since it is easier to pack.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item less than a year and the inner prong peices the rubber band fits around have melted.  My very first diffuser when I was 14 lasted no less than 10 years and it was Conair brand.  My, how things have changed.  The rubber band inside the diffuser does not hold.  The diffuser slips off of my hairdryer CONSTANTLY while I&#x27;m drying my hair...pops off, drops to the floor and goes bouncing across the room.  Worthless.</li>
