            <li>I love Balenciaga.</li>
            <li>What I love you may not.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but has staying power.</li>
            <li>but all of the perfumes it lead me to smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is not overly sweet like some of the others in the marketplace.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, arrived as expected!</li>

            <li>Long lasting and sure you&#x27;ll get compliments.</li>
            <li>I had smelt this in sephora and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on it, so after a couple months I found it here and ordered it, still pretty expensive, and I don&#x27;t like how it smells on me, but</li>
            <li>It is ok, but not as distinctive as Rosabotanica and does not last very long on my skin.</li>
            <li>I usually shop Saks, Sephora  or Dillards for perfume, so I&#x27;m so excited to have found this online!</li>
            <li>Been wearing some of same fragrances for years, so this is new for me-but seems like I have always worn it.</li>

            <li> She confirmed it was very weak.  </li>

            <li> definitely not full strength!  </li>
            <li> I wear it just about everyday as my signature scent!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how much less expensive it was here as compared to sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this daily since I ordered it, even when I&#x27;m feeling lazy and it lasts all day without being insanely overbearing.</li>
            <li> When i sprayed the perfume it smelled very weak so, I decided to have a cosmetic rep at Norstrms to compare what I received vs what was in the store.  </li>
            <li> I often purchase base perfume from Dillards, Norstrms.  </li>

            <li> Just want I wanted!!!!!! Perfect &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price for that expensive perfume!!!!</li>
            <li> It is now my &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; fragrance.  It will be my trademark instead of theirs.  Been wearing some of same fragrances for years, so this is new for me-but seems like I have always worn it. Love it.</li>

            <li> Fast Shipping.Great Smell.</li>
            <li> I often purchase base perfume from Dillards, Norstrms.  This time i decided to purchase through Amazon.  When i received the package the inside of the box label was cut out.  When i sprayed the perfume it smelled very weak so, I decided to have a cosmetic rep at Norstrms to compare what I received vs what was in the store.  She confirmed it was very weak.  I called Amazon to return the product,  but since is was considered flammable it couldn&#x27;t be returned.  Amazon refunded my credit card.  The product could have been an old sample, but not sure.</li>
            <li> Just as announced and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The most gorgeous scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to order Rosabotanica and made a mistake ordering this one. It is ok, but not as distinctive as Rosabotanica and does not last very long on my skin. Some people compared it to a Rose perfume by Hermes or Guerlain,  well, I&#x27;d rather buy the real thing from these perfumers.</li>
            <li> make you feel  like a sexy Goddess</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve fell in love with this when I got a sample of this from Sephora. Once I put it on, all my guy friends and even my brother fell in love with it. They wonder if there was a male version of this perfume! HELLO! Totally a guy magnet.</li>
            <li> I had smelt this in sephora and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on it, so after a couple months I found it here and ordered it, still pretty expensive, and I don&#x27;t like how it smells on me, but it deffintaly is a pretty/different smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume and have received many compliments. It&#x27;s light but has staying power.</li>

            <li> definitely not full strength!  you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Perfume is subjective. What I love you may not. So I will review the price and bottle.  Best price I have found on the web.  Also extremely fresh and would buy again.  In fact, I did.  Nice big bottle.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly as expected. I had gone to sephora and taken their little perfume personality test, which I normally would have thought was total garbage but all of the perfumes it lead me to smelled fantastic.
