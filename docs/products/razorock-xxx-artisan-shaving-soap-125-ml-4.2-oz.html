            <li>Another nice soap from RR.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Great price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Easy to load your brush and good cushion for the blade to slide across your face.</li>
            <li>Very easy to lather and love the scent.</li>
            <li>Once I was VERY comfortable with the feather (havent seen a nick in months)</li>
            <li>Smells amazing easy to lather.</li>
            <li>I well be buying more</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Warning, this product is an artisan soap packaged and sold by Razorock, so It will eventually be discontinued intermittently as it has in 2011 and 2013, so If you like it, buy two or more.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that, as an artisan soap, the price can fluctuate much more than say Barbasol &amp;#34;goo in a can&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Just want to say if u are thinking of buying it don&#x27;t think anymore just buy it because you will love it.</li>
            <li>I get better slickness and protection with my cheapest soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try it again later as I get board of my rotation because I do like the scent, but I&#x27;ll make sure to have my best aftershave on hand.   </li>
            <li>Recently bought the tuscan oud which smells incredible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this soap.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrant smell and lathers well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff, Luv it!</li>
            <li>If this describes you, I can confidently say you&#x27;ll love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thoroughly enjoyed this product it was more than promised.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you are maybe into more feminate items you might disagree.</li>
            <li>As far as a smooth awesome shave it does the job</li>
            <li>This is a top performing soap.</li>
            <li>I like the P160 scent better..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using more water</li>
            <li>Not bad...there are better options out there in this price range (try WSP).</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may perhaps find better performers out there (depending on your preferences, of course), but I think there&#x27;s a place for this soap in most shave dens.</li>
            <li>but just ok to me.  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Needs more slickness during shave.</li>
            <li>, slickness is decent but to be honest with you guys if the scent is not there you&#x27;ve lost me already, I know that may not be fair</li>
            <li>The lather is great, it&#x27;s slick and again, it smells incredible awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to build a pretty good lather</li>
            <li>This makes a great shave and great thick, hot lather that remains perfect thru all three passes with my straight.</li>
            <li>As I go thru my wet shaving soaps I find the best soaps are from overseas.</li>
            <li>This is a soft soap with a great scent also.</li>
            <li>Great soap, great price, and hard to find.</li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t easy to describe, but I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s citrusy without being fruity.</li>
            <li>Lathers easily.</li>
            <li>Not overly strong to offend.</li>
            <li>I tried this a while ago with my DE for some reason and decided it was fine</li>
            <li>I fine this soap lack protection</li>
            <li>great shave and all but hard to get a good lather from this</li>
            <li>Great scent (similar to Barbasol but nicer).</li>
            <li>Huge thanks to the guys at RazoRock for making such an great product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>This soap ranks as number 3 in my shave den with Catie&#x27;s Bubbles being the best, Proraso Green in number 2 and this one in number 3.</li>
            <li>This has a great italian scent.  </li>
            <li>If you see it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li>Hope it is always available.</li>
            <li>But it is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy this soap.  </li>
            <li>Right now this is my favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is not strong and I would prefer that it was stronger, but over-all face feel is excellent.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d better get you a tub because this goes fast!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 6 different soaps and 2-3 creams and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This smells great, fresh and citrusy, and lathers well, the tallow makes this nice and slick.</li>
            <li>I almost gave it 3 stars because it does smell nice, but it was easily my most irritated shave in a long time.</li>
            <li>Very easy to lather, strong and distinct scent with light citrus tone, very slick, and (for me) good post shave face feel.</li>
            <li>downside is that after I purchased this cologne, I had less of a reason to use this excellent soap as I have other excellent soaps with different scents.</li>
            <li>The soap is quite soft, somewhere between a soap and a cream, it lathers fairly well, but is really nothing special.</li>
            <li>Super on the skin</li>
            <li>For 10.99, there are far better soaps available.</li>
            <li>Slick, protective, easy to lather, and with a great scent to boot.</li>
            <li>, I know it is very popular with other people...</li>
            <li>Let me point out however that my shave den is isn&#x27;t a full grown den yet, so take it for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I have used it with my silver tip and pure badger finding a better result from the stiffer brush because I can load the brush from the container and whip it in my hot scuttle.</li>
            <li>If your to get it for $10 its well worth it.</li>
            <li>For the price, there are better soaps by far.</li>
            <li>I feel this is a pretty good purchase for a beginner in the world of wet shaving.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like a food that tastes good but smells bad lol</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and builds to a nice slick lather even with hard water.  </li>
            <li>It may be a different case for most people, but I use an Omega Pro 48</li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>Scent is a big deal for me so why use a soap that smells like one of my favorite colognes?</li>
            <li>Solid scent (I know others love it)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really enjoy the old barber shop smell.</li>
            <li>Purchased this as my first ever shave soap.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up very easily on my face using the dry brush method.  </li>
            <li>Leaves much to be desired, the load up with a brush is fairly effortless but the scent is a let down</li>
            <li>It smells like an immigrant taxi driver; not sophisticated or pleasant, but just overpoweringly ethnic.</li>
            <li>The scent is similar to AdP Colonia, it loads very easily and produces a nice slick lather.</li>
            <li>The smell is nothing like a barbershop the average &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; visits or any cologne the average &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; wears.. Buy this for an awesome shave not to smell like a modern straight man.</li>
            <li>Proraso red or green, for example, will last longer, provide more cushion, better slickness, and a better scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice, subtle, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Revisited this a few months ago and it has become my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>Still looking for a great less expensive shave cream/soap that smells equally good.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the soap</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>With this soap, I had never seen so much blood from shaving.</li>
            <li>Too much for a styptic to handle.</li>
            <li>Protects the skin from burn very well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Lathers well and is nice and slick.  </li>
            <li>Nice slick lather</li>
            <li>Lather is slick and abundant..</li>
            <li>Decent smell, like soap.</li>
            <li>still highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly and highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>With that said, I love the scent of this soap although I wish it was a little stronger on the face than in the jar.</li>
            <li>Clean crisp with a slight citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>and it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Heavenly citrus &amp; floral, yet masculine, classic barber shop scent.  </li>
            <li>Post shave is also very nice, although can be a little on the dry side, so definitely follow up with some witch hazel and post shave balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and none can match the slickness and cushion this lather provides.</li>
            <li>RazoRock&#x27;s XXX beats out my prior favorite, Proraso green.</li>
            <li>but it lathers extremely easy and is incredibly slick.</li>
            <li>Lathering as easy as creams, but slick like soaps...</li>
            <li>If you like an easy lathering slick soap this is the one.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to load the brush up and makes a thick lather.</li>
            <li>My first soap was Col. Conk lime simply because I could get so much for so little, but I can now see why.</li>
            <li>This is an Italian soft soap.  </li>
            <li>The hype behind this product is as abundant as &#x27;50 Shades of Grey&#x27;, the difference is that this product lives up to it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try it again later as I get board of my rotation because I do like the scent, but I&#x27;ll make sure to have my best aftershave on hand.   </li>
            <li> Recently bought the tuscan oud which smells incredible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this soap.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrant smell and lathers well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, Luv it!</li>
            <li> If this describes you, I can confidently say you&#x27;ll love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this product it was more than promised.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you are maybe into more feminate items you might disagree.</li>
            <li> As far as a smooth awesome shave it does the job</li>
            <li> This is a top performing soap.</li>
            <li> I like the P160 scent better..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using more water</li>
            <li> Not bad...there are better options out there in this price range (try WSP).</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may perhaps find better performers out there (depending on your preferences, of course), but I think there&#x27;s a place for this soap in most shave dens.</li>
            <li> but just ok to me.  </li>
            <li> and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Needs more slickness during shave.</li>
            <li> , slickness is decent but to be honest with you guys if the scent is not there you&#x27;ve lost me already, I know that may not be fair</li>
            <li> The lather is great, it&#x27;s slick and again, it smells incredible awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to build a pretty good lather</li>
            <li> This makes a great shave and great thick, hot lather that remains perfect thru all three passes with my straight.</li>
            <li> As I go thru my wet shaving soaps I find the best soaps are from overseas.</li>
            <li> This is a soft soap with a great scent also.</li>
            <li> Great soap, great price, and hard to find.</li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t easy to describe, but I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s citrusy without being fruity.</li>
            <li> Lathers easily.</li>
            <li> Not overly strong to offend.</li>
            <li> I tried this a while ago with my DE for some reason and decided it was fine</li>
            <li> I fine this soap lack protection</li>
            <li> great shave and all but hard to get a good lather from this</li>
            <li> Great scent (similar to Barbasol but nicer).</li>
            <li> Huge thanks to the guys at RazoRock for making such an great product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> This soap ranks as number 3 in my shave den with Catie&#x27;s Bubbles being the best, Proraso Green in number 2 and this one in number 3.</li>
            <li> This has a great italian scent.  </li>
            <li> If you see it&#x27;s available</li>
            <li> Hope it is always available.</li>
            <li> But it is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy this soap.  </li>
            <li> Right now this is my favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong and I would prefer that it was stronger, but over-all face feel is excellent.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d better get you a tub because this goes fast!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 6 different soaps and 2-3 creams and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This smells great, fresh and citrusy, and lathers well, the tallow makes this nice and slick.</li>
            <li> I almost gave it 3 stars because it does smell nice, but it was easily my most irritated shave in a long time.</li>
            <li> Very easy to lather, strong and distinct scent with light citrus tone, very slick, and (for me) good post shave face feel.</li>
            <li> downside is that after I purchased this cologne, I had less of a reason to use this excellent soap as I have other excellent soaps with different scents.</li>
            <li> The soap is quite soft, somewhere between a soap and a cream, it lathers fairly well, but is really nothing special.</li>
            <li> Super on the skin</li>
            <li> For 10.99, there are far better soaps available.</li>
            <li> Slick, protective, easy to lather, and with a great scent to boot.</li>
            <li> , I know it is very popular with other people...</li>
            <li> Let me point out however that my shave den is isn&#x27;t a full grown den yet, so take it for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I have used it with my silver tip and pure badger finding a better result from the stiffer brush because I can load the brush from the container and whip it in my hot scuttle.</li>
            <li> If your to get it for $10 its well worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price, there are better soaps by far.</li>
            <li> I feel this is a pretty good purchase for a beginner in the world of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like a food that tastes good but smells bad lol</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and builds to a nice slick lather even with hard water.  </li>
            <li> It may be a different case for most people, but I use an Omega Pro 48</li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> Scent is a big deal for me so why use a soap that smells like one of my favorite colognes?</li>
            <li> Solid scent (I know others love it)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really enjoy the old barber shop smell.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as my first ever shave soap.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up very easily on my face using the dry brush method.  </li>
            <li> Leaves much to be desired, the load up with a brush is fairly effortless but the scent is a let down</li>
            <li> It smells like an immigrant taxi driver; not sophisticated or pleasant, but just overpoweringly ethnic.</li>
            <li> The scent is similar to AdP Colonia, it loads very easily and produces a nice slick lather.</li>
            <li> The smell is nothing like a barbershop the average &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; visits or any cologne the average &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; wears.. Buy this for an awesome shave not to smell like a modern straight man.</li>
            <li> Proraso red or green, for example, will last longer, provide more cushion, better slickness, and a better scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice, subtle, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Revisited this a few months ago and it has become my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> Still looking for a great less expensive shave cream/soap that smells equally good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the soap</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> With this soap, I had never seen so much blood from shaving.</li>
            <li> Too much for a styptic to handle.</li>
            <li> Protects the skin from burn very well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  </li>
            <li> Lathers very well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Lathers well and is nice and slick.  </li>
            <li> Nice slick lather</li>
            <li> Lather is slick and abundant..</li>
            <li> Decent smell, like soap.</li>
            <li> still highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> With that said, I love the scent of this soap although I wish it was a little stronger on the face than in the jar.</li>
            <li> Clean crisp with a slight citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> and it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Heavenly citrus &amp; floral, yet masculine, classic barber shop scent.  </li>
            <li> Post shave is also very nice, although can be a little on the dry side, so definitely follow up with some witch hazel and post shave balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and none can match the slickness and cushion this lather provides.</li>
            <li> RazoRock&#x27;s XXX beats out my prior favorite, Proraso green.</li>
            <li> but it lathers extremely easy and is incredibly slick.</li>
            <li> Lathering as easy as creams, but slick like soaps...</li>
            <li> If you like an easy lathering slick soap this is the one.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to load the brush up and makes a thick lather.</li>
            <li> My first soap was Col. Conk lime simply because I could get so much for so little, but I can now see why.</li>
            <li> This is an Italian soft soap.  </li>
            <li> The hype behind this product is as abundant as &#x27;50 Shades of Grey&#x27;, the difference is that this product lives up to it.</li>
            <li> Very masculine, slightly citrus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I was running through a puck almost every month an a half, but this has lasted me two months so far</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the price tag for the amount of soap as well as its soft nature, but I can tell you that it&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> I had at least 5or 6 large nicks.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty skinny guy with defined facial features that can be tough to get around and have a coarse thick beard with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling dry post shave.</li>
            <li> Solid soap not worth the hype though</li>
            <li> It lathers well and provides an above average cushion and glide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather play with different scents to make my shaving experience less monotone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about 2-3 years and have tried tons of soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap to anyone who is wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I do not get any nicks or razor burn with my Merkur R41 or my other less agressive razors when using this soap.</li>
            <li> soap was one responsible party of my slippery slope path to expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> If it were half the price I&#x27;d say get it.</li>
            <li> Not a good citrus smell, but a soap smell.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to add water.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with XXX!!</li>
            <li> Well, very disappointed with all the hype out there.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great performing soap. I really wanted the soap and I overpaid for it since it was sold out everywhere else. If your to get it for $10 its well worth it. Don&#x27;t over pay like I did!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! The scent is not strong and I would prefer that it was stronger, but over-all face feel is excellent. Post shave is also very nice, although can be a little on the dry side, so definitely follow up with some witch hazel and post shave balm.</li>
            <li> Solid soap not worth the hype though</li>
            <li> The product is great, but I got ripped off on the price. I paid $16.59 and could have bought it elsewhere for $9.99</li>
            <li> It is a Great soap, but it burns my face, I guess the problem is my skin, not the soap, but it is a shame since I was extremely happy to get my hands in this soap.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap! Very easy to lather and love the scent.</li>
            <li> Great product.....I well be buying more</li>
            <li> As I go thru my wet shaving soaps I find the best soaps are from overseas. This is one of them. Great lather, fragrance is marvolous and not over powering. I have used it with my silver tip and pure badger finding a better result from the stiffer brush because I can load the brush from the container and whip it in my hot scuttle. This makes a great shave and great thick, hot lather that remains perfect thru all three passes with my straight. Great price, quick shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Another excellent RazoRock tallow-based soap! Very easy to lather, strong and distinct scent with light citrus tone, very slick, and (for me) good post shave face feel. Recommended!</li>
            <li> This smells great, fresh and citrusy, and lathers well, the tallow makes this nice and slick. Easy to load your brush and good cushion for the blade to slide across your face.</li>
            <li> The hype behind this product is as abundant as &#x27;50 Shades of Grey&#x27;, the difference is that this product lives up to it. I was skeptical of the price tag for the amount of soap as well as its soft nature, but I can tell you that it&#x27;s 100% worth it. You only need to rub the soap 5-6 times and you can lather your face 2.5 times over. It may be a different case for most people, but I use an Omega Pro 48 so 5-6 is all I need. My first soap was Col. Conk lime simply because I could get so much for so little, but I can now see why. Using an Omega 48 on a bloomed Col Conk puck still requires a solid thirty seconds to build up a useable lather that would need to be repeated for the second pass and cleanup. I was running through a puck almost every month an a half, but this has lasted me two months so far and I think it&#x27;s still got another month or so to go. As for the scent, it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve ever smelled before, but truly wonderful. I&#x27;ll be picking up the XXX Aftershave for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Warning, this product is an artisan soap packaged and sold by Razorock, so It will eventually be discontinued intermittently as it has in 2011 and 2013, so If you like it, buy two or more. Personally, I keep 3 tubs stocked. If there&#x27;s none left here you can find it on Italianbarber.com for a potentially cheaper price. I should also mention that, as an artisan soap, the price can fluctuate much more than say Barbasol &amp;#34;goo in a can&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great lather and slickness give a nice shave</li>
            <li> Simply a great soap. Great scent (similar to Barbasol but nicer). It&#x27;ll speak for itself when you try it. Huge thanks to the guys at RazoRock for making such an great product at an affordable price! Keep it up!</li>
            <li> Just want to say if u are thinking of buying it don&#x27;t think anymore just buy it because you will love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shaving soaps!!! It&#x27;s got great protection, easy to lather, wonderful sent, and slickness!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with XXX!! I just got a second one cuz I didn&#x27;t ever want to run out!! This stuff is Awesome!!! Buy Buy Buy!</li>
            <li> Quality product.  nice, subtle, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Its a nice soap. But did not give me the slickness i like</li>
            <li> Great shave soap. Smells amazing easy to lather. Nice protection and slickness.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about 2-3 years and have tried tons of soaps and creams. Started with de and about 6-12 months ago switched to the feather shavette. I tried this a while ago with my DE for some reason and decided it was fine but nothing to write home about. Once I was VERY comfortable with the feather (havent seen a nick in months) I decided to retry this soap. With this soap, I had never seen so much blood from shaving. Too much for a styptic to handle. I had at least 5or 6 large nicks. I get better slickness and protection with my cheapest soaps and creams. I almost gave it 3 stars because it does smell nice, but it was easily my most irritated shave in a long time. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try it again later as I get board of my rotation because I do like the scent, but I&#x27;ll make sure to have my best aftershave on hand.   Update: Revisited this a few months ago and it has become my absolute favorite! Dont know what happened before but it lathers extremely easy and is incredibly slick. Recently bought the tuscan oud which smells incredible!</li>
            <li> Good product with great smell. Prefer Cella</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this soap. It has a nice light fragrant smell and lathers well.</li>
            <li> This does not hold a candle to the classic!&lt;br /&gt;Why, I ask???&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather as well and does not have the almond smell.</li>
            <li> Great soap, excellent protection and scent</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, Luv it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers beautifully and provides great protection can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> Very nice shave soap.  Lathers well and lubricates well.</li>
            <li> Best shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used. . I am a pretty skinny guy with defined facial features that can be tough to get around and have a coarse thick beard with sensitive skin. If this describes you, I can confidently say you&#x27;ll love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 6 different soaps and 2-3 creams and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used prorasso, the art of shaving sandelwood, and this is still slicker and prevents me from getting nicks and cuts. I use an EJ DE89 with persona and feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;YouTube reviews on this stuff. Everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is easy to load the brush up and makes a thick lather. Protects the skin from burn very well</li>
            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed this product it was more than promised. I will definitely continue to use this brand into the future</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and builds to a nice slick lather even with hard water.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great Soap!!!!  Lathers well and is nice and slick.  I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap. Smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it smells horrible. Perhaps if you are maybe into more feminate items you might disagree. As far as a smooth awesome shave it does the job well. The smell is nothing like a barbershop the average &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; visits or any cologne the average &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; wears.. Buy this for an awesome shave not to smell like a modern straight man.</li>
            <li> great shave and all but hard to get a good lather from this</li>
            <li> Best shaving soap I have tried.  Super on the skin and I use a double edged razor which just glides.</li>
            <li> Great soap with a very rich lather.  Lathers up very easily on my face using the dry brush method.  First time using it I got the closest shave I have ever gotten.  I recommend this soap to anyone who is wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a top performing soap.</li>
            <li> Really good, but pricey.... Lathering as easy as creams, but slick like soaps... Best of both worlds... .. I like the P160 scent better..</li>
            <li> It smells great and it&#x27;s true. It smells a lot like Acqua di Parma Colonia (yes, I later owned this perfume as well).&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that after I purchased this cologne, I had less of a reason to use this excellent soap as I have other excellent soaps with different scents. Scent is a big deal for me so why use a soap that smells like one of my favorite colognes? I&#x27;d rather play with different scents to make my shaving experience less monotone.&lt;br /&gt;I still highly recommend this soap. The lather is great, it&#x27;s slick and again, it smells incredible awesome.&lt;br /&gt;This soap was one responsible party of my slippery slope path to expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> Decent smell, like soap. Not overly strong to offend. Nice slick lather and it is nice and thick. It will protect your face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather very well.  I&#x27;ve tried using more water and it just doesn&#x27;t lather well in a bowl.  My tobs stuff is awesome, I got this for some variance.  will not be reordering it.</li>
            <li> This soap ranks as number 3 in my shave den with Catie&#x27;s Bubbles being the best, Proraso Green in number 2 and this one in number 3. Let me point out however that my shave den is isn&#x27;t a full grown den yet, so take it for what it&#x27;s worth. With that said, I love the scent of this soap although I wish it was a little stronger on the face than in the jar. It lathers well and provides an above average cushion and glide. A great soap to have and use. I use it weekly and highly recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> If you like an easy lathering slick soap this is the one.  I like soaps that have a great scent. This has a great italian scent.  Makes me want to put a suit and tie on before walking out the door.  If you see it&#x27;s available you&#x27;d better get you a tub because this goes fast!  A MUST FOR EVERY SHAVING DEN!  I just ordered me the matching aftershave splash from italianbarber.com.  Can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Gives me a very close shave, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Heavenly citrus &amp; floral, yet masculine, classic barber shop scent.  It doesn&#x27;t linger, though, so it won&#x27;t clash with your cologne.  I&#x27;ve gone through 2 pucks, so I think I can provide a valid impression. This is one of the slickest, protective, shave soaps I&#x27;ve used.  RazoRock&#x27;s XXX beats out my prior favorite, Proraso green. This is an Italian soft soap.  Some folks call it &amp;#34;croap&amp;#34; (cream and soap hybrid).</li>
            <li> great product! great scent! great shave!!</li>
            <li> loved it very good soap</li>
            <li> Not bad...there are better options out there in this price range (try WSP).</li>
            <li> Wonderful citrusy scent and produced great lather. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave soap.  Smells great, provides really good cushion and glide.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Slick, protective, easy to lather, and with a great scent to boot. Scent isn&#x27;t easy to describe, but I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s citrusy without being fruity. I open it up and smell it every time I go into the bathroom. It makes me wish that it was edible. :-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may perhaps find better performers out there (depending on your preferences, of course), but I think there&#x27;s a place for this soap in most shave dens.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff!  Smells amazing!  Smoothest shave ever!</li>
            <li> Te best soap. Period.</li>
            <li> Leaves much to be desired, the load up with a brush is fairly effortless but the scent is a let down, slickness is decent but to be honest with you guys if the scent is not there you&#x27;ve lost me already, I know that may not be fair but that&#x27;s how I feel, it&#x27;s like a food that tastes good but smells bad lol</li>
            <li> Like whipped butter for the face and smells terrific!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap that does it all!! Will order more! One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Perfect cream. Hope it is always available. Smells no different than soap which means it&#x27;s rather neutral once rinsed.  It is a rather thirsty soap.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to add water.  But it is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Solid scent (I know others love it) but just ok to me.  Easy to lather and great protection.  It&#x27;s all personal taste on the scent, I know it is very popular with other people...it is a very good soap though.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and I love the scent. Very masculine, slightly citrus.</li>
            <li> For the price, there are better soaps by far. Proraso red or green, for example, will last longer, provide more cushion, better slickness, and a better scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RazorRock soaps are intended to be affordable alternatives to some of the pricey shaving soaps shave geeks like myself buy. The scent of this XXX is an Acqua di Parma Colonia knockoff. The soap is quite soft, somewhere between a soap and a cream, it lathers fairly well, but is really nothing special. It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s not great. If it were half the price I&#x27;d say get it. For 10.99, there are far better soaps available.</li>
            <li> Good soap, but hyper allergenic. Even after taking a shower and washing my face with shower soap, I could still smell the shaving soap on my face. Not a good citrus smell, but a soap smell. Unless you like a persistent soap smell, avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this will be my one and only shaving soap. Well, very disappointed with all the hype out there. I fine this soap lack protection and I don&#x27;t really enjoy the old barber shop smell. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great soap, great price, and hard to find. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as my first ever shave soap.  I&#x27;m still learning how to build a pretty good lather but I really enjoy this soap.  The smell is pretty awesome, the slickness is just as good, and the post shave is rather nice.  I feel this is a pretty good purchase for a beginner in the world of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Oh my god this stuff smells great and applies great. I think RazorRock has a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Right now this is my favorite shaving soap. I&#x27;ve tried all the Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and none can match the slickness and cushion this lather provides. Although ToOBS has some great scents, I find they lack the performance of this lather. This is a soft soap with a great scent also. I do not get any nicks or razor burn with my Merkur R41 or my other less agressive razors when using this soap. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on recommendations, but it&#x27;s not my choice in fragrance.  I prefer Dreadnaught Shaving Cream which is a bit pricier.  Still looking for a great less expensive shave cream/soap that smells equally good.</li>
            <li> great soap and smell awesome... Lather is slick and abundant..Thanks</li>
            <li> Lathers easily. Leaves face feeling dry post shave. Needs more slickness during shave.</li>
            <li> Another nice soap from RR. Clean crisp with a slight citrusy scent. Performs well.</li>
            <li> Smells good...not as protective as the Mitchell&#x27;s wool fat shave soap. I mix them now works great, best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s the best artisan shave soap  right now in the market buy it.try it. Ul know why</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaving soap (croap). The scent is similar to AdP Colonia, it loads very easily and produces a nice slick lather. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I second the quality of all the RazoRock soaps. It&#x27;s second-to-none. But this fragrance doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It smells like an immigrant taxi driver; not sophisticated or pleasant, but just overpoweringly ethnic.</li>
