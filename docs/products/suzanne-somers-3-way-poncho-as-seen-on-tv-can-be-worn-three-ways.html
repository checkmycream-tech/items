            <li>Will be great for this spring and summer since it&#x27;s light and flowy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a really nice shirt to wear with a pair of leggings.</li>
            <li>even on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The material was kind of flimsy too.</li>
            <li>but it drapes nicely.  </li>
            <li>It’s a good top for the price.</li>

            <li>look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li>delivered very quick poncho very cute nice fabric</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Amazon is an amazing company and do things quickly and inform you of every transaction and move they have made!  </li>
            <li>and I could fit TWO of me in this thing!</li>
            <li>Suzanne Somers can&#x27;t do better then this?  </li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t tell the top from the bottom.  </li>
            <li>If you are frumpy then it&#x27;ll make you look even more frumpy.  </li>
            <li>I knew my mom would love it---</li>
            <li>With the 3 way poncho as you can see through the pics I posted she not only loved the look but said it felt great against her</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many ways to wear it, and though I photographed her in 3 of those ways, you can see its versatility and the way it flows over her</li>
            <li>Once they try it on, they are going to want more than one.</li>
            <li>I received this product free in exchange for an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 way poncho .</li>
            <li>However, even with those downfalls I genuinely love this item of clothing.</li>
            <li>I had a coupon and CVS Rewards Bucks which is how I was able to get mine for $10. )</li>
            <li>Unless you are an exhibitionist, you will need to wear a tank top or shell underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit</li>
            <li>you might show more than cleavage.....</li>
            <li>It is what it is ... a $20 top from an infomercial ...</li>
            <li>Top came ripped.</li>
            <li>No matter how I attempt to style it, it&#x27;s nothing more than a tent that hangs in unflattering folds.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I was going to love it,</li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I wear a 2X top</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Suzanne Somers can well afford to use a better, higher-quality knit fabric, no matter what her target market.</li>
            <li>and I love it.....</li>
            <li>Is this the perfect top to wear outside (with no coat) in the cooler weather?</li>
            <li>favorite way of wearing it was to have the neck draped, with a cami underneath for additional coverage.</li>
            <li>Trick is to wear something \\&quot;slim\\&quot; fitting under it.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t think it is appropriately priced.</li>
            <li>I love this top and can&#x27;t always find the size I want.</li>
            <li>I love the material.</li>
            <li>I wear a size 22 or a 2x top.  </li>
            <li>like it and will probably purchase one more</li>
            <li>but all in all this is a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I like this easy, go-to garment and wish they had more colors/sizes available!</li>
            <li>I love the way the arms fit and the way the bottom flows out.</li>
            <li>The arms fit me perfectly, and I like how the material drapes into a long tunic and covers my  tummy.</li>
            <li>It gets wrinkled easily and looks like an inexpensive polyester material from a discount store.</li>
            <li>For an over sized basic top it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>and I doubt if I would ever wear it off the shoulders, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that this top would fit up to a 5X.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super-soft and maybe the possible ways to wear it are not as diverse as touted, but accept it for the attractive design it does have, and you&#x27;ll want more than one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special but it is extremely cute.</li>
            <li>Would be cool if they came out with more colors or maybe even patterns.</li>
            <li>It washed just fine.</li>
            <li>It is so huge.  </li>
            <li>Im not some huge Woman.</li>
            <li>I saw it was available for sizes up to 3X</li>
            <li>Cheap material.</li>
            <li>Its really light weight</li>
            <li>The fabric felt so cheap and when I did put this thing on, well it definitly looks like wearing a potatoe sack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous to just throw on over skinny jeans or leggings without any thought, but you can dress it up with jewelry.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>It also smells like cheap material.. chemicals.</li>
            <li>I was glad I didn&#x27;t spend very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is excited about it, and that makes it something that she will talk about with her friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A Donna Karan original?</li>
            <li>but I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>To be fair, I lost weight in my shoulders and upper arms and a lot of tops seem to fit me that way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get ready to have this become a favorite for that special lady in your life.</li>
            <li>I got my credit and my lower price and the right size and my return sticker came quickly!  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to really pull off the off the shoulder or dress look</li>
            <li>cool material.</li>
            <li>I really like this top.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;hood&#x27; is really just a cowl neck and not ample enough to go over your head, but it drapes very nicely around the neck.  </li>
            <li>The material is very comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>: The top works fine in the cowl style, but when I try the off the shoulder or one shoulder look, once I get to moving around the cowl rolls back up.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I really love wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received the product mentioned above for free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>Some of these reviews make me laugh.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a comfortable stylish versatile and effortless</li>
            <li>and it makes a nice cowl neck similar to what it is supposed to look like.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>Right now I am a size 10.</li>
            <li>The top is OK but not worth $20-$30, as I have seen it advertised for.</li>
            <li>This is meant for very large sizes.  </li>
            <li>Looks best over tight jeans with big earrings.</li>
            <li>The neckline is so big that it does fit comfortably over my head as a hood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>While this is a loose and easily draped poncho, it is a really cheap fabric.</li>
            <li>I am a 1X and the XL-3XL size is very big on me, but I am OK with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had none of the issues others mentioned, and I was concerned as I wear 14/16 (and am &amp;#34;Rubenesque&amp;#34;) and received S-L size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it covers any belly bulges without making you look fat; you can eat whatever you want during the course of the night, because it drapes no nicely...</li>
            <li>I have the Mocha one on order and will be interested to see how it turns out in that regard.  </li>
            <li>At work I fold the cowl neck over and pin it with a pretty pin for colder weather, or pin it and wear it with a pretty scarf.</li>
            <li>It does gradually become wider towards the bottom of the poncho which makes your body appear shapeless but this can easily be remedied with a cute and chic waist belt.</li>
            <li>I really thought I would love this, but it wrinkles constantly!  </li>
            <li>The fabric is REALLY soft, and reminded me of my favorite old t-shirts.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised that the top fit me extremely well</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local pharmacy so that I&#x27;d have the option to return it easily, but I kept it.  </li>
            <li>No matter what size you are DO NOT buy the large one.  </li>
            <li>It is super soft and comfy though, so I&#x27;ll be exchanging it for the regular fit if I can find one.</li>
            <li>I got a bigger size and it was huge on me</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Looks absolutely nothing like the picture while wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to fit big and</li>
            <li>I like it came very wrinkled still waiting for it to hang out</li>
            <li>It appeared much shorter when I removed from package.</li>
            <li>well, it&#x27;s cheap enough, and perhaps can use over a bathing suit.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to fit big.  </li>
            <li>Did not have any stability in the cloth, very flimsy and was shipped very wrinkly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight, stretchy and flexible type of fabric.</li>
            <li>very versatile.  </li>
            <li>Mine also came with a whole on the arm sleeve.</li>
            <li>very wrinkled washed</li>
            <li>I feel this top will look good on thin or heavier women, both short and tall.  </li>
            <li>It hangs to almost my knees and when I wear it off one shoulder, the entire shirt sleeve slips right off my hand and my whole arm is exposed, not to mention my boob!</li>
            <li>I have the black color wish they would make more colors.</li>
            <li>I got the poncho top in black and taupe.  </li>
            <li>The Black top was $19.99</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the models in the picture are wearing the larger size and not the smaller.</li>
            <li>This is a decent quality item.</li>
            <li>and it fit me loosely and went beyond my butt</li>
            <li>Many people mentioned that the sleeves are tight but I never noticed this</li>
            <li>Many people mentioned the sleeves are too tight, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem.  </li>
            <li>: The fit is very loose.</li>
            <li>I normally wear 8-10 which would be their S-L size.</li>
            <li>They offered them in different colors: grey, blue and red for a reduced price, but I didn&#x27;t buy them because I wasn&#x27;t sure how they would fit..</li>
            <li>If you are larger, like a 3x it will look like a loose fitting tee Instead of</li>
            <li>When I first put this on, the neckline was so low, it showed my bra.</li>
            <li>In store I&#x27;ve seen black available.</li>
            <li>But on a positive note, if it starts to rain the cowl can be pulled over the back of the head like a hoodie.</li>
            <li>It is not stretchy, but is soft floppy material...something you might consider wearing to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>and the whole left sleeve is falling apart!  </li>
            <li>Not from the infomercial or directly from the manufacturer</li>
            <li>It is not clingy, and would be very accommodating for different shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get control over that WILD neckline and a lot of compliments, too.</li>
            <li>I bought the XL - 3X directly from the site.</li>
            <li>About me: I wear a size 22/24 generally in tops, and am quite busty.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve read several horror stories from people who bought direct).  </li>
            <li>She is a full-figured woman that sometimes finds it difficult to find nice tops that flatter her.</li>
            <li>Im only being honest, I looked at myself and was so sad that she would allow this to be sold.</li>
            <li>This is such a stretchy material that it&#x27;s either very clingy if it&#x27;s too small, or in my case, way too much drape if it&#x27;s too big.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing this to work or to a fancy dinner, but with the proper accessories and other clothing, it could work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and can be worn in casual or dressier situations.</li>

            <li> I wear a 2X top</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Suzanne Somers can well afford to use a better, higher-quality knit fabric, no matter what her target market.</li>
            <li> and I love it.....</li>
            <li> Is this the perfect top to wear outside (with no coat) in the cooler weather?</li>
            <li> favorite way of wearing it was to have the neck draped, with a cami underneath for additional coverage.</li>
            <li> Trick is to wear something \\&quot;slim\\&quot; fitting under it.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t think it is appropriately priced.</li>
            <li> I love this top and can&#x27;t always find the size I want.</li>
            <li> I love the material.</li>
            <li> I wear a size 22 or a 2x top.  </li>
            <li> like it and will probably purchase one more</li>
            <li> but all in all this is a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I like this easy, go-to garment and wish they had more colors/sizes available!</li>
            <li> I love the way the arms fit and the way the bottom flows out.</li>
            <li> The arms fit me perfectly, and I like how the material drapes into a long tunic and covers my  tummy.</li>
            <li> It gets wrinkled easily and looks like an inexpensive polyester material from a discount store.</li>
            <li> For an over sized basic top it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> and I doubt if I would ever wear it off the shoulders, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that this top would fit up to a 5X.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super-soft and maybe the possible ways to wear it are not as diverse as touted, but accept it for the attractive design it does have, and you&#x27;ll want more than one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special but it is extremely cute.</li>
            <li> Would be cool if they came out with more colors or maybe even patterns.</li>
            <li> It washed just fine.</li>
            <li> It is so huge.  </li>
            <li> Im not some huge Woman.</li>
            <li> I saw it was available for sizes up to 3X</li>
            <li> Cheap material.</li>
            <li> Its really light weight</li>
            <li> The fabric felt so cheap and when I did put this thing on, well it definitly looks like wearing a potatoe sack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous to just throw on over skinny jeans or leggings without any thought, but you can dress it up with jewelry.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> It also smells like cheap material.. chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was glad I didn&#x27;t spend very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is excited about it, and that makes it something that she will talk about with her friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A Donna Karan original?</li>
            <li> but I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I lost weight in my shoulders and upper arms and a lot of tops seem to fit me that way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get ready to have this become a favorite for that special lady in your life.</li>
            <li> I got my credit and my lower price and the right size and my return sticker came quickly!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to really pull off the off the shoulder or dress look</li>
            <li> cool material.</li>
            <li> I really like this top.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;hood&#x27; is really just a cowl neck and not ample enough to go over your head, but it drapes very nicely around the neck.  </li>
            <li> The material is very comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> : The top works fine in the cowl style, but when I try the off the shoulder or one shoulder look, once I get to moving around the cowl rolls back up.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I really love wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received the product mentioned above for free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews make me laugh.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a comfortable stylish versatile and effortless</li>
            <li> and it makes a nice cowl neck similar to what it is supposed to look like.</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> Right now I am a size 10.</li>
            <li> The top is OK but not worth $20-$30, as I have seen it advertised for.</li>
            <li> This is meant for very large sizes.  </li>
            <li> Looks best over tight jeans with big earrings.</li>
            <li> The neckline is so big that it does fit comfortably over my head as a hood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> While this is a loose and easily draped poncho, it is a really cheap fabric.</li>
            <li> I am a 1X and the XL-3XL size is very big on me, but I am OK with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had none of the issues others mentioned, and I was concerned as I wear 14/16 (and am &amp;#34;Rubenesque&amp;#34;) and received S-L size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because it covers any belly bulges without making you look fat; you can eat whatever you want during the course of the night, because it drapes no nicely...</li>
            <li> I have the Mocha one on order and will be interested to see how it turns out in that regard.  </li>
            <li> At work I fold the cowl neck over and pin it with a pretty pin for colder weather, or pin it and wear it with a pretty scarf.</li>
            <li> It does gradually become wider towards the bottom of the poncho which makes your body appear shapeless but this can easily be remedied with a cute and chic waist belt.</li>
            <li> I really thought I would love this, but it wrinkles constantly!  </li>
            <li> The fabric is REALLY soft, and reminded me of my favorite old t-shirts.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised that the top fit me extremely well</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local pharmacy so that I&#x27;d have the option to return it easily, but I kept it.  </li>
            <li> No matter what size you are DO NOT buy the large one.  </li>
            <li> It is super soft and comfy though, so I&#x27;ll be exchanging it for the regular fit if I can find one.</li>
            <li> I got a bigger size and it was huge on me</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Looks absolutely nothing like the picture while wearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to fit big and</li>
            <li> I like it came very wrinkled still waiting for it to hang out</li>
            <li> It appeared much shorter when I removed from package.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s cheap enough, and perhaps can use over a bathing suit.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to fit big.  </li>
            <li> Did not have any stability in the cloth, very flimsy and was shipped very wrinkly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight, stretchy and flexible type of fabric.</li>
            <li> very versatile.  </li>
            <li> Mine also came with a whole on the arm sleeve.</li>
            <li> very wrinkled washed</li>
            <li> I feel this top will look good on thin or heavier women, both short and tall.  </li>
            <li> It hangs to almost my knees and when I wear it off one shoulder, the entire shirt sleeve slips right off my hand and my whole arm is exposed, not to mention my boob!</li>
            <li> I have the black color wish they would make more colors.</li>
            <li> I got the poncho top in black and taupe.  </li>
            <li> The Black top was $19.99</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the models in the picture are wearing the larger size and not the smaller.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality item.</li>
            <li> and it fit me loosely and went beyond my butt</li>
            <li> Many people mentioned that the sleeves are tight but I never noticed this</li>
            <li> Many people mentioned the sleeves are too tight, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem.  </li>
            <li> : The fit is very loose.</li>
            <li> I normally wear 8-10 which would be their S-L size.</li>
            <li> They offered them in different colors: grey, blue and red for a reduced price, but I didn&#x27;t buy them because I wasn&#x27;t sure how they would fit..</li>
            <li> If you are larger, like a 3x it will look like a loose fitting tee Instead of</li>
            <li> When I first put this on, the neckline was so low, it showed my bra.</li>
            <li> In store I&#x27;ve seen black available.</li>
            <li> But on a positive note, if it starts to rain the cowl can be pulled over the back of the head like a hoodie.</li>
            <li> It is not stretchy, but is soft floppy material...something you might consider wearing to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> and the whole left sleeve is falling apart!  </li>
            <li> Not from the infomercial or directly from the manufacturer</li>
            <li> It is not clingy, and would be very accommodating for different shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get control over that WILD neckline and a lot of compliments, too.</li>
            <li> I bought the XL - 3X directly from the site.</li>
            <li> About me: I wear a size 22/24 generally in tops, and am quite busty.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve read several horror stories from people who bought direct).  </li>
            <li> She is a full-figured woman that sometimes finds it difficult to find nice tops that flatter her.</li>
            <li> Im only being honest, I looked at myself and was so sad that she would allow this to be sold.</li>
            <li> This is such a stretchy material that it&#x27;s either very clingy if it&#x27;s too small, or in my case, way too much drape if it&#x27;s too big.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing this to work or to a fancy dinner, but with the proper accessories and other clothing, it could work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and can be worn in casual or dressier situations.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soooo comfy/soft and quite flattering as a blouse or casual top.</li>
            <li> The main reason it is not worth more than $10 is the material is very thin and shear.</li>
            <li> The hood is not large enough to actually cover your head without hiking the back all the way up to above the waist.</li>
            <li> They are machine washable, dry flat.  </li>
            <li> Much larger than expected.</li>
            <li> I can wear it over leggings or a long skirt in summer.</li>
            <li> (I have a long torso</li>
            <li> it hung it up to dry..</li>
            <li> For the big gal this poncho is thin and very clingy.</li>
            <li> have a few poncho type blouses that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> was going to send it back, but the postage I paid at the beginning and the postage it was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I donated it away hoping someone else can use it.</li>
            <li> It has a loose cowlneck that can be draped in front, over a shoulder or across both shoulders.</li>
            <li> The fabric is thin (the black is see through in fact) but it&#x27;s super comfy.</li>
            <li> paired mine with leggings and wore it as a draped neck top, the hood looks a little awkward to me</li>
            <li> About the same price as a t-shirt at Wal-Mart or Target (at least for a larger girl!).</li>
            <li> and I wish it was at least 2 sizes larger so that the neck hole would be bigger and</li>
            <li> Would not be caught dead wearing it, let alone out in public.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Not really recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit thinner than I expected and wrinkled when I got it out of the box.</li>
            <li> did have a slightly weird smell to it as well when I purchased it, but washed right out.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in other colors however</li>
            <li> I get it in two sizes, one for skirts and the other for pants.</li>
            <li> Big and shapeless, not comfortable around the shoulder and sleeve areas.....</li>
            <li> The fabric had a weird smell (very chemically) to it that went away after washing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> It IS a thin, soft material</li>
            <li> It is a little thin but the fabric is very soft and flattering.</li>
            <li> I have a black one</li>
            <li> I bought the poncho in black at Walgreen&#x27;s for $19.99.  </li>
            <li> Black is ALWAYS in, dearies.</li>
            <li> How I solved this problem is I pull the neckline down a little but not off the shoulders.</li>
            <li> the arms are supposed to be tight ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear it off the shoulder because the neck hole is too tight to stay in place...</li>
            <li> The sleeves are a little tight</li>
            <li> The sleeves are a bit snug, but they do have a little bit of a dolman sleeve.</li>
            <li> The fabric is rather thin, it&#x27;s definitely nothing like a sweater material.</li>
            <li> Really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Banded gathered sleeves not a great idea.</li>
            <li> Even my husband disliked it.</li>
            <li> This was shoddy construction &amp; definitely not worth the price of $19.99.</li>
            <li> got a small and paid $5.00 less!  </li>
            <li> I washed it in cold water, laid it out flat on a bath towel to dry.</li>
            <li> But you end up with a fairly shapeless item that is hard to dress up.</li>
            <li> This was small on me and it says one size fits all</li>
            <li> I ordered the small to XL size.  </li>
            <li> I think it runs small.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, out of the box, there was a small hole in a seam on the shoulder.</li>
            <li> It fits like a rag, made if cheap fabric, looks awful and the sleeves are uncomfortably tight.</li>
            <li> It fit but just looked sloppy and stupid.</li>
            <li> The black material is thin but not see-through while you&#x27;re wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps some of you who have this poncho and feel negatively about it or those who are on the fence about getting it.</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> 3way poncho was very disappointing size to big!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M RATHER THIN</li>
            <li> I am long and thin, and this piece of cloth looks terrible on me.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> Not like me to give a 1 star or bad review.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles and looks awful on.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived defected. Was not sewed together. Just kept and sewed myself.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Wear it everywhere!  I love it!  Best purchase ever made!  I got a bigger size and it was huge on me so I returned it for a refund,  got a small and paid $5.00 less!  I got my credit and my lower price and the right size and my return sticker came quickly!  Amazon is an amazing company and do things quickly and inform you of every transaction and move they have made!  Highly recommend!  Very happy!  10 stars!</li>
            <li> Perfect for going out in the city or for spending a night with family and friends! Would recommend to everyone! Definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift in the XL-3X size. I am 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; and a size 16/18 and I could fit TWO of me in this thing! It hangs to almost my knees and when I wear it off one shoulder, the entire shirt sleeve slips right off my hand and my whole arm is exposed, not to mention my boob! As a cowl neck, it hangs about 2&amp;#34; above my belly button. This is such a stretchy material that it&#x27;s either very clingy if it&#x27;s too small, or in my case, way too much drape if it&#x27;s too big. It is super soft and comfy though, so I&#x27;ll be exchanging it for the regular fit if I can find one.</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculous.  Suzanne Somers can&#x27;t do better then this?  It is a rag!!  Would not be caught dead wearing it, let alone out in public.  Will not hang on a hanger, you can&#x27;t tell the top from the bottom.  No matter what size you are DO NOT buy the large one.  If you are frumpy then it&#x27;ll make you look even more frumpy.  It is not stretchy, but is soft floppy material...something you might consider wearing to sleep in.  Was hoping it would shrink up in dryer after being washed, but it only got bigger.</li>
            <li> Suzanne Somers is known for being innovative and backing great products. This 3 Way Poncho is definitely one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw it was available for sizes up to 3X I knew my mom would love it---and I was right. She is a full-figured woman that sometimes finds it difficult to find nice tops that flatter her. With the 3 way poncho as you can see through the pics I posted she not only loved the look but said it felt great against her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many ways to wear it, and though I photographed her in 3 of those ways, you can see its versatility and the way it flows over her body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is excited about it, and that makes it something that she will talk about with her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get ready to have this become a favorite for that special lady in your life. Once they try it on, they are going to want more than one.</li>
            <li> It is so huge.  If you are short and carrying a couple of extra pounds, this will make you huge.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to send it back, but the postage I paid at the beginning and the postage it was not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I donated it away hoping someone else can use it. This is meant for very large sizes.  I really&lt;br /&gt;do not think Suzanne Somers would wear this</li>
            <li> I received this product free in exchange for an honest review of the product. I love the 3 way poncho . The material is very comfortable and soft. It looks great on . I have the black color wish they would make more colors.</li>
            <li> Looks absolutely nothing like the picture while wearing. You definitely can&#x27;t pull the back of it over your head like a hood. I&#x27;m sure the models in the picture are wearing the larger size and not the smaller. However, even with those downfalls I genuinely love this item of clothing. The sleeves are a bit snug, but they do have a little bit of a dolman sleeve. The fabric is rather thin, it&#x27;s definitely nothing like a sweater material. It&#x27;s just a really nice shirt to wear with a pair of leggings. I want it in every color. It&#x27;s nothing special but it is extremely cute.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality item. It is a little thin but the fabric is very soft and flattering. Works great with leggings, jean and even on it&#x27;s own. The fabric had a weird smell (very chemically) to it that went away after washing. Will be great for this spring and summer since it&#x27;s light and flowy. Would be cool if they came out with more colors or maybe even patterns. I have a black one and I do like it. It&#x27;s very comfortable and can be worn in casual or dressier situations. I really love wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received the product mentioned above for free in exchange for a review. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”</li>
            <li> Great top for any shape/size!!</li>
            <li> Sleeve has a hole in it!</li>
            <li> I really thought I would love this, but it wrinkles constantly!  And I have worn it once and the whole left sleeve is falling apart!  Don&#x27;t spend your money NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> While this is a loose and easily draped poncho, it is a really cheap fabric. It gets wrinkled easily and looks like an inexpensive polyester material from a discount store. It has a loose cowlneck that can be draped in front, over a shoulder or across both shoulders. There is plenty of give in the material to get it to do basically what you want. But you end up with a fairly shapeless item that is hard to dress up. Not really recommended. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Quality: The top is OK but not worth $20-$30, as I have seen it advertised for. (I bought mine at CVS where it retails for $20. I had a coupon and CVS Rewards Bucks which is how I was able to get mine for $10. )The main reason it is not worth more than $10 is the material is very thin and shear. Unless you are an exhibitionist, you will need to wear a tank top or shell underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit: The fit is very loose. It is very comfortable. I am a 1X and the XL-3XL size is very big on me, but I am OK with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style: The top works fine in the cowl style, but when I try the off the shoulder or one shoulder look, once I get to moving around the cowl rolls back up.  But on a positive note, if it starts to rain the cowl can be pulled over the back of the head like a hoodie. I like that.</li>
            <li> This was small on me and it says one size fits all but I&#x27; . a very big girl and was hoping this would be way looser and flowy on me. The material was kind of flimsy too. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I won this on another site and love it!  I&#x27;ve had none of the issues others mentioned, and I was concerned as I wear 14/16 (and am &amp;#34;Rubenesque&amp;#34;) and received S-L size but it drapes nicely.  My only concern is be careful when you bend far over....you might show more than cleavage.....</li>
            <li> This a piece of junk.  Wrinkles and looks awful on. Really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews make me laugh. It is what it is ... a $20 top from an infomercial ... what did you expect? A Donna Karan original? The fabric is thin (the black is see through in fact) but it&#x27;s super comfy. It&#x27;s meant to fit big and the arms are supposed to be tight ... it&#x27;s almost a bat wing type of sleeve. I can&#x27;t see wearing the hood - it&#x27;s really not big enough. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it off the shoulders - doesn&#x27;t look good. Looks best over tight jeans with big earrings. For an over sized basic top it&#x27;s great and I can see getting a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> I like it came very wrinkled still waiting for it to hang out</li>
            <li> Cheap material. Top came ripped. Much larger than expected. Would not order this again.</li>
            <li> I purchase the 3 Way Poncho from a Walgreens(As Seen On TV section). Poncho comes in only two sizes S-L and XL-3XL. I don&#x27;t know who they had in mind with these sizings. I normally wear 8-10 which would be their S-L size. I tried on. Sleeves were too short. Material didn&#x27;t hang the way Suzanne model hers. Every time I tried to use cowl feature, shoulders pulled up. Tried to wear off shoulder material would roll up. This was shoddy construction &amp; definitely not worth the price of $19.99. I returned to store immediately next day for a refund.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. I am long and thin, and this piece of cloth looks terrible on me. No matter how I attempt to style it, it&#x27;s nothing more than a tent that hangs in unflattering folds. There is no way I will wear this out of the house let alone to the office or a party.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T WORN IT YET BUT, IT IS AS EXOECTED.  I&#x27;M RATHER THIN SO THE PLAN IS TO WEAR IT WITH A LOW SLUNG SASH OR BELT, CONSEQUENTLY I BOUGHT THE LARGER SIZE.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Walgreens and I didn&#x27;t think I was going to love it, but I love it so much! I love the way the arms fit and the way the bottom flows out. I can wear it over leggings or a long skirt in summer. Its really light weight yet it covers you. It&#x27;s blousy and forgiving if you have a bit of s tummy.</li>
            <li> Worth it! But buy it in store... Not from the infomercial or directly from the manufacturer (I&#x27;ve read several horror stories from people who bought direct).  I found this at CVS! AND I&#x27;m in love. I wear a 2X top so I purchased the XL to 3X size. You won&#x27;t be able to really pull off the off the shoulder or dress look but it&#x27;s soooo comfy/soft and quite flattering as a blouse or casual top. If you&#x27;re smaller and you want the baggier look you should purchase the size larger. In store I&#x27;ve seen black available.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied. I&#x27;m a size 22 and I must compliment the makers for the flattering look...and the price.</li>
            <li> Banded gathered sleeves not a great idea. Material is thin, cheap. Suzanne Somers can well afford to use a better, higher-quality knit fabric, no matter what her target market. Length is misleading. It appeared much shorter when I removed from package. I would have never ordered from tv. I too found this at CVS Pharmacy and I had a stack of coupons so I got it for next to nothing on a whim. I was glad I didn&#x27;t spend very much.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gist for my granddaughter. She likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Walgreens and I love it.....I actually bought the larger size but since I have lost weight I exchanged it for the smaller size. It fits great.....The sleeves are a little tight but once you start moving around with it on they tend to loosen up. I wish it came in other colors however but all in all this is a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Big and shapeless, not comfortable around the shoulder and sleeve areas.....well, it&#x27;s cheap enough, and perhaps can use over a bathing suit.</li>
            <li> About me: I wear a size 22/24 generally in tops, and am quite busty. I obviously purchased the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is lightweight and appears to be see through, but when it’s on I couldn&#x27;t see through it. Is this the perfect top to wear outside (with no coat) in the cooler weather? No. Then again, neither is a t-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top fit me wonderfully – I did not have any problem with the size of the sleeves whatsoever. The fabric is REALLY soft, and reminded me of my favorite old t-shirts. It is not clingy, and would be very accommodating for different shapes and sizes. It did not cling to my backside as another reviewer mentioned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: WAY cheaper than tops from Lane Bryant and the like. About the same price as a t-shirt at Wal-Mart or Target (at least for a larger girl!). I think the $20 price tag is spot on. (I purchased mine at Walgreens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine did have a slightly weird smell to it as well when I purchased it, but washed right out. You should be in the habit of washing your clothing before wearing anyway, so it shouldn’t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way of wearing it was to have the neck draped, with a cami underneath for additional coverage. I don’t see myself using an off the shoulders look, and I personally didn’t like it as a hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It’s a good top for the price. Soft and comfortable, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it clinging in weird spots.</li>
            <li> Do not buy 3 way poncho. Rip off.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It fits like a rag, made if cheap fabric, looks awful and the sleeves are uncomfortably tight. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> no clinging. cool material. she wears it all the time. i&#x27;ll post again on the durability</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, and she loves it....and I thought it looked beautiful on her.  My daughter has had abdominal surgery that makes her belly area protrude, but this garment helps to cover her medical problem and make her look like a million bucks.  Good job Suzanne.....</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift from a family member and as soon as I saw it I was skeptical of it even fitting, I was pleasantly surprised that the top fit me extremely well, I wear a size 26-28 and it fit me loosely and went beyond my butt (I have a long torso so that was wonderful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired mine with leggings and wore it as a draped neck top, the hood looks a little awkward to me and I doubt if I would ever wear it off the shoulders, I&#x27;m comfortable saying that this top would fit up to a 5X.</li>
            <li> This poncho is great. looks great.</li>
            <li> I really like this top. I ordered the small to XL size.  To give you an idea, I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; tall and about 128 lbs.  I got the poncho top in black and taupe.  It IS a thin, soft material but I like it.  It&#x27;s very soft and comfortable.  It is supposed to fit big.  My suggestion is to wear it with skinny jeans and heels or boots, big bracelet and earrings or you could pair it with leggings or a slim skirt.  Trick is to wear something \\&quot;slim\\&quot; fitting under it.  That way the look is not all \\&quot;baggy\\&quot; or \\&quot;sloppy\\&quot; looking.  Wear nice accessories and you&#x27;ll be set.  I washed it in cold water, laid it out flat on a bath towel to dry. It washed just fine. I feel this top will look good on thin or heavier women, both short and tall.  It&#x27;s all about how you wear it and what you wear it with.  I hope this helps some of you who have this poncho and feel negatively about it or those who are on the fence about getting it.</li>
            <li> Not like me to give a 1 star or bad review. I was so upset when this came. Im not some huge Woman. Right now I am a size 10. The fabric felt so cheap and when I did put this thing on, well it definitly looks like wearing a potatoe sack. Im sorry Im only being honest, I looked at myself and was so sad that she would allow this to be sold. Not all Women are a size 0. And should not feel that way. If you are a size 8 ot above please take my warning.</li>
            <li> I bought the poncho in black at Walgreen&#x27;s for $19.99.  I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and size 8; and it fits me nicely.  It is very lightweight and comfortable.  However, I don&#x27;t think it can be attractively worn as a hoodie.  Also, I don&#x27;t think it is appropriately priced. It should cost $9.99-14.99 based on the quality of the fabric.</li>
            <li> 3way poncho was very disappointing size to big! Did not have any stability in the cloth, very flimsy and was shipped very wrinkly maybe should change the material.</li>
            <li> I love this top and can&#x27;t always find the size I want. But you can find it here. It&#x27;s super-soft and maybe the possible ways to wear it are not as diverse as touted, but accept it for the attractive design it does have, and you&#x27;ll want more than one. The sleeves are a bit snug at the cuffs (and my arms are slim.) I get it in two sizes, one for skirts and the other for pants. I would never wear it as a dress, it&#x27;s swing-line hem would show more than you want! But here&#x27;s a great tip for the wonderful neckline: use those &amp;#34;jeweled&amp;#34; finger rings w/ the stretch bands to gather and cinch up the extra material. Or the little-girl hair elastics with the fabric flowers (in rainbow colors!) to do the same thing. You&#x27;ll get control over that WILD neckline and a lot of compliments, too. Black is ALWAYS in, dearies.</li>
            <li> For the big gal this poncho is thin and very clingy. I think it runs small. It stretches and clings to your back side. If thats not a problem you&#x27;ll probably like it.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;5 145 lb girl and received the smaller size. It&#x27;s a very lightweight, stretchy and flexible type of fabric. It does gradually become wider towards the bottom of the poncho which makes your body appear shapeless but this can easily be remedied with a cute and chic waist belt. Many people mentioned that the sleeves are tight but I never noticed this and I have chubby muscular arms. Overall, it&#x27;s a comfortable stylish versatile and effortless look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample for an honest review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
            <li> delivered very quick poncho very cute nice fabric</li>
            <li> i have one of these, might be getting another actually. i got it in cvs.  i used it on my vacation, i flew from boston to aruba in it as a winter tunic with leggings, then used it as a beach cover up for a couple of days. its a cute tunic, and also makes a great coverup, you can even use the cowl as a hood.  very versatile.  material washes great.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local pharmacy so that I&#x27;d have the option to return it easily, but I kept it.  It&#x27;s fabulous to just throw on over skinny jeans or leggings without any thought, but you can dress it up with jewelry.  It&#x27;s great because it covers any belly bulges without making you look fat; you can eat whatever you want during the course of the night, because it drapes no nicely... the perfect party top!  The black material is thin but not see-through while you&#x27;re wearing it.  I have the Mocha one on order and will be interested to see how it turns out in that regard.  I am 5&#x27;2&amp;#34;, 125 and I wish it was at least 2 sizes larger so that the neck hole would be bigger and the length longer, but it still serves its purpose.  I can only wear it one-way, not three-ways, but I still like it.  The &#x27;hood&#x27; is really just a cowl neck and not ample enough to go over your head, but it drapes very nicely around the neck.  I can&#x27;t wear it off the shoulder because the neck hole is too tight to stay in place... the minute I move my arms, it pops back up around my neck.  Many people mentioned the sleeves are too tight, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem.  They were perfect and stretchy too.  All-in-all, I like this easy, go-to garment and wish they had more colors/sizes available!</li>
            <li> If your a bigger 3x, save your money. It fit but just looked sloppy and stupid. Mine also came with a whole on the arm sleeve.</li>
            <li> Wrinkle free. Not. Came delivered very wrinkled washed it hung it up to dry..still wrinkly. Very disappointed.  Even my husband disliked it.</li>
            <li> I bought the XL - 3X directly from the site. The Black top was $19.99 and I got the Mocha (taupe) for an additional $9.99. With shipping and postage the total was 37.99.  I thought this was a good price for the 2 tops. They offered them in different colors: grey, blue and red for a reduced price, but I didn&#x27;t buy them because I wasn&#x27;t sure how they would fit.. I love the material. It is very comfortable. In colder weather I wear with a cardigan, in warmer weather I wear it by itself. I would wear these every day around the house, but I save them for work. They are machine washable, dry flat.  They do tend to wrinkle so I keep them hung up. I wear a size 22 or a 2x top.  The arms fit me perfectly, and I like how the material drapes into a long tunic and covers my  tummy. When I first put this on, the neckline was so low, it showed my bra. To be fair, I lost weight in my shoulders and upper arms and a lot of tops seem to fit me that way. How I solved this problem is I pull the neckline down a little but not off the shoulders. At work I fold the cowl neck over and pin it with a pretty pin for colder weather, or pin it and wear it with a pretty scarf. My 4th option is to fold it, pin  it and flip the excess material inside and it makes a nice cowl neck similar to what it is supposed to look like. The neckline is so big that it does fit comfortably over my head as a hood. I never thought I would wear it as a hood, but  one day I came out of work, and it was snowing. I probably would not wear this off the shoulder unless I was wearing a tank or over a bathing suit as a cover up. Maybe I will get to try this during the summer.</li>
            <li> I would not advise anybody to buy this. The material is thin and cheap. When I opened it, out of the box, there was a small hole in a seam on the shoulder. The hood is not large enough to actually cover your head without hiking the back all the way up to above the waist. It also smells like cheap material.. chemicals. I am returning this pronto.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this item until today, but saw it in Walgreens for 19.99 and decided to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit thinner than I expected and wrinkled when I got it out of the box. I tried it on and loved it. If you are larger, like a 3x it will look like a loose fitting tee Instead of an actual poncho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It think it will be a perfect travel garment because it is light weight, covers your arms, and the wrinkles fall out. I don&#x27;t really see myself wearing this to work or to a fancy dinner, but with the proper accessories and other clothing, it could work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few poncho type blouses that are more expensive. This one, however, is truly seasonless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will probably purchase one more just have the my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I love It!!! I plan on buying another one for me and my sister.</li>
