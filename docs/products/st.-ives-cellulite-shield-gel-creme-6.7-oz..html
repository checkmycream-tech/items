            <li>*hoping for the best*</li>
            <li>so happy i did!!!</li>
            <li>and I am happy with that.</li>
            <li>This gel smells great and has a cooling, tightening effect to the skin.</li>
            <li>Thus I don&#x27;t know if it is effective for cellulite but for those who are averse to smells or chemicals, skip it.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and I love the scent!</li>
            <li>but, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think the longer you use it the more it works.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to buy this item.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to say orange is better for cellulite.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell was so strong on this -- even in the box I could smell it -- ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li>This gel makes your skin smooth to the touch</li>
            <li>Cannot find it in local drugstores so was glad to find it on line!</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t do something to increase the circulation and decrease the volume of fat trying to protrude through your skin, it&#x27;s likely that you won&#x27;t experience results beyond a nice tingly sensation when you put this lotion</li>
            <li>I noticed a smoothing right away.</li>
            <li>It feels tingly, smells great, and seems to really make your skin feel smoother and less dimply.</li>
            <li>I would love for them to make a regular moisturizing lotion with this scent.</li>
            <li>I have used this consistently day in and day out twice a day, and have not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>First cream to ever visibly make a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, this product works and works really well compared to other caffeine gels, besides it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This product its so good that its almost hard to believe.</li>
            <li>After only one week using it my legs and butt are cellulite free and Im a person over 40 who doesnt excercise frecuently.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this .</li>
            <li>The product is sticky and takes a long time to dry, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.</li>
            <li>It smooths out the skin a little, but there wasn&#x27;t much improvement on the cellulite.</li>

            <li> i have also been doing step &amp; sculpt exercises the past few months which have helped a little, but i think this will be that little extra something that makes my butt/leg area look FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li> Have used in the past and can really see results.</li>
            <li> However, the results do not last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not very expensive I usually use this gel twice a day (after my morning shower and after my post-workout shower.)</li>
            <li> I noticed only a slight difference after a couple weeks but as the weeks went on my thighs are much smoother and the cellulite is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and the only difference I have noticed is the results I&#x27;ve gotten from daily exercise.</li>
            <li> i have tried a couple different methods of making both things less noticable, like cocoa butter and lotions that claim they will diminish their appearence.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all mental</li>
            <li> It does seem to have the expected *temporary* tightening effect.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Overall, an unnecessary extra step to my already lengthy skin care routine.</li>
            <li> and i can see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only effective way to get rid of cellulite, but it is very painful and traumatic(temporarily leaves bruises and broken blood vessels).</li>
            <li> It does firm and tighten the skin as it states it will.  </li>
            <li> I feel this was a bit of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a gimmick, so don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i am in my mid 20&#x27;s and unfortunately stretch marks and cellulite</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a gel (and not a lotion) use sparingly and work over your skin in small circles with your fingertips and wipe off any excess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do exercise, and am working hard on my thigh areas.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is sticky and has a weird medicinal orange scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> Neither can they make your skin look worse after you are done using them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did not live up the the reviews I have read on here. :-(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying any product for Cellulite because as we all know, there are no miracle cures out there for it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I noticed a difference after using for a couple weeks.  I stopped using it because I wanted to wait until it got closer to summer and swimsuit weather.  Tried to order another tube but it was sold out.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong on this -- even in the box I could smell it -- ended up throwing it away. Thus I don&#x27;t know if it is effective for cellulite but for those who are averse to smells or chemicals, skip it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s all mental but, I love this stuff. It feels tingly, smells great, and seems to really make your skin feel smoother and less dimply. I will keep buying this and the lotion!</li>
            <li> This product its so good that its almost hard to believe. After only one week using it my legs and butt are cellulite free and Im a person over 40 who doesnt excercise frecuently. I really recommend this .</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying any product for Cellulite because as we all know, there are no miracle cures out there for it. However after reading reviews I decided to go for it. Well I must say it actually does work. I have been using it for 2 months now and I can see a difference. I think the longer you use it the more it works. I noticed only a slight difference after a couple weeks but as the weeks went on my thighs are much smoother and the cellulite is less noticeable. Its not a miracle but it definately improves the look of it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product for a few weeks now and the only difference I have noticed is the results I&#x27;ve gotten from daily exercise. The product is sticky and takes a long time to dry, but it smells nice. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the cellulite that I applied it to, but maybe you would get a different result. I would not buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and I love the scent! It does firm and tighten the skin as it states it will.  I would love for them to make a regular moisturizing lotion with this scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently day in and day out twice a day, and have not noticed a difference. I do exercise, and am working hard on my thigh areas. I feel this was a bit of a waste of money. I will continue to use it and see if I see a difference once the entire bottle is gone. *hoping for the best* This did not live up the the reviews I have read on here. :-(</li>
            <li> None of these gels or cremes can penetrate deep enough to make a difference in cellulite appearance. Neither can they make your skin look worse after you are done using them.&lt;br /&gt; This gel makes your skin smooth to the touch and I am happy with that. I use it after a workout and a shower. It smells citrusy and creates a cooling sensation. If you want something that will get rid of cellulite look up honey massage. It&#x27;s the only effective way to get rid of cellulite, but it is very painful and traumatic(temporarily leaves bruises and broken blood vessels). I would also try coffee massages in the shower, caffeine improves circulation and makes skin tighter.&lt;br /&gt; This gel is only for women who want their skin feel smoother. It cannot replace exercise and massages.</li>
            <li> Been using for awhile haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. Hopefully one day they will have one that works!&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to buy this item.  It&#x27;s just a gimmick, so don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work.</li>
            <li> i am in my mid 20&#x27;s and unfortunately stretch marks and cellulite run im my family. i have tried a couple different methods of making both things less noticable, like cocoa butter and lotions that claim they will diminish their appearence. none have ever worked in the slightest. however, i came accross this and figured why not give it a try. im so happy i did!!! ive been using it for about 3 days now and i can see a slight difference. i have also been doing step &amp; sculpt exercises the past few months which have helped a little, but i think this will be that little extra something that makes my butt/leg area look FANTASTIC!!! ;D</li>
            <li> Cellulite is what happens when the fat cells engorge and protrude through the collagen layer of the skin. So if you don&#x27;t do something to increase the circulation and decrease the volume of fat trying to protrude through your skin, it&#x27;s likely that you won&#x27;t experience results beyond a nice tingly sensation when you put this lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product works and works really well compared to other caffeine gels, besides it smells amazing. My legs are noticeably smoother when I use this gel with exercise as opposed to using exercise alone. The effect is temporary and wears off about a week after the last use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s a gel (and not a lotion) use sparingly and work over your skin in small circles with your fingertips and wipe off any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not very expensive I usually use this gel twice a day (after my morning shower and after my post-workout shower.)</li>
            <li> I saw no results at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work. Didn&#x27;t see any changes. It is a waste of money. Not a miracle cream. Save your money</li>
            <li> I buy the cream arrived yesterday but not the orange photo sent up a blue. taste it if I had not have to notify you. I wanted to say orange is better for cellulite. whether it works is still not .&lt;br /&gt;Compre la crema me llego ayer Pero no es la naranja de la fotos me mandaron Una en azul. ESO no me gusto si no la tenian tendran Que notificarte. yo queria la naranja Dicen Que Es Mejor Para La celulitis. Funciona si no lo sí Todovia .</li>
            <li> It does seem to have the expected *temporary* tightening effect. Other than that, it is sticky and has a weird medicinal orange scent that lingers. Like something I might use to disinfect my kitchen. Overall, an unnecessary extra step to my already lengthy skin care routine. No thanks.</li>
            <li> I noticed a smoothing right away. First cream to ever visibly make a difference. Nothing beats working out and using this though.</li>
            <li> This gel smells great and has a cooling, tightening effect to the skin. However, the results do not last long.</li>
            <li> It smooths out the skin a little, but there wasn&#x27;t much improvement on the cellulite. I only used it for about a month, though.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.  Have used in the past and can really see results. Cannot find it in local drugstores so was glad to find it on line!</li>
