            <li>this one had a great smell And worked as it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>Love this one and would keep buying it again and again !!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, inexpensive clay face mask.</li>
            <li>and I love the tingling sensation the best mask by Freeman</li>
            <li>This clay mask smells great, but you&#x27;ll have to make sure and moisturize after using it!</li>
            <li>It would be a good destressing mask to use because it&#x27;s got an aromatherapy quality to it.</li>
            <li>Feels good on your face</li>
            <li>The mint and lemon scent did sting my eyes quite a bit when you put it on the cheeks under the eyes, but otherwise I loved it.</li>
            <li>(Surprisingly, that is also an issue I have with my skin.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price and cruelty-free factor.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good.</li>
            <li>This is a good face mask.</li>
            <li>and it eliminates a good amount of my blackheads.  </li>
            <li>This is a good go-to product.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of clay masks over the years, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>More lemon-y than mint, which I like a lot!</li>
            <li>Love this mask!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this clay mask!</li>
            <li>All time favorite facial....ever!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>It states that it is &#x27;perfect for oily skin&#x27; and I absolutely agree!</li>
            <li>I leave it on for 30 minutes and afterwards my face looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I loved the Queen Helena Julip mask, which I&#x27;m sure everyone else does as well</li>
            <li>the others are good but this one became my favorite</li>
            <li>and it helps my skin look nice.</li>
            <li>I really liked this mask.</li>
            <li>also, honestly can&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin either.</li>
            <li>It smells so lemony, and tightens my skin nicely, after use.</li>
            <li>The texture is really nice and creamy, once on your face</li>
            <li>it has a cooling sensation which I find nice for the summer.</li>
            <li>We have decided to do this once a week because it leaves your face feeling refreshed and very clean!</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean!!</li>
            <li>They make it so unrealistically easy!  </li>
            <li>i have mildly dry/sensitive skin hoping this would be a good product.</li>
            <li>Freeman masks are super cheap, but great quality.</li>
            <li>MY FACE FEELS/LOOKS BETTER.</li>
            <li>We decided to try this tonight, with nothing better to do, and are AMAZED at the results.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to take it off in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>If I use this once a week, I notice that I don&#x27;t get as many breakouts, and existing acne blemishes heal faster.</li>
            <li>Another winning Freeman product.</li>
            <li>I love all freeman products.</li>
            <li>I tried the cucumber peal mask and I feel this is better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I order this ....</li>
            <li>The lemon and mint is really refreshing too.</li>
            <li>My skin tone appeared more even and brighter.  </li>
            <li>I think what I like the most about this product is that it has a refreshing scent to it, it soaks up all of the oil on my face, it tightens my skin</li>
            <li>, perhaps I should be applying it twice per week or more to get better results, idk.</li>
            <li>(you may get better results than I did)</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s preteen friends love these for their sleepovers.  </li>
            <li>They love their facials together.  </li>
            <li>and it cleaned most of the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I recommend using more moisturizer after using this mask.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and feels.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>The scent is also pleasing...smells lemony and minty, just as the name suggests :)</li>
            <li>I love all of the mask from this brand, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>, I recommend it more than this one.</li>
            <li>Although I love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li>I love mint products for the tingly feeling you get.</li>
            <li>I really love it a lot.</li>
            <li>Works well as a clay mask, just make sure you like the minty lemony smell that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The mint in it makes it tingly and refreshing.</li>
            <li>So honestly I love this face mask.</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>It feels better than it has for awhile.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic anytime</li>
            <li>i love love love it</li>
            <li>I ordered this mask not knowing what exactly to expect but owning and using almost all of freemans mask,except the peel-off,hate those kind!  </li>
            <li>It washes off smoothly and has a nice lather when rinsed.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels great when I&#x27;m careful with it.</li>
            <li>I love this clay mask.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying more of them out.</li>
            <li>I have used Freeman masks for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of face masks.</li>
            <li>Leave ample room around your eyes for tear-free mask cleansing :)</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and medium thickness, it dries in approx 15 mins, doesnt sting or burn my skin and does a good job leaving my skin clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel very clean</li>
            <li>The lemon and mint combination is an invigorating scent, and the mask gives my skin a nice, cool, tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>have been using Freeman&#x27;s Cucumber Mask and it works so much better, leaves your skin feeling refreshed, cleans and removes impurities and most important DOES NOT BURN YOUR FACE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the greatest on black heads but most masks leave me wanting more in that area.</li>
            <li>but this one is cheaper, doesn&#x27;t expire nearly as soon, and my skin feels so great after.</li>
            <li>My skin is super oily and this product keeps it nice and smooth without over-drying or creating excess oil.</li>
            <li>This is the first clay mask I have tried, so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others, but I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of masques, as my skin is pretty acne prone, and this one is by-far my favorite!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash off when it dries.  </li>
            <li>It not only helps ease any sweaty and oily feeling you have on your face, it has a great smell and feels refreshing and cooling on your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild, but yet still refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and easy to get off.</li>
            <li>For the ones that this mask doesn&#x27;t eliminate, they&#x27;re usually easy to squeeze out</li>
            <li>I have started using this product and liked it at first, but then started to break out from it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it glides on really easily and smoothly in the beginning, but as it dries it shrinks and wrinkles my skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and left my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>My breakouts have stopped since I have started using it also which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue looking until I find one that I feel comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>We purchased a cheap sheet</li>
            <li>(: the whole line of masks are amazing.</li>
            <li>* Smooth Application (I don&#x27;t like gritty-type masks)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soo smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>it works nice on your face but the smell was jsut too much for me since i have sensitivity to smell</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with oily skin and especially visible pores.</li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t meet my desires in that light.</li>
            <li>I bought this since I wanted to try something different from the Mint Julep mask which is my go-to mask and read great reviews for this one.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin Smooth</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel very smooth after and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>All his pores are clean and his face is smooth.</li>
            <li>I love clay masks, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and my favorite is the freeman&#x27;s avocado and oatmeal</li>
            <li>* Helps maintain face clean and glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li>The mask leaves your pores feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe my acne went right off the surface of my face on just one application!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and gets rid of blackheads and dull skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is kind of sensitive</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much results, face was softer, but I found that Queen Helen&#x27;s Mint Julep mask made my skin look better and brighter afterwards.</li>
            <li>The tingling sensation is a true spa like experience at home on a budget.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for some sort of cool sensation, but didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>lemon cool feeling</li>
            <li>This Freeman mask drys quickly  and makes your skin feel really clean after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask for really cleaning and toning my face.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and clean!!</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin, and my face feels so fresh and clean after using this.</li>
            <li>When I was it off my face feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I also like that the clay dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I usually use a Freeman peel-off mask first, then a clay mask, then a hydrating mask, and my face feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this mask and will make it a regular part of my skin care.</li>
            <li>The price is good and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards :) I would recommend it if you&#x27;re interested in trying something new!</li>
            <li>and I love  what it does makes your skin nice and tight</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin and huge pores.</li>
            <li>Out of all the products freeman makes this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I bought a bunch of different kind here.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>I like the fresh feel after I use the mask on my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>I received the package pretty quickly from this seller.</li>
            <li>It smells good but other than it leaves your face feeling like a desert..</li>
            <li>First of all, I am a huge fan of Freeman masks because of the range of products and affordability (not on Amazon, but on their own website and other online retailers).</li>
            <li>This is a nice smelling mask and will dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have very very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was a little worried if this product will be good for me,</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so fresh, clean, and soft.</li>
            <li>It also shows a huge difference directly after you wash the mask off.</li>
            <li>If you rather try it first, Walmart also carried trial packs for about 1.37/pack.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful with what kind of face washes I use.</li>
            <li>and I totally fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>The mint is very zesty - don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes, or it will make them water!  </li>
            <li>My pores were minimized after the first use.</li>
            <li>Overall okay.</li>
            <li>If you have naturally dry skin, I would choose a different clay mask as this will definitely dry you out, but if you have oily skin or have oily days like me, or just need a great mask for hot, sweaty days, then you will definitely love this.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and clean after using this.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need and what I&#x27;ve been searching for because I have very problematic skin</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re left with a really clean, fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>mask is easy to apply and spread while still retaining similar effects; pores tightening, tingling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I have tried tons including fresh face masks from lush!</li>
            <li>There is a slight tingle and is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For a parent hosting a girl gathering, this is much better than the makeup they cake on at other girls&#x27; houses, both for cleanup of their pretty faces and cleanup in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li>and it has never broken me out or irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>Using it once a week won&#x27;t really give you the results you&#x27;re expecting.  </li>
            <li>If you use it reasonably so, then in about 10 minutes, you&#x27;re ready to rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>it is the fact that it hasn&#x27;t really done much to help my acne</li>
            <li>and it really hasn&#x27;t done much to tighten my pores</li>
            <li>I really like the Freeman Mint &amp; Lemon Clay Mask, as it cleanses very well and leaves you with a refreshed feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>It has helped my acne so much.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the freeman masks and this one wins out far beyond the rest.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and this really helps.</li>
            <li>i think that this product works very well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This mask did absolutely nothing for her.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>When I use it twice a week, my face doesn&#x27;t produce as much as oil.</li>
            <li>However this mask really relaxes my skin and just stripe it of impurity&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I use this facial clay mask once a week; I get really oily so this is a great means to cleanse my pores without using a harsh cream.</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li>You really shouldn&#x27;t be doing that anyways</li>
            <li>QH&#x27;s can be VERY over-drying if used all over the face, and this is coming from someone with oily skin</li>
            <li>just bc of how much it has helped my breakouts and</li>
            <li>The key to this product actually being effective is consistency.  </li>
            <li>It gets nice and firm and my skin appears refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>I have used the Queene Helene green mint juleb mask for decades (the kind you buy in the dollar store)..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily my skin is fine and just flaked off a bit, it eventually healed up and is back to normal but this stuff HURTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to make sure I use it at least 2-3 times per week, and it seems to really purge my pores quickly.  </li>
            <li>Left my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Once rinsed, it makes my skin extra soft, and not any more dried out than most clay masks.</li>
            <li>It toned down my pimples and I love this more than the other freeman&#x27;s mask.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin &amp; it is not my first time using a face mask.</li>
            <li>eventually settled in to a full degree chemical burn that had to be medically treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product once per week (during the weekend) for a month now, more or less.  </li>
            <li>Although I guess that smells better than the earthy smell of previous clay masks I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews, i decided to purchase this product hoping that it would help me and my oily skin problem, unfortunately i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after using this mask.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mask mainly because it has mint in it.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to try out the other Freeman clay masks now, probably more relaxing ones!</li>
            <li>Very much a classic clay mask.  </li>
            <li>Freeman&#x27;s mint &amp; lemon mask left a noticeable difference after the very first use.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and smooth after use, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Normally my skin is pretty dry, but when I work out or spend a day in the sun or have to wear a lot of make up for the whole day, I notice my skin gets pretty sweaty and oily.</li>
            <li>It cleans up my face very gently and leave it soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Despite the bad reviews this product is the best.</li>
            <li>The amount of time you have to leave it on your face is in direct correlation with how much you use.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean, but if you go in with dry skin it itches like a bitch so watch out.</li>
            <li>packaged,  I have no complaint</li>
            <li>This mask and the Anti-Stress Dead Sea Mineral Mask (also by Freeman) are my top</li>
            <li>strongly recommend researching what is actually in this product prior to purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s face has always been real oily with blackheads and large pores, looks as if there&#x27;s tiny holes in her face.</li>
            <li>One use and my face felt brand new</li>
            <li>I wanted something new to try.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin, bought this with a lot of doubts.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY RECOMMEND;)</li>
            <li>Keep it less than 5 minutes, and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I brought this on vacation with my to southern Utah where I ended up doing a lot of hiking in the hot sun</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected, nor what I would prefer.</li>
            <li>It also left my skin pretty dry, which is to be expected from a clay mask, but without the refreshing feeling</li>
            <li>I think I have more than half of the product still left in the tube</li>
            <li>Even my fiance notices that my face has appear to look much smoother, brighter, less oily, surprisingly he even commented \\&quot;I can hardly see your pores anymore!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clear, and when I use it frequently, it helps clear my pores.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and oily skin, btw.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>* Didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>When I washed the masked off my skin felt soft and oil-free.</li>
            <li>I follow the directs and don&#x27;t go near my eyes but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li>But this one is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>but I think it helps when I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive skin, but didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or tightness.</li>
            <li>(am 58 years old).  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put this near your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Overall not a bad mask, but I wouldn&#x27;t chose it again, possibly just because of my personal views on what a clay mask &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; be.</li>
            <li>Skin can feel tight but that&#x27;s not a bad thing</li>
            <li>It has a subtle minty-citrus scent, and it applies, dries and rinses off the way most clay masks do.</li>
            <li>Well it seems to really get down into your pores really well--</li>
            <li>I more or less think of Queen Helene clay masks, where they come out thick and you know they are clay masks right off the bat.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what was expected</li>
            <li>it was so pleasing to the skin and make the skin loo fresh and does not dry it unlike other packs.</li>
            <li>, I have oily, acne-prone skin that has become sensitive over years of trying different products.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier to spread, but simultaneously makes it harder to get a thicker layer.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to parabens and when I finally checked the ingredients list, it made sense.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the other one, but this one works really well.</li>
            <li>Freemans is the only kind of clay mask that I have used that isn&#x27;t expensive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>No dry skin here.  </li>
            <li>If you glob it on an inch thick, you have to walk around for 30 minutes with a face full of clay.  </li>
            <li>Bought one of the little packets, and now I&#x27;m back for a whole tube!</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin (like I wash my face and less</li>
            <li>When I took the mask off after approximately 15 minutes, I was amazed how easily the clay was to rinse off my face.  </li>
            <li>I applied a thick layer to my face and noticed the pleasant smell and slight tingling as the clay dried.  </li>
            <li>you are like me, are Italian, and have extremely sensitive combination oily dry skin this product might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Refreshing, put it on thick and let it dry completely but does not clean out pores.</li>

            <li> This clay mask smells great, but you&#x27;ll have to make sure and moisturize after using it!</li>
            <li> It would be a good destressing mask to use because it&#x27;s got an aromatherapy quality to it.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your face</li>
            <li> The mint and lemon scent did sting my eyes quite a bit when you put it on the cheeks under the eyes, but otherwise I loved it.</li>

            <li> I leave it on for 30 minutes and afterwards my face looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I loved the Queen Helena Julip mask, which I&#x27;m sure everyone else does as well</li>

            <li> and it helps my skin look nice.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mask.</li>
            <li> also, honestly can&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin either.</li>
            <li> It smells so lemony, and tightens my skin nicely, after use.</li>
            <li> The texture is really nice and creamy, once on your face</li>
            <li> it has a cooling sensation which I find nice for the summer.</li>
            <li> We have decided to do this once a week because it leaves your face feeling refreshed and very clean!</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean!!</li>
            <li> They make it so unrealistically easy!  </li>
            <li> i have mildly dry/sensitive skin hoping this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> Freeman masks are super cheap, but great quality.</li>
            <li> MY FACE FEELS/LOOKS BETTER.</li>
            <li> We decided to try this tonight, with nothing better to do, and are AMAZED at the results.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> I was able to take it off in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> If I use this once a week, I notice that I don&#x27;t get as many breakouts, and existing acne blemishes heal faster.</li>
            <li> Another winning Freeman product.</li>
            <li> I love all freeman products.</li>
            <li> I tried the cucumber peal mask and I feel this is better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I order this ....</li>
            <li> The lemon and mint is really refreshing too.</li>
            <li> My skin tone appeared more even and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I think what I like the most about this product is that it has a refreshing scent to it, it soaks up all of the oil on my face, it tightens my skin</li>
            <li> , perhaps I should be applying it twice per week or more to get better results, idk.</li>
            <li> (you may get better results than I did)</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s preteen friends love these for their sleepovers.  </li>
            <li> They love their facials together.  </li>
            <li> and it cleaned most of the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I recommend using more moisturizer after using this mask.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and feels.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> The scent is also pleasing...smells lemony and minty, just as the name suggests :)</li>
            <li> I love all of the mask from this brand, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> , I recommend it more than this one.</li>
            <li> Although I love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I love mint products for the tingly feeling you get.</li>
            <li> I really love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Works well as a clay mask, just make sure you like the minty lemony smell that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The mint in it makes it tingly and refreshing.</li>
            <li> So honestly I love this face mask.</li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> It feels better than it has for awhile.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic anytime</li>
            <li> i love love love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this mask not knowing what exactly to expect but owning and using almost all of freemans mask,except the peel-off,hate those kind!  </li>
            <li> It washes off smoothly and has a nice lather when rinsed.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great when I&#x27;m careful with it.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying more of them out.</li>
            <li> I have used Freeman masks for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of face masks.</li>
            <li> Leave ample room around your eyes for tear-free mask cleansing :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and medium thickness, it dries in approx 15 mins, doesnt sting or burn my skin and does a good job leaving my skin clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very clean</li>
            <li> The lemon and mint combination is an invigorating scent, and the mask gives my skin a nice, cool, tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> have been using Freeman&#x27;s Cucumber Mask and it works so much better, leaves your skin feeling refreshed, cleans and removes impurities and most important DOES NOT BURN YOUR FACE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the greatest on black heads but most masks leave me wanting more in that area.</li>
            <li> but this one is cheaper, doesn&#x27;t expire nearly as soon, and my skin feels so great after.</li>
            <li> My skin is super oily and this product keeps it nice and smooth without over-drying or creating excess oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first clay mask I have tried, so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of masques, as my skin is pretty acne prone, and this one is by-far my favorite!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to wash off when it dries.  </li>
            <li> It not only helps ease any sweaty and oily feeling you have on your face, it has a great smell and feels refreshing and cooling on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild, but yet still refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and easy to get off.</li>
            <li> For the ones that this mask doesn&#x27;t eliminate, they&#x27;re usually easy to squeeze out</li>
            <li> I have started using this product and liked it at first, but then started to break out from it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it glides on really easily and smoothly in the beginning, but as it dries it shrinks and wrinkles my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and left my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> My breakouts have stopped since I have started using it also which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue looking until I find one that I feel comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> We purchased a cheap sheet</li>
            <li> (: the whole line of masks are amazing.</li>
            <li> * Smooth Application (I don&#x27;t like gritty-type masks)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soo smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> it works nice on your face but the smell was jsut too much for me since i have sensitivity to smell</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with oily skin and especially visible pores.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t meet my desires in that light.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I wanted to try something different from the Mint Julep mask which is my go-to mask and read great reviews for this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin Smooth</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel very smooth after and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> All his pores are clean and his face is smooth.</li>
            <li> I love clay masks, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and my favorite is the freeman&#x27;s avocado and oatmeal</li>
            <li> * Helps maintain face clean and glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> The mask leaves your pores feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe my acne went right off the surface of my face on just one application!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and gets rid of blackheads and dull skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is kind of sensitive</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much results, face was softer, but I found that Queen Helen&#x27;s Mint Julep mask made my skin look better and brighter afterwards.</li>
            <li> The tingling sensation is a true spa like experience at home on a budget.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for some sort of cool sensation, but didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> lemon cool feeling</li>
            <li> This Freeman mask drys quickly  and makes your skin feel really clean after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask for really cleaning and toning my face.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin, and my face feels so fresh and clean after using this.</li>
            <li> When I was it off my face feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I also like that the clay dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually use a Freeman peel-off mask first, then a clay mask, then a hydrating mask, and my face feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this mask and will make it a regular part of my skin care.</li>
            <li> The price is good and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards :) I would recommend it if you&#x27;re interested in trying something new!</li>
            <li> and I love  what it does makes your skin nice and tight</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin and huge pores.</li>
            <li> Out of all the products freeman makes this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> so I bought a bunch of different kind here.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li> I like the fresh feel after I use the mask on my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> I received the package pretty quickly from this seller.</li>
            <li> It smells good but other than it leaves your face feeling like a desert..</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a huge fan of Freeman masks because of the range of products and affordability (not on Amazon, but on their own website and other online retailers).</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling mask and will dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have very very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was a little worried if this product will be good for me,</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so fresh, clean, and soft.</li>
            <li> It also shows a huge difference directly after you wash the mask off.</li>
            <li> If you rather try it first, Walmart also carried trial packs for about 1.37/pack.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with what kind of face washes I use.</li>
            <li> and I totally fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> The mint is very zesty - don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes, or it will make them water!  </li>
            <li> My pores were minimized after the first use.</li>
            <li> Overall okay.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally dry skin, I would choose a different clay mask as this will definitely dry you out, but if you have oily skin or have oily days like me, or just need a great mask for hot, sweaty days, then you will definitely love this.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft and clean after using this.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I need and what I&#x27;ve been searching for because I have very problematic skin</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re left with a really clean, fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> mask is easy to apply and spread while still retaining similar effects; pores tightening, tingling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I have tried tons including fresh face masks from lush!</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle and is good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For a parent hosting a girl gathering, this is much better than the makeup they cake on at other girls&#x27; houses, both for cleanup of their pretty faces and cleanup in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> and it has never broken me out or irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Using it once a week won&#x27;t really give you the results you&#x27;re expecting.  </li>
            <li> If you use it reasonably so, then in about 10 minutes, you&#x27;re ready to rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> it is the fact that it hasn&#x27;t really done much to help my acne</li>
            <li> and it really hasn&#x27;t done much to tighten my pores</li>
            <li> I really like the Freeman Mint &amp; Lemon Clay Mask, as it cleanses very well and leaves you with a refreshed feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> It has helped my acne so much.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the freeman masks and this one wins out far beyond the rest.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this really helps.</li>
            <li> i think that this product works very well at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This mask did absolutely nothing for her.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> When I use it twice a week, my face doesn&#x27;t produce as much as oil.</li>
            <li> However this mask really relaxes my skin and just stripe it of impurity&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I use this facial clay mask once a week; I get really oily so this is a great means to cleanse my pores without using a harsh cream.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li> You really shouldn&#x27;t be doing that anyways</li>
            <li> QH&#x27;s can be VERY over-drying if used all over the face, and this is coming from someone with oily skin</li>
            <li> just bc of how much it has helped my breakouts and</li>
            <li> The key to this product actually being effective is consistency.  </li>
            <li> It gets nice and firm and my skin appears refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used the Queene Helene green mint juleb mask for decades (the kind you buy in the dollar store)..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily my skin is fine and just flaked off a bit, it eventually healed up and is back to normal but this stuff HURTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to make sure I use it at least 2-3 times per week, and it seems to really purge my pores quickly.  </li>
            <li> Left my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Once rinsed, it makes my skin extra soft, and not any more dried out than most clay masks.</li>
            <li> It toned down my pimples and I love this more than the other freeman&#x27;s mask.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin &amp; it is not my first time using a face mask.</li>
            <li> eventually settled in to a full degree chemical burn that had to be medically treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once per week (during the weekend) for a month now, more or less.  </li>
            <li> Although I guess that smells better than the earthy smell of previous clay masks I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews, i decided to purchase this product hoping that it would help me and my oily skin problem, unfortunately i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after using this mask.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask mainly because it has mint in it.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to try out the other Freeman clay masks now, probably more relaxing ones!</li>
            <li> Very much a classic clay mask.  </li>
            <li> Freeman&#x27;s mint &amp; lemon mask left a noticeable difference after the very first use.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and smooth after use, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Normally my skin is pretty dry, but when I work out or spend a day in the sun or have to wear a lot of make up for the whole day, I notice my skin gets pretty sweaty and oily.</li>
            <li> It cleans up my face very gently and leave it soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Despite the bad reviews this product is the best.</li>
            <li> The amount of time you have to leave it on your face is in direct correlation with how much you use.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean, but if you go in with dry skin it itches like a bitch so watch out.</li>
            <li> packaged,  I have no complaint</li>
            <li> This mask and the Anti-Stress Dead Sea Mineral Mask (also by Freeman) are my top</li>
            <li> strongly recommend researching what is actually in this product prior to purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s face has always been real oily with blackheads and large pores, looks as if there&#x27;s tiny holes in her face.</li>
            <li> One use and my face felt brand new</li>
            <li> I wanted something new to try.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, bought this with a lot of doubts.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY RECOMMEND;)</li>
            <li> Keep it less than 5 minutes, and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I brought this on vacation with my to southern Utah where I ended up doing a lot of hiking in the hot sun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected, nor what I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin pretty dry, which is to be expected from a clay mask, but without the refreshing feeling</li>
            <li> I think I have more than half of the product still left in the tube</li>
            <li> Even my fiance notices that my face has appear to look much smoother, brighter, less oily, surprisingly he even commented \\&quot;I can hardly see your pores anymore!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clear, and when I use it frequently, it helps clear my pores.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and oily skin, btw.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> * Didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> When I washed the masked off my skin felt soft and oil-free.</li>
            <li> I follow the directs and don&#x27;t go near my eyes but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> But this one is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> but I think it helps when I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin, but didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or tightness.</li>
            <li> (am 58 years old).  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put this near your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Overall not a bad mask, but I wouldn&#x27;t chose it again, possibly just because of my personal views on what a clay mask &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; be.</li>
            <li> Skin can feel tight but that&#x27;s not a bad thing</li>
            <li> It has a subtle minty-citrus scent, and it applies, dries and rinses off the way most clay masks do.</li>
            <li> Well it seems to really get down into your pores really well--</li>
            <li> I more or less think of Queen Helene clay masks, where they come out thick and you know they are clay masks right off the bat.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> it was so pleasing to the skin and make the skin loo fresh and does not dry it unlike other packs.</li>
            <li> , I have oily, acne-prone skin that has become sensitive over years of trying different products.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to spread, but simultaneously makes it harder to get a thicker layer.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to parabens and when I finally checked the ingredients list, it made sense.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other one, but this one works really well.</li>
            <li> Freemans is the only kind of clay mask that I have used that isn&#x27;t expensive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> No dry skin here.  </li>
            <li> If you glob it on an inch thick, you have to walk around for 30 minutes with a face full of clay.  </li>
            <li> Bought one of the little packets, and now I&#x27;m back for a whole tube!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin (like I wash my face and less</li>
            <li> When I took the mask off after approximately 15 minutes, I was amazed how easily the clay was to rinse off my face.  </li>
            <li> I applied a thick layer to my face and noticed the pleasant smell and slight tingling as the clay dried.  </li>
            <li> you are like me, are Italian, and have extremely sensitive combination oily dry skin this product might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Refreshing, put it on thick and let it dry completely but does not clean out pores.</li>
            <li> She has acne, and I was hoping for a mask that would at least clean her face out minimally.</li>
            <li> Just mix a bit in palm with a touch of water and it covers my whole face, chin, and neck with very little product.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for the past 2 months or so, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had clear skin up till a few months ago.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 because although the cleansing feeling is instant, it doesn&#x27;t show on your face like with other clay or even peel masks.</li>
            <li> However, my skin was too dry after using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, either.</li>
            <li> I have oily and dry skin</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t take the chance of my face getting dry.</li>
            <li> dont use to often cause it will dry the skin.</li>
            <li> but this takes away that shine without making my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot even imagine what it would do to someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> That being said, the small amount of this product required makes it last a very long time, and a bargain at the really low price.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time experience,  and I am yet to be disappointed,  got my face masks on time, and appropriately.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it more than 3 times a week though, it will dry your face badly.</li>
            <li> I love lemon, so this was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> He had very clogged dirty pores, and after keeping the mask on nearly an hour....</li>
            <li> The scent was also not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been useing this product a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, seafoam/bluish color and smells vaguely minty/lemony (not overwhelming at all).</li>
            <li> a few days ago the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It has become expected at our house!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results each time, and usually by the second application, my face is visibly</li>
            <li> * Results may not be immediately visible, in comparison to peel-away or even other clay masks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; i advise other not to as well.</li>
            <li> I have two other kinds.</li>
            <li> I like how this product smells and feels on my face, especially after a hard workout at the gym.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different masks before and they were hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t simply wash this off at the sink because it hard to splash or wipe off.  </li>
            <li> She says it works well, her only complaint is that it gives her a headache.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s really nothing that can go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> My prior experiences with clay masks were pretty frustrating because the clay was always difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is it stings my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> Within one use I could tell my pores had shrunk, and my skin was less oily.</li>
            <li> I typically use it once a week just to get a deeper face cleanse, and when breakouts occur, I use it 3 to 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> If you use the store coupon ..then u will buy around 3 of these face masks for less than 10 bucks.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and my blackheads are less visible after every use.</li>
            <li> Just a little of it provides all the freshness.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes a little watery at times and burns a little bit</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Minerals Anti-Stress Mask, and dries to feel like clay.</li>
            <li> You can SEE where it&#x27;s seeping out of your pores and onto the dried clay--</li>
            <li> so it somewhat dried mine out but nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad cleans my face really well and doesn&#x27;t sting like some other products do</li>
            <li> i was dead wrong, this product not only dried out my face</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but have been unable to find it locally.</li>
            <li> This stuff game me chemical burns on my face and is up there with other products like Pro-active and Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was hard to find a mask that didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash out.  </li>
            <li> this is my second time ordering this product, very cold when using which i expected, a bit of a pain to get off doesnt stain skin, or clothes.</li>
            <li> I use this product at least 3 times a week</li>
            <li> My skin sucks.)</li>
            <li> than an hour later I can fry chicken on my nose) and had read clay masks are a must-have for my skin type.</li>
            <li> --the skin around your eyes is delicate and doesn&#x27;t need a heavy duty clay mask irritating it.  </li>
            <li> If left on for too long (my bad), it can be difficult to remove from pores and creases.</li>
            <li> blast water at my face, and it&#x27;s usually gone in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, word of warning!  </li>
            <li> Literally, last night I had a huge blemish (like a horrible, painful, under the skin blemish).</li>
            <li> not a good product for me -</li>
            <li> It was not really as good as she hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> this product is no good.</li>
            <li> Its green gray color with a middle of the road lemon scent, not too terrible.</li>
            <li> I assumed this was because of the clay drying (which is not uncommon for clam masks).</li>
            <li> This, however, came out thin and slimy, like the Freeman</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to describe the smell, but the lemon is a little too artificial and the mint just makes it smell weird, and not like mint.</li>
            <li> but i have been bugging my fiance for months to buy us some to do something silly together.  </li>
            <li> I finished the tube and saw no results, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> This has been the worst facial mask experience of my life.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like about the mint julip mask was that it was SOO difficult to squeeze out and smear on your face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I think this is Freemans version of the infamous Mint Julep mask.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my expensive Peter Thomas Roth mask.</li>
            <li> , my skin tends to gravitate towards the shiny forehead and cheek effect every now and then (random oily skin, wut)</li>
            <li> it dries up painfully...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i will purchase this again : (</li>
            <li> It feels like all the nasty oils are gone</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT AND MY FACE FEELS/LOOKS BETTER. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND;)</li>
            <li> My skin is kind of sensitive and I was a little worried if this product will be good for me, but anyway I bought it and i&#x27;m happy with it. It cleans up my face very gently and leave it soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Awesome clay mask ever I wake up in the morning to find that my acne is gone I recommend it too anyone who will buy it I just bought a second tube a few days ago the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin and huge pores. Within one use I could tell my pores had shrunk, and my skin was less oily. I use this product at least 3 times a week and I deffinatly see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much results, face was softer, but I found that Queen Helen&#x27;s Mint Julep mask made my skin look better and brighter afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, bought this with a lot of doubts. I was so happy that i happen to find this product. it was so pleasing to the skin and make the skin loo fresh and does not dry it unlike other packs. Just a little of it provides all the freshness. Love this one and would keep buying it again and again !!</li>
            <li> Refreshing, put it on thick and let it dry completely but does not clean out pores. Try Biore strips for that.</li>
            <li> I have never done a mask before but i have been bugging my fiance for months to buy us some to do something silly together.  We decided to try this tonight, with nothing better to do, and are AMAZED at the results. He had very clogged dirty pores, and after keeping the mask on nearly an hour....i cannot BELIEVE the difference in his face. All his pores are clean and his face is smooth. My face is the same way!!! We have decided to do this once a week because it leaves your face feeling refreshed and very clean! It also shows a huge difference directly after you wash the mask off. If you rather try it first, Walmart also carried trial packs for about 1.37/pack.</li>
            <li> Great face mask, girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  I have very sensitive skin and it has never broken me out or irritated my skin.  My face feels very clean and smooth after use, and a little bit goes a long way.  Just mix a bit in palm with a touch of water and it covers my whole face, chin, and neck with very little product.  I am very pleased with this mask and will make it a regular part of my skin care.</li>
            <li> This is the first clay mask I have tried, so I don&#x27;t know how it compares to others, but I love it! The lemon and mint combination is an invigorating scent, and the mask gives my skin a nice, cool, tingling feeling. I also like that the clay dries quickly. I was able to take it off in 15 minutes. If I use this once a week, I notice that I don&#x27;t get as many breakouts, and existing acne blemishes heal faster. This product has become a staple on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Another winning Freeman product.</li>
            <li> not a good product for me - I have oily skin</li>
            <li> I love all freeman products.</li>
            <li> This is my second time experience,  and I am yet to be disappointed,  got my face masks on time, and appropriately. packaged,  I have no complaint,  my products works as it should,  well packaged and it was delivered on time,  what else can I say,  life is good!  They make it so unrealistically easy!  Love them!</li>
            <li> This clay mask smells great, but you&#x27;ll have to make sure and moisturize after using it! It would be a good destressing mask to use because it&#x27;s got an aromatherapy quality to it.</li>
            <li> Despite the bad reviews this product is the best. I have very sensitive skin so it was hard to find a mask that didn&#x27;t break me out. But this stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out and brightens my skin. I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I tried the cucumber peal mask and I feel this is better. I haven&#x27;t tried the other one, but this one works really well.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product everywhere but I can never seem to find it except at walmart, but they only sell it in individual packages. I love the way it feels on my skin. It decreases the size of my pores. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 months, using it about two to three times a week. Even my fiance notices that my face has appear to look much smoother, brighter, less oily, surprisingly he even commented \\&quot;I can hardly see your pores anymore!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Feels good on your face I&#x27;m glad I order this .... I will be getting more of this stuff !!!</li>
            <li> The key to this product actually being effective is consistency.  Using it once a week won&#x27;t really give you the results you&#x27;re expecting.  I try to make sure I use it at least 2-3 times per week, and it seems to really purge my pores quickly.  The amount of time you have to leave it on your face is in direct correlation with how much you use.  If you glob it on an inch thick, you have to walk around for 30 minutes with a face full of clay.  If you use it reasonably so, then in about 10 minutes, you&#x27;re ready to rinse it off.  That being said, the small amount of this product required makes it last a very long time, and a bargain at the really low price.  The lemon and mint is really refreshing too.</li>
            <li> I bought this clay mask because I have oily skin and larger sized pores.  I applied a thick layer to my face and noticed the pleasant smell and slight tingling as the clay dried.  When I took the mask off after approximately 15 minutes, I was amazed how easily the clay was to rinse off my face.  My prior experiences with clay masks were pretty frustrating because the clay was always difficult to remove.  Freeman&#x27;s mint &amp; lemon mask left a noticeable difference after the very first use. My skin tone appeared more even and brighter.  Very happy with this mask, perfect for oily skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews, i decided to purchase this product hoping that it would help me and my oily skin problem, unfortunately i didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after using this mask. I don&#x27;t think i will purchase this again : (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once per week (during the weekend) for a month now, more or less.  I apply a moderate amount all over my face and neck...I have adult acne and oily skin, btw.  I think what I like the most about this product is that it has a refreshing scent to it, it soaks up all of the oil on my face, it tightens my skin and it&#x27;s easy to wash off when it dries.  I think I have more than half of the product still left in the tube and I think it is reasonably priced.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is the fact that it hasn&#x27;t really done much to help my acne and it really hasn&#x27;t done much to tighten my pores, perhaps I should be applying it twice per week or more to get better results, idk. I plan on finishing the tube and I would recommend it to others (you may get better results than I did) but I don&#x27;t think that I will be repurchasing.  I think the next face mask that I would like to try is Queen Helene&#x27;s mud mask...I&#x27;ll continue looking until I find one that I feel comfortable with.  Hope this helps.    Updated review just in case:  I finished the tube and saw no results, unfortunately.  I tried using it once per week, several times per week and even as an overnight spot treatment, but I never got any noticeable results.  I think I&#x27;ll keep my rating at three stars.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask! Helps immensely with the breakouts! Couldn&#x27;t believe my acne went right off the surface of my face on just one application! Will buy this mask for life! Life saver! Please keep making this product and never ever change the formula Freeman!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s preteen friends love these for their sleepovers.  It has become expected at our house!  They love their facials together.  For a parent hosting a girl gathering, this is much better than the makeup they cake on at other girls&#x27; houses, both for cleanup of their pretty faces and cleanup in our bathroom.  We purchased a cheap sheet (so it doesn&#x27;t get on the furniture or carpet) and rolled up towels so they could apply then lay and watch a girly movie to feel like they were getting royal treatment.  Or add a cucumber and let them gab.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean, but if you go in with dry skin it itches like a bitch so watch out.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and its texture. Really great lemon smell and it cleaned most of the pores on my nose. However, my skin was too dry after using it. I recommend using more moisturizer after using this mask.</li>
            <li> Literally, last night I had a huge blemish (like a horrible, painful, under the skin blemish). I put this on it, got in the bath, watched an episode of FRIENDS and then got out the bath. I rinsed off the mask, went to bed, and when I woke up this morning the blemish was gone! Now I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle product but it definitely deserves 5 stars. This is exactly what I need and what I&#x27;ve been searching for because I have very problematic skin and this definitely controls oils and blemishes (: the whole line of masks are amazing. (:</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend&#x27;s wedding shower and she loved it, perfect for a de-stress kit.</li>
            <li> This was an order that my daughter placed. It was not really as good as she hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It smells amazing and left my skin feeling amazing. The price is good and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have use this product before and I love  what it does makes your skin nice and tight, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of masques, as my skin is pretty acne prone, and this one is by-far my favorite! Leaves skin clear, and when I use it frequently, it helps clear my pores. But I would definitely suggest following with a moisturizer, as it can be drying.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what kind of face washes I use. Freemans is the only kind of clay mask that I have used that isn&#x27;t expensive and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love the way it smells and feels. Out of all the products freeman makes this is by far my favorite. I will definitely order this again since I can&#x27;t find it instores.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very clean and I saw a difference in pore size as well. Love it and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find mud masks anywhere anymore. Needed some stuff for a weekend campout with girls so I bought a bunch of different kind here. Not the best value but I needed clay masks.</li>
            <li> The mint and lemon scent did sting my eyes quite a bit when you put it on the cheeks under the eyes, but otherwise I loved it. It feels so soft and clean after using this. Skin can feel tight but that&#x27;s not a bad thing</li>
            <li> I really like the Freeman Mint &amp; Lemon Clay Mask, as it cleanses very well and leaves you with a refreshed feeling on your face. The scent is also pleasing...smells lemony and minty, just as the name suggests :) However, I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 because although the cleansing feeling is instant, it doesn&#x27;t show on your face like with other clay or even peel masks. I do have to say though that it does help with blemishes. I typically use it once a week just to get a deeper face cleanse, and when breakouts occur, I use it 3 to 4 times a week. I&#x27;ve seen results each time, and usually by the second application, my face is visibly clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Helps maintain face clean and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;* Prevents/Gets Rid of Blemishes&lt;br /&gt;* Refreshing&lt;br /&gt;* Smells Terrific!&lt;br /&gt;* Didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;* Smooth Application (I don&#x27;t like gritty-type masks)&lt;br /&gt;* Practical Container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Results may not be immediately visible, in comparison to peel-away or even other clay masks.&lt;br /&gt;* If left on for too long (my bad), it can be difficult to remove from pores and creases. Keep it less than 5 minutes, and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I bought these at a local ulta store for 3.99 each.  If you use the store coupon ..then u will buy around 3 of these face masks for less than 10 bucks.  Regarding the face masks...they are excellent.  Skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This has been the worst facial mask experience of my life. I followed the directions but when the mask was drying it began to itch. I assumed this was because of the clay drying (which is not uncommon for clam masks). However, I had to remove it soon thereafter because the itching became intolerable. I removed it quickly only to find my skin irritated &amp; it feels as if its been burnt. Perhaps it is a chemical burn? I do not have sensitive skin &amp; it is not my first time using a face mask. I never write product reviews but hope this prevents others from having this experience. I will NOT be using any of this company&#x27;s products ever again &amp; i advise other not to as well. It&#x27;s been hours &amp; my face is still red!</li>
            <li> Normally my skin is pretty dry, but when I work out or spend a day in the sun or have to wear a lot of make up for the whole day, I notice my skin gets pretty sweaty and oily. I brought this on vacation with my to southern Utah where I ended up doing a lot of hiking in the hot sun and I totally fell in love with it. It not only helps ease any sweaty and oily feeling you have on your face, it has a great smell and feels refreshing and cooling on your face. When I washed the masked off my skin felt soft and oil-free. If you have naturally dry skin, I would choose a different clay mask as this will definitely dry you out, but if you have oily skin or have oily days like me, or just need a great mask for hot, sweaty days, then you will definitely love this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad cleans my face really well and doesn&#x27;t sting like some other products do</li>
            <li> I love all of the mask from this brand, but this one is my favorite. I leave it on for 30 minutes and afterwards my face looks and feels amazing. It has helped my acne so much. You can get it at alta for 4 bucks though.. Just saying.</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this, and she likes it. She says it works well, her only complaint is that it gives her a headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of clay masks over the years, but this one is my favorite! Freeman products are great and this leaves my skin feeling wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like how this product smells and feels on my face, especially after a hard workout at the gym. However, after using it for the past 2 months or so, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done much for my skin. I&#x27;m going to try upping my usage to twice a week and see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have oily, acne-prone skin that has become sensitive over years of trying different products. This mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, either. (Surprisingly, that is also an issue I have with my skin. My skin sucks.)</li>
            <li> I love clay masks, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and my favorite is the freeman&#x27;s avocado and oatmeal, I recommend it more than this one. Although I love the scent of this one. There is a slight tingle and is good for sensitive skin. Only time will tell if there is a drastic difference but they both make my face feel tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the freeman masks and this one wins out far beyond the rest. Leaves my skin feeling soo smooth and refreshed. The tingling sensation is a true spa like experience at home on a budget.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask mainly because it has mint in it. I love mint products for the tingly feeling you get. I was hoping for some sort of cool sensation, but didn&#x27;t get it. I still like this mask. It gets nice and firm and my skin appears refreshed after using it. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this! Bought me the sample and it worked so well on me, I had to buy this one. My face loves anything with lemon for some reason. It toned down my pimples and I love this more than the other freeman&#x27;s mask. It doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the avocado one but it works wonders for my skin. I have acne prone skin &amp; scars. I just place this as a spot treatment overnight and it reduces the size. Deff need to give this a try!</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells and it lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s not a salon quality mask but its great for the price.</li>
            <li> i have mildly dry/sensitive skin hoping this would be a good product. i was dead wrong, this product not only dried out my face but i had a perfect shadow of where it was on my face. it also left me with red bumps and irritated skin. this product is no good. hope this review helped you.</li>
            <li> I loved the Queen Helena Julip mask, which I&#x27;m sure everyone else does as well but this is a great alternative! One thing I didn&#x27;t like about the mint julip mask was that it was SOO difficult to squeeze out and smear on your face.&lt;br /&gt;This mask is easy to apply and spread while still retaining similar effects; pores tightening, tingling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing the mask for the 10 minutes, my face felt like it was breathing. I am definitely going to try out the other Freeman clay masks now, probably more relaxing ones! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover this brand sooner.</li>
            <li> I think this is Freemans version of the infamous Mint Julep mask. I use both since they are not tested on animals and don&#x27;t contain animal ingredients. This mask dries in about 10 minutes and helps reduce oil and dries up pimples. Not the greatest on black heads but most masks leave me wanting more in that area. Good product for the price and cruelty-free factor.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to  have a tingling feeling or feel some sort of minty feeling. I wasn&#x27;t impress with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this really helps. It takes out all of the oil, but you will definitely need a moisturizer after using.</li>
            <li> I follow the directs and don&#x27;t go near my eyes but something in it burns my eyes a bit. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> i think that this product works very well at a reasonable price. I really love it a lot. I recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Works well as a clay mask, just make sure you like the minty lemony smell that comes with it. Although I guess that smells better than the earthy smell of previous clay masks I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> it works nice on your face but the smell was jsut too much for me since i have sensitivity to smell</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She has acne, and I was hoping for a mask that would at least clean her face out minimally. This mask did absolutely nothing for her.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with oily skin and especially visible pores. The smell is fresh and not overpowering. Great value!</li>
            <li> One use and my face felt brand new and I love the tingling sensation the best mask by Freeman I&#x27;ve used so far the others are good but this one became my favorite</li>
            <li> First of all, I am a huge fan of Freeman masks because of the range of products and affordability (not on Amazon, but on their own website and other online retailers). But this one is my least favorite. When I think of a clay mask, this is not what comes to mind. I more or less think of Queen Helene clay masks, where they come out thick and you know they are clay masks right off the bat. This, however, came out thin and slimy, like the Freeman Dead Sea Minerals Anti-Stress Mask, and dries to feel like clay. This makes it much easier to spread, but simultaneously makes it harder to get a thicker layer. I like semi-thick layers for clay masks, unlike peels, so this didn&#x27;t meet my desires in that light. It also left my skin pretty dry, which is to be expected from a clay mask, but without the refreshing feeling I get from Queen Helene masks. The scent was also not what I expected. I love lemon, so this was a little disappointing. It&#x27;s very hard to describe the smell, but the lemon is a little too artificial and the mint just makes it smell weird, and not like mint. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected, nor what I would prefer. Overall not a bad mask, but I wouldn&#x27;t chose it again, possibly just because of my personal views on what a clay mask &amp;#34;should&amp;#34; be.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  Cap is fl;flimsy and broke off.</li>
            <li> Bought one of the little packets, and now I&#x27;m back for a whole tube! Once it dries it soaks up the oil on your face. You can SEE where it&#x27;s seeping out of your pores and onto the dried clay--AWESOME. It smells great, too. More lemon-y than mint, which I like a lot!</li>
            <li> I love it. it feels great on my face. it&#x27;s a great product to have. best combination lemon and mint. go for it!</li>
            <li> The mint in it makes it tingly and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good. I have oily and dry skin and it helps my skin look nice. I would recommend and will buy it again. Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Love this mask!  Leaves skin feeling soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> So honestly I love this face mask. And I have tried tons including fresh face masks from lush! I do like them but this one is cheaper, doesn&#x27;t expire nearly as soon, and my skin feels so great after. Really. It feels like all the nasty oils are gone and it&#x27;s the prettiest matte look and sometimes I don&#x27;t even want to put makeup on after but I do cus it&#x27;s fun :). Oh, and my blackheads are less visible after every use. So it helps with pimples and blackheads too.</li>
            <li> Everybody must understand that everybody&#x27;s skin type is different. What may work wonders for me may do nothing for you, or you may have a reaction to it! Amazon ships to people all over the world, so these reviews are from all over!&lt;br /&gt;My review-- I love it! I have oily skin. I&#x27;ve always had clear skin up till a few months ago. My mom&#x27;s face has always been real oily with blackheads and large pores, looks as if there&#x27;s tiny holes in her face. I always hoped my face never looked like that. Not sure what&#x27;s going on but I started useing this and I put &amp;#34;clearpores&amp;#34; lotion on afterwards so i don&#x27;t take the chance of my face getting dry. My face feels so clean!! It feels better than it has for awhile. I&#x27;ve only been useing this product a few days and I can definitely tell a difference!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this mask. It has a subtle minty-citrus scent, and it applies, dries and rinses off the way most clay masks do. Once rinsed, it makes my skin extra soft, and not any more dried out than most clay masks. It hasn&#x27;t been a miracle cure for my blackheads/acne but I think it helps when I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> I wanted something simple to wash my face every night with and this did it. I like the fresh feel after I use the mask on my face. Don&#x27;t use it more than 3 times a week though, it will dry your face badly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic anytime i have a bit of redness and acne i use this and it zaps redness and the size of acne i love love love it</li>
            <li> I have started using this product and liked it at first, but then started to break out from it. My skin is sensitive to parabens and when I finally checked the ingredients list, it made sense. There are 3 different ones in it.... &#x3D; garbage.</li>
            <li> it dries up painfully...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it glides on really easily and smoothly in the beginning, but as it dries it shrinks and wrinkles my skin. also, honestly can&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin either. i prefer the mint julep mask.</li>
            <li> Very much a classic clay mask.  The mint is very zesty - don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes, or it will make them water!  Leaves your skin feeling deep cleaned.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask! I have used this product for years, but have been unable to find it locally. It makes my face feel so fresh, clean, and soft. It smells so lemony, and tightens my skin nicely, after use. Would recommend this to any of my friends. All time favorite facial....ever!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin (like I wash my face and less than an hour later I can fry chicken on my nose) and had read clay masks are a must-have for my skin type. This mask worked wonders! My pores were minimized after the first use. When I use it twice a week, my face doesn&#x27;t produce as much as oil. I just have to stick to it to see those results.</li>
            <li> This stuff game me chemical burns on my face and is up there with other products like Pro-active and Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend researching what is actually in this product prior to purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon cool feeling I got from my face eventually settled in to a full degree chemical burn that had to be medically treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily my skin is fine and just flaked off a bit, it eventually healed up and is back to normal but this stuff HURTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, are Italian, and have extremely sensitive combination oily dry skin this product might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Freeman&#x27;s Cucumber Mask and it works so much better, leaves your skin feeling refreshed, cleans and removes impurities and most important DOES NOT BURN YOUR FACE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005NFBJ Freeman Cucumber Facial Peel Off Mask]]</li>
            <li> Although it claims to help pores, i dont see any difference. However this mask really relaxes my skin and just stripe it of impurity&#x27;s. It&#x27;s great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mask not knowing what exactly to expect but owning and using almost all of freemans mask,except the peel-off,hate those kind!  Its green gray color with a middle of the road lemon scent, not too terrible. It goes on smooth and medium thickness, it dries in approx 15 mins, doesnt sting or burn my skin and does a good job leaving my skin clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> I received the package pretty quickly from this seller. I use this facial clay mask once a week; I get really oily so this is a great means to cleanse my pores without using a harsh cream. It&#x27;s very mild, but yet still refreshes my skin. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I needed. This is a nice smelling mask and will dry in about 10 minutes. It washes off smoothly and has a nice lather when rinsed. My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards. Remember to always put a moisturizer on after cleansing though to protect your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I wanted to try something different from the Mint Julep mask which is my go-to mask and read great reviews for this one. The texture is really nice and creamy, once on your face it has a cooling sensation which I find nice for the summer. I have oily, sensitive skin, but didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or tightness. My skin felt clean and refreshed afterwards :) I would recommend it if you&#x27;re interested in trying something new!</li>
            <li> The lemon and mint combo is wonderful together. Easy to put on and easy to get off. I&#x27;ve used different masks before and they were hard to get off. Made my skin feel very smooth after and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have used the Queene Helene green mint juleb mask for decades (the kind you buy in the dollar store).. I have very very oily skin.  (am 58 years old).  I wanted something new to try.  This Freeman mask drys quickly  and makes your skin feel really clean after you rinse it off.  I will order it again when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> This is a good face mask. It makes my eyes a little watery at times and burns a little bit and I sometimes end up having to wipe it off. Might just be me, but I&#x27;m not allergic to anything so I don&#x27;t know. Smells great, feels great when I&#x27;m careful with it. Overall okay.</li>
            <li> this is my second time ordering this product, very cold when using which i expected, a bit of a pain to get off doesnt stain skin, or clothes. helps with the redness in my face, its blue so counteracts the red. dont use to often cause it will dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask. I have rather regular skin so it somewhat dried mine out but nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. The mask leaves your pores feeling clean. For this price I recommend to anyone. Great buy</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, inexpensive clay face mask. It&#x27;s a light, seafoam/bluish color and smells vaguely minty/lemony (not overwhelming at all). I leave it on for about 20 minutes and wash off. I do it 2-3 times per week. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and my face feels so fresh and clean after using this. It works just as well as my expensive Peter Thomas Roth mask. Freeman masks are super cheap, but great quality. I look forward to trying more of them out.</li>
            <li> I love this mask for really cleaning and toning my face.  It smells wonderful and gets rid of blackheads and dull skin.  I usually use a Freeman peel-off mask first, then a clay mask, then a hydrating mask, and my face feels wonderful.  They all smell great, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I&#x27;m a fan for life!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Freeman masks for many, many years. Had not seen this one before. I love it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin Smooth</li>
            <li> I love this brand of face masks. I have two other kinds. It is very relaxing and calming. I have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any problems. Look around before you buy tho because I found the same things for $2 at a local store.</li>
            <li> I use this mask 1-2 times a week because I have blackheads up the wazoo and my regular exfoliation/cleansing routine leaves my skin a bit...dull.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the masks from the Freeman line but this remains my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?  Well it seems to really get down into your pores really well--and it eliminates a good amount of my blackheads.  For the ones that this mask doesn&#x27;t eliminate, they&#x27;re usually easy to squeeze out so you&#x27;re left with a really clean, fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin tends to gravitate towards the shiny forehead and cheek effect every now and then (random oily skin, wut) but this takes away that shine without making my skin dry.  No dry skin here.  Just makes my skin feel softer, smoother, and I think brighter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe?  It&#x27;s hard to wash out.  I can&#x27;t simply wash this off at the sink because it hard to splash or wipe off.  I go in the shower, blast water at my face, and it&#x27;s usually gone in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, word of warning!  Don&#x27;t put this near your eyes.  You really shouldn&#x27;t be doing that anyways--the skin around your eyes is delicate and doesn&#x27;t need a heavy duty clay mask irritating it.  This mask will irritate your eyes and make them watery if you put it too close to your eyes, so don&#x27;t do that.  Leave ample room around your eyes for tear-free mask cleansing :)</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised. It&#x27;s basically just a blue facial mask so there&#x27;s really nothing that can go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I just ordered my second bottle! It smells great, and leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and refreshed. It states that it is &#x27;perfect for oily skin&#x27; and I absolutely agree! My skin is super oily and this product keeps it nice and smooth without over-drying or creating excess oil. This mask and the Anti-Stress Dead Sea Mineral Mask (also by Freeman) are my top two favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, compared to Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Mask: I feel as if this is good for all over the skin whereas QH&#x27;s is best used as a spot treatment. QH&#x27;s can be VERY over-drying if used all over the face, and this is coming from someone with oily skin so I cannot even imagine what it would do to someone with dry skin. Overall, if you&#x27;re trying to decide between the two, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is a good go-to product. I&#x27;ve used it for sometime now when I feel my skin needs a pick-me-up. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> It smells good but other than it leaves your face feeling like a desert..dry</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, superfast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> I have used some mask products that do not smell all that great. this one had a great smell And worked as it is suppose to. Left my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask. I can feel it tightening my face and it smells so good. My breakouts have stopped since I have started using it also which is a huge plus. When I was it off my face feels so clean and fresh. Only complaint is it stings my eyes a little. But I get over that just bc of how much it has helped my breakouts and it feels so good on my skin.</li>
