            <li>The mary kay timewise day and night solution has been one of my best product to use on a daily basis because it helps my skin look clean and it helps eliminate pimples scars and makes my face look smooth and health.</li>

            <li>I really love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s products, but the day solution in the Timewise Set leaves the skin on my face feeling a certain way.</li>
            <li>skin feels really nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and buying it through this buyer was much cheaper than and faster than searching around town for someone who sells Mary Kay, then waiting for them to put in the order and wait a while to receive it.</li>
            <li>Really works for me to make my skin feel and look better.</li>
            <li>thanks, very satisfied with my purchase, will order more at a later date, before i run out .</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fresh at night and moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li>right after it came out.</li>

            <li>Great products for ladies in their late 20&#x27;s, early 30&#x27;s, get a jump on it now! :)</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost a third of the bottle so far to help my skin get better faster and its working its magic.</li>
            <li>These are well worth the price, especially here on Amazon, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful that I stumbled upon these products.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>If you want a pretty.</li>
            <li>From quality to shipping,  very well done!</li>
            <li>This is one of the two products I use daily, and I LOVE LOVE them, the Day Solution goes on after the shower, and before make up (daily) and the night solution is every night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for years now and at first I didn&#x27;t even bother with using this set and returned it stating that I needed to use my acne medicated stuff instead.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the promtness</li>
            <li>Have used the Timewise line for years and find I like it very well.</li>
            <li>The price caught my attention...very much a steal of a deal.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the nighttime solution is perfect for my skin, it does give me a little more moisture than the daytime solution, but I still have to use a little</li>
            <li>I really like it these products.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>, I really like</li>
            <li>These both really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in college now) and had so much scarring resulting from that.</li>
            <li>It took a couple months or so, but even my friends have noticed how my scarring is finally healing and is so faded and how much more radiant and soft my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay Products for almost 10 years now, and I&#x27;m near 40, I always get compliments on my skin, so I must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li>Then after getting this set again due to much convincing I discovered that the night solution CLEARS UP MY SKIN so fast that it was a miracle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this last week and it got to me super fast.</li>
            <li>The night solution is not oily and thick is soaks in quickly and is refreshing.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Keeps your face smooth and balances the oily vs. dry areas.</li>
            <li>I had tons of acne scarring from severe acne in high school</li>
            <li>happy wife, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying her this product.</li>
            <li>Any extra protection I can get is worth it</li>
            <li>Product was in new condition and not \\&quot;old\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>One of my can&#x27;t live without items.</li>
            <li>Product was supposed to be new in an unopened box.</li>
            <li>No one believes I&#x27;m as old as I am.</li>
            <li>It has been several years now and believe it has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to the mature woman with discriminating taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay</li>
            <li>I am surprised it got to me without coming out of the package.</li>
            <li>I have always used Mary Kay and it keeps me from looking old in my face.  </li>
            <li>The TimeWise Day was very liquid as someone mixed it with water.</li>
            <li>The one I bought directly from Mary Kay was thicker.</li>
            <li>very fast service with products as I expected</li>
            <li>lst time I requested it it was missing alot of the item, but this time it came in full.  </li>
            <li>I applied it to my entire face which was suffering after using too much Tylenol (it hurts your liver which is the bodies cleaner, if it can&#x27;t clean then the toxins/bad stuff tries to exit the body in other ways, ie through your skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have great things to say about these products, but nothing bad either.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have great things to say about these products, but nothing bad either.  </li>
            <li> i used them every single day!</li>
            <li> For some reason they have a weird small, specially the night lotion.</li>
            <li> Now I am getting under eye wrinkles and bought over 500.00 of Estee Lauder and the only thing seems to work is the night repair serum, kills dead skin, the I ordered from Seropha Kate Sommersville eye repair gave 150.00 for a .5 oz bottle and used it now for over a week and for that price and such a small bottle, not sure of that, so if any Mary Kay reads this, please guide me to the products I am looking for!</li>
            <li> Also, it should last you approximately 3 months.</li>
            <li> I started to use them a few days ago and it seems like it is working.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if you are supposed to apply it and then moisturize, but I was under the impression that these are moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Not sure why that was.</li>
            <li> and the glow is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked to find this delivered the very next day.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay for at least 25 years!  </li>
            <li> it dried my skin out badly.</li>
            <li> It is ILLEGAL to sell Mary Kay products online!!</li>
            <li> was very disappointed she said was all</li>
            <li> The way the product was packaged was awful.</li>
            <li> It was the worst my skins been in a year and within one night</li>

            <li> Very happy with the service you provide and the discounts.</li>
            <li> 2 for 1 deal is good, but I use the one with the sunscreen more than the night one.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years.  Only purchased thru Amazon because of the savings.  The line gives me the youthful skin that I desire.</li>
            <li> Been using it for YEARS. Wouldn&#x27;t do without it. No one believes I&#x27;m as old as I am. I&#x27;m sure this has helped.</li>
            <li> great product and very timely arrival - thanks!</li>
            <li> thanks, very satisfied with my purchase, will order more at a later date, before i run out . skin feels really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product, was a great price.</li>
            <li> This day and night routine is great for ageing skin.  Very light.  The day solution is wonderful under makeup, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and the service</li>
            <li> I have not used the night solution yet but the day radiance seems to be different in the way that the cream is thinner and it leaves my face with a shine unlike any that I have used before. Even so, I will probably continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have great things to say about these products, but nothing bad either.  My skin feels good after using both,</li>
            <li> It is ILLEGAL to sell Mary Kay products online!! Not to mention unsafe!! PLEASE go thorough a local consultant!!</li>
            <li> I am one who have proven the wonders of using these products. Your skin looks healthy and youthful, the compliments are on going, beautiful is the result.</li>
            <li> I like this. Hopefully it is helping with my wrinkles on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;I would reorder again from here, when needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mary Kay products for years.  I started using the Day and Night Solution right after it came out. It has been several years now and believe it has really helped my skin. It is fantastic and I highly recommend it. Also, it should last you approximately 3 months.</li>
            <li> The price caught my attention...very much a steal of a deal. Product was in new condition and not \\&quot;old\\&quot;. Have used product for years...very good.</li>
            <li> This product is good I guess, I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 10days and it has made my face softer and silkier and that&#x27;s about it. Lol I&#x27;m not even sure what it&#x27;s suppose to do in the first place. I only ordered it because I really needed a moisturizer for the harsh winter weather.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay for at least 25 years!  Very pleased with the results!  I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> good product, received promptly.</li>
            <li> I really love all of Mary Kay&#x27;s products, but the day solution in the Timewise Set leaves the skin on my face feeling a certain way. I am not sure if you are supposed to apply it and then moisturize, but I was under the impression that these are moisturizers. On the other hand, the nighttime solution is perfect for my skin, it does give me a little more moisture than the daytime solution, but I still have to use a little but of the gel moisturizer from Mary Kay - which by the way is perfection - in order to achieve the look and feel that I want. I would recommend this to the mature woman with discriminating taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay</li>
            <li> I have been using this since it came out. I really like it these products. No allergic reactions to either one.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for years</li>
            <li> This Night and Day cream is my favorite. The night solution is not oily and thick is soaks in quickly and is refreshing. The day cream goes amazing under makeup without feeling oily and the spf is high.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my skin</li>
            <li> I first bought it from a rep and liked it. Then found it on amazon for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Good price... Quick delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it. Have been using it for 25years. Not kidding when I say everyone. Thinks I look ten years younger then I am. I&#x27;ll never tell. My skin is smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> Order received in timely manner.  Products were just what I ordered.  Very Pleased!!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Promise what they said.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and my wife uses it every day. If you want a pretty. happy wife, you can&#x27;t go wrong buying her this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay for many years. I stopped using it at one point to see if I could tell a difference and boy, could I! This is an excellent product and a good price. Recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, never bought it online but I have used it for a year now and I don&#x27;t look over 32 and I am 47. Now I am getting under eye wrinkles and bought over 500.00 of Estee Lauder and the only thing seems to work is the night repair serum, kills dead skin, the I ordered from Seropha Kate Sommersville eye repair gave 150.00 for a .5 oz bottle and used it now for over a week and for that price and such a small bottle, not sure of that, so if any Mary Kay reads this, please guide me to the products I am looking for! I spoke with a lady was in her 80s and looked to be 50 something she said make sure it has rentional in it, I am so lost!</li>
            <li> Lovely cream, I really like</li>
            <li> I really love this product and buying it through this buyer was much cheaper than and faster than searching around town for someone who sells Mary Kay, then waiting for them to put in the order and wait a while to receive it. Received it quickly and love this product. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> To watery. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with delivery and product!</li>
            <li> Well done!  From quality to shipping,  very well done!</li>
            <li> The product was as described.  The price was also very good.  The way the product was packaged was awful. I am surprised it got to me without coming out of the package.</li>
            <li> Daytime solution expired Feb. 2014</li>
            <li> very fast service with products as I expected</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes my skin feel fresh at night and moisturized in the morning. can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay products 15 years and its the only product that works for my skin type. The mary kay timewise day and night solution has been one of my best product to use on a daily basis because it helps my skin look clean and it helps eliminate pimples scars and makes my face look smooth and health. I would recommend this product to anyone that has problems with oily skin and acne problem. You will like the feeling of waking up to a beautiful and fresh look in the morning.</li>
            <li> I personally dn&#x27;t use this product I just bought it for my mom who uses this...I bought it as a present for her since I know it is one of the things she loves and prefers to use</li>
            <li> I have always used Mary Kay and it keeps me from looking old in my face.  Easy to use and feels good.</li>
            <li> Always has been one of my favorite MK products. Keeps your face smooth and balances the oily vs. dry areas. One of my can&#x27;t live without items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay Products for almost 10 years now, and I&#x27;m near 40, I always get compliments on my skin, so I must be doing something right.  This is one of the two products I use daily, and I LOVE LOVE them, the Day Solution goes on after the shower, and before make up (daily) and the night solution is every night before I go to bed.  Seller was prompt, and product arrived in tact.  Great products for ladies in their late 20&#x27;s, early 30&#x27;s, get a jump on it now! :)</li>
            <li> The TimeWise Day was very liquid as someone mixed it with water. The one I bought directly from Mary Kay was thicker.</li>
            <li> it dried my skin out badly.</li>
            <li> The nigh solution is really good.</li>
            <li> These both really helped my skin. I had tons of acne scarring from severe acne in high school (I&#x27;m in college now) and had so much scarring resulting from that. These, especially the night serum, helped my skin a ton and they last for MONTHS. These are well worth the price, especially here on Amazon, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful that I stumbled upon these products. It took a couple months or so, but even my friends have noticed how my scarring is finally healing and is so faded and how much more radiant and soft my skin looks. I&#x27;d totally recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like Mary Kay products, those are really good.</li>
            <li> was out dated won&#x27;t order any more  on here was very disappointed she said was all she had  it doesn&#x27;t fill right</li>
            <li> Love it.  I hope to use it for life.</li>
            <li> Really works for me to make my skin feel and look better. I like the convenience of ordering it on-line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for years now and at first I didn&#x27;t even bother with using this set and returned it stating that I needed to use my acne medicated stuff instead. Then after getting this set again due to much convincing I discovered that the night solution CLEARS UP MY SKIN so fast that it was a miracle. I ordered this last week and it got to me super fast. I applied it to my entire face which was suffering after using too much Tylenol (it hurts your liver which is the bodies cleaner, if it can&#x27;t clean then the toxins/bad stuff tries to exit the body in other ways, ie through your skin and you get acne). It was the worst my skins been in a year and within one night 50% of the acne and redness was gone. I&#x27;ve used almost a third of the bottle so far to help my skin get better faster and its working its magic. EVERYONE should use the NIGHT SOLUTION it has antioxidants essential for skin&#x27;s renewal process in it. As for the day stuff I don&#x27;t go in the sun so I don&#x27;t bother using it.</li>
            <li> Product was supposed to be new in an unopened box. It had been opened and used before being shipped to me</li>
            <li> i used them every single day! My face has never felt better!</li>
            <li> being using it for sometime and it works for me, lst time I requested it it was missing alot of the item, but this time it came in full.  Not sure why that was.</li>
            <li> I love timewise, it makes my face feel so good and the glow is unbelievable. I have been using this for 5 years and I love it</li>
            <li> Yes it does ....the time is perfect. ...very good.</li>
            <li> Amazon always has great products and great prices.  This Mary Kay solution I love. Great for underneath the moisture cream.</li>
            <li> This combination makes skin care a dash easier. There are some product systems out there that have so many steps it is almost like putting together a puzzle. The Day/Night solutions paired with the moisturizer and face wash have made a difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Products are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> Given as a gift; person enjoyed it</li>
            <li> Love this skin care product. Not as fond of their make up line but skin care line I would recommend</li>
            <li> I love these two items.  Any extra protection I can get is worth it and these seem to help me.</li>
            <li> Verry good product and fast</li>
            <li> I started to use them a few days ago and it seems like it is working. For some reason they have a weird small, specially the night lotion.</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay Products ♡♡♡</li>
