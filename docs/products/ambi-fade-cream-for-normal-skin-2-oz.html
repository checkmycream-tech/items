            <li>but if you are patient, you will be happy.</li>
            <li>I use it on both my hands and face and am fairly happy with it.</li>
            <li>even if they don&#x27;t change any more then they are now, I&#x27;m still extremely happy with the results!    </li>
            <li>but it does a good job.   </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife, she has fair skin and freckles.</li>
            <li>The sun reeks havoc on her fair skin making her freckles darker.</li>
            <li>now i can look in the mirror and see that my skin has change and that make me cry and it feel so good</li>
            <li>It did smell good though.</li>

            <li>I have fair skin that freckles easily.  </li>
            <li>and it was great for the first couple uses</li>

            <li>She was letting me know the economy is no excuse for not looking and being our best...</li>
            <li>That worked great and the results are fast.</li>
            <li>It really seems like it is helping greatly</li>
            <li>love the convenience of the tube.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after researching many products for fading skin discoloration.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need to fade them afterwards :-)</li>
            <li>could go out with your facialist and get helpful hints :)</li>
            <li>I love that it is SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>And if you are going to use ANY lightening cream, be mindful that you are going to be more photosensitive afterwords; wear sunscreen.the spots to return once you have finishing using Ambi, because the skin&#x27;s melanin is what makes us tan &amp; freckle; protecting &amp; reacting to the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>And if you are going to use ANY lightening cream, be mindful that you are going to be more photosensitive afterwords; wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>You do have to make sure you do not expose the treated skin to the sun or tanning since you defeat the purpose</li>
            <li>It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay let me start off saying that i&#x27;m a 2 tone women</li>
            <li>so i al so use the soap i love the soap it wipe off</li>
            <li>i try the ambi lotion one time i have to buy more to give a review on that</li>
            <li>You ambi and thank you amazon for selling the on here where you can buy more then one</li>
            <li>and that is what i like to do is to buy more then one the way i use it the 1st time</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t many products out there that work</li>
            <li>This product is not any better than another dozen or so products out there.</li>
            <li>I could be sure of.</li>
            <li>This worked okay.</li>
            <li>Love this it fades our sun spots and has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair complected and used this product twice daily and still saw no results.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective at evening out your skin tone, but it takes time, as it abosorbs at a much slower rate (making it safer and just as effective, but much slower).    </li>
            <li>Even though i don&#x27;t like the smell because it&#x27;s too strong; i don&#x27;t use it at night but in the morning.</li>
            <li>For the price, I think it is a remarkable product and now, my darkest spots have almost completely faded.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it on my face, but I imagine it would work fine there as well.</li>
            <li>Although they seem to be rare, hydroquinone can have many adverse side effects.</li>
            <li>, I snagged free shipping for orders of $25 and up.</li>
            <li>pampering and treating ourselves wonderfully we&#x27;d be looking AND feeling good and have a few extra bucks in our pockets so we could go out with your facialist and get helpful hints :)\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream twice daily for two months with great results.</li>
            <li>easy clean</li>
            <li>I believe they will continue to fade with consistent use of Ambi and consistent use of a good sun block.    </li>
            <li>My skin overall looks better (seems to be good for wrinkles, too).  </li>
            <li>I have to say that so far so good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the age spots I am trying to fade, but I am hopeful.  </li>
            <li>The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>must work on fair skinned people only?</li>
            <li>cons of this product are that if you have sensitive skin like mine - where you put lotions or creams or acne treatments of almost any kind on your skin and it makes you break out - this product will make you break out.</li>
            <li>You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients.</li>
            <li>Takes about 12wks for full effect, but see results in about 6wks.</li>
            <li>I gave up on this before giving it the full \\&quot;skin turnover\\&quot; time.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recomend this cream for people with sensitive skin and I am sure that if you apply it two times a day as recommended you will get rid off your spot by the time.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>but that disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>Used during post partum, not while pregnant.</li>
            <li>This inexpensive product works better than the high dollar products.</li>
            <li>After at least a month of day and night use I had very good fading of the two age spots.  </li>
            <li>I make my own facial masque/scrub using a teaspoon of sugar and a splash of antibacterial liquid soap.</li>
            <li>Make it FRESH each time, use the leftovers on the backs of your hands.</li>
            <li>Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while.</li>
            <li>Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while.</li>
            <li>: try some lemon juice or diluted lemon juice on your skin first - helps reduce fine lines and do gentle chemical peel.</li>
            <li>The Alpha-Hydroxy is pretty much the only thing that has been clinically tested that shows some effectiveness on wrinkles and spots--so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Lots of other good reviews, so I might be an anomaly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned (very very pale), so I can scar easily.</li>
            <li>Give yourself a nice gentle warm face wash then pat dry with a soft towel.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li>In fact, it works so good, it faded a dark spot under my eye in about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>but so far, this is not bad!  </li>
            <li>I am a medium to fair skin female in my early 30s</li>
            <li>love it buy more til i&#x27;m dead and gone</li>
            <li>So I searched on Amazon as a last resort to see if I could find this product and was pleasantly surprised, and at a good price too.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>That is good news, and it is kind of scary in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s the positive right there</li>
            <li>Who knew we&#x27;d STILL continue working hard to stay attractive ;)</li>
            <li>I love ambi, I been using this product way back from the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s safe for darker skin types (asian, latino, blacks, etc).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it came in a 4 pack because I like to keep it in two different bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>I like to be able to reapply it to my hands a second time during the day after I&#x27;ve washed my hands.</li>
            <li>I can be pretty picky with smells at times, but I had no issues with the scent at all.</li>
            <li>Again, this is only the 2nd day, I already feel more confident in my scars.</li>
            <li>Using this AMBI cream consistently TWO times a day (AM/PM) will deliver noticeable results in 14 days.</li>
            <li>/warm helps the cream penetrate better AND daily making</li>
            <li>sure we drink enough water,</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient than going to my local Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: Stings when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I wash my face, treat it for acne, apply this (ONLY to the sites of discoloration), &amp; top it off with sunblock.</li>
            <li>I was using it for the sun damage on my forehead at first, and when I started breaking out, I had to stop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to see if hydroquinone works, I would try something with a higher percentage of it, which is something I might do.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get through the first tube,</li>
            <li>On one hand it did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.</li>
            <li>It almost looked like I had a burn covering my arm, and after months it still had not faded; I remembered my success with Ambi and tried it again, and again with really just a couple applications</li>
            <li>but back to the cream i love it</li>
            <li>then i put the 2nd time on there and leave it on for 3 more hours</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 months consistently.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be much better off in the long run.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be much better off in the long run.</li>
            <li>Ambi have really work on my skin, I do not give the 5 stars on the review because I have not follow the treatment as consistent as I should</li>
            <li>I recently moved to CA from FL, where Ambi was easily found in any drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like that the cream adds moisture to my face and seems to be very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t strong enough to face my spots so got a prescription for real thing at 2X power.</li>
            <li>This product does work, though as many other reviewers mention, the use of the cream must be consistent.  </li>
            <li>Ambi evens out skintone and the teture of your skin is left smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Please know, if you are PATIENT, PERSISTENT, and want to proceed with CAUTION, consider something else that absorbs in the skin at a much slower rate and is MUCH SAFER.</li>
            <li>If Mama lotion interest you, you don&#x27;t need to buy the whole skincare line.</li>
            <li>Gently fades blemishes.</li>
            <li>It must be very toxic in some way.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any one who wants to see result.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>AND that are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth every time I use it, but it took several months to see results</li>
            <li>The cream is very sticky</li>
            <li>Maybe if the percentage was a little higher, I might have seen better results in a shorter time frame?</li>
            <li>I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do use sunblock because it will get dark again if you expose your skin to the sun too much.</li>
            <li>so dark people couldn&#x27;t be sure</li>
            <li>Just this past week, got complements from 2 senior ladies about how nice my skin looks without old-age spots.  </li>
            <li>It has generally worked for those spots in my face where skin has freshly healed from acne/pimples (that&#x27;s after the extraction of the pus inside).</li>
            <li>While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start.</li>
            <li>Plus, it also states on the back of the box to discontinue use after 3 months; so buying 4 tubes is probably not necessary unless you have more family members or friends you will share them with.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient (Hydroquinone) has reportedly been all but banned for skin use in Europe (Directive 76/768/</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cream to anyone older</li>
            <li>The main chemical that reduce the skin spots is the hydroquinone and this product has it.  </li>
            <li>I may try the one by Garnier next as a friend recommends it highly, but if it dries my skin out more I will switch back.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a little more of the tan skin</li>
            <li>It feels a little oily on my skin, but not horrible.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve not broken out because of it thus far.</li>
            <li>It does have it&#x27;s own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) &amp; wear sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li>It does have it&#x27;s own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) &amp; wear sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li>and wow, it really does work.</li>
            <li>There are two kinds: normal &amp; oily skin.</li>
            <li>I got the one for normal, though perhaps I should have considered for oily, as it will moisturize the sites in which you apply it.</li>
            <li>I was thinking that there wasn&#x27;t anything even the least bit effective out there--</li>
            <li>I choose normal skin</li>
            <li>Yes, it does fade the brown spot maybe one or two shades, but if you stop using it they darken right back up.</li>
            <li>An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use.  </li>
            <li>i use the soap alot because where i live i can get it at the store for $2</li>
            <li>i live</li>
            <li>using it a few more weeks to see if the brown spots resolve completely...</li>
            <li>we spent the TIME on ourselves... finding the appropriate products AND using them properly ...</li>
            <li>It dissolves before it rips your skin up, unless you are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, please skip these exfoliation tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists multiple times for both acne &amp; scarring, &amp; although they are very capable, at times their remedies are costly.</li>
            <li>It was priced affordably and seemed to have majority positive reviews on various sites.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a huge area to cover, one 2 oz tube should last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>I did notice  slight improvement after a few weeks but not as much fading as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>: Started using the AMBI Even and Clear Exfoliating wash like the microbeads and the salicylic acid 1% that keeps bumps away</li>
            <li>I would steer clear of it.  </li>
            <li>Ambi Even &amp; Clear Exfoliating Wash (which I&#x27;m still using).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m battling adult acne,  fighting pimples, wrinkles, post-inflammatory hyperpigmenation AND age spots.</li>
            <li>Make sure you spend at least TWO minutes on your face with this</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>but I hope the scar will be completely gone soon.    </li>
            <li>This product works well if you don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin like I do.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t completely go away</li>
            <li>I had acne marks on my chest, back and legs, my chest marks are clearing out so fast, i can&#x27;t believe that.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted this to work but haven&#x27;t seen any results after using religiously for two months.</li>
            <li>Seems to be developed because of the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li>I used two tubes of this product and saw no visible results on the age spots I have developed as I age.  </li>
            <li>Many international skin care companies are removing Hydroquinone from their formulations due to the European ban.</li>
            <li>and I have a few dark spots on my face from being an irresponsible beach bunny for many years!</li>
            <li>but if I just use it lightly and only a couple of times a week, my spots will fade in due time.  </li>
            <li>I did buy this elsewhere in a single tube to try it first, before investing in a multi-pack.</li>
            <li>I thought that&#x27;s ok because my skin a little be dry because of using Acne products that&#x27;s y</li>
            <li>I wear sunblock anyway, but it is HIGHLY recommended that you wear it, especially when using this product.</li>
            <li>have medium-fair Asian skin but had spent years at the beach and skiing, so I had some mega-huge brown spots at the top of my cheek-bones and lots of smaller spots I never had when I was younger from all the sun.  </li>

            <li>I am a very white skill male who had some light brown spots in the face big enough to bother.</li>
            <li>You will have to use it at least twice a day and buy a number of tubes as they run out quickly if you use it for your whole body</li>
            <li>I still struggle to this day to get my skin back to a normal appearance.</li>
            <li>That i&#x27;m not dark</li>
            <li>If you want exfoliation once a week, you might try some baking soda mixed to a paste and GENTLY exfoliate face, neck, upper chest, hands - even legs and feet once you&#x27;re in the tub.</li>
            <li>store my dollar general dollar store</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think 2% is anywhere near enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas.</li>
            <li>While your face is barely moist from the washing, apply Ambi.  </li>
            <li>At least... it works better than any other topical over-the-counter product that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dark spots or acne scars.</li>
            <li>I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me.  </li>

            <li> but if you are patient, you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I use it on both my hands and face and am fairly happy with it.</li>
            <li> even if they don&#x27;t change any more then they are now, I&#x27;m still extremely happy with the results!    </li>
            <li> but it does a good job.   </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, she has fair skin and freckles.</li>
            <li> The sun reeks havoc on her fair skin making her freckles darker.</li>
            <li> now i can look in the mirror and see that my skin has change and that make me cry and it feel so good</li>
            <li> It did smell good though.</li>

            <li> She was letting me know the economy is no excuse for not looking and being our best...</li>
            <li> That worked great and the results are fast.</li>
            <li> It really seems like it is helping greatly</li>
            <li> love the convenience of the tube.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researching many products for fading skin discoloration.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to fade them afterwards :-)</li>
            <li> could go out with your facialist and get helpful hints :)</li>
            <li> I love that it is SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> And if you are going to use ANY lightening cream, be mindful that you are going to be more photosensitive afterwords; wear sunscreen.the spots to return once you have finishing using Ambi, because the skin&#x27;s melanin is what makes us tan &amp; freckle; protecting &amp; reacting to the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> And if you are going to use ANY lightening cream, be mindful that you are going to be more photosensitive afterwords; wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> You do have to make sure you do not expose the treated skin to the sun or tanning since you defeat the purpose</li>
            <li> It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay let me start off saying that i&#x27;m a 2 tone women</li>
            <li> so i al so use the soap i love the soap it wipe off</li>
            <li> i try the ambi lotion one time i have to buy more to give a review on that</li>
            <li> You ambi and thank you amazon for selling the on here where you can buy more then one</li>
            <li> and that is what i like to do is to buy more then one the way i use it the 1st time</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t many products out there that work</li>
            <li> This product is not any better than another dozen or so products out there.</li>
            <li> I could be sure of.</li>
            <li> This worked okay.</li>
            <li> Love this it fades our sun spots and has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair complected and used this product twice daily and still saw no results.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective at evening out your skin tone, but it takes time, as it abosorbs at a much slower rate (making it safer and just as effective, but much slower).    </li>
            <li> Even though i don&#x27;t like the smell because it&#x27;s too strong; i don&#x27;t use it at night but in the morning.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it is a remarkable product and now, my darkest spots have almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it on my face, but I imagine it would work fine there as well.</li>
            <li> Although they seem to be rare, hydroquinone can have many adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> , I snagged free shipping for orders of $25 and up.</li>
            <li> pampering and treating ourselves wonderfully we&#x27;d be looking AND feeling good and have a few extra bucks in our pockets so we could go out with your facialist and get helpful hints :)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream twice daily for two months with great results.</li>
            <li> easy clean</li>
            <li> I believe they will continue to fade with consistent use of Ambi and consistent use of a good sun block.    </li>
            <li> My skin overall looks better (seems to be good for wrinkles, too).  </li>
            <li> I have to say that so far so good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the age spots I am trying to fade, but I am hopeful.  </li>
            <li> The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> must work on fair skinned people only?</li>
            <li> cons of this product are that if you have sensitive skin like mine - where you put lotions or creams or acne treatments of almost any kind on your skin and it makes you break out - this product will make you break out.</li>
            <li> You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients.</li>
            <li> Takes about 12wks for full effect, but see results in about 6wks.</li>
            <li> I gave up on this before giving it the full \\&quot;skin turnover\\&quot; time.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recomend this cream for people with sensitive skin and I am sure that if you apply it two times a day as recommended you will get rid off your spot by the time.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> but that disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> Used during post partum, not while pregnant.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive product works better than the high dollar products.</li>
            <li> After at least a month of day and night use I had very good fading of the two age spots.  </li>
            <li> I make my own facial masque/scrub using a teaspoon of sugar and a splash of antibacterial liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Make it FRESH each time, use the leftovers on the backs of your hands.</li>
            <li> Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while.</li>
            <li> Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while.</li>
            <li> : try some lemon juice or diluted lemon juice on your skin first - helps reduce fine lines and do gentle chemical peel.</li>
            <li> The Alpha-Hydroxy is pretty much the only thing that has been clinically tested that shows some effectiveness on wrinkles and spots--so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> Lots of other good reviews, so I might be an anomaly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned (very very pale), so I can scar easily.</li>
            <li> Give yourself a nice gentle warm face wash then pat dry with a soft towel.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> In fact, it works so good, it faded a dark spot under my eye in about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> but so far, this is not bad!  </li>
            <li> I am a medium to fair skin female in my early 30s</li>
            <li> love it buy more til i&#x27;m dead and gone</li>
            <li> So I searched on Amazon as a last resort to see if I could find this product and was pleasantly surprised, and at a good price too.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> That is good news, and it is kind of scary in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s the positive right there</li>
            <li> Who knew we&#x27;d STILL continue working hard to stay attractive ;)</li>
            <li> I love ambi, I been using this product way back from the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s safe for darker skin types (asian, latino, blacks, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it came in a 4 pack because I like to keep it in two different bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> I like to be able to reapply it to my hands a second time during the day after I&#x27;ve washed my hands.</li>
            <li> I can be pretty picky with smells at times, but I had no issues with the scent at all.</li>
            <li> Again, this is only the 2nd day, I already feel more confident in my scars.</li>
            <li> Using this AMBI cream consistently TWO times a day (AM/PM) will deliver noticeable results in 14 days.</li>
            <li> /warm helps the cream penetrate better AND daily making</li>
            <li> sure we drink enough water,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient than going to my local Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : Stings when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, treat it for acne, apply this (ONLY to the sites of discoloration), &amp; top it off with sunblock.</li>
            <li> I was using it for the sun damage on my forehead at first, and when I started breaking out, I had to stop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to see if hydroquinone works, I would try something with a higher percentage of it, which is something I might do.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get through the first tube,</li>
            <li> On one hand it did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.</li>
            <li> It almost looked like I had a burn covering my arm, and after months it still had not faded; I remembered my success with Ambi and tried it again, and again with really just a couple applications</li>
            <li> but back to the cream i love it</li>
            <li> then i put the 2nd time on there and leave it on for 3 more hours</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months consistently.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be much better off in the long run.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be much better off in the long run.</li>
            <li> Ambi have really work on my skin, I do not give the 5 stars on the review because I have not follow the treatment as consistent as I should</li>
            <li> I recently moved to CA from FL, where Ambi was easily found in any drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like that the cream adds moisture to my face and seems to be very gentle.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t strong enough to face my spots so got a prescription for real thing at 2X power.</li>
            <li> This product does work, though as many other reviewers mention, the use of the cream must be consistent.  </li>
            <li> Ambi evens out skintone and the teture of your skin is left smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Please know, if you are PATIENT, PERSISTENT, and want to proceed with CAUTION, consider something else that absorbs in the skin at a much slower rate and is MUCH SAFER.</li>
            <li> If Mama lotion interest you, you don&#x27;t need to buy the whole skincare line.</li>
            <li> Gently fades blemishes.</li>
            <li> It must be very toxic in some way.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any one who wants to see result.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> AND that are reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin smooth every time I use it, but it took several months to see results</li>
            <li> The cream is very sticky</li>
            <li> Maybe if the percentage was a little higher, I might have seen better results in a shorter time frame?</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you do use sunblock because it will get dark again if you expose your skin to the sun too much.</li>
            <li> so dark people couldn&#x27;t be sure</li>
            <li> Just this past week, got complements from 2 senior ladies about how nice my skin looks without old-age spots.  </li>
            <li> It has generally worked for those spots in my face where skin has freshly healed from acne/pimples (that&#x27;s after the extraction of the pus inside).</li>
            <li> While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start.</li>
            <li> Plus, it also states on the back of the box to discontinue use after 3 months; so buying 4 tubes is probably not necessary unless you have more family members or friends you will share them with.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient (Hydroquinone) has reportedly been all but banned for skin use in Europe (Directive 76/768/</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream to anyone older</li>
            <li> The main chemical that reduce the skin spots is the hydroquinone and this product has it.  </li>
            <li> I may try the one by Garnier next as a friend recommends it highly, but if it dries my skin out more I will switch back.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little more of the tan skin</li>
            <li> It feels a little oily on my skin, but not horrible.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve not broken out because of it thus far.</li>
            <li> It does have it&#x27;s own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) &amp; wear sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li> It does have it&#x27;s own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) &amp; wear sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li> and wow, it really does work.</li>
            <li> There are two kinds: normal &amp; oily skin.</li>
            <li> I got the one for normal, though perhaps I should have considered for oily, as it will moisturize the sites in which you apply it.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that there wasn&#x27;t anything even the least bit effective out there--</li>
            <li> I choose normal skin</li>
            <li> Yes, it does fade the brown spot maybe one or two shades, but if you stop using it they darken right back up.</li>
            <li> An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use.  </li>
            <li> i use the soap alot because where i live i can get it at the store for $2</li>
            <li> i live</li>
            <li> using it a few more weeks to see if the brown spots resolve completely...</li>
            <li> we spent the TIME on ourselves... finding the appropriate products AND using them properly ...</li>
            <li> It dissolves before it rips your skin up, unless you are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, please skip these exfoliation tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists multiple times for both acne &amp; scarring, &amp; although they are very capable, at times their remedies are costly.</li>
            <li> It was priced affordably and seemed to have majority positive reviews on various sites.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a huge area to cover, one 2 oz tube should last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I did notice  slight improvement after a few weeks but not as much fading as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> : Started using the AMBI Even and Clear Exfoliating wash like the microbeads and the salicylic acid 1% that keeps bumps away</li>
            <li> I would steer clear of it.  </li>
            <li> Ambi Even &amp; Clear Exfoliating Wash (which I&#x27;m still using).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m battling adult acne,  fighting pimples, wrinkles, post-inflammatory hyperpigmenation AND age spots.</li>
            <li> Make sure you spend at least TWO minutes on your face with this</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> but I hope the scar will be completely gone soon.    </li>
            <li> This product works well if you don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin like I do.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t completely go away</li>
            <li> I had acne marks on my chest, back and legs, my chest marks are clearing out so fast, i can&#x27;t believe that.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this to work but haven&#x27;t seen any results after using religiously for two months.</li>
            <li> Seems to be developed because of the effects of the sun.</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> I used two tubes of this product and saw no visible results on the age spots I have developed as I age.  </li>
            <li> Many international skin care companies are removing Hydroquinone from their formulations due to the European ban.</li>
            <li> and I have a few dark spots on my face from being an irresponsible beach bunny for many years!</li>
            <li> but if I just use it lightly and only a couple of times a week, my spots will fade in due time.  </li>
            <li> I did buy this elsewhere in a single tube to try it first, before investing in a multi-pack.</li>
            <li> I thought that&#x27;s ok because my skin a little be dry because of using Acne products that&#x27;s y</li>
            <li> I wear sunblock anyway, but it is HIGHLY recommended that you wear it, especially when using this product.</li>
            <li> have medium-fair Asian skin but had spent years at the beach and skiing, so I had some mega-huge brown spots at the top of my cheek-bones and lots of smaller spots I never had when I was younger from all the sun.  </li>

            <li> I am a very white skill male who had some light brown spots in the face big enough to bother.</li>
            <li> You will have to use it at least twice a day and buy a number of tubes as they run out quickly if you use it for your whole body</li>
            <li> I still struggle to this day to get my skin back to a normal appearance.</li>
            <li> That i&#x27;m not dark</li>
            <li> If you want exfoliation once a week, you might try some baking soda mixed to a paste and GENTLY exfoliate face, neck, upper chest, hands - even legs and feet once you&#x27;re in the tub.</li>
            <li> store my dollar general dollar store</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think 2% is anywhere near enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas.</li>
            <li> While your face is barely moist from the washing, apply Ambi.  </li>
            <li> At least... it works better than any other topical over-the-counter product that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dark spots or acne scars.</li>
            <li> I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me.  </li>
            <li> The majority of dark purple contrast has faded to a light pink or pale red.</li>
            <li> The majority of dark purple contrast has faded to a light pink or pale red.</li>
            <li> Well, I finally managed to get the acne under control &amp; decided I needed to get a product that could help clear up the dark marks left over on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The cream is not as easy to use on age spots because it&#x27;s difficult to keep the cream only on the age spot and off the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> All of that being said, I&#x27;m a very pale Caucasian woman with very pronounced and old hyperpigmentation scars due to acne/compulsive skin picking.</li>
            <li> The time period was long because I could only use the product once a day, otherwise it caused skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The price was so much more affordable and a better texture than the other creams I&#x27;ve tried, so am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product is not strong enough, and I returned it unopened to the seller, Pharmapacks, who did NOT give me a complete refund.  </li>
            <li> Been using Ambi for one month, three to four times per day...has faded my UNDER EYE DARK CIRCLES and huge dark spots on either side of my face by at least seventy five percent in this short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I digress, in the short amount of time, Ambi has managed not to break me out further &amp; the areas of extreme discoloration have already improved by 50%.</li>

            <li> There are lots of other fade creams on the market, more expensive, but this one I like for the price</li>
            <li> And if you are older than your usual acne sufferer (ie a teenager), it takes even longer for them to go away because of the time it takes for collagen &amp; elastin to be produced in the body.</li>
            <li> Pros: Some darker spots have faded and overall my skin tone seems a little more even, but it;s really not all that dramatic.</li>
            <li> Age spots, redness, minor lines all disappear.</li>
            <li> With trouble combination skin, acne, age, etc...this has been a problem I&#x27;ve dealt with for years, nearly decades.</li>
            <li> I would theorize that my spots will diminish adequately long before then.</li>

            <li> At the bottom of any article is a long reference list you can explore.</li>
            <li> and i still have a long way to go with my skin</li>
            <li> A pea size dab technically covers the entire face, so if you just spot treat your discolored areas, you will need even less than a pea size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve increased my daily intake of vitamin D3 to (hopefully) offset the slight medical risk.</li>
            <li> ~I was very hesitant to order this, especially knowing I have had some pretty bad acne scars around my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> other con is that it&#x27;s only 2% hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> This product made my face itch and dry.  </li>
            <li> I used it first for strange (and ugly) discoloration on my face, particularly around and above my mouth, when I was a smoker.</li>
            <li> Like most consumers today, I was skeptical about this product and thinking that it was wishful thinking and probably a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smoothly and base is very moist.</li>
            <li> The problem with cystic acne is you can develop post inflammatory hyper pigmentation, which in simple terms are those dark splotchy purple/red spots that linger for months as it heals, sometimes even permanently scarring the area.</li>
            <li> At 42 I had several dark \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots have faded away and the product only costs pennies per day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out how to remove the dark blemishes that&#x27;s been on my face since my teenage years.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 months and dark spots still remained the same.</li>
            <li> Was shocked to find this so cheap at a local drug store, have been using it twice a day for 3 weeks now and the spots have remarkibly improved!  </li>
            <li> It seems like a bigger waste of money that way.  </li>
            <li> However, over the last few weeks, I have noticed a drastic lightening of the spots.</li>
            <li> The spots are still visible, but are only about half as dark as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots left from acne and it drastically faded the spots in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as much as some other reviewers claimed.</li>
            <li> My neck and chest has dark discoloration from years of abuse and if I use this, it slowly fades it down to normal.</li>
            <li> BUT, after a few weeks of use it has long since surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used any other AMBI products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely please with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely please with the results.</li>
            <li> Other products didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all--and I&#x27;d used I lot of brands and types.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve only used a small fraction of one tube.</li>
            <li> thought I would give away the other 3 unopened tubes to a friend</li>
            <li> So I definitely would recommend testing this product on a small area of your face before using it.  </li>
            <li> In the United States, topical treatments usually contain up to 2% in hydroquinone.</li>

            <li> But BEWARE if you purchase it or any other product from Pharmapacks.</li>
            <li> I have tried two creams before Ambi but one did not do anything and the other one irritated my skin face a lot.</li>
            <li> Remember, there is no magic cure or youth potion, but if you take care of your skin when you are in your teens &amp; early 20&#x27;s (avoiding excessive sun, wearing sunscreen, handling acne, etc...)</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change and after reading that the active ingredient has been banned in Japan and Europe, an wondering why it is allowed here?</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed, twice a day every day (only missing one application per day less than half a dozen times) on the pregnancy mask I had and on my dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> I really did hate to quit using the fade cream because it really was improving the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> After an hour of applying this cream, my boyfriend &amp; I both noticed the fading of the dark spots.</li>
            <li> At 52, I have splotchy, dark discoloration on my neck as a result of birth control pills taken when I was 45 and sun damage.</li>
            <li> it works on dark circles...</li>
            <li> a lot seemed to make the dark spots fade</li>
            <li> I feel I was misled by this product until I understood the wording &amp;#34;guaranteed to fade dark spots&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you use this product, look at the lid after a couple of days; the cream around the lid turns dark brown.</li>
            <li> um doesnt lighten my dark spots at all, lightened the skin around it.</li>
            <li> A dark spot with lighter skin around it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to stave off dark blemishes from where acne scars/pimples used to be in my face.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to fade sun spots or some dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking you might need to get to the dark spots sooner than I got to mine.</li>
            <li> If you have had dark spots for a while, it might not work so well.</li>
            <li> Im half Hispanic/Caucasian and have that olive skin tone that shows everything.</li>
            <li> but they were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations.[5]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past 45 days (package says results should be seen in 2 months) and have found a little reduction in discoloration but not much, not even 50%.</li>
            <li> The splotches have faded from dark brown to pale tan...</li>
            <li> I got was very dark.</li>

            <li> One things I do have to say, after reading other reviews: many said the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> I mad an mistake by choose Ambi cream for normal skin .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to cont.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product isn&#x27;t lovely but it isn&#x27;t awful either.  </li>
            <li> (small rash like bumps).  </li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find, depending on the brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li> was!---this was BEFORE they started telling us about how too much sun was going to be bad for your skin!)  </li>
            <li> Not a good selling point.</li>
            <li> Been dealing with ugly brown spots left over from previous pregnancies 2 years ago, tired RX samples, expensive Clinique products all without any bit of improvement.</li>
            <li> On the other hand apparently I&#x27;m allergic to hydroquinone because it broke my face out terribly</li>
            <li> This product made my skin break out terribly within the first week of using.  </li>
            <li> now i look dumb.</li>
            <li> If you want something that is weak, then maybe its for you.</li>
            <li> It has improved the texture of my skin, helped to fade some acne scars, and also lightened a broken blood vessel.</li>
            <li> Not a great product.  </li>
            <li> In approximately two weeks i started seeing results.</li>
            <li> Not good product at all!</li>
            <li> I got a bad chemical burn from a &#x27;beauty product&#x27; a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Those age brown spots can be annoying, and Ambi can help a little.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong at the price of this product.</li>
            <li> I guess I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> but the insurance would not cover and the price was almost 200.00 for it so needless to say I did not get it.</li>
            <li> So I will sadly throw the rest of the bottle away.  </li>
            <li> one time, I had horrible hyper-pigmentation due to hormones and who know what else.  </li>
            <li> after all the research I did that says there is no cure or treatment for dark circles!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed I bought it in a multi-pack, too.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find that this worked at all :(</li>
            <li> Like how stupid.</li>
            <li> i hate when i run out</li>
            <li> This is the worst seller I have encountered on Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love ambi, I been using this product way back from the 80&#x27;s, I had great results then and I still have awesome results now. My skin is even toned and beautiful. I would recommend this cream to anyone who has a discoloration issues. Make sure you do use sunblock because it will get dark again if you expose your skin to the sun too much.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  Ended up getting rid of the age spots by laser.  That worked great and the results are fast.</li>
            <li> My daughter had several warts on her leg removed.  Dermatologist recommended this product for scarring.  It really seems like it is helping greatly</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for those who have blemshes. Ambi evens out skintone and the teture of your skin is left smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Have been using Ambi for years with excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: try some lemon juice or diluted lemon juice on your skin first - helps reduce fine lines and do gentle chemical peel. Same ingredient as many expensive items at a tiny fraction of the cost. The Ambi works quicker this way. If you want exfoliation once a week, you might try some baking soda mixed to a paste and GENTLY exfoliate face, neck, upper chest, hands - even legs and feet once you&#x27;re in the tub. It dissolves before it rips your skin up, unless you are very sensitive. Age spots, redness, minor lines all disappear. Toothpaste on for 5 minutes also does a chemical peel. NEVER let any of this stuff get in your eyes. If you don&#x27;t use sunblock, the marks come back. If you have very sensitive skin, please skip these exfoliation tips.&lt;br /&gt;Problem: if I do my upper chest and cleavage (removes spots and creasing from sun, weathering and time) I need to wear a white undershirt or something that can get stained and does not upset me. Same with hand-towels, and pillow-cases. If you&#x27;re not sleeping alone, you may want to put this on way before bedtime as it does have a smell that&#x27;s medicinal and not too sexy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the convenience of the tube. You can put one in your purse. This price is great and I just love having it delivered!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after researching many products for fading skin discoloration.  It did nothing for me at all.  I am really disappointed I bought it in a multi-pack, too.  It seems like a bigger waste of money that way.  I thought I would share it with friends, but I see no point since it does nothing.</li>
            <li> Been dealing with ugly brown spots left over from previous pregnancies 2 years ago, tired RX samples, expensive Clinique products all without any bit of improvement. Was shocked to find this so cheap at a local drug store, have been using it twice a day for 3 weeks now and the spots have remarkibly improved!  I don&#x27;t like the smell but it goes away quickly.  Even though it has a SPF in it, I would also advise using your regular daily SPF that you would regularly use ontop of it.    I&#x27;m anxious to cont. using it a few more weeks to see if the brown spots resolve completely...even if they don&#x27;t change any more then they are now, I&#x27;m still extremely happy with the results!    Unless you have a huge area to cover, one 2 oz tube should last you a very long time. A pea size dab technically covers the entire face, so if you just spot treat your discolored areas, you will need even less than a pea size.  Plus, it also states on the back of the box to discontinue use after 3 months; so buying 4 tubes is probably not necessary unless you have more family members or friends you will share them with.  Just a suggestion ;)  I use it 2x a day for several weeks now, and there is not even a dent in the tube yet.</li>
            <li> AMBI does work at fading darker skin discolorations. In fact, it works so good, it faded a dark spot under my eye in about 20-30 minutes. That is good news, and it is kind of scary in my opinion. Although they seem to be rare, hydroquinone can have many adverse side effects. And, hydroquinone is carcinogenic (as found in lab mice). PLEASE, use it with caution.     Please know, if you are PATIENT, PERSISTENT, and want to proceed with CAUTION, consider something else that absorbs in the skin at a much slower rate and is MUCH SAFER. And, it&#x27;s safe for darker skin types (asian, latino, blacks, etc). While I&#x27;m as white as they get (Fitzpatrick type 1), I still wanted to avoid the slim chance of adverse reactions with hydroquinone and decided to use MaMa lotion. It&#x27;s a 10% Malic and 10% Mandelic acid. It is very effective at evening out your skin tone, but it takes time, as it abosorbs at a much slower rate (making it safer and just as effective, but much slower).    If Mama lotion interest you, you don&#x27;t need to buy the whole skincare line. Just buy the 20% refinisher. It does lighten scars somewhat and fades discoloration (melasma). Google for the website. It&#x27;s around $40 a bottle, and a bottle will last 6-8 weeks. It does make your face sticky though!    I got a bad chemical burn from a &#x27;beauty product&#x27; a few years ago. I still struggle to this day to get my skin back to a normal appearance. PLEASE use products with caution, and learn from my mistake!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to help fade a couple of sun spots on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month now.  The spots are still visible, but are only about half as dark as they used to be.  I believe they will continue to fade with consistent use of Ambi and consistent use of a good sun block.    I particularly like that the cream adds moisture to my face and seems to be very gentle.  I plan to keep using it daily.  I&#x27;m glad it came in a 4 pack because I like to keep it in two different bathrooms.  I&#x27;m using it on my hands too, so I like to be able to reapply it to my hands a second time during the day after I&#x27;ve washed my hands.</li>
            <li> I just received the Ambi Fade Cream yesterday, was at my house within 2 days of ordering it! Which was great! Ok..now about the product~I was very hesitant to order this, especially knowing I have had some pretty bad acne scars around my forehead and cheeks. Im half Hispanic/Caucasian and have that olive skin tone that shows everything. After an hour of applying this cream, my boyfriend &amp; I both noticed the fading of the dark spots. One things I do have to say, after reading other reviews: many said the smell is terrible. I can be pretty picky with smells at times, but I had no issues with the scent at all. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dark spots or acne scars. Again, this is only the 2nd day, I already feel more confident in my scars. ***USE IT TWICE A DAY! AND USE SPF!</li>
            <li> Like most consumers today, I was skeptical about this product and thinking that it was wishful thinking and probably a waste of my money. BUT, after a few weeks of use it has long since surpassed my expectations. It has improved the texture of my skin, helped to fade some acne scars, and also lightened a broken blood vessel.</li>
            <li> Using this AMBI cream consistently TWO times a day (AM/PM) will deliver noticeable results in 14 days. Putting it on after a steamy shower while the skin is still moist/warm helps the cream penetrate better AND daily making sure we drink enough water, get enough fruits and vegetables are secrets from a facialist for clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This AMBI formulation now contains Alpha-Hydroxy for skin cell renewal, a sunscreen and lightening agent-2% Hydroquinone. My budget has tightened, so facials and salon products are history. AMBI I&#x27;m back! This 4pack for $19.96 from Amazon with another Amazon item, I snagged free shipping for orders of $25 and up. That&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient than going to my local Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used any other AMBI products. I make my own facial masque/scrub using a teaspoon of sugar and a splash of antibacterial liquid soap. Make it FRESH each time, use the leftovers on the backs of your hands. I&#x27;m battling adult acne,  fighting pimples, wrinkles, post-inflammatory hyperpigmenation AND age spots. Who knew we&#x27;d STILL continue working hard to stay attractive ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: Please read the product instructions and cautions. Many international skin care companies are removing Hydroquinone from their formulations due to the European ban. Additionally, if you see no improvement within 60 to 90 days you may need to see a Dermatologist for a prescription strength solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Started using the AMBI Even and Clear Exfoliating wash like the microbeads and the salicylic acid 1% that keeps bumps away so I don&#x27;t need to fade them afterwards :-) TIP: Make sure you spend at least TWO minutes on your face with this so it gets a chance to activate and deposit the medication deep into the pores. Something my facialist told me \\&quot;If we spent the TIME on ourselves... finding the appropriate products AND using them properly ...pampering and treating ourselves wonderfully we&#x27;d be looking AND feeling good and have a few extra bucks in our pockets so we could go out with your facialist and get helpful hints :)\\&quot; She was letting me know the economy is no excuse for not looking and being our best...I AGREE!we could go out with your facialist and get helpful hints :)\\&quot; She was letting me know the economy is no excuse for not looking and being our best...I AGREE!</li>
            <li> Pros: Some darker spots have faded and overall my skin tone seems a little more even, but it;s really not all that dramatic. I love that it is SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Stings when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Excellent for clearing up post inflammatory hyper pigmentation. I&#x27;m fair skinned (very very pale), so I can scar easily. With trouble combination skin, acne, age, etc...this has been a problem I&#x27;ve dealt with for years, nearly decades. The problem with cystic acne is you can develop post inflammatory hyper pigmentation, which in simple terms are those dark splotchy purple/red spots that linger for months as it heals, sometimes even permanently scarring the area. And if you are older than your usual acne sufferer (ie a teenager), it takes even longer for them to go away because of the time it takes for collagen &amp; elastin to be produced in the body. They are unsightly &amp; seem to take forever to go away, especially if you get multiple flare ups of acne atop the same spot. Well, I finally managed to get the acne under control &amp; decided I needed to get a product that could help clear up the dark marks left over on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists multiple times for both acne &amp; scarring, &amp; although they are very capable, at times their remedies are costly. I needed something affordable and effective. I happened across this product amidst researched reviews &amp; reports. It was priced affordably and seemed to have majority positive reviews on various sites. I did buy this elsewhere in a single tube to try it first, before investing in a multi-pack. There are two kinds: normal &amp; oily skin. I got the one for normal, though perhaps I should have considered for oily, as it will moisturize the sites in which you apply it. But I&#x27;ve not broken out because of it thus far. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, apply twice a day as it recommends. I wash my face, treat it for acne, apply this (ONLY to the sites of discoloration), &amp; top it off with sunblock. I wear sunblock anyway, but it is HIGHLY recommended that you wear it, especially when using this product. It works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin, within the site of application. Not using sunscreen/block, allows the spots to return once you have finishing using Ambi, because the skin&#x27;s melanin is what makes us tan &amp; freckle; protecting &amp; reacting to the sun&#x27;s rays. Thus, this will make you more photo sensitive to the sun for a while. It does have it&#x27;s own sunscreen mixed in, but you should really be mindful of your skin (the largest organ of your body) &amp; wear sunscreen everyday. &amp; don&#x27;t trust the ones only in your make up. It degrades over time &amp; tends to be a low spf. I digress, in the short amount of time, Ambi has managed not to break me out further &amp; the areas of extreme discoloration have already improved by 50%. I&#x27;m extremely please with the results. The majority of dark purple contrast has faded to a light pink or pale red. This type of result would have taken me weeks without assistance. Ambi recommends you use it for about 3 months &amp; discontinue use thereafter. I would theorize that my spots will diminish adequately long before then. Remember, there is no magic cure or youth potion, but if you take care of your skin when you are in your teens &amp; early 20&#x27;s (avoiding excessive sun, wearing sunscreen, handling acne, etc...) you&#x27;ll be much better off in the long run. And if you are going to use ANY lightening cream, be mindful that you are going to be more photosensitive afterwords; wear sunscreen.the spots to return once you have finishing using Ambi, because the skin&#x27;s melanin is what makes us tan &amp; freckle; protecting &amp; reacting to the sun&#x27;s rays.

            <li> I&#x27;m hispanic so I&#x27;m a little more of the tan skin so my sun spot I was trying to take off is still there with no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;This must work on fair skinned people only?</li>
            <li> At least... it works better than any other topical over-the-counter product that I&#x27;ve tried so far.  The Alpha-Hydroxy is pretty much the only thing that has been clinically tested that shows some effectiveness on wrinkles and spots--so that&#x27;s good.  I like the Vit E (who knows?  but it can&#x27;t hurt to have it) and definitely the sunscreen (wonder what the SPF it is?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-fair Asian skin but had spent years at the beach and skiing, so I had some mega-huge brown spots at the top of my cheek-bones and lots of smaller spots I never had when I was younger from all the sun.  (I used to tan so dark people couldn&#x27;t be sure WHAT race I was!---this was BEFORE they started telling us about how too much sun was going to be bad for your skin!)  Anyway, my smaller spots seem to be lightening... I still have one big one that is super-obvious, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the scent of the stuff... but that disappears quickly.  It feels a little oily on my skin, but not horrible.  I don&#x27;t get a reaction (I don&#x27;t tend to have sensitive skin).  My skin overall looks better (seems to be good for wrinkles, too).  Other products didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all--and I&#x27;d used I lot of brands and types.  I was thinking that there wasn&#x27;t anything even the least bit effective out there--but so far, this is not bad!  I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so and will continue to see how it goes, but I&#x27;m happy I tried it!</li>
            <li> Not good product at all!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t strong enough to face my spots so got a prescription for real thing at 2X power. Now I use this every day and the prescription one ever 2-3 days. Seems to be a great combination. Even protected me in Bermuda&#x27;s sun (with hat and sunglasses too, of course).</li>
            <li> You will have to use it at least twice a day and buy a number of tubes as they run out quickly if you use it for your whole body but it does a good job.   I would defiantly recommend this product for mixed race, caramel toned complexions, who want to even skin tone and lighten blemishes.</li>
            <li> Great skin product.  I get a lot of compliments about how great my skins looks.  Have been using Ambi for years and plan to continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This product does work, though as many other reviewers mention, the use of the cream must be consistent.  After using the cream about twice daily for a couple months, the spot I wanted to fade is noticeably lighter.  I will need to keep using it but I hope the scar will be completely gone soon.    You do have to be committed to applying the cream multiple times daily, but it does work! And I&#x27;ve only used a small fraction of one tube.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient (Hydroquinone) has reportedly been all but banned for skin use in Europe (Directive 76/768/EEC:1976) because it was found to be carcinogenic- which means \\&quot;cancer- causing.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am a medium to fair skin female in my early 30s and I have a few dark spots on my face from being an irresponsible beach bunny for many years! I wanted an inexpensive cream to help me fight the look of aging. I picked up this product about 4 months ago. I did notice  slight improvement after a few weeks but not as much fading as I would have liked. However, over the last few weeks, I have noticed a drastic lightening of the spots. I have used this product twice a day, religiously, for the last 4 months and truly believe it is starting to work. If you buy this product, it will not fade overnight, you have to keep using it for a while. For the price, I think it is a remarkable product and now, my darkest spots have almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed, twice a day every day (only missing one application per day less than half a dozen times) on the pregnancy mask I had and on my dark under-eye circles. I&#x27;ve used it for the past 45 days (package says results should be seen in 2 months) and have found a little reduction in discoloration but not much, not even 50%. Definitely not as much as some other reviewers claimed. So that&#x27;s the positive right there: there was some reduction, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons of this product are that if you have sensitive skin like mine - where you put lotions or creams or acne treatments of almost any kind on your skin and it makes you break out - this product will make you break out. I was using it for the sun damage on my forehead at first, and when I started breaking out, I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other con is that it&#x27;s only 2% hydroquinone. Maybe if the percentage was a little higher, I might have seen better results in a shorter time frame? I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t think 2% is anywhere near enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product. If you want to see if hydroquinone works, I would try something with a higher percentage of it, which is something I might do.</li>
            <li> At 52, I have splotchy, dark discoloration on my neck as a result of birth control pills taken when I was 45 and sun damage. I&#x27;ve used this cream twice daily for two months with great results. The splotches have faded from dark brown to pale tan...I&#x27;m quite happy with the results. I&#x27;ve increased my daily intake of vitamin D3 to (hopefully) offset the slight medical risk. The cream is not as easy to use on age spots because it&#x27;s difficult to keep the cream only on the age spot and off the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, she has fair skin and freckles. The sun reeks havoc on her fair skin making her freckles darker. This product helps fade the freckles from the sun. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This product works well if you don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin like I do.  I knew there was a chance my skin may not receive it well but if I just use it lightly and only a couple of times a week, my spots will fade in due time.  It worked well for my friend who tried it out daily.</li>
            <li> Been using Ambi for one month, three to four times per day...has faded my UNDER EYE DARK CIRCLES and huge dark spots on either side of my face by at least seventy five percent in this short amount of time. I am not doomed to wear makeup..HALLELUJAH!!Can u believe it...it works on dark circles...after all the research I did that says there is no cure or treatment for dark circles!!!!!!! Thank you Jesus!!!!I have before and after pics to prove my point!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this cream. I decided to give it a try because I heard about it, so I googled it. I have to say that so far so good. Those age brown spots can be annoying, and Ambi can help a little.</li>
            <li> Not a great product.  I used this and realized it was not for me.  I could not send the product back because I had passed the deadline, but it did not work like promised</li>
            <li> liked this cream a lot seemed to make the dark spots fade I would recommend this cream to anyone older</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after about a month. The time period was long because I could only use the product once a day, otherwise it caused skin irritation. Product goes on smoothly and base is very moist.</li>
            <li> At 42 I had several dark \\&quot;age spots\\&quot; on the side of my face.  I have fair skin that freckles easily.  After at least a month of day and night use I had very good fading of the two age spots.  They didn&#x27;t completely go away but they were much less noticeable. The smell of this product isn&#x27;t lovely but it isn&#x27;t awful either.  I didn&#x27;t find to be an issue.   Can&#x27;t really go wrong at the price of this product.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Gently fades blemishes.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me.  I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me.  About a week later, I did see that it had faded my brown spot, so it does work, I just couldn&#x27;t deal with the headaches.  It must be very toxic in some way.  I would steer clear of it.  An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use.  I guess I was wrong.  I am trying the Niacin products now, and so far, no headaches or anything alarming.</li>
            <li> This product made my face itch and dry.  I didn&#x27;t get through the first tube, thought I would give away the other 3 unopened tubes to a friend but they were expired so I threw away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little less than a month.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change in the age spots I am trying to fade, but I am hopeful.  I use it only at night although it is reccommended to use morning and night, so I think it may take longer for me.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t work to fade the spots, I find it works well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Ambi is great product! I was so embarrass the fact that my scar(chemical burn) I got was very dark. I used the product for 2 months and the scar has faded!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME. My dermatologist wrote me a perscription for some cream but the insurance would not cover and the price was almost 200.00 for it so needless to say I did not get it. I bought this and wow, it really does work. You need to give it some time, will not take care of it in a week or two but if you are patient, you will be happy. My neck and chest has dark discoloration from years of abuse and if I use this, it slowly fades it down to normal. You do have to make sure you do not expose the treated skin to the sun or tanning since you defeat the purpose but I would definitely recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings on Ambi Fade Cream.  On one hand it did exactly what it said it would do.  I have dark spots left from acne and it drastically faded the spots in less than a week. (obvious fading).  On the other hand apparently I&#x27;m allergic to hydroquinone because it broke my face out terribly (small rash like bumps).  I used the fade cream along with the Ambi Even &amp; Clear Exfoliating Wash (which I&#x27;m still using).  I really did hate to quit using the fade cream because it really was improving the dark spots.  I once used Reverse (by Rodan &amp; Fields) and it did the same thing.  I googled the ingredients in Reverse and it has hydroquinone in it also.  So I definitely would recommend testing this product on a small area of your face before using it.  After see a dermatologist, they don&#x27;t recommend using products with hydroquinone and products with sylicylic acid because a lot of times they will cause a reaction.  So I will sadly throw the rest of the bottle away.  I have since purchased Neutrogena visibly even SPF 30 moisturizer and Avalon Organics Vitamin C serum.  Between the two they cleared the reaction and my spots are still fading.</li>
            <li> While Wikipedia is not the final word on anything, it&#x27;s not a bad place to start. Even my pharmacology professor uses it for drug research. At the bottom of any article is a long reference list you can explore. I decided to look up the main active ingredient, hydroquinone and below is an excerpt. (Remember, \\&quot;carcinogenic\\&quot; and \\&quot;neoplasms\\&quot; are terms associated with cancer, and skin cancer can be deadly.) You might also want to see the Wikipedia article titled \\&quot;Skin Lightening\\&quot; for a good overview of safety and risks of various ingredients. It looks to me as though the alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are a relatively safe bet for evening out skin pigmentation. I have blotches too, so I know what it&#x27;s like. It&#x27;s always best to make informed decisions, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excerpt from Wikipedia on \\&quot;Hydroquinone\\&quot;: In human medicine, hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin as it does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as metol does. This use is banned in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC:1976.[3][4]&lt;br /&gt;In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations.[5] The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.[6]&lt;br /&gt;Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin.[5][7]&lt;br /&gt;While using hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity. Using a daily sunscreen with a high PPD (persistent pigment darkening) rating reduces the risk of further damage. Hydroquinone is sometimes combined with alpha hydroxy acids that exfoliate the skin to quicken the lightening process. In the United States, topical treatments usually contain up to 2% in hydroquinone. Otherwise, higher concentrations (up to 4%) should be prescribed and used with caution.ng hydroquinone as lightening agent can be effective with proper use, it can also cause skin sensitivity.

            <li> This product is amazing. I used it first for strange (and ugly) discoloration on my face, particularly around and above my mouth, when I was a smoker. It disappeared almost overnight. I returned to Ambi recently after recovering from a rash on my arm. It almost looked like I had a burn covering my arm, and after months it still had not faded; I remembered my success with Ambi and tried it again, and again with really just a couple applications the coloring has faded almost 75 percent.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!  My dark spots have faded away and the product only costs pennies per day.  This inexpensive product works better than the high dollar products.</li>
            <li> This product works just in 7 days I have seen the result. I recommend this product to any one who wants to see result.</li>
            <li> Okay let me start off saying that i&#x27;m a 2 tone women and i just want to be all one skin tone and ambi work for me now i must say that i did not work for me over night it do take time and i still have a long way to go with my skin so i al so use the soap i love the soap it wipe off easy clean i use the soap alot because where i live i can get it at the store for $2 and i get like 5 boxes of the ambi soap i try the ambi lotion one time i have to buy more to give a review on that but back to the cream i love it i live buy it i hate when i run out i get them at the hair store my dollar general dollar store and i got some from here to it just work for me but i don&#x27;t think it work on very dark skin and thank god. That i&#x27;m not dark and yeah i use sun block i&amp;#34;m not bleching my skin but what i&#x27;m doing is eveing out my skin to get that honey brown tone that i&#x27;m looking for and with this omg it and i.thank god for this now i can look in the mirror and see that my skin has change and that make me cry and it feel so good that something that been around for years that it work still to this day god bless ambi and dont never take it off the market thank. You ambi and thank you amazon for selling the on here where you can buy more then one and that is what i like to do is to buy more then one the way i use it the 1st time is u put it on then i leave it on for 4hours max then i put the 2nd time on there and leave it on for 3 more hours then i wash it off and do the same thing the next day and that is how i use it again love it buy more til i&#x27;m dead and gone i will not use nothing else but my ambi ambi got my vote</li>
            <li> my life saver. I had acne marks on my chest, back and legs, my chest marks are clearing out so fast, i can&#x27;t believe that. Even though i don&#x27;t like the smell because it&#x27;s too strong; i don&#x27;t use it at night but in the morning.</li>
            <li> I feel I was misled by this product until I understood the wording &amp;#34;guaranteed to fade dark spots&amp;#34;. I was looking for my one brown spot to disappear, but this cream, and others like it don&#x27;t do that. Yes, it does fade the brown spot maybe one or two shades, but if you stop using it they darken right back up. If you use this product, look at the lid after a couple of days; the cream around the lid turns dark brown. Not a good selling point. I don&#x27;t know if there is anything out there that makes spots disappear.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find that this worked at all :( Waste of money. It did smell good though.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 2 starts is because of the price.  This product made my skin break out terribly within the first week of using.  It never seemed to soak in, and my skin always felt greasy and oily.  It might work for someone else, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Only two weeks haven&#x27;t seen results yet</li>
            <li> This product really works. In approximately two weeks i started seeing results. I would definetly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to CA from FL, where Ambi was easily found in any drugstore.  Not so in CA!  So I searched on Amazon as a last resort to see if I could find this product and was pleasantly surprised, and at a good price too.&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t many products out there that work AND that are reasonably priced.  I use this for the brown spots on my hands, and when used nightly, it does fade spots and keeps them from returning.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my face, but I imagine it would work fine there as well.</li>
            <li> um doesnt lighten my dark spots at all, lightened the skin around it. now i look dumb. A dark spot with lighter skin around it. Like how stupid.</li>
            <li> Have used Ambi for years on face and back of hands.  Just this past week, got complements from 2 senior ladies about how nice my skin looks without old-age spots.  There are lots of other fade creams on the market, more expensive, but this one I like for the price and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and make blemishes.  Sometimes hard to find, depending on the brick and mortar store.  Good sized tube for the price.</li>
            <li> I mad an mistake by choose Ambi cream for normal skin . my skin is oily. I thought that&#x27;s ok because my skin a little be dry because of using Acne products that&#x27;s y I choose normal skin but when I use it I got a lot of blackhead that transform to acne. so I stop use it for my face and keep use it for my hand and knee and I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is not any better than another dozen or so products out there. Also, the information does NOT tell you what amount of the different types of ingredients are in it. If you want something that is weak, then maybe its for you. But BEWARE if you purchase it or any other product from Pharmapacks. The product is not strong enough, and I returned it unopened to the seller, Pharmapacks, who did NOT give me a complete refund.  I reported Pharmapacks to Amazon, and I advise anyone that contemplates buying from  Pharmapacks to kiss your money goodbye, because you won&#x27;t get it all back if these is a problem with your order, as there was with mine. This is the worst seller I have encountered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this to work but haven&#x27;t seen any results after using religiously for two months. All of that being said, I&#x27;m a very pale Caucasian woman with very pronounced and old hyperpigmentation scars due to acne/compulsive skin picking. The price was so much more affordable and a better texture than the other creams I&#x27;ve tried, so am very disappointed. Lots of other good reviews, so I might be an anomaly.</li>
            <li> I am a very white skill male who had some light brown spots in the face big enough to bother. Seems to be developed because of the effects of the sun. I have tried two creams before Ambi but one did not do anything and the other one irritated my skin face a lot. Ambi have really work on my skin, I do not give the 5 stars on the review because I have not follow the treatment as consistent as I should but the face spots have sustancially being reduced and some of then are almost invisible already. The main chemical that reduce the skin spots is the hydroquinone and this product has it.  I strongly recomend this cream for people with sensitive skin and I am sure that if you apply it two times a day as recommended you will get rid off your spot by the time. This cream comes with SPF so you do not have to worry about the sunscreen lotion until you finish the treatment.  Hope my review help you to make a decision.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to stave off dark blemishes from where acne scars/pimples used to be in my face. It has generally worked for those spots in my face where skin has freshly healed from acne/pimples (that&#x27;s after the extraction of the pus inside). I&#x27;m still figuring out how to remove the dark blemishes that&#x27;s been on my face since my teenage years. I&#x27;m leaning towards trying a microneedle roller and then putting this and some (step 3) proactiv lotion on those spots.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it. It leaves the skin smooth every time I use it, but it took several months to see results I could be sure of. I may try the one by Garnier next as a friend recommends it highly, but if it dries my skin out more I will switch back. I use it on both my hands and face and am fairly happy with it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months consistently.  It did nothing to fade sun spots or some dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This worked okay. I&#x27;m thinking you might need to get to the dark spots sooner than I got to mine. It faded some of the newer ones. If you have had dark spots for a while, it might not work so well.</li>
            <li> Love this it fades our sun spots and has sunscreen in it.We put it on ATMs face neck buy in bulk.Helps my PN  too&lt;br /&gt;Pruigo Nodularis .Buy the 5 pack!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change and after reading that the active ingredient has been banned in Japan and Europe, an wondering why it is allowed here? For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used this and it was great for the first couple uses but it stopped working and it made me itch.</li>
            <li> Takes about 12wks for full effect, but see results in about 6wks. Use it for some sun spots and hyperpigmentation from pregnancy. Used during post partum, not while pregnant.</li>
            <li> Skin turnover is around 28 days or one month.  Even though some people have seen results earlier than this, it might be because they were two weeks in until their \\&quot;skin turnover\\&quot;.  Make sense?  This stuff does work!!! However, you must use it according to the directions.  Give yourself a nice gentle warm face wash then pat dry with a soft towel.  While your face is barely moist from the washing, apply Ambi.  Let it soak in with the moisture of evaporating water from your face wash.  Do this in the morning, and then again before you go to bed. The skin works \\&quot;magic\\&quot; overnight (read up on it) and you&#x27;ll see a difference in your skin in no time.  This is not a cream that will work in just three days.  Add it to your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one time, I had horrible hyper-pigmentation due to hormones and who know what else.  I gave up on this before giving it the full \\&quot;skin turnover\\&quot; time.  Well, I tried it again and I was just amazed at the results when it is used as I mentioned above.  Now, I don&#x27;t even need any cover-up or base and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 months and dark spots still remained the same. Never again!</li>
            <li> I like to use it as body cream, it helps me a lot after the summer heat.</li>
            <li> The cream is very sticky</li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and nothing has changed. I&#x27;m going to continue using it for a couple months to see if that&#x27;s what it takes.</li>
            <li> I used two tubes of this product and saw no visible results on the age spots I have developed as I age.  I&#x27;m very fair complected and used this product twice daily and still saw no results.  I then tried Derma E after hearing a dermatologist on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show tout the properties of pycnogenol.  I even ordered the oral tablets in addition to using Derma e which contains pycnogenol... again, two jars.. and nothing.  I don&#x27;t know why people claim things work...  when they don&#x27;t.</li>
    </ol>
