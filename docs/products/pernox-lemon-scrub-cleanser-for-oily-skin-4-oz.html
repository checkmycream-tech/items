            <li>did try it,very nice for a scrub.</li>
            <li>It is the best facial scrub on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love Pernox &amp; have been using it for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li>But I wish I had purchased more.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more, as I need it, and i dont think there is a reason to ever stop using it.</li>
            <li>It is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>Pernox is an awesome scrub that helps reduce pore size, blackheads and exfoliates deeply.  </li>
            <li>Many of them have scents that I do not like.  </li>
            <li>but now i use it every day because it is better then anything else i used and does not bother my face.</li>
            <li>I love it and will reorder.</li>
            <li>It takes a more abrasive scrub to clean the oily buildup from my face.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates the skin, helps to keep it smooth.  </li>
            <li>This lemon is a nice light scent and it really helps for getting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is great for people who are teenagers and long beyond.  </li>
            <li>For years I used Ionax Scrub to clean my face...</li>
            <li>I use it almost every day as my face does not feel clean without it.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and does not get iritated from it</li>
            <li>I feel my face more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried other products for acne and haven&#x27;t been successful, this is worth the shot.</li>
            <li>I just ordered this product last week, I&#x27;m not even quite sure how I stumbled upon it, but it&#x27;s definitely one of the best skin treatment purchases I&#x27;ve made in a very long time.</li>
            <li>It can be very, very drying and cause peeling until your skin adjusts to it and goes through an exfoliation process.  </li>
            <li>I credit most of this to Pernox which cleanses my oily skin far better than any other product I have found.  </li>
            <li>Once skin is under control, one doesn&#x27;t need to use a lot of it--just consistently and rinse very well.</li>
            <li>My skin is really thankful to this product.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin this product really works well.  </li>
            <li>Can someone in J&amp;J or Ranbaxy explain why they killed off an effective product?</li>
            <li>It is more abrasive than any other product you will find, but that is why I like it.</li>
            <li>It cleans and polishes, leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, bright and a little tight..</li>
            <li>This product works better than any other skin care product I have ever used!</li>
            <li>In fact, I haven&#x27;t tried any new products in decades!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive oily skin</li>
            <li>It used to be an Rx when I first started using it back in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It keeps oiliness away during the day when I wash with it in the morning and keeps to clear up clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I am 67 and people think I am in my early 50s.  </li>
            <li>and I recently convinced my 13 year old son to use it.  </li>
            <li>I have battled acne since I was a teenager, the main issue being extremely oily skin which inevitably leads to frequent break outs.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years.  It is the best facial scrub on the market.  It is more abrasive than any other product you will find, but that is why I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is hard to find at any physical retail locations but I can always find it on Amazon. I love Pernox &amp; have been using it for almost 10 years.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores.  It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps acne at bay, including that bumpy under the skin acne.  Makes my skin brighter and smoother.  It can be very, very drying and cause peeling until your skin adjusts to it and goes through an exfoliation process.  Once skin is under control, one doesn&#x27;t need to use a lot of it--just consistently and rinse very well.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best skin scrub ever made.  Whether you have acne or not, it makes your face glow.  But alas, it is no longer manufactured.  You can&#x27;t get it anywhere, except on eBay for prices near $400, which is as insane as it sounds.  I even wonder why people have it to sell on eBay and suspect, frankly, that they don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s why the insane prices.  I purchased this on Amazon a few years ago at $24 a tube.  Expensive at that time.  But I wish I had purchased more.</li>
            <li> Do not understand why J&amp;J sold Pernox off to Ranbaxy.  What is Ranbaxy????  Why did Ranbaxy discontinue Pernox?  As everyone who ever used Pernox can attest, it was an amazingly effective product.  When businesses make really questionable decisions that result in the discontinuance of an effective product, it creates the impression that someone(s) in that company in the marketing/business departments is not competent.  Can someone in J&amp;J or Ranbaxy explain why they killed off an effective product?</li>
            <li> This item has been discontinued. Because of that, some of these businesses including this one, is price gouging. I will never do business with this place again.</li>
            <li> Pernox is like a mini microderm abrasion. It feels wonderful and cleans my skin great, very saticfied. I plan on ordering more, as I need it, and i dont think there is a reason to ever stop using it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 30 years... loved it. But, it went through several ownership&lt;br /&gt;changes and now has been abandoned for some reason.</li>
            <li> Used when I was in my 20s and now in my 40s I find it to be just as beneficial.  It cleans and polishes, leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, bright and a little tight..</li>
            <li> I and 46 and have been using Pernox since I was a teenager.  My skin still looks great.  My mother who is 70 uses it and I recently convinced my 13 year old son to use it.  Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for over 35 yrs. Of course , it was $2.50 back then. I recommend this product to anyone with oily skin and want that refreshed feel on there face.</li>
            <li> For years I used Ionax Scrub to clean my face...then it was discontinued and I thought I would never find another product that exfoliated so well.  Pernox is that product.  It takes a more abrasive scrub to clean the oily buildup from my face.  I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> It is just fantastic! My skin is really thankful to this product. I feel my face more soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. It used to be an Rx when I first started using it back in the 70&#x27;s. I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  This product works better than any other skin care product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have battled acne since I was a teenager, the main issue being extremely oily skin which inevitably leads to frequent break outs. I just ordered this product last week, I&#x27;m not even quite sure how I stumbled upon it, but it&#x27;s definitely one of the best skin treatment purchases I&#x27;ve made in a very long time. It&#x27;s painless, easy to use, and best of all effective! If you&#x27;ve tried other products for acne and haven&#x27;t been successful, this is worth the shot.</li>
            <li> This is a great face scrub.  It exfoliates the skin, helps to keep it smooth.  Recommend to anyone with skin issues.</li>
            <li> Pernox is an awesome scrub that helps reduce pore size, blackheads and exfoliates deeply.  It is great for people who are teenagers and long beyond.  Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I am 67 and people think I am in my early 50s.  I credit most of this to Pernox which cleanses my oily skin far better than any other product I have found.  In fact, I haven&#x27;t tried any new products in decades! I use it almost every day as my face does not feel clean without it.  If you have oily skin, once you try this, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product when I asked him about facial scrubs to exfoliate and prepare my face for shaving.  I&#x27;ve tried other face scrubs.  Many of them have scents that I do not like.  This lemon is a nice light scent and it really helps for getting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive oily skin i thought this is gonna be too raugh for daily use so i planned on using it like once a week but now i use it every day because it is better then anything else i used and does not bother my face. My face feels clean and does not get iritated from it</li>
            <li> This is a great product; I have used it for many years and I have recommended to a lot of my friends and family</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin this product really works well.  It keeps oiliness away during the day when I wash with it in the morning and keeps to clear up clogged pores. If your skin is not very oily, then the product would probably be too drying.  I love it and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Even though this was a gift for my Boyfriend,&lt;br /&gt;I did try it,very nice for a scrub. Refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good cleansing scrub.</li>
