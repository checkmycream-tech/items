            <li>I bought it for my boyfriend, and I don&#x27;t think it turned me on or anything, but it did smell really good on him, and in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Good smell though and good value for the size/cost.</li>

            <li>I had the opportunity to try this out for a reduced rate in exchange for an honest review, so I figured why not?</li>
            <li>All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband because I had the opportunity to use a discount to buy it--figured, why not, seems kind of like a joke.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bottle at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>:) very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>Smells good and not too strong.</li>
            <li>It gives my husband a nice manly smell which I absolutly love.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if the Pheromones are working a putting out some scent from me, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell ladies love it</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong!</li>
            <li>very nice smell fresh</li>
            <li>It smells really good and was very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I love giving gifts and will be purchasing many more for the holiday season</li>
            <li>love the way it smells on my hudband</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>, i just don&#x27;t feel i love it nor does it attract me to him more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Healthy Attraction Pheromone cologne for men.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>the good smell fresh out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I find myself snuggling up to him a lot more now, and it smells a lot better on him than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle to try out and according to my female friends it smells great!</li>
            <li>Ok so I, ordered this because..</li>
            <li>Maybe we should give it more time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its my imagination but women seem to be paying more attention to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell really spectacular or special in the bottle but after about 20 minutes after he puts it on,</li>
            <li>The bottle claims that this cologne, infused with pheromones as it is, is meant to &amp;#34;enhance your own sex appeal.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know how true this</li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting!!</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of it, and while more than 2 squirts is pretty overpowering, if you have the right amount on, you&#x27;ll smell great all day.</li>
            <li>It has a light, kind of clean scent.</li>
            <li>He and I think it smells great, but as far as providing added attraction, I can not vouch for the product making a difference.</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming, really nice smell and great cologne for any guy!</li>
            <li>I am actually highly surprised how great this smells.</li>
            <li>Very nice masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking that it would be like a dollar store cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong alcohol smell or chemicals.</li>
            <li>While the scent is a pleasant one, it dissipates rather quickly, so don&#x27;t expect your man to smell &#x27;good&#x27; all evening long.</li>
            <li>Such a great smell</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light, and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I ended up receiving it at a discount in return for a genuine critique.</li>
            <li>and she did enjoy the scent she wasn&#x27;t tearing off my clothes or anything.</li>
            <li>This cologne seems to be nothing but cheap cologne - which is what I got it for.  </li>
            <li>I brush up all right, but I am most comfortable in my jeans and t-shirts.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and get many compliments but no results as a pheromone oil that attracts the other sex, Just an amazing smell to me.</li>
            <li>after I shower - I have had many compliments recently on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li>When my husband finally came home and tried it out, he loved it.</li>
            <li>As far as working as an attractant--maybe, cause it does smell really nice, and husband seems to like the attention he is getting from me.</li>
            <li>She more aggressive in what she wants when I wear this.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product just not for us.</li>
            <li>This would likely be a good fit for someone who is sensitive to strong fragrances, but still wants to be able to wear, or have their partner wear cologne.</li>
            <li>However, many people (especially people of the opposite gender) have commented on how great the cologne smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about the supposedly added Pheromones and such inside of this cologne, I haven&#x27;t noticed any females being more interested in me or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the bold and masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>As for the pheromone, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different but one of the ladies did say she liked the smell.</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite cologne by far</li>
            <li>It has an okay smell, kind of strong, not sure how it works as a pheromone though as it really has not made a difference .</li>
            <li>It has a very clean, masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally the kind of person you think of when you think of a cologne-wearer.</li>
            <li>not my favorite and seems to be a little more feminine.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a funny buy for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Such a sexy smell.</li>
            <li>Hubby and son have worn this for the last 3 days and though i think it smells ok on my husband</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed more attention from the ladies at work.</li>
            <li>I spray myself once or twice first thing in the morning and every evening</li>
            <li>I like that it has no harsh chemicals and is paraben and sulfate free.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely buy more from this.</li>
            <li>My nose is pretty sensitive to certain smells and some of it being cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells masculine and clean but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really works or my confidence level is higher</li>
            <li>My husband and I love the sexy yet subtle scent</li>
            <li>Smells a little clique, not a bad thing though, it lasts all day and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I meet the lady who doesn&#x27;t mind being manipulated by pheromone cologne into thinking I&#x27;m sexier than I am, but for now, I&#x27;m inclined to believe that this cologne certainly can do what it says.</li>
            <li>But since I was assured that I smell subtle and very pleasant, I have only to imagine that the increased interest in me by the fairer sex may well be attributed to this pheromone-laced fragrance.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t believe in pheromones</li>
            <li>We really didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>This is pheromones though, so it wouldn&#x27;t really make much sense for me to wear it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my husband.</li>
            <li>well.. I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li>As for the addition of pheromones can&#x27;t really say they worked.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about the attraction thing tho.</li>
            <li>It really attract the ladies</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really know if it works...</li>
            <li>Which is relieving because I was worried that the heads I was turning was due more to the odour than to any enhanced sex appeal this cologne provided.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that it should be safe for someone that&#x27;s heavy handed with their cologne application.</li>
            <li>One down fall men also seem to be paying more attention to me.</li>
            <li>The stuff was apparently still strong since I ended up cuddling and petting our cat for the next 3 hours while we tried to watch a movie.</li>
            <li>This is a really enticing perfume, i love it when my husband use, the only draw back is that its so tiny.</li>
            <li>It does make a decent smelling cologne and has actually become one of my new favorite scents to wear, simply because of the scent, not because of it&#x27;s supposed female attracting abilities.</li>
            <li>I am already attracted to him though so I am not sure if the attraction part is working :) .</li>
            <li>But when my husband got this in and he immediately put it on, not 20 minutes later, it really had me turned on!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s completely different from his other cologne&#x27;s he owns.</li>
            <li>but just is a little too strong for our liking.</li>
            <li>The smell is soft and floral.</li>
            <li>after it has mixed with his chemistry and body heat, it is absolutely yummy.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me a bit of Candies or Curve, a bit sweet and not incredibly masculine but still obviously a cologne.</li>
            <li>but he normally does with his regular cologne.</li>
            <li>Whether or not I actually felt more &#x27;attracted&#x27; to him while he was wearing this, is really hard to tell.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy smelling but enough for a young boy.</li>
            <li>Though I may not have normally purchased something like this, I am always looking for ways to add a little extra fun to our date nights.</li>
            <li>It has natural essential oils in it, and reminds me of the oil roller colognes.</li>
            <li>Soft scent but overall my fiance</li>
            <li>This stuff is CRAZY good.</li>
            <li>Picture this, grown man trying to pose all sexy (victoria secret model) on the couch.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to buy unknown cologne online since I won&#x27;t be able to test it.</li>

            <li> Very nice masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking that it would be like a dollar store cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong alcohol smell or chemicals.</li>
            <li> While the scent is a pleasant one, it dissipates rather quickly, so don&#x27;t expect your man to smell &#x27;good&#x27; all evening long.</li>
            <li> Such a great smell</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light, and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I ended up receiving it at a discount in return for a genuine critique.</li>
            <li> and she did enjoy the scent she wasn&#x27;t tearing off my clothes or anything.</li>
            <li> This cologne seems to be nothing but cheap cologne - which is what I got it for.  </li>
            <li> I brush up all right, but I am most comfortable in my jeans and t-shirts.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and get many compliments but no results as a pheromone oil that attracts the other sex, Just an amazing smell to me.</li>
            <li> after I shower - I have had many compliments recently on how nice I smell.  </li>
            <li> When my husband finally came home and tried it out, he loved it.</li>
            <li> As far as working as an attractant--maybe, cause it does smell really nice, and husband seems to like the attention he is getting from me.</li>
            <li> She more aggressive in what she wants when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product just not for us.</li>
            <li> This would likely be a good fit for someone who is sensitive to strong fragrances, but still wants to be able to wear, or have their partner wear cologne.</li>
            <li> However, many people (especially people of the opposite gender) have commented on how great the cologne smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the supposedly added Pheromones and such inside of this cologne, I haven&#x27;t noticed any females being more interested in me or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the bold and masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li> As for the pheromone, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different but one of the ladies did say she liked the smell.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite cologne by far</li>
            <li> It has an okay smell, kind of strong, not sure how it works as a pheromone though as it really has not made a difference .</li>
            <li> It has a very clean, masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally the kind of person you think of when you think of a cologne-wearer.</li>
            <li> not my favorite and seems to be a little more feminine.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a funny buy for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Such a sexy smell.</li>
            <li> Hubby and son have worn this for the last 3 days and though i think it smells ok on my husband</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed more attention from the ladies at work.</li>
            <li> I spray myself once or twice first thing in the morning and every evening</li>
            <li> I like that it has no harsh chemicals and is paraben and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely buy more from this.</li>
            <li> My nose is pretty sensitive to certain smells and some of it being cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li> This cologne smells masculine and clean but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really works or my confidence level is higher</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the sexy yet subtle scent</li>
            <li> Smells a little clique, not a bad thing though, it lasts all day and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I meet the lady who doesn&#x27;t mind being manipulated by pheromone cologne into thinking I&#x27;m sexier than I am, but for now, I&#x27;m inclined to believe that this cologne certainly can do what it says.</li>
            <li> But since I was assured that I smell subtle and very pleasant, I have only to imagine that the increased interest in me by the fairer sex may well be attributed to this pheromone-laced fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t believe in pheromones</li>
            <li> We really didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This is pheromones though, so it wouldn&#x27;t really make much sense for me to wear it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my husband.</li>
            <li> well.. I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li> As for the addition of pheromones can&#x27;t really say they worked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about the attraction thing tho.</li>
            <li> It really attract the ladies</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really know if it works...</li>
            <li> Which is relieving because I was worried that the heads I was turning was due more to the odour than to any enhanced sex appeal this cologne provided.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that it should be safe for someone that&#x27;s heavy handed with their cologne application.</li>
            <li> One down fall men also seem to be paying more attention to me.</li>
            <li> The stuff was apparently still strong since I ended up cuddling and petting our cat for the next 3 hours while we tried to watch a movie.</li>
            <li> This is a really enticing perfume, i love it when my husband use, the only draw back is that its so tiny.</li>
            <li> It does make a decent smelling cologne and has actually become one of my new favorite scents to wear, simply because of the scent, not because of it&#x27;s supposed female attracting abilities.</li>
            <li> I am already attracted to him though so I am not sure if the attraction part is working :) .</li>
            <li> But when my husband got this in and he immediately put it on, not 20 minutes later, it really had me turned on!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s completely different from his other cologne&#x27;s he owns.</li>
            <li> but just is a little too strong for our liking.</li>
            <li> The smell is soft and floral.</li>
            <li> after it has mixed with his chemistry and body heat, it is absolutely yummy.  </li>
            <li> The smell reminds me a bit of Candies or Curve, a bit sweet and not incredibly masculine but still obviously a cologne.</li>
            <li> but he normally does with his regular cologne.</li>
            <li> Whether or not I actually felt more &#x27;attracted&#x27; to him while he was wearing this, is really hard to tell.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy smelling but enough for a young boy.</li>
            <li> Though I may not have normally purchased something like this, I am always looking for ways to add a little extra fun to our date nights.</li>
            <li> It has natural essential oils in it, and reminds me of the oil roller colognes.</li>
            <li> Soft scent but overall my fiance</li>
            <li> This stuff is CRAZY good.</li>
            <li> Picture this, grown man trying to pose all sexy (victoria secret model) on the couch.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to buy unknown cologne online since I won&#x27;t be able to test it.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not a masculine enough smell for me to wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this separately from other scents I generally use -</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> It has a label on the front with the name and company and a label on the back to explain the product a little, offer suggested uses including safety information, and listing ingredients.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different...</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if it would have an effect on me.  </li>
            <li> You really do not need to use a lot of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than than I expected after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this.  </li>
            <li> After she recovered from hyperventilating due to her uncontrollable laughter, I took a shower.</li>
            <li> The presentation left a little to be desired -- there&#x27;s no box for this, just the bottle which is fairly plain and unexciting.</li>
            <li> I would catch myself smelling him from time to time as we sat down watching tv.</li>
            <li> No stickiness or bland smell.</li>
            <li> Men, if your really looking for a way to get the ladies to go crazy over you, this is it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has gotten a few compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my husband and hated the smell, tried on my son and it was okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times around my girl</li>
            <li> Worst case scenario, I won&#x27;t even be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> but this is no magic attraction cologne.</li>
            <li> and there is a small setback - I myself cannot smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll work for random dating though</li>
            <li> stupid thing just jumped back on.</li>
            <li> Happily, it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it&#x27;s made in the US.</li>
            <li> Personal use, I hated the smell..</li>
            <li> Boy was he wrong!  </li>
            <li> but after about 2 minutes turns into nasty chemical smell</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is amazing, where&#x27;s that darn 6th star? Ladies and gents, it&#x27;s just that good!  I love giving gifts and will be purchasing many more for the holiday season (hey it&#x27;ll be here sooner than you know it).  I can guarantee I will win Christmas with this!</li>
            <li> love the way it smells on my hudband</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the sexy yet subtle scent</li>
            <li> My nose is pretty sensitive to certain smells and some of it being cheap cologne.  So it&#x27;s extremely hard for me to buy unknown cologne online since I won&#x27;t be able to test it. Worst case scenario, I won&#x27;t even be able to use it.  However, I&#x27;m happy (and relieved) to report that this cologne is awesome.  It smells wonderful.  This is now my favorite cologne.  As for the pheromone, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different but one of the ladies did say she liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a funny buy for my husband.  I was curious to see if it would have an effect on me.  It gives my husband a nice manly smell which I absolutly love. I would lay on the couch next to him and automatically get a hint of the smell and it was so pleasant.  I would catch myself smelling him from time to time as we sat down watching tv. A little bit goes a long way with this.  1 or 2 sprays max.  This is not like axe that you shower in it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both tried this item and it did not smell different for either one of us! Was lemony smelling.</li>
            <li> My son loved this. Its not heavy smelling but enough for a young boy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He said it smelled nice but smelled too feminine for his taste.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! Such a great smell I couldn&#x27;t get enough of it! Definatley will buy again. Such a sexy smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice masculine smell.  Long lasting fragrance.  After two sprays you will get noticed.  Definitely worth getting!!</li>
            <li> It smells really good and was very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say I have seen an increase in female attention since I started wearing this. I really don&#x27;t believe in pheromones and I don&#x27;t believe the pheromones contained in this cologne work. It does make a decent smelling cologne and has actually become one of my new favorite scents to wear, simply because of the scent, not because of it&#x27;s supposed female attracting abilities.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has gotten a few compliments on the smell. He likes it and so do I.</li>
            <li> Hubby and son have worn this for the last 3 days and though i think it smells ok on my husband, i just don&#x27;t feel i love it nor does it attract me to him more. My son has worn it to school and gets compliments on it from girls but he normally does with his regular cologne. We really didn&#x27;t notice a difference. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it does smell nice but this is no magic attraction cologne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product deeply discounted for my spouse to use.  He and I think it smells great, but as far as providing added attraction, I can not vouch for the product making a difference.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells AMAZING!  It has a very clean, masculine smell.  The fragrance is light, and not overpowering.  This would likely be a good fit for someone who is sensitive to strong fragrances, but still wants to be able to wear, or have their partner wear cologne.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Smells great. I get all the bitches now!</li>
            <li> Great Oil... Smells awesome...</li>
            <li> Smells a little clique, not a bad thing though, it lasts all day and I love it.</li>
            <li> very nice smell fresh :) very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne. My husband loves the scent too so it&#x27;s a plus. I am already attracted to him though so I am not sure if the attraction part is working :) . Not overwhelming, really nice smell and great cologne for any guy!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Healthy Attraction Pheromone cologne for men. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the bold and masculine fragrance. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed more attention from the ladies at work. I&#x27;m blown away!</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance.  I was pleasantly surprized.</li>
            <li> This stuff, WORKS. Wver since having my second child, sex isnt, well, that big for me. But when my husband got this in and he immediately put it on, not 20 minutes later, it really had me turned on! This stuff is CRAZY good. Men, if your really looking for a way to get the ladies to go crazy over you, this is it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.  I honestly don&#x27;t know if the Pheromones are working a putting out some scent from me, but that&#x27;s ok.  Im a member of Elite Deal Club so I got this at a great price</li>
            <li> Personal use, I hated the smell..</li>
            <li> This is a really enticing perfume, i love it when my husband use, the only draw back is that its so tiny. i wish the company introduces a bigger size of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really works or my confidence level is higher and it&#x27;s attracting the women but something is working.  Buying me some more bottles lol</li>
            <li> Can see a visible increase of attention I received with a couple sprays.</li>
            <li> I spray myself once or twice first thing in the morning and every evening after I shower - I have had many compliments recently on how nice I smell.  I don&#x27;t use this separately from other scents I generally use - though I think they somehow work together to enhance what I already smelled like.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband to use. It smells amazing!! I did not tell him about the pheromones in the bottle or he probably would not have used it.i hope they will be making this for women also!!!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this out for a reduced rate in exchange for an honest review, so I figured why not? Though I may not have normally purchased something like this, I am always looking for ways to add a little extra fun to our date nights. While the scent is a pleasant one, it dissipates rather quickly, so don&#x27;t expect your man to smell &#x27;good&#x27; all evening long. Whether or not I actually felt more &#x27;attracted&#x27; to him while he was wearing this, is really hard to tell. I gave it 4 stars for the novelty of it and the good smell fresh out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband smells irresistible with this.</li>
            <li> My husband likes, the appearance, the smell and he said this is a very good product. Recommend it</li>
            <li> When they say &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34;, they are not kidding! This stuff is strong! I bought this for my husband originally,even though I wear men&#x27;s cologne instead of perfume. This is pheromones though, so it wouldn&#x27;t really make much sense for me to wear it. But when I opened it up, I didn&#x27;t want to wait until my husband got home so I sprayed it all over myself. That wasn&#x27;t a very good idea... its very strong! You really do not need to use a lot of this stuff. It smells really great but it&#x27;s really not a masculine enough smell for me to wear. When my husband finally came home and tried it out, he loved it. He&#x27;s been wearing it ever since, and let me tell you.. those pheromones do work! I find myself snuggling up to him a lot more now, and it smells a lot better on him than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Had an alright smell.  Didn&#x27;t do much for my husband. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice smell ladies love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this Cologne for my husband and oh my gosh it smells so good! I love that it&#x27;s completely different from his other cologne&#x27;s he owns. Another plus about this cologne is that it is not overpowering what so ever!!</li>
            <li> The smell is soft and floral.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle to try out and according to my female friends it smells great! No stickiness or bland smell. I like it and will continue to use it. I have had no adverse reaction or allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Ok so I, ordered this because.. well.. I don&#x27;t really know. Sort of as a joke. Boy did it stir up something primal in me!! Smells amazing! I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but hey its spiced things up!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally the kind of person you think of when you think of a cologne-wearer. I brush up all right, but I am most comfortable in my jeans and t-shirts. When I saw this as part of a promotion, I didn&#x27;t know if I should try it or not, but I thought, what the heck. I ended up receiving it at a discount in return for a genuine critique. The presentation left a little to be desired -- there&#x27;s no box for this, just the bottle which is fairly plain and unexciting. It has a label on the front with the name and company and a label on the back to explain the product a little, offer suggested uses including safety information, and listing ingredients. Happily, it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it&#x27;s made in the US. The bottle claims that this cologne, infused with pheromones as it is, is meant to &amp;#34;enhance your own sex appeal.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know how true this and there is a small setback - I myself cannot smell. However, all my lady friends have told me I smell really good since I&#x27;ve been using it. Not just good. Really good. Which is relieving because I was worried that the heads I was turning was due more to the odour than to any enhanced sex appeal this cologne provided. But since I was assured that I smell subtle and very pleasant, I have only to imagine that the increased interest in me by the fairer sex may well be attributed to this pheromone-laced fragrance. Time will of course tell if it pays off and I meet the lady who doesn&#x27;t mind being manipulated by pheromone cologne into thinking I&#x27;m sexier than I am, but for now, I&#x27;m inclined to believe that this cologne certainly can do what it says.</li>
            <li> I am actually highly surprised how great this smells. I was thinking that it would be like a dollar store cologne, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong alcohol smell or chemicals. It has natural essential oils in it, and reminds me of the oil roller colognes. I bought it for my boyfriend, and I don&#x27;t think it turned me on or anything, but it did smell really good on him, and in the bottle. We plan to buy this and the perfume again when we run out.&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
            <li> It has an okay smell, kind of strong, not sure how it works as a pheromone though as it really has not made a difference .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the supposedly added Pheromones and such inside of this cologne, I haven&#x27;t noticed any females being more interested in me or anything like that. However, many people (especially people of the opposite gender) have commented on how great the cologne smells. I personally love the smell of it, and while more than 2 squirts is pretty overpowering, if you have the right amount on, you&#x27;ll smell great all day. This isn&#x27;t only me saying this, like I said, I get a lot of compliments while wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> Great smell but way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me a bit of Candies or Curve, a bit sweet and not incredibly masculine but still obviously a cologne. As for the addition of pheromones can&#x27;t really say they worked. Wore this on a couple of date nights with my girlfriend and she did enjoy the scent she wasn&#x27;t tearing off my clothes or anything. Good smell though and good value for the size/cost.</li>
            <li> Soft scent but overall my fiance and I like it. Lasts longer than than I expected after reading the reviews. Don&#x27;t know much about the attraction thing tho. Maybe we should give it more time. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good but unsure it actually it attracts the opposite sex</li>
            <li> Tried this on my husband and hated the smell, tried on my son and it was okay. Not one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because I had the opportunity to use a discount to buy it--figured, why not, seems kind of like a joke. I was asked to leave a review of the product after I or my husband had a chance to try it out. Well, I think it smells really nice, surprisingly. We tend to stick to well known cologne/perfume brands, but it looks like my husband actually likes this one because he has been wearing it for several days now. I like it too--it has a very pleasant, non-offensive scent. As far as working as an attractant--maybe, cause it does smell really nice, and husband seems to like the attention he is getting from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times around my girl and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. She more aggressive in what she wants when I wear this. I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll work for random dating though</li>
            <li> A great cologne for men. It smells amaaaaaazing!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and get many compliments but no results as a pheromone oil that attracts the other sex, Just an amazing smell to me.</li>
            <li> Loveed this! I bought it for my brother just to see if it works and it did! It really attract the ladies</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect smell wise. But, I got it for my husband anyways, just to try out. Surprisingly, it smells great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its my imagination but women seem to be paying more attention to me.One down fall men also seem to be paying more attention to me. This stuff does not seem to be gender specific.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband, it smells good but just is a little too strong for our liking. Overall it is a good product just not for us.</li>
            <li> It smells super good!  My husband was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the way he smells.  Boy was he wrong!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Hmmm...what can I say?  I love the smell of this on my husband - must be working!</li>
            <li> It smells really great!</li>
            <li> This cologne seems to be nothing but cheap cologne - which is what I got it for.  The smell is a little different... not my favorite and seems to be a little more feminine.  The scent does seem to last for a while, and isn&#x27;t nauseating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... But I don&#x27;t really know if it works...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about Pheromones or sexual attraction, but this cologne smells really, really good! It definitely makes me want to get close and sniff. :) It has a light, kind of clean scent. It&#x27;s light enough that it should be safe for someone that&#x27;s heavy handed with their cologne application.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells masculine and clean but not overpowering.  A little goes a long ways and is long lasting.  It doesn&#x27;t smell really spectacular or special in the bottle but after about 20 minutes after he puts it on, after it has mixed with his chemistry and body heat, it is absolutely yummy.  I can&#x27;t stop smelling him or get close enough.  I love it!  I purchased this bottle at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I tried several times to get the women&#x27;s perfume but it was always sold out.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it too.</li>
            <li> the smell is hideous it starts somewhat woodsy which would be good if it stayed that way but after about 2 minutes turns into nasty chemical smell</li>
            <li> Smells good and not too strong.I like that it has no harsh chemicals and is paraben and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on as I heard my wife pulling in the driveway and waited for her. Picture this, grown man trying to pose all sexy (victoria secret model) on the couch. Within a few seconds I was mobbed by my cat and she wanted to be REALLY close to me. Yeah, not the female I was trying to attract. I kept trying to kick her off the couch but stupid thing just jumped back on. That&#x27;s when my wife walked in. What she saw was a scantly clad husband being petted by their cat. I had a lot of explaining to do. After she recovered from hyperventilating due to her uncontrollable laughter, I took a shower. The stuff was apparently still strong since I ended up cuddling and petting our cat for the next 3 hours while we tried to watch a movie.</li>
            <li> I would sooner spray swamp water on my body. I can not recoomend it at all</li>
            <li> Great cologne. I love the smell it has has it just perfect. This has to be my favorite cologne by far and I will definitely buy more from this. Great product and would recommend it to any man who is looking for great colonge.</li>
