            <li>He was hesitant to try it, but I think he was glad that he let me put it on the sore area, as he now will let me put it on him without me pushing him to do it.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m convinced to its benefits and ordered more.</li>
            <li>My wife has seen Arnica, in gel form, in stores for a lot more than what I found on Amazon, so even with the shipping cost you are saving money.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>she seems to like it since she keeps requesting more.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I use it for my clients in my Spa all the time and they love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS GEL.</li>
            <li>I have TRIED SO MANY Products that have Done Nothing</li>
            <li>i have suffered from Sciatica for many years and the pain can be unbearable at times.</li>
            <li>AND YOU FEEL MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY MORE</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a great product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Maybe it takes more time to build up or something.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people involved in the kind of alternative lifestyle that can often lead to significant bruising.</li>
            <li>The problem is they take long time for send me the item, but the product is very good, I used this for many yearsâ€¦</li>
            <li>Application of this product has brought her some relief from her pain, allowing her to sleep more soundly with fewer interruptions.</li>
            <li>You get a good size tube for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and innocuous once dried, the packaging is attractive, and the ingredients are the purest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I think you get a good value based on the amount of product and price, but what I really like is that it absorbs into your skin very quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product 2 years ago, when a friend of mine noticed how easily I bruise.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, leaves no lingering odor, and has proven to work to relieve pain.  </li>
            <li>And IT CAME Very Quickly, too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and leaves no stains or odor.  </li>
            <li>This a high quality product and a good price for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it successfully to relieve most of my pain in my knees and lower back.</li>
            <li>Vendor&#x27;s description is accurate.  </li>
            <li>I took four steps and the bus roared off and I began to fall into a lady in a huge metal wheelchair.  </li>
            <li>Everyone looked at me with huge eyes and said they had never seen anything like that.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this specific product and was happy that I located it online.</li>
            <li>He appears to be quite comfortable since using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light gel absorbs in the skin and calms pain for hours.</li>
            <li>This is great for sore muscles especially.</li>
            <li>I got on the bus with my cane and almost every seat was filled.  </li>
            <li>I sent a detailed report of what happened to the bus system via email and went to bed for three weeks to get over it.  </li>
            <li>GOES ON SMOOTHLY, RELIEVES PAIN, AND IS NOT STICKY</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this at such a good price.</li>
            <li>I have used this arnica gel from almost the first night after I broke the bone, and I can honestly say that the swelling and bruising has been helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased at GNC and now via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I did not believe it would work at first because I had tried pain pills and every kind of rub that I was aware of.</li>
            <li>I used the gel on his back and he also got good relief from his pain.</li>
            <li>Seems to be somewhat effective so far.</li>
            <li>It is a tried and true gel that goes to work on sore muscles within minutes of application.  </li>
            <li>It is delivered quickly without incident.</li>
            <li>THIS WORKS FAIRLY QUICK TO STOP PAIN...</li>
            <li>The gel goes on cool and it seems like it will take a while to sink in, but it actually is absorbed into the skin fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>He is very pleased with this product as to its ability to relieve his chronic back pain.  </li>
            <li>He is very thankful that there is such a product on the market and is surprised he had not heard of it when so many others have heard of it and used it successfully.</li>
            <li>Clear arnica is better.</li>
            <li>not enough arnica to be effective at all...</li>
            <li>No one was more surprised than me.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money, which is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I would do anything within reason to relieve it and this stuff works at a VERY reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to use something that wasn&#x27;t medicinal, willing to try alternative treatments for arthritis  in my knees.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Had fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li>Also, most drugstore brands include a hefty amount of alcohol, which I can only assume is designed to expedite the drying process.</li>
            <li>repeat user, consistent 5 stars</li>
            <li>LOVE this , ACTUALLY HELPS, My Fibromyalgia Pain &amp; Neuropathy Pain!!.</li>
            <li>After using this gel for two nights I have slept without pain for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>This is a repeat purchase, I have bought this product previously and been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Works great on serious bruises</li>
            <li>I like this product and would recommend it, especially for people who bruise easily, like me.</li>
            <li>The gel soaks in easily and delivers the product deeply.</li>
            <li>It comes in a large tube type  plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>We use this product on all of our bruises and it really works.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easliy and absorbs into the skin gently but fast.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Works well and quite fast,</li>
            <li>Did not notice much difference.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It really does help relieve pain.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful in reducing swelling, inflammation and brusing.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful for aching limbs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing much benefit from this yet, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great to find a good pain reliever that is not expensive and does not have an awful smell.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective it is yet.</li>
            <li>For an OTC product, I give it high ranking and recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>Really works when you have soft tissue aches.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally go for over the counter pain remedies.  </li>
            <li>It helps the stiffness and pain, and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I saw others advertised online, but most were smaller and more expensive.</li>
            <li>Should use it as soon as you notice a bruise, consistently and daily on bruises.  </li>
            <li>Wow, did it work!</li>
            <li>I have already ordered my 2nd tube as I am out of my first tube.</li>
            <li>This is a large tube and can last for months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive and it seems to work (homeopathic remedies are always a bit of a mystery to me and I wonder whether its simply the placebo effect)</li>
            <li>husband recently fell on the ice, and was very sore.</li>
            <li>I really like it because, not only does it provide the relief of Arnica, but it also contains an oil that moisturizes.</li>
            <li>It helps to heal from the outside, and the bruises fade much quicker with each application.  </li>
            <li>I also bruise like a peach naturally.</li>
            <li>This arnica contains no alcohol and has been wonderfully gently on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recently had surgery and did very well but had the muscle soreness that seemed to linger.</li>
            <li>He would stop and immediately take off again until he came to a busy four lane where he had to stay stopped.  </li>
            <li>Arnica gel is the only thing that really helps.  </li>
            <li>The two people I spoke with were completely uninvolved in what I was trying to communicate and discuss.  </li>
            <li>When it gets to the point that the pain meds don&#x27;t take care of the pain, I apply this on the area and wow, the pain subsides to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>It contains blue 1, Red 40, yellow 5, propylene glycol plus other ingredients which I&#x27;m pretty sure are not &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li>used the gel 3-4 times per day for the first few days and then was able to drop down to only using it once per day with continued pain relief.</li>
            <li>There is no cooling or warming sensation for those of you expecting it to be like an icy hot.  </li>
            <li>I have used other arnica products in the past which have been fairly effective.</li>
            <li>I have seen other products that costs more and you get less.</li>
            <li>I use it for bruises and it really helps out and also for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This product really works for my deep muscle back pressure pain.  </li>
            <li>I use this quite a bit for back and neck pain, but you do need to realize that it can only do so much.</li>
            <li>BUT Since I rub it on a Few times a day and all over for Fibro Pain, I have used about 1/3 the tube already, BUT I MUST SAY This STUFF REALLY DOES HELP ME!!  </li>
            <li>One was in back just before the steps to the high back part by the door.  </li>
            <li>Thank you! :O)</li>
            <li>I order this frequently for a relative.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product,but company is slow to ship even though they claim the product is available.</li>
            <li>It seems to work, is swift to dry, no negative effects.  </li>
            <li>and now I only apply it in the morning and evening and the soreness is barely noticible.</li>
            <li>My knees are getting older, creak, crack and make other noises.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is good for mild pain and soreness</li>
            <li> but it often helps more than anything else we have found.</li>
            <li> I love this arnica gel</li>
            <li> I have used it before and am glad to&lt;br /&gt;find</li>
            <li> Rub it wherever you hurt, and it sure helps.</li>
            <li> He was hesitant to try it, but I think he was glad that he let me put it on the sore area, as he now will let me put it on him without me pushing him to do it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m convinced to its benefits and ordered more.</li>
            <li> My wife has seen Arnica, in gel form, in stores for a lot more than what I found on Amazon, so even with the shipping cost you are saving money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> she seems to like it since she keeps requesting more.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I use it for my clients in my Spa all the time and they love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS GEL.</li>
            <li> I have TRIED SO MANY Products that have Done Nothing</li>
            <li> i have suffered from Sciatica for many years and the pain can be unbearable at times.</li>
            <li> AND YOU FEEL MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY MORE</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more time to build up or something.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people involved in the kind of alternative lifestyle that can often lead to significant bruising.</li>
            <li> The problem is they take long time for send me the item, but the product is very good, I used this for many yearsâ€¦</li>
            <li> Application of this product has brought her some relief from her pain, allowing her to sleep more soundly with fewer interruptions.</li>
            <li> You get a good size tube for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and innocuous once dried, the packaging is attractive, and the ingredients are the purest I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I think you get a good value based on the amount of product and price, but what I really like is that it absorbs into your skin very quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product 2 years ago, when a friend of mine noticed how easily I bruise.  </li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, leaves no lingering odor, and has proven to work to relieve pain.  </li>
            <li> And IT CAME Very Quickly, too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and leaves no stains or odor.  </li>
            <li> This a high quality product and a good price for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it successfully to relieve most of my pain in my knees and lower back.</li>
            <li> Vendor&#x27;s description is accurate.  </li>
            <li> I took four steps and the bus roared off and I began to fall into a lady in a huge metal wheelchair.  </li>
            <li> Everyone looked at me with huge eyes and said they had never seen anything like that.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this specific product and was happy that I located it online.</li>
            <li> He appears to be quite comfortable since using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light gel absorbs in the skin and calms pain for hours.</li>
            <li> This is great for sore muscles especially.</li>
            <li> I got on the bus with my cane and almost every seat was filled.  </li>
            <li> I sent a detailed report of what happened to the bus system via email and went to bed for three weeks to get over it.  </li>
            <li> GOES ON SMOOTHLY, RELIEVES PAIN, AND IS NOT STICKY</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this arnica gel from almost the first night after I broke the bone, and I can honestly say that the swelling and bruising has been helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased at GNC and now via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I did not believe it would work at first because I had tried pain pills and every kind of rub that I was aware of.</li>
            <li> I used the gel on his back and he also got good relief from his pain.</li>
            <li> Seems to be somewhat effective so far.</li>
            <li> It is a tried and true gel that goes to work on sore muscles within minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> It is delivered quickly without incident.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS FAIRLY QUICK TO STOP PAIN...</li>
            <li> The gel goes on cool and it seems like it will take a while to sink in, but it actually is absorbed into the skin fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> He is very pleased with this product as to its ability to relieve his chronic back pain.  </li>
            <li> He is very thankful that there is such a product on the market and is surprised he had not heard of it when so many others have heard of it and used it successfully.</li>
            <li> Clear arnica is better.</li>
            <li> not enough arnica to be effective at all...</li>
            <li> No one was more surprised than me.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money, which is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I would do anything within reason to relieve it and this stuff works at a VERY reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to use something that wasn&#x27;t medicinal, willing to try alternative treatments for arthritis  in my knees.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Had fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> Also, most drugstore brands include a hefty amount of alcohol, which I can only assume is designed to expedite the drying process.</li>
            <li> repeat user, consistent 5 stars</li>
            <li> LOVE this , ACTUALLY HELPS, My Fibromyalgia Pain &amp; Neuropathy Pain!!.</li>
            <li> After using this gel for two nights I have slept without pain for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase, I have bought this product previously and been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Works great on serious bruises</li>
            <li> I like this product and would recommend it, especially for people who bruise easily, like me.</li>
            <li> The gel soaks in easily and delivers the product deeply.</li>
            <li> It comes in a large tube type  plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> We use this product on all of our bruises and it really works.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easliy and absorbs into the skin gently but fast.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Works well and quite fast,</li>
            <li> Did not notice much difference.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It really does help relieve pain.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful in reducing swelling, inflammation and brusing.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful for aching limbs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much benefit from this yet, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great to find a good pain reliever that is not expensive and does not have an awful smell.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective it is yet.</li>
            <li> For an OTC product, I give it high ranking and recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> Really works when you have soft tissue aches.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally go for over the counter pain remedies.  </li>
            <li> It helps the stiffness and pain, and makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I saw others advertised online, but most were smaller and more expensive.</li>
            <li> Should use it as soon as you notice a bruise, consistently and daily on bruises.  </li>
            <li> Wow, did it work!</li>
            <li> I have already ordered my 2nd tube as I am out of my first tube.</li>
            <li> This is a large tube and can last for months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive and it seems to work (homeopathic remedies are always a bit of a mystery to me and I wonder whether its simply the placebo effect)</li>
            <li> husband recently fell on the ice, and was very sore.</li>
            <li> I really like it because, not only does it provide the relief of Arnica, but it also contains an oil that moisturizes.</li>
            <li> It helps to heal from the outside, and the bruises fade much quicker with each application.  </li>
            <li> I also bruise like a peach naturally.</li>
            <li> This arnica contains no alcohol and has been wonderfully gently on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and did very well but had the muscle soreness that seemed to linger.</li>
            <li> He would stop and immediately take off again until he came to a busy four lane where he had to stay stopped.  </li>
            <li> Arnica gel is the only thing that really helps.  </li>
            <li> The two people I spoke with were completely uninvolved in what I was trying to communicate and discuss.  </li>
            <li> When it gets to the point that the pain meds don&#x27;t take care of the pain, I apply this on the area and wow, the pain subsides to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> It contains blue 1, Red 40, yellow 5, propylene glycol plus other ingredients which I&#x27;m pretty sure are not &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> used the gel 3-4 times per day for the first few days and then was able to drop down to only using it once per day with continued pain relief.</li>
            <li> There is no cooling or warming sensation for those of you expecting it to be like an icy hot.  </li>
            <li> I have used other arnica products in the past which have been fairly effective.</li>
            <li> I have seen other products that costs more and you get less.</li>
            <li> I use it for bruises and it really helps out and also for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product really works for my deep muscle back pressure pain.  </li>
            <li> I use this quite a bit for back and neck pain, but you do need to realize that it can only do so much.</li>
            <li> BUT Since I rub it on a Few times a day and all over for Fibro Pain, I have used about 1/3 the tube already, BUT I MUST SAY This STUFF REALLY DOES HELP ME!!  </li>
            <li> One was in back just before the steps to the high back part by the door.  </li>
            <li> Thank you! :O)</li>
            <li> I order this frequently for a relative.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product,but company is slow to ship even though they claim the product is available.</li>
            <li> It seems to work, is swift to dry, no negative effects.  </li>
            <li> and now I only apply it in the morning and evening and the soreness is barely noticible.</li>
            <li> My knees are getting older, creak, crack and make other noises.  </li>
            <li> I use it to ease pain that I&#x27;ve had for a number of years, in the neck, back and wrists, due to old injuries.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> When my thumbs I had hung from finally healed six months later, I was left with severe arthritis in the notch on my hand that had been sprung and that causes extreme pain.  </li>
            <li> I recently had a partial knee replacement, I was prescibed pain killers and such but did not want to use them on a long term basis.</li>
            <li> It lasts long after you think it will.</li>
            <li> Since I was right behind him, he heard me.  </li>
            <li> Actually I was a little hesitant to write a review because I do not want the seller to run out or go up in price.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the gel on spots to where I was having some bad pain, making sure to rub in rotation strokes upward toward the heart as suggested..</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, I have been using arnica for ages for bruising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very tall</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and it is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Saw it on Dr. Oz , not really convinced on all we see there, but this one worked.</li>
            <li> A Little Goes A Long Way.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it didn&#x27;t have a fragrance, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like those other pain pain gels and dries non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully as long as you apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use for pain in my knee but not much relief!</li>
            <li> This time, $$ Well Spent!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this Arnica Gel because it&#x27;s got some other ingredients</li>
            <li> Terrific for headaches and stiff necks!  </li>
            <li> The product does help with bruising and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Not worth using.</li>
            <li> but if you have a serious injury you may not get total relief using this alone.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product in the past and it works extremely well for me on sore joints, strains, etc.  </li>
            <li> Their little lady investigator agreed with them.  </li>
            <li> I rub a little on my forehead or side of my face and it helps to ease the pain a bit.</li>
            <li> I am disabled with severe fibromyalgia.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the alcohol is also extremely drying to the skin and can be uncomfortable when used over large areas.</li>
            <li> Not very effective.  </li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE PAIN RELIEF.</li>
            <li> After I became ambulatory, I was looking for something to ease the soreness, my wife had heard of Arnica and bought a small jar of it in balm form.</li>
            <li> This gel is soupier than others I have used and getting only a small amount is difficult.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from chronic sciatica and lower back pain, often resulting in disturbed sleep.</li>
            <li> Have ordered at least 15 bottles.</li>
            <li> Pain sucks.  </li>
            <li> To use it properly, spread a thin layer on the painful area but do not rub it in.</li>
            <li> It feels like a thin layer of ice which is what seems to relieve pain.</li>
            <li> shoulders, elbows, hands, and one knee were so painful, and since I am not able to take my Rheumatoid Arthritis medicine for a period of time (due to other health issues), I had to find something to help with the awful pain.</li>
            <li> the minimum amount of arnica and pain reliever made this product useless</li>
            <li> Sorry that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> USELESS AND INEFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> 2 additives proven dangerous for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very bad knees.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was working until I stop using and my pain and stiffness got worst.</li>
            <li> Around four years ago I had a horrible experience on the Spokane bus system.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Alleviates muscle soreness from chemo treaents.  Not greasy and does its job nicely. A good friend alerted me to this gel and I am thankful that she did!!</li>
            <li> Even use this product as a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this product works wonders for my wife and she could not exist without it</li>
            <li> It is amazing the hip, knee, elbow, ... pains this gel relieves. Not sure what exactly it does but it often helps more than anything else we have found.</li>
            <li> I love this arnica gel it&#x27;s a big help with soreness and healing properties. I have used it before and am glad to&lt;br /&gt;find it online.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, have used it for years! It lasts long after you think it will. Sometimes the pain is gone for days! Rub it wherever you hurt, and it sure helps. Well worth the money, which is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Works great on serious bruises</li>
            <li> This gel fades bruises in a fraction of the time it would take them to fade on their own.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product really works for my deep muscle back pressure pain.  I sit in an inclined position within my wheelchair so back pressure pain is an ongoing daily occurrence.  Roberts Arnica Gel truly helps get me through the day with an increased quality of life...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive and it seems to work (homeopathic remedies are always a bit of a mystery to me and I wonder whether its simply the placebo effect)</li>
            <li> Really works when you have soft tissue aches.  Vendor&#x27;s description is accurate.  No odor gel.  Use it several times a day.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this specific product and was happy that I located it online. Great shipping and pricing. Thank you</li>
            <li> Large container- works great!</li>
            <li> great product that works!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, highly recommend for aches and pains</li>
            <li> I have been SO happy with the results of using this gel.&lt;br /&gt;Both shoulders, elbows, hands, and one knee were so painful, and since I am not able to take my Rheumatoid Arthritis medicine for a period of time (due to other health issues), I had to find something to help with the awful pain. I did not expect that the gel would work as well as it does! It was a very pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the gel 3-4 times per day for the first few days and then was able to drop down to only using it once per day with continued pain relief. It is amazing the level of pain relief that I get from this gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband recently fell on the ice, and was very sore. I used the gel on his back and he also got good relief from his pain. He was hesitant to try it, but I think he was glad that he let me put it on the sore area, as he now will let me put it on him without me pushing him to do it. Once a day seems to be helpful to him. He appears to be quite comfortable since using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to find a good pain reliever that is not expensive and does not have an awful smell. It is not sticky, and the scent is very pleasant. I plan to have this gel in the house at all times.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after hearing Dr. Oz recommend it for eye puffiness and circles.  It comes in a large tube type  plastic bottle. It will last a long time. I saw others advertised online, but most were smaller and more expensive. It  has a pleasant aroma. Arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.  It is recommended to lighten bruises also.  I am not sure how effective it is yet. Seems to be somewhat effective so far. Inexpensive enough to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Update April 2014: It does seem to help get rid of bruises with repeated use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was working until I stop using and my pain and stiffness got worst. Now I&#x27;m convinced to its benefits and ordered more.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product in the past and it works extremely well for me on sore joints, strains, etc.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> We use this product on all of our bruises and it really works.  Should use it as soon as you notice a bruise, consistently and daily on bruises.  It goes on easliy and absorbs into the skin gently but fast.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from chronic sciatica and lower back pain, often resulting in disturbed sleep. Application of this product has brought her some relief from her pain, allowing her to sleep more soundly with fewer interruptions. Good price, generous portion.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with this product as to its ability to relieve his chronic back pain.  He is very thankful that there is such a product on the market and is surprised he had not heard of it when so many others have heard of it and used it successfully.</li>
            <li> I have used Homeopathic gels for years and the pain relief you get from them can not be beat.  I would not be without Arnica Gel and this is one of the best prices to be found online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product,but company is slow to ship even though they claim the product is available.</li>
            <li> I recently had a partial knee replacement, I was prescibed pain killers and such but did not want to use them on a long term basis. After I became ambulatory, I was looking for something to ease the soreness, my wife had heard of Arnica and bought a small jar of it in balm form. Wow, did it work! I bought some of this and applied it 3 times daily, upon waking up, middle of the day and before bed and now I only apply it in the morning and evening and the soreness is barely noticible. I have even stopped taking the Ibuprofen. This product has not only sped up my recovery process, by relieving the pain and thereby making it easier to walk around, it also has helped diminish the surgery scar to almost invisible. My wife has seen Arnica, in gel form, in stores for a lot more than what I found on Amazon, so even with the shipping cost you are saving money. I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis on my left knee and have pain.  By applying Arnica gel it feels good.</li>
            <li> Great product, wife loves it to help relax her muscles and aches</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does what it was advertised to do. The light gel absorbs in the skin and calms pain for hours. It really works.  A great temporary solution.</li>
            <li> Love it  , the best product to use after liposuction everyone should get it.</li>
            <li> This product did seen to ease arthritis pain somewhat, and had a pleasant scent. You get a good size tube for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Terrific for headaches and stiff necks!  Nice!!! Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this gel. I have severe back, leg and hip pain and I was searching the internet and found others who had tried this gel. I did not believe it would work at first because I had tried pain pills and every kind of rub that I was aware of. This is a superior product and I will recommend others to try it. It works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Really nice gel that&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t stink! Works well and quite fast,</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner. The product does help with bruising and dark spots. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a lower cost arnica item for patient&#x27;, found this. Have ordered at least 15 bottles. Works great for pain.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Roberts Research Arnica gel has been a blessing in disguise! I use it to ease pain that I&#x27;ve had for a number of years, in the neck, back and wrists, due to old injuries. Anytime I feel tension building in those areas, I massage it in and start to feel the relief. I Love the smell of it too! Thank you! :O)</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it didn&#x27;t have a fragrance, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use something that wasn&#x27;t medicinal, willing to try alternative treatments for arthritis  in my knees. Not worth using. Did pass it on to a friend to see it helped her back pain.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Amazing for bruises and sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Good price for a quality product; quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I dislike the fact that this product has color added which may or may not be good for you. Clear arnica is better. Further, it contains metylparaben and polyparaben...2 additives proven dangerous for you.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use it or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Native Americans have used the Arnica plant...which grows only in Montana...for muscle soreness and bruising for hundreds of years.  It is a tried and true gel that goes to work on sore muscles within minutes of application.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this at such a good price. It is hard to find</li>
            <li> I have very bad knees. I have tried everything from Heet to Banalg, wraps, knee braces, etc etc etc. This product was shown on DR. Oz.  It is very good for quick relief from pain and soreness.  Works good on the joints and for muscle strains.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well for a few hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff. I recently broke a bone in my foot, and had some residual swelling and bruising in my foot. I have used this arnica gel from almost the first night after I broke the bone, and I can honestly say that the swelling and bruising has been helped tremendously. I have already ordered my 2nd tube as I am out of my first tube.</li>
            <li> not enough arnica to be effective at all...</li>
            <li> I use this for arthritis in my hands in conjunction with oral Arnica tablets. It helps the stiffness and pain, and makes my skin very soft. I have been using it for over a year and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> product works well as you would expect it to. doesn&#x27;t smell like ben gay would, works great for sore muscle .</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these. Love it. I plan to order some for my friends to try.</li>
            <li> Our local store carried this - for about a month.  Bought it, loved it, now I have to go online to get it!</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet to reduce ache and pain.  It seems to work, is swift to dry, no negative effects.  Does a good job.</li>
            <li> I order this frequently for a relative. Though I don&#x27;t have any personal experience with it she seems to like it since she keeps requesting more. It is delivered quickly without incident.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel I have found to relieve arthritis and joint pain.  Use it on my hands, knees, feet and back...where ever I&#x27;m hurting.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like those other pain pain gels and dries non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally go for over the counter pain remedies.  My knees are getting older, creak, crack and make other noises.  I take a NSAID but this product takes care of that residual ache.  No one was more surprised than me.  Try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural remedy for bumps etc.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This is a great brand because the price is right and so is the ounces. I have seen other products that costs more and you get less. This is great for sore muscles especially. And doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Had fast shipping as well!</li>
            <li> the minimum amount of arnica and pain reliever made this product useless</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was the same as what my reflexologist had and he recommended it.  I really like it because, not only does it provide the relief of Arnica, but it also contains an oil that moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Item received in good shape, package seemed to be handled well..the only problem I had was with the time it took to get to me. Thr product work great on the first use.  I rubbed the gel on spots to where I was having some bad pain, making sure to rub in rotation strokes upward toward the heart as suggested.. after 10 minutes the pain was almost gone.  On deeper pain it worked as a back up to my regular pain pills...I would recommend this product..</li>
            <li> just great and it works!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product 2 years ago, when a friend of mine noticed how easily I bruise.  It helps to heal from the outside, and the bruises fade much quicker with each application.  It is not instantaneous results, but my bruises seem to disappear in 1/2 the time.&lt;br /&gt;This Arnica Gel has a pleasant fragrance, and a cooling sensation when applied.  It leaves no greasy or sticky residue, either, when it dries, after it has been rubbed into the affected areas.  I like this product and would recommend it, especially for people who bruise easily, like me.</li>
            <li> Sorry that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and seems to help bruising lighten quicker</li>
            <li> I am one of those people involved in the kind of alternative lifestyle that can often lead to significant bruising. I also bruise like a peach naturally. I&#x27;ve tried a number of arnica gels and creams, both purchased online and in the drugstore. Honestly, I think I&#x27;ve tried them all. This is by FAR the best in terms of value and in terms of application. The scent is pleasant and innocuous once dried, the packaging is attractive, and the ingredients are the purest I&#x27;ve found. Also, most drugstore brands include a hefty amount of alcohol, which I can only assume is designed to expedite the drying process. Unfortunately, the alcohol is also extremely drying to the skin and can be uncomfortable when used over large areas. This arnica contains no alcohol and has been wonderfully gently on my sensitive skin. I will never use another brand again.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, I have been using arnica for ages for bruising. The gel soaks in easily and delivers the product deeply.</li>
            <li> It works and is not smelly. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and did very well but had the muscle soreness that seemed to linger. I used arnica tablets and this lotion. The lotion feels nice, glides on easily and does offer some relief. There is no cooling or warming sensation for those of you expecting it to be like an icy hot.  I waited to put it over my incision until after the incision healed.</li>
            <li> repeat user, consistent 5 stars</li>
            <li> Works great.  Helps for the bruising after having sclerotherapy.</li>
            <li> My loves this cream. It helps her with her back pain</li>
            <li> Did not notice much difference.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well , good value</li>
            <li> Great buy. Effective product. Fast delivery. I use it for my clients in my Spa all the time and they love it.</li>
            <li> I am disabled with severe fibromyalgia.  Around four years ago I had a horrible experience on the Spokane bus system.  I got on the bus with my cane and almost every seat was filled.  One was in back just before the steps to the high back part by the door.  I took four steps and the bus roared off and I began to fall into a lady in a huge metal wheelchair.  A man squeezed in by her and  against the wall grabbed my hands and put them in rings from the ceiling.  I&#x27;m not very tall and I hung there for blocks screaming for the driver to stop. Since I was right behind him, he heard me.  He would stop and immediately take off again until he came to a busy four lane where he had to stay stopped.  I managed to get to the seat and slam into it as he started off again.  Everyone looked at me with huge eyes and said they had never seen anything like that.  I couldn&#x27;t say a word.  I was in severe shock and just wanted off.  I sent a detailed report of what happened to the bus system via email and went to bed for three weeks to get over it.  When I got up and contacted them they claimed it never happened and they had destroyed the video because &amp;#34;I wasn&#x27;t on the bus&amp;#34;.  Their little lady investigator agreed with them.  I wasn&#x27;t well enough to fight them.  Shame on them all.  When my thumbs I had hung from finally healed six months later, I was left with severe arthritis in the notch on my hand that had been sprung and that causes extreme pain.  Arnica gel is the only thing that really helps.  I use it elsewhere also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be without Arnica gel.  This a high quality product and a good price for the amount you get.  This gel is soupier than others I have used and getting only a small amount is difficult.  The fragrance stays instead of dissipating.  It smells like the tiny bars of soaps in the motels in the 1960s and 1970s used to.  It also lubricates the skin.  Best value for the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Arrived on time and it is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS GEL. GOES ON SMOOTHLY, RELIEVES PAIN, AND IS NOT STICKY</li>
            <li> We have used this product for over 10 years to relieve muscle and arthritic pain.  Originally purchased at GNC and now via Amazon.  It dries very quickly, leaves no lingering odor, and has proven to work to relieve pain.  For an OTC product, I give it high ranking and recommend.</li>
            <li> I called the company to discuss the labeling of product which says\\&quot;Natural\\&quot;. It contains blue 1, Red 40, yellow 5, propylene glycol plus other ingredients which I&#x27;m pretty sure are not &#x27;natural&#x27;. The two people I spoke with were completely uninvolved in what I was trying to communicate and discuss.  I have used other arnica products in the past which have been fairly effective. This one seems to have no noticable effect.</li>
            <li> I find it really great for muscle aches and even for headaches. I rub a little on my forehead or side of my face and it helps to ease the pain a bit. I hurt my back and started going to chiropractor and rubbing this gel on my back and leg. Between the two it has helped me out a lot. The pain is not gone but livable. Actually I was a little hesitant to write a review because I do not want the seller to run out or go up in price. To be honest, its a real good product, nice scent, not a cure all, but a helper which is all we can ask for.</li>
            <li> I used this for after a surgery I had.  It works wonderfully as long as you apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> DID NOT HELP MY ARTHRITIS AT ALL. USELESS AND INEFFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> The Wife has me rub it on her back and says that it works Myself don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Not very effective.  I use for pain in my knee but not much relief!</li>
            <li> got it fast and looks great!  thanks</li>
            <li> The best arnica ever and a good value.</li>
            <li> LOVE this , ACTUALLY HELPS, My Fibromyalgia Pain &amp; Neuropathy Pain!!. I have TRIED SO MANY Products that have Done Nothing, I Put this on ASAP Upon Waking up, A Little Goes A Long Way. BUT Since I rub it on a Few times a day and all over for Fibro Pain, I have used about 1/3 the tube already, BUT I MUST SAY This STUFF REALLY DOES HELP ME!!  And IT CAME Very Quickly, too. This time, $$ Well Spent! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The problem is they take long time for send me the item, but the product is very good, I used this for many yearsâ€¦</li>
            <li> This is a soothing and cooling gel that effectively relieves pain in your muscles or joints. I&#x27;ve used it successfully to relieve most of my pain in my knees and lower back. To use it properly, spread a thin layer on the painful area but do not rub it in. Also do not cover it. Allow the injured area to be exposed to the air. Within 3-4 minutes you will feel a cooling and soothing effect on your injury. It feels like a thin layer of ice which is what seems to relieve pain. Also, the cooling effect seems to last about 1-2 hours. The nice thing is that it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn and can be used every 2-3 hours without any noticeable side effect except relief. This is a large tube and can last for months. Also the price was fair. I highly recommend trying this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use Arnica Gel in combo with Bromelain pills, Arnica pills, and St. John&#x27;s Wort oil to help me with bruise healing, as I don&#x27;t heal.  Before, I would get bruises that were visible months later.  With the help of this, my deep tissue bruises heal in about a week.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The price was good and the product is great.  It really does help relieve pain.  Saw it on Dr. Oz , not really convinced on all we see there, but this one worked.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and reliable service.</li>
            <li> I have been in severe pain for three years and have been on constant medications.  After using this gel for two nights I have slept without pain for the first time in years.  It is easy to use and leaves no stains or odor.  THE PAIN IS GONE.  I do not care what color additives they use in it.  Pain sucks.  I would do anything within reason to relieve it and this stuff works at a VERY reasonable price.  Wonderful product.  Thank the Lord.</li>
            <li> Would have preferred if the gel did not have that medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> Very helpful in reducing swelling, inflammation and brusing.</li>
            <li> i have suffered from Sciatica for many years and the pain can be unbearable at times. When it gets to the point that the pain meds don&#x27;t take care of the pain, I apply this on the area and wow, the pain subsides to almost nothing.  I totally endorse it!</li>
            <li> HI I USE FOR FYBROMYALIGA AND NECK SHOULDER PAIN..THIS WORKS FAIRLY QUICK TO STOP PAIN...15 MINS OR SO..AND YOU FEEL MUCH BETTER. I WILL BUY MORE</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase, I have bought this product previously and been very pleased with it.  It is very helpful for aching limbs</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I have sent some to Canada &amp; overseas</li>
            <li> a product I use regularly, no surprises</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and the service is excellent.  At first I was skeptical about this Arnica Gel because it&#x27;s got some other ingredients but they seem to enhance the product.  The gel goes on cool and it seems like it will take a while to sink in, but it actually is absorbed into the skin fairly quickly.  I use it on sore joints and swelling.  After getting a pneumonia vaccine my arm itched and swelled.  The Arnica Gel helped ease the irritation.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE PAIN RELIEF.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I use it for bruises and it really helps out and also for dry skin. I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended and I have to say it met the expectations I had for my knee! Fast delivery and a great product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing much benefit from this yet, but I&#x27;ll keep using it. Maybe it takes more time to build up or something.</li>
            <li> had surgery on my leg and this has worked wonders for clearing up a lot of the swelling and bruising.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product and would use again.</li>
            <li> I use this quite a bit for back and neck pain, but you do need to realize that it can only do so much. It is good for mild pain and soreness but if you have a serious injury you may not get total relief using this alone. I think you get a good value based on the amount of product and price, but what I really like is that it absorbs into your skin very quickly with no residue. This is especially good for using it before bed or maybe right before getting dressed for work - you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time trying to rub it in and it won&#x27;t feel greasy or stain your clothes.</li>
