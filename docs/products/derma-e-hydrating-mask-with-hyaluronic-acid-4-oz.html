            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I bought his product because on Paula choice reviews it said it was one of the best masks for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job hydrating the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredible afterwards and the most important it doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts like many other products.</li>
            <li>Strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>(I tend to be allergic to most products), and softens my skin very well!!</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this facial mask, after using it my skin feel so smooth and no tight feeling at all.</li>
            <li>and I bought this because I needed something to Hydrate my facial skin, and so far it has worked great!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells nice and dries pretty fast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old, so I don&#x27;t need to use heavy moisturizers a lot just yet, so this mask does a perfect job for me if i use it once a week.</li>
            <li>I have large pores in my T-zone that get clogged quickly, but after using this mask, not only are my pores clean, but my whole complexion has a fresher look, and feels very comfortable.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not one of those masks that you instantly fall in love with.</li>
            <li>I apply the mask about twice a week and leave it on for about an hour, afterwards, my skin is left looking very smooth and very supple.</li>
            <li>this is a good quality hydrating and refreshing mask with a faint floral scent.</li>
            <li>although pure coconut and kukui oil works,it not like I can wear that out of the house.  </li>
            <li>my skin has gone from nice and moisturized naturally to sucked dry and dehydrated.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Plus this company is totally organic and they are cruelty-free meaning they don&#x27;t do animal testing which is important to me in my choice of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Will def use it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their face skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week for a month and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a 26 year old male</li>
            <li>I spend my summers in Hawaii and my skin goes back to normal, so when I did use this, I actually broke out and got a little too much moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>This makes your dry skin feel hydrated and soft.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice mask!! it is hydrating and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> Strong fragrance. I was about to vomit. :( Could not believe that Paula&#x27;s Choice rated it &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; mask... :(</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Makes bb cream go on smoother and complexion better.</li>
            <li> This makes your dry skin feel hydrated and soft.  I also purchased the night crème and love that as well!</li>
            <li> this is a good quality hydrating and refreshing mask with a faint floral scent. I can use it everyday although I have sensitive skin and this mask seems to work as a booster for serums and moisturizers I use afterwards.</li>
            <li> HATED this... i threw it out tbh.  it smells so strongly and so badly (think triple-strength B&amp;BW plumeria), all while doing nothing to help my skin. a loser on all fronts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but I love the way my skin feels afterward.  It really does a good job hydrating the skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Noticeable results in short time.</li>
            <li> I bought his product because on Paula choice reviews it said it was one of the best masks for dry skin. In the cold winters when it&#x27;s snowing I noticed I needed extra moisture and although pure coconut and kukui oil works,it not like I can wear that out of the house.  Ever since living in Colorado for the past 2 yrs my skin has gone from nice and moisturized naturally to sucked dry and dehydrated. I use this after I put my serums on to push in the nutrients. It works good and and use it over my eyes as well since all the ingredients or moisturizing and perfect for it. I leave it overnight or on for an hour or 2.  For the price it&#x27;s really good and lasts long. It&#x27;s smells nice and dries pretty fast and I use a generous amount on my face so I look pasty.  I recommend this for those dry seasons or if you have dry skin. I don&#x27;t recommend it in humid weather. I spend my summers in Hawaii and my skin goes back to normal, so when I did use this, I actually broke out and got a little too much moisture in my skin. I suggest it as a seasonal and depending on the weather, is when you should take care to use it.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell, doesn&#x27;t make me itch (I tend to be allergic to most products), and softens my skin very well!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.

I have very sensitive skin, so would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me. She has been using products of this brand for a while and was very happy, so I decided to try it as well. I use the mask once a week and notice that my skin became a lot smoother and looks healthier. I am 29 years old, so I don&#x27;t need to use heavy moisturizers a lot just yet, so this mask does a perfect job for me if i use it once a week. My skin feels incredible afterwards and the most important it doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts like many other products. Plus this company is totally organic and they are cruelty-free meaning they don&#x27;t do animal testing which is important to me in my choice of cosmetics. Will def use it again and recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their face skin.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with this facial mask, after using it my skin feel so smooth and no tight feeling at all. Love it and great price too. I will buy another tube for my mum as a gift !</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a 26 year old male and I bought this because I needed something to Hydrate my facial skin, and so far it has worked great!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not one of those masks that you instantly fall in love with. It&#x27;s like any other ordinary face mask. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying it ever again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve been using the hydrating mask for over six months and my skin look wonderful!  I have received many compliments on how nice my skin look. I apply the mask about twice a week and leave it on for about an hour, afterwards, my skin is left looking very smooth and very supple. The night crème is great as well.  These are  wonderful products!</li>
