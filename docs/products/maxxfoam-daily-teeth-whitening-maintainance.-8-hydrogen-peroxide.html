            <li>I have reactions to so many things I test the water so to speak...  </li>
            <li>I love that I am able to use this without having any side effects</li>

            <li>I received this from a Company for FREE for my opinion :)</li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>The foam has a pleasant taste that is refreshing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth  </li>
            <li>I was vert fortunate to recieve this whitener in return for my hinest opinion,  I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Everyone feels better when they have great looking white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt!!</li>
            <li>Iys easy to apply to my toothbrush and just do it as</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, like the spearmint taste as well.</li>
            <li>This has very mild flavor.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet...</li>
            <li>It has an awesome minty taste and I can tell a difference after a few weeks of using this teeth whitener.</li>
            <li>It has a great minty flavor and wasn&#x27;t chalky like most other whiteners.</li>
            <li>it leaves my mouth very fresh</li>
            <li>I love this product and it really works!</li>
            <li>I was especially excited when my mom told me how white my teeth looked and asked what I have been using.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know there was an option to do a light whitening in between when you need to do a full over whitening.</li>
            <li>If you want a fast and easy way to get whiter teeth, this could be the product for you!.</li>
            <li>MaxxFoam is an easy and inexpensive way to get a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>In my research of this product I have never seen so many positive reviews describing</li>
            <li>product contains hydrogen peroxide, its not an uncommon tooth whitener but befriend peroxide needs to be stored in a dark bottle away from light.  </li>
            <li>This is the most gentle product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I stop using whitening toothpaste, just regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it at full price.</li>
            <li>I am so lucky to have received this on  discount during a promotion for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>great alternative from crest white strips, although it doesn&#x27;t work as fast.</li>
            <li>You can really feel your teeth are a lot cleaner and feel like it is getting everything clean very well and very easily.</li>
            <li>NO GRIT!&lt;br /&gt;I can notice a difference, my teeth look so nice and clean and white!</li>
            <li>And see everyone wants that amazing beaming white smile :)</li>
            <li>Seriously who doesn&#x27;t like to see a pretty beautiful smile!!</li>
            <li>But the fact that you can go back to eating after an hour is amazing...</li>
            <li>we all want a nice white smile.</li>
            <li>There are many natural ways to whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>whitening Product :) Is you can apply it directly on your tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I got to try some teeth whitening that tasted minty fresh.</li>
            <li>Shiny, and fresh.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth, I use this foam, and go to bed right away.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see anything special in terms of results from this product.</li>
            <li>So if I can only use it every 6 months, I&#x27;m thinking it won&#x27;t be any good the next time I go to use it because hydrogen peroxide does not keep its strength or effectiveness when exposed to light.  </li>
            <li>, the packaging is very nice, just not sure of the taste still...</li>
            <li>The flavor is not strong but a nice light mint flavor.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try teeth whitening foam.</li>
            <li>The directions say not to use for more than 3 weeks and then wait 6 months to use again, so the MaxxFoam should last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>Some whitening effect but nothing stellar</li>
            <li>But I will be switching it up for a daily routine so that I get even more results...</li>
            <li>My teeth are not terribly discolored, but they are not as white as a marshmallow either.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Works FAST!</li>
            <li>I like that this product is brushed on with your tooth brush so it gets in between the teeth much better.</li>
            <li>and I liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn my gums like some other whitening products.</li>
            <li>I just ordered the Maxx Foam whitener and did so strictly on all the positive reviews I have read regarding this product.</li>
            <li>This foam really works!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I would say time will tell how much whitening you will get from this form.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is shake the bottle really well and put a squirt of the foam on your toothbrush then brush your teeth for one minute, spit out the foam then wait 15 minutes before eating or drinking anything.</li>
            <li>The real hit is that it turns to foam</li>
            <li>It really does whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like this Maxxfoam.  </li>
            <li>I really like it all.</li>
            <li>I been using it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li>Convenient pump allows for just the right amount on your brush and is not messy.</li>
            <li>I have tried other teeth whitening products but none as good overall as this.</li>
            <li>You can actually feel that your teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>Its has the proven active whitening ingredient that many whiteners lack....</li>
            <li>Or getting special trays and gels to whitening those teeth to get that pearly white look!!</li>
            <li>Billions are spent yearly on special whitening your teeth at home!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item fir testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not to mention just normal aging of the teeth.</li>
            <li>what I like about this New teeth</li>
            <li>that is my judgment call because I am scared of new things.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a harsh flavor, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, and because of the foaming action, it gets in between your teeth better, unlike whitening strips!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>there is no harsh after taste!</li>
            <li>I never purchase anything without first doing extensive reviews on any product.</li>
            <li>I do use coconut oil pulling and many other natural ways to keep my teeth white!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and I see that it really lightens my teeth only after a few applications.  </li>
            <li>I usually do this right after my night time brushing right before bed so that I don&#x27;t have to think about it.  </li>
            <li>Clearly that is not stated on the direction.</li>
            <li>This product is in a clear bottle.</li>
            <li>I had my teeth professionally whitened by dentist.</li>
            <li>My teeth still are not anchor woman white, but they are much improved.</li>
            <li>I like is so far...</li>
            <li>I try not to do it often as I do have some what sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really no mess with trips or gels.</li>
            <li>has 8% hydrogen peroxide, whereas peroxide that you get in a big bottle in the first aid section has only 2%.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, by just placing on your toothbrush, and brushing as normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not intended for long term use, the bottle says not to use more than 3 times per day and no more than 3 weeks every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot ear or drink 15 minutes after each use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>MaxxFoam daily teeth whitening is gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in your mouth like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but have already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I really have seen progress through using it over the past couple of weeks, highly recommend if you are a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the whitening strips, the toothpastes and none of them ever worked for me, but the MaxxFoam is a whole other story!</li>

            <li> But I will be switching it up for a daily routine so that I get even more results...</li>
            <li> My teeth are not terribly discolored, but they are not as white as a marshmallow either.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Works FAST!</li>
            <li> I like that this product is brushed on with your tooth brush so it gets in between the teeth much better.</li>
            <li> and I liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn my gums like some other whitening products.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Maxx Foam whitener and did so strictly on all the positive reviews I have read regarding this product.</li>
            <li> This foam really works!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I would say time will tell how much whitening you will get from this form.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is shake the bottle really well and put a squirt of the foam on your toothbrush then brush your teeth for one minute, spit out the foam then wait 15 minutes before eating or drinking anything.</li>
            <li> The real hit is that it turns to foam</li>
            <li> It really does whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like this Maxxfoam.  </li>
            <li> I really like it all.</li>
            <li> I been using it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li> Convenient pump allows for just the right amount on your brush and is not messy.</li>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products but none as good overall as this.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel that your teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> Its has the proven active whitening ingredient that many whiteners lack....</li>
            <li> Or getting special trays and gels to whitening those teeth to get that pearly white look!!</li>
            <li> Billions are spent yearly on special whitening your teeth at home!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item fir testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not to mention just normal aging of the teeth.</li>
            <li> what I like about this New teeth</li>
            <li> that is my judgment call because I am scared of new things.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a harsh flavor, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, and because of the foaming action, it gets in between your teeth better, unlike whitening strips!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there is no harsh after taste!</li>
            <li> I never purchase anything without first doing extensive reviews on any product.</li>
            <li> I do use coconut oil pulling and many other natural ways to keep my teeth white!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I see that it really lightens my teeth only after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> I usually do this right after my night time brushing right before bed so that I don&#x27;t have to think about it.  </li>
            <li> Clearly that is not stated on the direction.</li>
            <li> This product is in a clear bottle.</li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened by dentist.</li>
            <li> My teeth still are not anchor woman white, but they are much improved.</li>
            <li> I like is so far...</li>
            <li> I try not to do it often as I do have some what sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really no mess with trips or gels.</li>
            <li> has 8% hydrogen peroxide, whereas peroxide that you get in a big bottle in the first aid section has only 2%.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, by just placing on your toothbrush, and brushing as normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not intended for long term use, the bottle says not to use more than 3 times per day and no more than 3 weeks every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot ear or drink 15 minutes after each use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> MaxxFoam daily teeth whitening is gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li> The mint flavor is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in your mouth like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but have already noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I really have seen progress through using it over the past couple of weeks, highly recommend if you are a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the whitening strips, the toothpastes and none of them ever worked for me, but the MaxxFoam is a whole other story!</li>
            <li> No more walking around with goofy strips on your teeth or clumsy trays.</li>
            <li> Clearly if you smoke or drink dark beverage etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see results, but I do like that</li>
            <li> I cut down to using the product once per day because it was making my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> and so far I see a little bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they once were...</li>
            <li> The taste is not completely unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this only every other day --</li>
            <li> Nothing to loose and everything to gain.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it there was a dramatic difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> With Maxxfoam that is not the case, at least that I can see so far.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to swallow this product (within reason) when using.</li>
            <li> It starts to whiten your teeth a bit I have noticed and only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> I  have been following the directions and  have noticed results in less than 5 days!  </li>
            <li> I can tell just after a week and a half of use that my teeth are less yellow than they were.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This is not for everyday, long term use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why every bottle of hydrogen peroxide you buy,  is in a dark brown bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive teeth and when using the strips I can only use them once every other week or pay the painful price.</li>
            <li> and I can see my teeth lightening a little.  </li>
            <li> and I did notice my teeth get a little whiter.</li>
            <li> But they are messy and take time.</li>
            <li> no time is wasted.</li>
            <li> thing about this foam is, it doesn&#x27;t have nasty flavor or make my teeth sensitive, which I was scared of in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my teeth seem a little whiter than before I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I have used whitening strips in the past an</li>
            <li> Just put a small amount on your toothbrush and brush.</li>
            <li> Some of them break down your enamel and make your teeth worse.</li>
            <li> Although it seems to work,  I am not thrilled with it</li>
            <li> Most others are uncomfortable, taste nasty, take forever to apply or you just don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad to me and it is simple to use.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using any whitening product as it usually breaks me out; however, this product did nothing but whiten my teeth.</li>

            <li> I am always skeptical for using teeth whitening products.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t to bad.</li>
            <li> I like this because it does not have a bad taste</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken before and after pictures as I was shocked at the results after just one use.</li>
            <li> It was painful AND it did not work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice this week without any painful side affects and have noticed a drastic difference in my teeth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried other teeth whitening products but none as good overall as this. Most others are uncomfortable, taste nasty, take forever to apply or you just don&#x27;t see results. This foam really works!&lt;br /&gt;You just put it on, watch it foam for a couple of minutes, then rinse. Thats how simple! It has a great minty flavor and wasn&#x27;t chalky like most other whiteners. Also since it&#x27;s a liquid to foam, NO GRIT!&lt;br /&gt;I can notice a difference, my teeth look so nice and clean and white! My mouth has a great taste after. I am happy to recieve this foam whitener to review! I will definitely keep using this stuff!</li>
            <li> All you need to do is check every magazine!! And see everyone wants that amazing beaming white smile :) That not only makes you feel more attractive, and makes your selfie look fabulous!! Seriously who doesn&#x27;t like to see a pretty beautiful smile!! Right? Everyone feels better when they have great looking white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt!! we all want a nice white smile. Billions are spent yearly on special whitening your teeth at home! Or getting special trays and gels to whitening those teeth to get that pearly white look!! There are many natural ways to whitening your teeth. But they are messy and take time. I do use coconut oil pulling and many other natural ways to keep my teeth white!! Love it. But again it takes 20 minutes of swishing it around in your mouth etc. what I like about this New teeth whitening Product :) Is you can apply it directly on your tooth brush. And it pumps out as a form. So a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;Now It says to use twice a day only!! Now I don&#x27;t know if you can still use your regular tooth paste. Clearly that is not stated on the direction. But for the product its self. I would say time will tell how much whitening you will get from this form. There are a lot of factors that go into teeth staying white. Clearly if you smoke or drink dark beverage etc. Your teeth will take time to get white then. Not to mention just normal aging of the teeth. But I do recommend you give this product a try. Nothing to loose and everything to gain. I received this from a Company for FREE for my opinion :)</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time using any whitening product as it usually breaks me out; however, this product did nothing but whiten my teeth. I love this product and it really works! The hardest part is waiting 15 mins before drinking fluids. This is the most gentle product I&#x27;ve ever used. Glad I tried it! Happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but have already noticed a difference. I&#x27;m very happy with the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s to come!</li>
            <li> I got it at discount to test the product and write review. This is my first time to try teeth whitening foam. I follow the instruction, but I only use it at night. It has been 3 weeks now (it says no longer than 3 weeks in 6 month).. I can see the difference. To be fair, I stop using whitening toothpaste, just regular toothpaste. After brushing my teeth, I use this foam, and go to bed right away. I don&#x27;t use it in the morning though. Maybe if I did, I would see more improvement. I think, after 3 weeks usage, my teeth are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;Great thing about this foam is, it doesn&#x27;t have nasty flavor or make my teeth sensitive, which I was scared of in the first place. I think this is an awesome product which does work. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now and I like it</li>
            <li> awesome great product</li>
            <li> MaxxFoam is an easy and inexpensive way to get a whiter smile. And it is used only twice a day. I wish I had taken before and after pictures as I was shocked at the results after just one use. I&#x27;ve tried the whitening strips, the toothpastes and none of them ever worked for me, but the MaxxFoam is a whole other story! After the first time I used it there was a dramatic difference in the color of my teeth. My teeth are whiter now than they have ever been.  All you have to do is shake the bottle really well and put a squirt of the foam on your toothbrush then brush your teeth for one minute, spit out the foam then wait 15 minutes before eating or drinking anything. No rinsing is necessary. It is so easy! The foam has a pleasant taste that is refreshing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth  and the MaxxFoam does not cause my teeth or gums to hurt at all. The directions say not to use for more than 3 weeks and then wait 6 months to use again, so the MaxxFoam should last me quite a while. If you want a fast and easy way to get whiter teeth, this could be the product for you!. I would definitely recommend this product. This is my honest opinion after trying this product.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like the taste at all.  We will see?  I like this concept, the packaging is very nice, just not sure of the taste still... I&#x27;m sure it works great for some :-)</li>
            <li> I am  so happy with the results I am seeing with MaxxFoam.  I am using  MaxxFoam twice daily along with a whitening toothpaste.  I  have been following the directions and  have noticed results in less than 5 days!  I have used whitening strips in the past an it caused my teeth to have sensitivity, to the point it hurt to go outside in the winter.  I have not had any teeth sensitivity with MaxxFoam.  The foam does not leave a nasty taste in your mouth, in fact it is very minty.  I was especially excited when my mom told me how white my teeth looked and asked what I have been using.  I am so lucky to have received this on  discount during a promotion for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> After using the MaxxGel teeth whitener, I needed to maintain my pearly whites so I purchased the MaxxFoam daily teeth whitening maintenance. I also received this at a good price. I like the foam because you use it like you would toothpaste. You put in on your toothbrush and brush your teeth with it. You spit out the excess but don&#x27;t rinse your mouth out. I had to wait about 10 minutes before I could eat anything. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad to me and it is simple to use. I would recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> The foam is soooo much better than a gel! Iys easy to apply to my toothbrush and just do it as if im brushing my teeth! Instead of having gel and a tray. It has an awesome minty taste and I can tell a difference after a few weeks of using this teeth whitener. I was vert fortunate to recieve this whitener in return for my hinest opinion,  I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great whitening system. The mint flavor is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in your mouth like some of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. The real hit is that it turns to foam so it&#x27;s really no mess with trips or gels. For me I have two kids so time is essential and with this product no time is wasted. Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item fir testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff  works great at maintaining your bright smile. So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe what a huge difference this made!  Only after two applications I see a world of difference. I highly recommend this to anyone getting married or wanting great teeth!</li>
            <li> This product has a great flavor.It really does whiten my teeth.I had my teeth professionally whitened by dentist.It was painful AND it did not work.My teeth are not stained.They were never white white.I tried this on a whim with low expectations.It was a pleasant surprise. My teeth still are not anchor woman white, but they are much improved.You do have to be careful not to swallow this product (within reason) when using.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to be able to get this Maxx Foam teeth whitening by a promotional offer. I got to try some teeth whitening that tasted minty fresh. I will be looking forward to using this teeth whitening maintenance to get my teeth white. As I have aged, my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as they once were... I am so looking forward to seeing those pearly whites once again. thank you for this opportunity to try your product and see how it works... I LOVE the taste of mint!</li>
            <li> I like is so far... I don&#x27;t see a huge difference yet...&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it leaves my mouth very fresh</li>
            <li> I got this as a promotional item. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well I would like brushing my teeth with a &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34;. It really isn&#x27;t to bad. I use a whitening toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t foam up well and sometimes I have to put more toothpaste on my toothbrush. This foam keeps foaming as you are brushing and it tastes pretty good. I have noticed that my teeth seem a little whiter than before I started using this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this Maxxfoam.  I have never had really white teeth.  I drink a lot of tea which stains my teeth.  This has hydrogen peroxide which is always good at whitening.  It is very easy to use just  one pump on to my tooth brush.  I have only been using it for about a week and I can see my teeth lightening a little.  I will continue using.  I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical for using teeth whitening products. Some of them break down your enamel and make your teeth worse. With Maxxfoam that is not the case, at least that I can see so far. I waited a couple weeks after purchasing before I reviewed to see what difference was made and my teeth are visibly whiter. I used to smoke and my teeth were stained from the smoke. I can tell just after a week and a half of use that my teeth are less yellow than they were. I did receive this for review purposes. The taste is not completely unbearable.</li>
            <li> taste spearmint, I like it!</li>
            <li> Is great. Has a nice spearmint flavor that tastes amazing. You can really feel your teeth are a lot cleaner and feel like it is getting everything clean very well and very easily. It starts to whiten your teeth a bit I have noticed and only been using it a few days. I really like it all. comes in an easy to pump tube with a great cover to keep the germs out as well. I am so happy I was able to receive this as a gift to share my experiences about it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this like a day ago and I liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn my gums like some other whitening products. You can actually feel that your teeth are clean. Can&#x27;t wait to see the chanes the more I use it!</li>
            <li> A++++++ This stuff is AWESOME! I love this, it works and is super easy to use!!! Get some!!!&lt;br /&gt;I got a discount to try and review this, and I am sure happy I did!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, like the spearmint taste as well. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see anything special in terms of results from this product. Some whitening effect but nothing stellar</li>
            <li> Excellent teeth whitening foam use twice a day for best results!</li>
            <li> You can not get easier than this... I usually do this right after my night time brushing right before bed so that I don&#x27;t have to think about it.  But the fact that you can go back to eating after an hour is amazing... I have been using this only every other day -- that is my judgment call because I am scared of new things.  I have reactions to so many things I test the water so to speak...  But I will be switching it up for a daily routine so that I get even more results... I love that I am able to use this without having any side effects well unless you want to call whiter teeth a side effect... Good job on a great product...</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant spearmint flavor.  I am a coffee and tea drinker, even thought I visit the dentist regularly,  I still get stains. I used this product as directed and I did notice my teeth get a little whiter. My teeth are not terribly discolored, but they are not as white as a marshmallow either.&lt;br /&gt;This foam did get them about 1 shade whiter.&lt;br /&gt;It is not intended for long term use, the bottle says not to use more than 3 times per day and no more than 3 weeks every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot ear or drink 15 minutes after each use.&lt;br /&gt;This product contains hydrogen peroxide, its not an uncommon tooth whitener but befriend peroxide needs to be stored in a dark bottle away from light.  This product is in a clear bottle. So if I can only use it every 6 months, I&#x27;m thinking it won&#x27;t be any good the next time I go to use it because hydrogen peroxide does not keep its strength or effectiveness when exposed to light.  That&#x27;s why every bottle of hydrogen peroxide you buy,  is in a dark brown bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample bottle of Maxxfoam to test and review.  Although it seems to work,  I am not thrilled with it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it at full price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice foam teeth whiten. If you have uses a whitener before and need to maintain it. This is what you need to keep it up. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the product. The flavor is not strong but a nice light mint flavor.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  I found with this even lightened up my teeth than before I started using this maintenance program. I didn&#x27;t even know there was an option to do a light whitening in between when you need to do a full over whitening. I try not to do it often as I do have some what sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This has very mild flavor. It&#x27;s a foam (like foam hand soap but more bubbly) I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see results, but I do like that there is no harsh after taste!</li>
            <li> I been using it for 2 weeks straight and so far I see a little bit of a difference. Will continue to use to see the difference I want :) great alternative from crest white strips, although it doesn&#x27;t work as fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! Doesn&#x27;t have a harsh flavor, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, and because of the foaming action, it gets in between your teeth better, unlike whitening strips!&lt;br /&gt;I honestly noticed a difference in my teeth after ONE use.&lt;br /&gt;Product is very affordable and effective! I deviated from the instructions a little--the instructions say to put the foam on your toothbrush, brush your teeth, then spit the foam out. I let it sit on my teeth for about 5 minutes then spit out.&lt;br /&gt;This has 8% hydrogen peroxide, whereas peroxide that you get in a big bottle in the first aid section has only 2%. I used to swish with regular peroxide but I will be using this from now on because it is stronger!</li>
            <li> Works FAST! I noticed a difference with 3 days.  My husband commented on how white my teeth were after about a week of use.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive teeth and when using the strips I can only use them once every other week or pay the painful price. I have used this product twice this week without any painful side affects and have noticed a drastic difference in my teeth. I like that this product is brushed on with your tooth brush so it gets in between the teeth much better. I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit. Its has the proven active whitening ingredient that many whiteners lack....peroxide. I really have seen progress through using it over the past couple of weeks, highly recommend if you are a coffee drinker.</li>
            <li> This product is only the 2nd product I&#x27;ve ever tried with the benefits of teeth whitening and I have to say I do like the way it makes my mouth feel. Refreshed, and my teeth are showing a difference already. Shiny, and fresh. Simple to use, by just placing on your toothbrush, and brushing as normal. Tastes just like a toothpaste, but lightweight.</li>
            <li> MaxxFoam daily teeth whitening is gentle enough to use every day.  I have been using it for almost a week and can see a visible difference in the whiteness and brightness of my teeth.  This is the easiest teeth whitener I have ever used.  Convenient pump allows for just the right amount on your brush and is not messy. Just put a small amount on your toothbrush and brush. The foam has a pleasant minty taste.  A little goes a long way.  No more walking around with goofy strips on your teeth or clumsy trays. Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> It works, but you must use as directed. This is not for everyday, long term use.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Maxx Foam whitener and did so strictly on all the positive reviews I have read regarding this product. I never purchase anything without first doing extensive reviews on any product. In my research of this product I have never seen so many positive reviews describing it&#x27;s effectiveness. I look forward to using this product and will return to give my opinion and rate it&#x27;s effectiveness. ..</li>
            <li> I have noticed my teeth getting brighter. I cut down to using the product once per day because it was making my teeth sensitive. The sensitivity has lessened but it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> I like this because it does not have a bad taste and it&#x27;s easy to use. It helps get rid of unwanted coffee and wine stains on my teeth. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I see that it really lightens my teeth only after a few applications.  I received a discount of product for my unbiased opinion.</li>
