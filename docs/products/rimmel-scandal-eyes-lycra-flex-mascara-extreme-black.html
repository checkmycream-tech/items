            <li>The thing I love best about Dior is the buildable volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara for some time and was recommended this by a friend.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked this good.</li>
            <li>Still this is a good choice</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this one since it was so inexpensive and had so many great ratings.</li>
            <li>but I would honestly purchase this product, it is that good.</li>
            <li>I got this after trying my sisters and I love it!</li>
            <li>but this is 100 times better!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my lashes and eyes since I started using this!</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>but I really feel like this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Most have been good but not this one.</li>
            <li>This mascara is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I just really love it.</li>
            <li>Try this mascara if you love the Diorshow you will never splurge again.</li>
            <li>The brush is big, but it puts on the perfect amount of mascara.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have too many problems with clumping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a life-changing product, but it&#x27;s certainly better than a lot that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>in all this is definitely my favorite mascara at the moment.</li>
            <li>Favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Also noteworthy, buying white bed linens was the best bedtime regimine decision ever!</li>
            <li>but i use Mary Kay eye makeup remover, which I also love,</li>
            <li>I have really long lashes and this product brings them out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a dupe for my DiorShow original mascara and this is it!</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect to make your lashes full and long.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why it comes off so easily for me.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start right off with the fact that my favorite mascara of all time is Diorshow Iconic Waterproof.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best mascara.</li>
            <li>The brush on this wand is RIDICULOUSLY huge.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the brush is huge.</li>
            <li>I received this for free</li>
            <li>I should have known by the size of the tube itself, now I&#x27;m out the few bucks and still searching for that perfect drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li>I probably couldn&#x27;t fit it between my lashes, but I never tried, because --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT, the mascara itself is great, and thickens &amp; elongates my super blonde fine eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with it and would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I pulled out the brush.</li>
            <li>But again I used a clean wand to separate them to my liking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>noticed a girl with ridiculously long lashes that were full and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>A couple coats is good for work, but it you want huge, full, dark lashes, you can just keep layering it on.</li>
            <li>, just right.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara, but I have to admit, I prefer the black tube version.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a huge one...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Rimmel mascara</li>
            <li>The brush is big which helps with applying the mascara evenly on your eyelashes and it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and the one I go back to every</li>
            <li>I love how long my lashes look with this mascara it separates, builds volume, and length.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is absolutely amazing ( like this one) or if it&#x27;s a product that absolutely a waste.</li>
            <li>Item was as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear a lot of mascara, so when I do, I expect it to work well.</li>
            <li>As for the mascara formula, I honestly can&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li>This one, however, really just missed the mark.</li>
            <li>I have very stubbornly straight lashes and it&#x27;s taken me years to find a system that works for me.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t do that, my stick straight lashes lose their curl.)</li>
            <li>Please note that brand new mascara is always super wet and gloopy (also true of any luxury brand I&#x27;ve ever tried in the history of time), so for the first week</li>
            <li>Sadly, you can&#x27;t buy this product in Germany, but I&#x27;m so impressed that I definitely have to import it.</li>
            <li>because the tube is huge and the idea is to increase lash size, this doesn&#x27;t mean they have to give us a HUGE application wand too.</li>
            <li>I love the original Rimmel Scandel Eyes mascara in the black tube with the green lettering, so I thought I would try this version.</li>
            <li>my bed linens are crisp white.</li>
            <li>This mascara is a huge let down.</li>
            <li>brush is huge which I don&#x27;t usually like, but it works really well to separate lashes and keep the mascara from clumping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake on me and my lashes feel soft and natural.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get enough mascara ON my eyelashes to really see how this mascara works.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this out.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>The poorest Rimmel mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I only paid about $6 at my local store, so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get mascara on my eyelids, but most of the time I do a medium thick liquid line</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I have very long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>What I like most is that it gives me long, lush lashes that don&#x27;t flake off after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I was a little bit scared to buy this mascara at first because of the other reviews saying that the brush was too large.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have spider legs growing out of your eyes, only full, dark, long lashes.</li>
            <li>I put makeup on around 5:30am and don&#x27;t wash it off until right before bed, anywhere past 10pm and on into the wee morning hours.</li>

            <li> I put makeup on around 5:30am and don&#x27;t wash it off until right before bed, anywhere past 10pm and on into the wee morning hours.</li>
            <li> This is really a shame, because I&#x27;m usually quite the fan on Rimmel makeup products.</li>
            <li> It makes a big mess on my eyelids and barely coats my lashes.</li>
            <li> I get comments from strangers all the time--they ask if my eyelashes are fake--because my eyelashes are so long.</li>
            <li> For a long time I tried cheaper mascaras and nothing could compare, but</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local Walmart because I had tried a bunch of other brands that just hadn&#x27;t done the trick</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyelashes stand up straight and full without looking goopy or nasty.</li>
            <li> Definitely not buying again-- a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I did get a little bit of mascara on my eyelids (nothing that can&#x27;t be removed with a Q-tip) and the brush didn&#x27;t separate my eyelashes as much as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> No cardstock/plastic packaging, and when I twisted the cap to open it for the first time, it didn&#x27;t feel sealed.</li>
            <li> or so I pump the tube (pushing the wand in and out several times to push air into the tube and dry it out a little).</li>
            <li> (Side tip: I almost always blow dry my lashes on low on the coolest setting for a few seconds between coats.</li>
            <li> This will work for those who have little to no lashes, or very blonde lashes.</li>
            <li> Not so with any other drugstore mascara</li>
            <li> barrel round brush that I blow dry my hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is too large to function properly (weird) and I look like a raccoon after an hour of wear.  </li>
            <li> I have at least 10 different tubes in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> I keep the clumping to a minimum by warming the mascara for a few minutes before I use it by tucking it in my bra while I do other things.</li>
            <li> and I guess the mascara wand hits that line, but it&#x27;s black, so you&#x27;d never</li>
            <li> Yes, I have a problem with trying almost every new mascara that comes on the market - chep and expensive.</li>
            <li> If you expect perfection, you&#x27;ll need to set your bar a little lower.</li>
            <li> Also clumps and a little temperamental in application.</li>
            <li> I predict this gimmicky product to disappear from stores soon.</li>
            <li> After the first swipe I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lancôme and Chanel in the past</li>
            <li> I wash my face with soap and water (sometimes the foam hand soap by the sink if I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off, takes a couple days to get all the residue off.  </li>
            <li> The mascara itself is thick, but not too thick</li>
            <li> The length this mascara gave my eyelashes was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I mean, these suckers are ridiculous, and this mascara is up to the task.</li>
            <li> Had worse.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not that younique crap.</li>
            <li> People ask if I have fake lashes on, or extensions..</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It clumps like crazy and flakes when dries.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell at all.</li>
            <li> Buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane.</li>

            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had. I tried it during a stay in Canada. Sadly, you can&#x27;t buy this product in Germany, but I&#x27;m so impressed that I definitely have to import it.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Flexible, yet lengthens &amp; draws attention to one&#x27;s eyes.  I&#x27;ve had better.  Had worse.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not that younique crap. You won&#x27;t have spider legs growing out of your eyes, only full, dark, long lashes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara for some time and was recommended this by a friend. Worth it! Absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have used to date! I am totally in love with it and would highly recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I got this after trying my sisters and I love it! I have brown eyes, sometimes they look hazel, and this mascara just makes my eyes pop! I always, and almost only, get compliments about my &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; when I wear this mascara even if it&#x27;s the only make up I&#x27;m wearing. I just really love it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best mascara. The brush is perfect to make your lashes full and long. I&#x27;ve used Lancôme and Chanel in the past but this is 100 times better! (And the price difference is a chunk of change too)&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a girl with ridiculously long lashes that were full and gorgeous. I asked what she used and this is what she told me.  Buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Item was as described, fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This mascara is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have really long lashes and this product brings them out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dupe for my DiorShow original mascara and this is it! I love how long my lashes look with this mascara it separates, builds volume, and length. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake on me and my lashes feel soft and natural. Try this mascara if you love the Diorshow you will never splurge again. So impressed.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras and this one is the best.I received this from a offer on a website. At the time I have never tried this mascara or this brand, so I decided to try it out. This mascara fills out my lashes to the fullest.The brush is big, but it puts on the perfect amount of mascara.This will work for those who have little to no lashes, or very blonde lashes.I received this for free but I would honestly purchase this product, it is that good. I don&#x27;t write reviews unless the product is absolutely amazing ( like this one) or if it&#x27;s a product that absolutely a waste.Thank you for reading this review and I hope you have a beautiful day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear a lot of mascara, so when I do, I expect it to work well. I purchased this at a local Walmart because I had tried a bunch of other brands that just hadn&#x27;t done the trick lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is *amazing*. It really makes my eyelashes stand up straight and full without looking goopy or nasty. Maybe if you over-apply it will look globby (as with any mascara) but I really feel like this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I definitely plan to purchase another one to have as a back-up. I only paid about $6 at my local store, so it&#x27;s totally worth it. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Expensive brands are not any better.  Does not leave filaments in eyes after removing at night.  Some mascara leave particles in eyes after removing and irritate eyes over night.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I am a mascara lover. I have at least 10 different tubes in my cosmetic bag. I wanted to try this one since it was so inexpensive and had so many great ratings. For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal. If you expect perfection, you&#x27;ll need to set your bar a little lower. I didn&#x27;t have too many problems with clumping. On days I used an eyelash primer, I only needed one coat of the Rimmel. It&#x27;s not a life-changing product, but it&#x27;s certainly better than a lot that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The brush is too large to function properly (weird) and I look like a raccoon after an hour of wear.  Color does not stay on lashes.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off, takes a couple days to get all the residue off.  Also clumps and a little temperamental in application.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.......Awesome color......Rimmel is the BOMB !!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be wasting $ on this again! It&#x27;s awful!    I was so excited when I pulled out the brush. Wow, what a huge one...my lashes are gonna be gorgeous!! Ugh. What a disappointment. It makes a big mess on my eyelids and barely coats my lashes. The formula flakes, too. I loathe flaking mascara!    I predict this gimmicky product to disappear from stores soon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the brush on this mascara wand! First, let me say that I have very long eyelashes. I get comments from strangers all the time--they ask if my eyelashes are fake--because my eyelashes are so long. So it&#x27;s not me! It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m lacking length here. The brush on this wand is RIDICULOUSLY huge. I can&#x27;t even get mascara on my eyelashes because the brush is so big. I might as well try and apply makeup with my 3&amp;#34; barrel round brush that I blow dry my hair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because the tube is huge and the idea is to increase lash size, this doesn&#x27;t mean they have to give us a HUGE application wand too. I don&#x27;t get it, the design here is totally lacking. As for the mascara formula, I honestly can&#x27;t really say. I couldn&#x27;t get enough mascara ON my eyelashes to really see how this mascara works. This is really a shame, because I&#x27;m usually quite the fan on Rimmel makeup products. This one, however, really just missed the mark. I should have known by the size of the tube itself, now I&#x27;m out the few bucks and still searching for that perfect drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a huge let down. It clumps like crazy and flakes when dries. Definitely not buying again-- a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit scared to buy this mascara at first because of the other reviews saying that the brush was too large. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this out. The mascara itself is thick, but not too thick, just right. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell at all. It makes my eyelashes feel soft and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. It feels like there&#x27;s nothing on my eyelashes. The brush itself worked fairly well. It got all of my eyelashes even the pesky short ones. The length this mascara gave my eyelashes was unbelievable! After the first swipe I was shocked. My only complaint is that I did get a little bit of mascara on my eyelids (nothing that can&#x27;t be removed with a Q-tip) and the brush didn&#x27;t separate my eyelashes as much as I would like it to. But again I used a clean wand to separate them to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is definitely my favorite mascara at the moment. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Rimmel mascara and I will purchase it again in the future.  The brush is big which helps with applying the mascara evenly on your eyelashes and it looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara. Does nnot clump and lengthens my lashs.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the brush is huge. I probably couldn&#x27;t fit it between my lashes, but I never tried, because --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT CAME OPEN. No cardstock/plastic packaging, and when I twisted the cap to open it for the first time, it didn&#x27;t feel sealed. The brush and inside the tube looked like it had been used once or twice, and I immediately threw it away. It&#x27;s an add-on item, so I didn&#x27;t bother asking to return it, I didn&#x27;t want to pay return shipping, and any company that sells OPEN, USED MASCARA to a customer obviously doesn&#x27;t care enough about customer service to want to help me anyway.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara... But only with a different applicator/wand. With the applicator it comes with, it&#x27;s SOOO clumpy it&#x27;s insane. BUT, the mascara itself is great, and thickens &amp; elongates my super blonde fine eyelashes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it -- it just goes on too globby for what I like. The poorest Rimmel mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far. Most have been good but not this one.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start right off with the fact that my favorite mascara of all time is Diorshow Iconic Waterproof. For a long time I tried cheaper mascaras and nothing could compare, but oh, my wallet! Then came this gem. The thing I love best about Dior is the buildable volume. A couple coats is good for work, but it you want huge, full, dark lashes, you can just keep layering it on. Not so with any other drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Scandal Eyes Lycra Flex. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand size doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit. Please note that brand new mascara is always super wet and gloopy (also true of any luxury brand I&#x27;ve ever tried in the history of time), so for the first week or so I pump the tube (pushing the wand in and out several times to push air into the tube and dry it out a little). I also did this with my Dior mascaras and my Too Faced mascaras. Sometimes I get mascara on my eyelids, but most of the time I do a medium thick liquid line and I guess the mascara wand hits that line, but it&#x27;s black, so you&#x27;d never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding smudging/flaking: I work 12 hour shifts. I put makeup on around 5:30am and don&#x27;t wash it off until right before bed, anywhere past 10pm and on into the wee morning hours. I have NEVER had an issue with this mascara smudging or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding residue: my bed linens are crisp white. I wash my face with soap and water (sometimes the foam hand soap by the sink if I&#x27;m lazy. Don&#x27;t judge me), and my pillowcases have NO TRACE OF MASCARA RESIDUE ON THEM. (Also noteworthy, buying white bed linens was the best bedtime regimine decision ever! I can&#x27;t stand the thought of staining them up with mascara so even on my laziests of nights I wash my face before going to sleep, haha.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mascara. I have very stubbornly straight lashes and it&#x27;s taken me years to find a system that works for me. I mean, these suckers are ridiculous, and this mascara is up to the task. (Side tip: I almost always blow dry my lashes on low on the coolest setting for a few seconds between coats. If I don&#x27;t do that, my stick straight lashes lose their curl.)shes on low on the coolest setting for a few seconds between coats. If I don&#x27;t do that, my stick straight lashes lose their curl.)</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my lashes and eyes since I started using this! People ask if I have fake lashes on, or extensions.. NOPE. I keep the clumping to a minimum by warming the mascara for a few minutes before I use it by tucking it in my bra while I do other things. This mascara is a must have.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked this good.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by admitting, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a mascaraholic&amp;#34;.  Yes, I have a problem with trying almost every new mascara that comes on the market - chep and expensive. This is my favorite and the one I go back to every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is huge which I don&#x27;t usually like, but it works really well to separate lashes and keep the mascara from clumping. What I like most is that it gives me long, lush lashes that don&#x27;t flake off after a few hours. I haven&#x27;t had a problem removing it but i use Mary Kay eye makeup remover, which I also love, so maybe that&#x27;s why it comes off so easily for me.</li>
            <li> I love the original Rimmel Scandel Eyes mascara in the black tube with the green lettering, so I thought I would try this version. This is a good mascara, but I have to admit, I prefer the black tube version. Still this is a good choice and I would recommend it.</li>
