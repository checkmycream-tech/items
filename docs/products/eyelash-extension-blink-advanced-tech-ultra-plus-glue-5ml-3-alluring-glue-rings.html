            <li>so be sure you are experienced enough to use it before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Smell wasn&#x27;t strong at all.  </li>
            <li>I was a little leery about getting this since some reviews said there was a lot of fumes and it irritated the eyes, but turns out this was great!</li>
            <li>This glue really bonds well but attempting to do my own lashes and</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many different kind of lash glue I decided to give this one a try</li>
            <li>and the whole top came off with it</li>
            <li>I tried keeping it in a cool place, then let it sit out about 2 hours before client arrived.  </li>
            <li>fumes were not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this glue, it dries fast and lasts 4-6 weeks, as long as clients take good care of their lashes.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly</li>

            <li>OK product, but the glue burns the old peepers.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far.</li>
            <li>The right thing to do would be to just send it regardless</li>
            <li>This is one of the best prices for this product, works well, a little fumy So fan for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>first thank goodness.</li>
            <li>It holds pretty well</li>
            <li>You could really damage your eyes!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>this one does just as good, if not better than the $150 glue.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this glue!</li>
            <li>This glue is really fast and helps speed up my lash extensions fixing.</li>
            <li>Like some of the users, this glue irritated my eyes so much.</li>
            <li>This adhesive is very watery.  </li>
            <li>Got this glue a week ago and my lashes are all still holding very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for experienced professionals, otherwise the fume can be irritating if it gets too close to the skin.</li>
            <li>This glue was easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>i decided to give this a try because i was due to order some glue, and what i was using was much, much more than this one.  </li>
            <li>Since you don&#x27;t need very much, it feels soft on your lashes.(not gummy)  </li>
            <li>Clients love it and say the eyelash extension last longer with this glue, (must be prepped and applied correctly to last)</li>
            <li>Order early if you need it by a certain date.</li>
            <li>If you have real sensitive eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, because the fumes do cause some watering.  </li>
            <li>and it was quick to dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not super strong and stinky like the one i had used before.</li>
            <li>I just keep a cool wet face cloth to put under my eye, helps reduce the redness.  </li>
            <li>A little strong odor...</li>
            <li>it took forever to dry, and after 24 hours of dry time, STILL did not hold a lash on for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>Do not use this for strip or individual applications....for real.</li>
            <li>Meant for professional use.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Fast drying &amp; my client&#x27;s lashes last up to four weeks before any touch ups  needed.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast.  </li>
            <li>This is for professional use only!!</li>

            <li> i will no longer buy that expensive glue as long as this is available!  </li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t wear contacts this will certainly cause you to tear excessively.</li>
            <li> If you allow glue to dry properly before allowing your client to open their eyes they won&#x27;t be bothered by smell at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, with this glue you can&#x27;t even open your eyes for 45 minutes, once you do after an hour your eyes will water endlessly, and they&#x27;ll hurt sooooo much.</li>
            <li> so know it is hard to poor without putting more glue than I want to use on my stone for lashes.</li>
            <li> I would surly loose my vision.</li>
            <li> I usually use the same brand... but opted to try this company, looking for a possibly cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> It does not adhere at all; won&#x27;t cling to lashes; if you want to be extremely frustrated...then order it.  </li>
            <li> Your eyes have to stay closed!</li>
            <li> With that said, water away, I didn&#x27;t mind the slight tearing because the lashes stayed on for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a half dozen kinds/brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black</li>
            <li> they even included little rings that have &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; on them so you can put the glue in that while you are applying the lashes.  </li>
            <li> but it already dried out in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The adhesive does sting, a lot so a few seconds</li>
            <li> Oh and all you need to use is a small amount about a size of a pearl</li>
            <li> but this is serious glue.</li>
            <li> not anyone else&#x27;s I cannot prevent myself from crying and my nose running while applying :(</li>
            <li> It is totally useless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this glue and it burned and stung my eye so bad.</li>
            <li> Also this store doesn&#x27;t accept returns, so I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and tried to return it</li>
            <li> This glue was horrible...</li>
            <li> this glue made my eyes cry like a baby couldn&#x27;t handle the smell it does glue on for couple of day but its terrible experience to use</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this glue and it burned and stung my eye so bad. It left welts on my eyelid. I was very disappointed and tried to return it but it already dried out in the bottle. I wear lashes all the time and put lashes on for my clients and I try the products out on myself first thank goodness. I could never use this product on my clients.  I will never purchase this glue again.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery about getting this since some reviews said there was a lot of fumes and it irritated the eyes, but turns out this was great! I used this to do my own lashes and I felt no irritation or fumes and it was quick to dry. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this glue again.</li>
            <li> Do not use this for strip or individual applications....for real. This glue is strictly for eyelash extensions and nothing else...maybe suturing skin together (just a joke!) but this is serious glue.</li>
            <li> I could not even get this glue close to my eye lid with out tearing up and burning. It is totally useless in my opinion. In fact my sight after trying it was blurry and double vision for 24 hours. I thought If I continued using it I would surly loose my vision. It scared me. Don&#x27;t buy it . I want to see more than want eyelashes..And I&#x27;m sure you do too.!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different kind of lash glue I decided to give this one a try and there is only one word to describe this glue and that&#x27;s.......PERFECT my clients love it and so do I. I will continue to purchase this item because it works.&lt;br /&gt;FYI...... you want to have a fan (hand fan) close by for your client for the fumes from the glue. Oh and all you need to use is a small amount about a size of a pearl and thats for both eyes.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best prices for this product, works well, a little fumy So fan for about ten minutes. Clients love it and say the eyelash extension last longer with this glue, (must be prepped and applied correctly to last) No eyelash extension glue is not for self application. So don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> Not the best adhesive but it alright!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, with this glue you can&#x27;t even open your eyes for 45 minutes, once you do after an hour your eyes will water endlessly, and they&#x27;ll hurt sooooo much.</li>
            <li> This glue holds awesome, though the fumes are very strong.  Meant for professional use.  I am able to use this on myself, however with much tearing up lol.  I just keep a cool wet face cloth to put under my eye, helps reduce the redness.  My eyes do get used to the fumes after about fifteen mins.</li>
            <li> A little strong odor... but overall good glue...holds great, sets fast, and duration of lashes are long too... my clients like it...</li>
            <li> I love this glue, it dries fast and lasts 4-6 weeks, as long as clients take good care of their lashes.</li>
            <li> This glue works great! It drys quickly so be sure you are experienced enough to use it before purchasing. I highly recommend this glue!</li>
            <li> This glue really bonds well but attempting to do my own lashes and not anyone else&#x27;s I cannot prevent myself from crying and my nose running while applying :(</li>
            <li> This glue was easy to use and lasts a long time. Since you don&#x27;t need very much, it feels soft on your lashes.(not gummy)  If you have real sensitive eyes, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, because the fumes do cause some watering.  With that said, water away, I didn&#x27;t mind the slight tearing because the lashes stayed on for weeks.  Great bond, I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> glue is great and hold well however I went to open up and the whole top came off with it so know it is hard to poor without putting more glue than I want to use on my stone for lashes. Feel as if ii am wasting product but the lid just came apart.</li>
            <li> This glue is really fast and helps speed up my lash extensions fixing. I love the fact they added glue rings...I was able to use it as samples and will now be ordering glue rings</li>
            <li> very good glue. using this in my salon with the same eyelashes. stays on for a week or 4.. GOOD</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with rings...... shouldnt have to chase anyone. The right thing to do would be to just send it regardless wether I respond to an email or not. I purchased it, it shouldve been sent. Smh</li>
            <li> Like some of the users, this glue irritated my eyes so much. Tears and running nose. It&#x27;s cheaper but I can&#x27;t use it! It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just received the glue and it does not come with the three rings like in the picture but I will be trying the glue tomorrow and will KEEP u guys update on how it goes... I would give it 5 starts but the fact it does not come with the rings like it says... 😕</li>
            <li> OK product, but the glue burns the old peepers.</li>
            <li> This adhesive is very watery.  I tried keeping it in a cool place, then let it sit out about 2 hours before client arrived.  It does not adhere at all; won&#x27;t cling to lashes; if you want to be extremely frustrated...then order it.  I won&#x27;t buy again.  Also this store doesn&#x27;t accept returns, so I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless bottle.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> If you know what your doing you will love working with this product. If you allow glue to dry properly before allowing your client to open their eyes they won&#x27;t be bothered by smell at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite so far. I&#x27;ve tried about a half dozen kinds/brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying individual lash extensions for over 5 years now... I&#x27;ve had much success, and many very happy clients. I usually use the same brand... but opted to try this company, looking for a possibly cheaper alternative. This glue was horrible... it took forever to dry, and after 24 hours of dry time, STILL did not hold a lash on for more than 2 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this glue for my eyelash extensions that I put on myself and I love it! It holds pretty well and it&#x27;s not super strong and stinky like the one i had used before. I will buy it again when I run out. The only thing I need is a glue remover so i can eventually take it out of my lashes</li>
            <li> Got this glue a week ago and my lashes are all still holding very well. I made the mistake of taking out a contact halfway through application. Leave your contacts in! They will shield your eyes from the fumes. For those that don&#x27;t wear contacts this will certainly cause you to tear excessively. Keep tissues handy. This product was shipped from China via China Post and took several weeks to arrive. Order early if you need it by a certain date.</li>
            <li> this glue made my eyes cry like a baby couldn&#x27;t handle the smell it does glue on for couple of day but its terrible experience to use</li>
            <li> You should NEVER use this product on yourself!!! Your eyes have to stay closed! This is for professional use only!! I&#x27;m a lash stylist and don&#x27;t even do my own! You could really damage your eyes!</li>
            <li> Tis glue is ok . It doesn&#x27;t dry too fast.  Kinda sticky.. probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t strong at all.  Binds lashes well.  I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle</li>
            <li> Love it. Fast drying &amp; my client&#x27;s lashes last up to four weeks before any touch ups  needed. It&#x27;s for experienced professionals, otherwise the fume can be irritating if it gets too close to the skin.</li>
            <li> My lashes lash 4-6 weeks!  And even then I have to remove them for another set.  It&#x27;s black so no one knows they are are not my own lashes.  The adhesive does sting, a lot so a few seconds but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> i decided to give this a try because i was due to order some glue, and what i was using was much, much more than this one.  this one does just as good, if not better than the $150 glue.  i will no longer buy that expensive glue as long as this is available!  fumes were not bad at all.  they even included little rings that have &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; on them so you can put the glue in that while you are applying the lashes.  just something extra that was a nice suprise.  thanks!</li>
