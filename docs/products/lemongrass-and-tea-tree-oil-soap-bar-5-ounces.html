            <li>Wish the scent was more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love the Lemongrass and Tea Tree Oil Soap Bar.  </li>

            <li>It is a very fresh and clean smell that reminds me of summertime.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling super clean, smooth, and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>After bathing you just have a lovely clean smell and feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be fine, but my condition is getting better and thanks to this soap right here.</li>
            <li>almost 2 full months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is not bad in any way</li>
            <li>I Love Love Love, this soap, Ive been having problems with acne lately at 46 years old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing &amp; actually helps with skin problems!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many bars &amp; will come back again!</li>
            <li>This Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap is a fantastic product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the lemongrass and tea tree</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4/5 stars because I am still in love with their coconut papaya.</li>
            <li>Natural clean lemon scent</li>
            <li>Helped clear mine quickly.</li>
            <li>It is great but very hard to find in a story anymore.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, it does smell good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>Much more moisturizing than any other soap I have used.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed considerably more slight issues with my skin as compared to the Paul Mitchell bar.</li>
            <li>its decent soap.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make them go away, but I have to be realistic.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using the soap I have not noticed any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a few days, and so far, I think that I will really be glad of the purchase.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this for everyday use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>At first I wondered if this soap was like black soap, which was so drying I could barely move my face, but this is NOTHING like it!</li>
            <li>This soap put the disease in a neutral position and as long as I don&#x27;t get any new breakouts</li>
            <li>I purchased the first bar a few months ago to try it on a rash since the soap contains ingredients to fight inflammation.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anybody who has acne or any other sort skin conditions .</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is mild, to non-existent, and the soap actually seems to have very small items in it that helps &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I Love Love Love, this soap, Ive been having problems with acne lately at 46 years old, I&#x27;d been reading lately on home remedies to help me get writ of this problem, really nothing worked so after researching i came across lemon and tea tree oil soap it helps fight bacterial so i decided to buy this product because it had what i needed  to heal my acne. I crossed my fingers and yes it did work after a week i could see results no flair ups our recurring bumps , if i do flair its gone the next day. The soap is drying so i made sure i moisturized after every use.....great great product</li>
            <li> This product is sensational.  I purchased the first bar a few months ago to try it on a rash since the soap contains ingredients to fight inflammation.  This product worked when prescription creams, lotions, and other products did not. The rash disappeared within a few days of using it.  I will continue to buy this for everyday use as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review as someone who purchased it as a face wash. I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Tea Tree Bar for almost 20 years. It is great but very hard to find in a story anymore. I used to buy it for about 4.50 but the last shop that I was getting it in was charging over $6.50. I simply felt it was too expensive so I have been looking for a replacement. This bar smells great but it does not work very well as a face wash. My skin is not bad in any way but I have noticed considerably more slight issues with my skin as compared to the Paul Mitchell bar. I have given this soap now almost 2 full months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting simply a nice soap to wash your body or hands, then this is a GREAT soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Natural clean lemon scent</li>
            <li> The best scented antibacterial soap!</li>
            <li> This is the best lemongrass/tea tree oil soap I have ever used. It is very moisturizing and smells incredible. I raise bees and use a natural lemon grass oil supplement in their feed and whenever I use this soap, it reminds me of the wonderful honeybee smell!</li>
            <li> It smells delicious. It lathers great. The delicious smell lingers on your body for quite some time after you bathed. It is a very fresh and clean smell that reminds me of summertime. The soap stays hard as long as you get it out of a soppy place so it will last a while. I use it as face and body soap and have enjoyed it. After bathing you just have a lovely clean smell and feel very refreshed. This is good soap. Also from what I hear the tea tree oil helps to prevent the occurrence of lice and that would be an excellent positive for this soap, too. p. s. I ordered some more and it still smells delicious. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  It&#x27;s like lemon verbina and lemon pie with a slightly spicier scent.  The soap has texture so if you are put off by that you may want to consider a different type.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me so I love it.  As far as to whether or not it helped me with my skin condition I&#x27;ve seen a slight improvement but not enough to give it 5 stars.  I&#x27;ll probably not buy this again, because of the expense but will say if you are looking form a nicely scented tea tree oil soap this could be your choice.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it does smell good enough to eat. Seems to be helping my skin too but I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days. Only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is that for some reason I thought this wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin as dry as regular bar soap but it does. No problem as moisturizing should be part of your routine anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after about a week of mulling. My selling point were the rave reviews, as well as the fact that the product is lemon-based (I&#x27;m obsessed with lemon for some reason). My package came fast (as always) and this is what I experienced. This soap is caustic, so you need a good moisturizer afterwards; I use Nubian Lemontea Grass Lotion (it&#x27;s thick and does not make me break out). At first I wondered if this soap was like black soap, which was so drying I could barely move my face, but this is NOTHING like it! This soap is great once you find the perfect moisturizer, it&#x27;s affordable, and my face no longer looks like I was splashed with olive oil by the end of the day! I am a make-up wearer; I&#x27;m talking concealer, foundation, powder, blush, the WORKS! This soap helps control my oily skin and I only have to use blotting sheets once a day (I used to use them five times a day). The acne scars on my checks are clearing up and my skin has a glow! I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few days, and so far, I think that I will really be glad of the purchase. It cleans well and leaves the skin soft. I will see later how the tea tree ect. works.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Much more moisturizing than any other soap I have used. I have thrown out my Dove body wash and exclusively use this soap. It has a great lather to it as well and works just as good as shaving cream so no need to buy that anymore as well.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers really REALLY good.. like you may be using it, and it slip out of your hand, it lathers so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild, to non-existent, and the soap actually seems to have very small items in it that helps &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bar of this soap with regular use.. let say you wash your hands once, you wash your face once, and take a shower and use the bar soap.. probably last you a week. There about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So its decent soap. Wish the scent was more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Bright, fresh, pleasant, refreshing scent.  Leaves my skin feeling super clean, smooth, and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for people with psoriasis. Helped clear mine quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It&#x27;s so refreshing &amp; actually helps with skin problems! It perfumes my whole shower!!!  I&#x27;ve bought many bars &amp; will come back again!</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good.  I got it to reduce acne on the body, and it is working really well, and had results in just a few days.  thank you!</li>
            <li> This Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap is a fantastic product for sensitive skin. Smells wonderful and works miracles.</li>
            <li> I love the Lemongrass and Tea Tree Oil Soap Bar.  It is especially good, and the main reason I purchased, for my Blepharitis.  I love ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nubian Heritage makes amazing soaps. This was my first time trying the lemongrass and tea tree and I really liked it. The smell just pulls you into a shower. I only gave it 4/5 stars because I am still in love with their coconut papaya. It is rare that you find a soap that smells so good and lathers so well!</li>
            <li> I have a awful disease called Hidradenitis Supparativa. I hesitantly tried looking for a good anti-bacterial soap and I came across lemongrass and tea tree oil soap. I saw good reviews and decided to give it a try . Ever since I started using the soap I have not noticed any new breakouts. I thought it would make them go away, but I have to be realistic. This soap put the disease in a neutral position and as long as I don&#x27;t get any new breakouts I&#x27;ll be fine, but my condition is getting better and thanks to this soap right here. I highly recommend it to anybody who has acne or any other sort skin conditions .</li>
