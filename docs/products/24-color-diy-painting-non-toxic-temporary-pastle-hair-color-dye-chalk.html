            <li>The chalk works great.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>It probably works best on very light hair.</li>
            <li>Although there are things that should improve,If I had more attachment would be perfect</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, i love it.</li>
            <li>It goes on really bright and then fade by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>My daughter really loved these.  </li>
            <li>Good products,</li>
            <li>The colors looked bright and the selection was good.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>Ordered this as a gift for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li>The price is good on these</li>
            <li>so I think this item is fair for what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>This product was perfect for the funky fun I wanted in my life on my vacation.  </li>
            <li>Rainbow hair is not an appropriate look!</li>
            <li>The colors were great and the chalk was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Could have had more bright colors in the pack instead of 3 shades of browm</li>
            <li>Great for light hair....</li>
            <li>was nice.</li>
            <li>I really want it to work since the colors look awesome.</li>
            <li>+ break very easy.</li>
            <li>so my hair picked up all the colors very easily.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the 5-12 year old set.</li>
            <li>My 9 yr old thought it was great!</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my girls, they work great and fun to use without using permanent color.</li>
            <li>What is interesting is that she doesn&#x27;t use them for her own hair.</li>
            <li>They are good fun!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have very light hair and parts</li>
            <li>LOVE IT and was a great deal for the reasonable price!</li>
            <li>grand daughter loves this stuff</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, I was glad to see that all of the chalk was in tact.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t stain your lighter colors with more prominent</li>
            <li>I think better packaging could have prevented that from happening.  </li>
            <li>boys and girls enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>Some colors work better on lighter hair vs darker.</li>
            <li>Ok for one Don&#x27;t use the chalk on your kids hair..</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it was what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all of the colors and many times in combination with others.</li>
            <li>Hopefully these will work better for someone&#x27;s art projects.. giving them away to a friend.</li>
            <li>Orange took a bit more work</li>
            <li>It acted more like an acrylic than chalk.  </li>
            <li>So many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>However,I found I got better results by weting my hair and soaking the chalk itself.</li>
            <li>Some colors work better than others</li>
            <li>(we&#x27;ll see if this option works better)</li>
            <li>Using the product was interesting, it took some getting used to and some trial and error.  </li>
            <li>Love it, works well on hair.</li>
            <li>Gonna buy some more</li>
            <li>They really enjoyed making colors in their hair.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying it to use in coloring books or art projects it would probably work better.  </li>
            <li>I have used many pastel chalk dyes in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>and I have already received so many compliments.</li>
            <li>&quot; with nothing more.</li>
            <li>These are awesome for my kids who always want to dye their hair different colors.</li>
            <li>But my girls love them and so do I bc</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super fun!!!</li>
            <li>It can last many colorings, price is good, and I liked the product.</li>
            <li>Yet it washes out easily with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy for everyone to use.</li>
            <li>but it was easy.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and it</li>
            <li>The best part it is came right out with the next shower.</li>
            <li>have dark brown hair, and the colors showed up great!</li>
            <li>but if you have light hair its really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fine, but it should not be billed as temporary hair dye chalk.  </li>
            <li>The hair chalk is very fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was able to make it really pretty!</li>
            <li>The best product the chalk did not come broken its so amazing</li>
            <li>but okay just for fun.</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s chalk it&#x27;s really easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>I have light brown to a blondish hair color.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is light brown.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves this and like got it really cheap as an add-on order.</li>
            <li>We received the chalk, not the hair styling tools, which is why we ordered this one as oppose to the others that are available.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and there is a nice variety</li>
            <li>Most of it comes out after first wash.</li>
            <li>She was so excited,</li>
            <li>These where so worth the money!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really show up very well on my nieces hair, but she loved the gift anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>*basically washes right out of your hair!</li>
            <li>the only bright colors I have seen.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say is that it did not stain anything that I can see.  </li>
            <li>They arrived in a sealed package which I opened to make sure they were not broken.</li>
            <li>Im blonde so shows up in my hair really good.</li>
            <li>i chalk mt hair like every day such a good product</li>
            <li>Some of the other colors just didn&#x27;t show up too great.  </li>
            <li>But now when I want a quick pick me up to go with an outfit, I use this.</li>
            <li>When It&#x27;s time to go to work on Monday morning, a quick shampoo</li>
            <li>The product was not damaged and came quickly.  </li>
            <li>We followed the simple instructions and the chalk seemed better for coloring skin more than hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product before and it was awesome, same as this picture with the same colors</li>
            <li>It is simply artistic chalk.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to try a swatch on your hair before going to high up just in case it doesn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li>The only two colors that were great were the hot pink, bright teal, orange and one of the reds .  </li>
            <li>the majority of colors don&#x27;t really show and a lot of them break easy.</li>
            <li>These are a gift for my girls, so we have not used them yet, but they are soooo much larger than another brand I purchased, &amp; I was extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>and so far no stain on the carpet either very important.</li>
            <li>After watching how to do it, I tried it, and these hair chalks worked great, even on my dark brown hair!</li>
            <li>We had a salon room set up for the kids, and I was looking for a fun, cheaper way to color children&#x27;s hair for the night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gonna be a fun summer playing with these.</li>
            <li>Really fun.</li>
            <li>I was thinking I wanted to do something fun for my girly girls without permanently changing their hair color.  </li>
            <li>They have had lots of fun</li>
            <li>Still a fun product for girls.</li>
            <li>This is fun stuff to experiment with.</li>
            <li>So much fun</li>
            <li>and it was really easy to apply, but be sure to dry it asap because otherwise the color gets on everything.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was good.</li>
            <li>No worries.. it washes right out.</li>
            <li>It is VERY MESSY, but Very cute when finished!</li>
            <li>â€¦it was super easy because the chalk barely stuck to her hair.  </li>
            <li>I have black hair and it looks really good.</li>
            <li>Only thing is it kind of fades fast.</li>
            <li>First of all, it stiffens your hair like hairspray so be sure to style it while wet because it&#x27;s a huge pain to brush through it afterwards.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I did was look up a hair chalk tutorial on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I brushed my hair yesterday, and most of my hair color came out.</li>
            <li>I plan to experiment more with them later.</li>
            <li>If you want any of it to show up use white and the put the color on on top of it.</li>
            <li>First off this is like a chalk kit for artists.</li>
            <li>I bought these to try to temporarily put colored streaks in my hair for a Halloween costume and they did absolutely nothing!  </li>
            <li>To get the best color on dark hair, it is recommended you wet your hair.</li>
            <li>The chalk colors were pretty on the hair.  </li>
            <li>but, hot her hair</li>
            <li>They worked pretty well on both mine and my boyfriend&#x27;s hair for halloween.</li>
            <li>I love that I can have different hair color every day.</li>
            <li>and it washed out after two washes the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>The color showed up okay, after using white first and wetting the chalk as suggested.  </li>
            <li>So if you want continuous bright color you will have to reapply everyday.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vividly and very pretty.</li>
            <li>It is not very bright, have to use it a lot to get desired effect, but still good to use for fun.</li>
            <li>We both used this chalk and the bright colors show up well in her hair (not so much the dark colors of course) and the whole color range works pretty well in my hair.</li>
            <li>She has light brown hair and has used other chalk brands in her hair and worked fine.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has light brown hair, and the colors barely showed up.</li>
            <li>These look very vibrant.</li>
            <li>My son loves it, but as a hairstylist I am somewhat less enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>Get the hair wet first - the wetter the better the chalk works.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for highlighting but not to do a large portion of your hair.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work as well on dry hair but great on damp or wet hair.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.  </li>
            <li>After applying heat it seems to be working really well at staying in.</li>
            <li>so you just gotta be ready to experiment.  </li>
            <li>It isnt really that viberant in the hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t show up in my daughters light blonde hair at all.</li>
            <li>So much so I had to grind them into a powder form and put them in a spray bottle with water to get any real color.</li>
            <li>She has light red hair.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Too dry for the hair and break easy</li>
            <li>I will have to update after they receive them to comment on use &amp; how vibrant the colors are.</li>
            <li>Works well when hair is wet, colors are more vibrant if white is used first.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great as a stocking stuffer or at an expensive gift for a tween girl</li>
            <li>Ok, so its extremely messy to do, but does it work.  </li>
            <li>These are not hair chalks they are normal pastels.</li>
            <li>I stroked the color in a downward (only) motion and my hair picked it right up.</li>
            <li>i wanted a new loook</li>
            <li>Luckily my nieces were familiar with hair chalk &amp; already knew how to use it as there is a wet &amp; dry method.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped two days earlier than what was expected : )</li>
            <li>Was using on dirty blonde hair - color showed best on the blondest parts.  </li>
            <li>I work in a very professional environment so having something that allows me to play</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these!</li>
            <li>But overall exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Maybe in a couple of months I&#x27;ll be willing to try this again but in a different manner.  </li>
            <li>The only problem was, the chalk came off with the hot iron.</li>
            <li>Other than that its cool stuff.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure your hair is wet and use gloves, then dry it.</li>
            <li>This hair chalk looked like a great idea, but it made a giant mess and did not make a dent in the color of my very dark hair.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to do some purple streaks for a costume but after using this I just ended up buying some fake pieces to put in because I didn&#x27;t think this would have the bright effect I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Let me be clear,</li>
            <li>It is not made for hair and clearly, application to hair was not contemplated.  </li>
            <li>Very concerned about the toxicity of the product coming from China, given their recent history with toxic toys!!</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t completely fade out when she washes her hair.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old loves these hair chalks.</li>
            <li>The colors didn&#x27;t wow me</li>
            <li>My little sister was really excited when she got these.</li>
            <li>I then used a hot iron to dry the hair.  </li>
            <li>There were no instructions in the package, so once I figured out that I have to spray water on the hair to make the chalk work, it was fine, but very messy to work with.  </li>
            <li>They say you only need a the old shirt while applying, my daughters shirt was very noticeable blue.</li>
            <li>You have to wet your hair first</li>
            <li>My daughter has dark brown hair and the pink, purple, blue and green all show up great.  </li>
            <li>Although I do not know if that is what hair chalk is, the package is very clearly stating the contents are for regular chalk drawing for art classes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the chalk wet, and you have damp hair before applying, then style as usual.</li>
            <li>We had around 1000 people at this event, and the chalk looks barely used after all the hair we colored.</li>
            <li>Those are the only colors we have tried so far</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old, who has begged me for the last 6 months to get her &amp;#34;hair chalk&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I let her open it early</li>
            <li>Someone posted you have to rough up the coating on the outside of the chalk first, but I have not been successfull with that.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair, so i don&#x27;t even have to wet it first.</li>
            <li>but nothing so serious that it looks like it from every angle, pretty much you can tell on the tips that I used the pink at some point (this is 2 weeks later) if you are really looking and are standing in sunlight.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t show up extremely well the first few times but after watching some reviews on how to make the color pop (use white first)</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair and the colors didn&#x27;t even show up in the least.  </li>
            <li>I let her open the gift as an early Christmas present, but when she opened up the box, a lot of the chalk sticks were in pieces.  </li>
            <li>but I would be careful about buying on them counting on them for a particular purpose.  </li>
            <li>The color makes the hair a little more stiff.</li>
            <li>This works really well even on dark hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need that much application to make the color noticeable, even if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li>not so much for dark hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to use it for the tips only, but some of the advertisement pictures you see that show people with a full head of hair chalked up is unrealistic.</li>
            <li>And it will turn out brighter as it dries than it seems while it&#x27;s wet, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re going for a more subtle look.</li>

            <li> The colors were great and the chalk was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Could have had more bright colors in the pack instead of 3 shades of browm</li>
            <li> Great for light hair....</li>
            <li> was nice.</li>
            <li> I really want it to work since the colors look awesome.</li>
            <li> + break very easy.</li>
            <li> so my hair picked up all the colors very easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the 5-12 year old set.</li>
            <li> My 9 yr old thought it was great!</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my girls, they work great and fun to use without using permanent color.</li>
            <li> What is interesting is that she doesn&#x27;t use them for her own hair.</li>
            <li> They are good fun!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have very light hair and parts</li>
            <li> LOVE IT and was a great deal for the reasonable price!</li>
            <li> grand daughter loves this stuff</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, I was glad to see that all of the chalk was in tact.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t stain your lighter colors with more prominent</li>
            <li> I think better packaging could have prevented that from happening.  </li>
            <li> boys and girls enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> Some colors work better on lighter hair vs darker.</li>
            <li> Ok for one Don&#x27;t use the chalk on your kids hair..</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it was what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all of the colors and many times in combination with others.</li>
            <li> Hopefully these will work better for someone&#x27;s art projects.. giving them away to a friend.</li>
            <li> Orange took a bit more work</li>
            <li> It acted more like an acrylic than chalk.  </li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> However,I found I got better results by weting my hair and soaking the chalk itself.</li>
            <li> Some colors work better than others</li>
            <li> (we&#x27;ll see if this option works better)</li>
            <li> Using the product was interesting, it took some getting used to and some trial and error.  </li>
            <li> Love it, works well on hair.</li>
            <li> Gonna buy some more</li>
            <li> They really enjoyed making colors in their hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying it to use in coloring books or art projects it would probably work better.  </li>
            <li> I have used many pastel chalk dyes in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> and I have already received so many compliments.</li>
            <li> &quot; with nothing more.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for my kids who always want to dye their hair different colors.</li>
            <li> But my girls love them and so do I bc</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super fun!!!</li>
            <li> It can last many colorings, price is good, and I liked the product.</li>
            <li> Yet it washes out easily with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy for everyone to use.</li>
            <li> but it was easy.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it</li>
            <li> The best part it is came right out with the next shower.</li>
            <li> have dark brown hair, and the colors showed up great!</li>
            <li> but if you have light hair its really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fine, but it should not be billed as temporary hair dye chalk.  </li>
            <li> The hair chalk is very fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was able to make it really pretty!</li>
            <li> The best product the chalk did not come broken its so amazing</li>
            <li> but okay just for fun.</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s chalk it&#x27;s really easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> I have light brown to a blondish hair color.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is light brown.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and like got it really cheap as an add-on order.</li>
            <li> We received the chalk, not the hair styling tools, which is why we ordered this one as oppose to the others that are available.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and there is a nice variety</li>
            <li> Most of it comes out after first wash.</li>
            <li> She was so excited,</li>
            <li> These where so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really show up very well on my nieces hair, but she loved the gift anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> *basically washes right out of your hair!</li>
            <li> the only bright colors I have seen.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say is that it did not stain anything that I can see.  </li>
            <li> They arrived in a sealed package which I opened to make sure they were not broken.</li>
            <li> Im blonde so shows up in my hair really good.</li>
            <li> i chalk mt hair like every day such a good product</li>
            <li> Some of the other colors just didn&#x27;t show up too great.  </li>
            <li> But now when I want a quick pick me up to go with an outfit, I use this.</li>
            <li> When It&#x27;s time to go to work on Monday morning, a quick shampoo</li>
            <li> The product was not damaged and came quickly.  </li>
            <li> We followed the simple instructions and the chalk seemed better for coloring skin more than hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product before and it was awesome, same as this picture with the same colors</li>
            <li> It is simply artistic chalk.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to try a swatch on your hair before going to high up just in case it doesn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li> The only two colors that were great were the hot pink, bright teal, orange and one of the reds .  </li>
            <li> the majority of colors don&#x27;t really show and a lot of them break easy.</li>
            <li> These are a gift for my girls, so we have not used them yet, but they are soooo much larger than another brand I purchased, &amp; I was extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> and so far no stain on the carpet either very important.</li>
            <li> After watching how to do it, I tried it, and these hair chalks worked great, even on my dark brown hair!</li>
            <li> We had a salon room set up for the kids, and I was looking for a fun, cheaper way to color children&#x27;s hair for the night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gonna be a fun summer playing with these.</li>
            <li> Really fun.</li>
            <li> I was thinking I wanted to do something fun for my girly girls without permanently changing their hair color.  </li>
            <li> They have had lots of fun</li>
            <li> Still a fun product for girls.</li>
            <li> This is fun stuff to experiment with.</li>
            <li> So much fun</li>
            <li> and it was really easy to apply, but be sure to dry it asap because otherwise the color gets on everything.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was good.</li>
            <li> No worries.. it washes right out.</li>
            <li> It is VERY MESSY, but Very cute when finished!</li>
            <li> â€¦it was super easy because the chalk barely stuck to her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and it looks really good.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it kind of fades fast.</li>
            <li> First of all, it stiffens your hair like hairspray so be sure to style it while wet because it&#x27;s a huge pain to brush through it afterwards.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I did was look up a hair chalk tutorial on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I brushed my hair yesterday, and most of my hair color came out.</li>
            <li> I plan to experiment more with them later.</li>
            <li> If you want any of it to show up use white and the put the color on on top of it.</li>
            <li> First off this is like a chalk kit for artists.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try to temporarily put colored streaks in my hair for a Halloween costume and they did absolutely nothing!  </li>
            <li> To get the best color on dark hair, it is recommended you wet your hair.</li>
            <li> The chalk colors were pretty on the hair.  </li>
            <li> but, hot her hair</li>
            <li> They worked pretty well on both mine and my boyfriend&#x27;s hair for halloween.</li>
            <li> I love that I can have different hair color every day.</li>
            <li> and it washed out after two washes the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> The color showed up okay, after using white first and wetting the chalk as suggested.  </li>
            <li> So if you want continuous bright color you will have to reapply everyday.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vividly and very pretty.</li>
            <li> It is not very bright, have to use it a lot to get desired effect, but still good to use for fun.</li>
            <li> We both used this chalk and the bright colors show up well in her hair (not so much the dark colors of course) and the whole color range works pretty well in my hair.</li>
            <li> She has light brown hair and has used other chalk brands in her hair and worked fine.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has light brown hair, and the colors barely showed up.</li>
            <li> These look very vibrant.</li>
            <li> My son loves it, but as a hairstylist I am somewhat less enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> Get the hair wet first - the wetter the better the chalk works.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for highlighting but not to do a large portion of your hair.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work as well on dry hair but great on damp or wet hair.</li>
            <li> Worked really well.  </li>
            <li> After applying heat it seems to be working really well at staying in.</li>
            <li> so you just gotta be ready to experiment.  </li>
            <li> It isnt really that viberant in the hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t show up in my daughters light blonde hair at all.</li>
            <li> So much so I had to grind them into a powder form and put them in a spray bottle with water to get any real color.</li>
            <li> She has light red hair.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Too dry for the hair and break easy</li>
            <li> I will have to update after they receive them to comment on use &amp; how vibrant the colors are.</li>
            <li> Works well when hair is wet, colors are more vibrant if white is used first.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great as a stocking stuffer or at an expensive gift for a tween girl</li>
            <li> Ok, so its extremely messy to do, but does it work.  </li>
            <li> These are not hair chalks they are normal pastels.</li>
            <li> I stroked the color in a downward (only) motion and my hair picked it right up.</li>
            <li> i wanted a new loook</li>
            <li> Luckily my nieces were familiar with hair chalk &amp; already knew how to use it as there is a wet &amp; dry method.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped two days earlier than what was expected : )</li>
            <li> Was using on dirty blonde hair - color showed best on the blondest parts.  </li>
            <li> I work in a very professional environment so having something that allows me to play</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> But overall exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Maybe in a couple of months I&#x27;ll be willing to try this again but in a different manner.  </li>
            <li> The only problem was, the chalk came off with the hot iron.</li>
            <li> Other than that its cool stuff.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure your hair is wet and use gloves, then dry it.</li>
            <li> This hair chalk looked like a great idea, but it made a giant mess and did not make a dent in the color of my very dark hair.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to do some purple streaks for a costume but after using this I just ended up buying some fake pieces to put in because I didn&#x27;t think this would have the bright effect I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear,</li>
            <li> It is not made for hair and clearly, application to hair was not contemplated.  </li>
            <li> Very concerned about the toxicity of the product coming from China, given their recent history with toxic toys!!</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t completely fade out when she washes her hair.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves these hair chalks.</li>
            <li> The colors didn&#x27;t wow me</li>
            <li> My little sister was really excited when she got these.</li>
            <li> I then used a hot iron to dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> There were no instructions in the package, so once I figured out that I have to spray water on the hair to make the chalk work, it was fine, but very messy to work with.  </li>
            <li> They say you only need a the old shirt while applying, my daughters shirt was very noticeable blue.</li>
            <li> You have to wet your hair first</li>
            <li> My daughter has dark brown hair and the pink, purple, blue and green all show up great.  </li>
            <li> Although I do not know if that is what hair chalk is, the package is very clearly stating the contents are for regular chalk drawing for art classes.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the chalk wet, and you have damp hair before applying, then style as usual.</li>
            <li> We had around 1000 people at this event, and the chalk looks barely used after all the hair we colored.</li>
            <li> Those are the only colors we have tried so far</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old, who has begged me for the last 6 months to get her &amp;#34;hair chalk&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I let her open it early</li>
            <li> Someone posted you have to rough up the coating on the outside of the chalk first, but I have not been successfull with that.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, so i don&#x27;t even have to wet it first.</li>
            <li> but nothing so serious that it looks like it from every angle, pretty much you can tell on the tips that I used the pink at some point (this is 2 weeks later) if you are really looking and are standing in sunlight.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t show up extremely well the first few times but after watching some reviews on how to make the color pop (use white first)</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and the colors didn&#x27;t even show up in the least.  </li>
            <li> I let her open the gift as an early Christmas present, but when she opened up the box, a lot of the chalk sticks were in pieces.  </li>
            <li> but I would be careful about buying on them counting on them for a particular purpose.  </li>
            <li> The color makes the hair a little more stiff.</li>
            <li> This works really well even on dark hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need that much application to make the color noticeable, even if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> not so much for dark hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to use it for the tips only, but some of the advertisement pictures you see that show people with a full head of hair chalked up is unrealistic.</li>
            <li> And it will turn out brighter as it dries than it seems while it&#x27;s wet, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re going for a more subtle look.</li>
            <li> it is exactly how is advertised and is very easy to use as long as you aren&#x27;t afraid of a little work</li>
            <li> We went with the blue and purple and the colors were vivid on my redheaded and ashbrown little girls.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and the first time I used this it didn&#x27;t work at all (but made a big mess!)</li>
            <li> These chalks are so solid and will not work on dry hair at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hair chalks before and because these looked the same I assumed they were the same.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained that the color came out after brushing, but I really like that it does.</li>
            <li> In order for it to work on my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair her hair had to be wet.  </li>
            <li> It also says it works on dry or damp hair, how about only REALLY wet hair.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on dry hair</li>
            <li> Your hair does look dry after it&#x27;s set in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of work and it makes your hair feel really dry.</li>
            <li> I found out you have to apply it to dry air and dip the chalk in watch then put it on.</li>
            <li> It makes it A TON easier than putting the dry chalk on dry hair... which doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> And makes your hair really dry.</li>
            <li> I tried red, yellow, and green.</li>
            <li> However, two hours later, she is in tears, chalk running down her hands, face, neck, on the walls, floor sink,</li>
            <li> Wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I asked her why she was making such a mess</li>
            <li> With dry hair I just wet some hair where I want a streak of about an inch wide and color.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not willing to try another way after the mess this left.  </li>
            <li> Hair needs to be wet when applied.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no color comes off the chalks and onto the hair.</li>
            <li> The trick is to WET THE CHALK.</li>
            <li> We just wet the chalk and colored it on.  </li>
            <li> Came a lot sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Wet hair instead of chalk</li>
            <li> I did go with the &amp;#34;wet chalk&amp;#34; technique with the hair wet</li>
            <li> Not what expected...</li>
            <li> These really do not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> so expected delays.</li>
            <li> and that was with her hair wet.</li>
            <li> I do have dark hair, and it recommends using white before a color to make it show up, But I wasn&#x27;t able to get any color on my hair :(</li>
            <li> This product showed no real results.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful and wash everything off immediately.  </li>
            <li> I colored my wet hair with the colors, and I could see them.  </li>
            <li> would not advice anyone to purchase this, especially if you have dark or black hair.</li>
            <li> you actually need to wet your hair for the color to work, and it is very messy and a pain to do.</li>
            <li> Had to rub really hard on hair and then u could barely see any color..</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had other brands which worked well, but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Going off other reviews, I ordered this one even though I had not used hair chalk before.</li>
            <li> and I had to assure her that I would find the other brand for her (that we used before) and replace this set.  </li>
            <li> Like any other chalk.</li>
            <li> the colors are all over the other chalk sticks.  </li>
            <li> Once the hair is wet, I ran the chalk down the strand of hair until I got the desired color I wanted.</li>
            <li> This does not work and I followed the directions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> I was coloring very wet otherwise</li>
            <li> Same as the small pack I bought they arrived with some of them broken and again they were the colors Red &amp; Blue</li>
            <li> Your hair must be very wet and the colors get all over everything.</li>
            <li> We were kind of disappointed by how small they were though.</li>
            <li> It plain didn&#x27;t work with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this dispite some reviews saying it will not work on dark hair.</li>
            <li> Putting a small streak of color in my grey hair brightens my day.</li>
            <li> They are now stuck in a drawer, not worth the cost of returning.</li>
            <li> If u have dark hair you will have problems coloring  </li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that not one chalk was broken when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I know, I have it running down my hands, arms, legs, counter and walls.  </li>
            <li> I had to run it up and down my daughters hair about 6 times just to see a change</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to apply and you need to stay away from ware while it&#x27;s in, but it does technically add color.</li>
            <li> Now, it looks like a black, almost, in my hair.</li>
            <li> Even the black chalk could be seen in my hair, so it will work on all colors.</li>
            <li> My little sister has black hair.</li>
            <li> Is my first time buying a hair chalk and unfortunately this one is not effective.</li>
            <li> Its not for little kids anyways...</li>
            <li> It might help a little.</li>
            <li> It took a little effort to get the chalk off the wall and sink and our skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to figure out how to make it stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money-this is not hair chalk.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple washes to get the green out.</li>
            <li> I used a few of the blues and pinks in my hair.</li>
            <li> They should write on the pack &amp;#34;only for blondes&amp;#34; waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I can put in a few streaks of color to match any outfit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were only a couple of chalk pieces that arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews on how to apply this we went with a &amp;#34;wet chalk&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But with a few notes to self:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I say messy, it is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I just used these to go out a few nights ago</li>
            <li> Pull the chalk through your hair with the chalk firmly gripped between your finders so it makes contact to the end.  </li>
            <li> Super disappointed, since I saved them for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, and now can&#x27;t return them.</li>
            <li> I reseved the package in a tight small pouch, when i opened it</li>
            <li> Not easy for kids to use.</li>
            <li> Fun - crazy hair day during summer for the kids!</li>
            <li> These are a little hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Pretty Disappointed...</li>
            <li> but since I work in an office I wanted to look professional at work as well, this let&#x27;s me have it both ways and have some crazy color for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very messy</li>
            <li> It does not come in the pictured box, those are not the colors you get they lean more to the pale yellows and pale blues and ugly ugly brown colors.  </li>
            <li> hair chalk is hard to use and messy!</li>
            <li> I tried repeatedly to use this product and ended up throwing it out - it was awkward to use and barely showed up</li>
            <li> Also since the chalk is thin it can snap in half on you.</li>
            <li> Difficult to work with and the colors are not vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Hardly shows up on brown hair.</li>
            <li> These were extremely hard to use.</li>
            <li> And You have to pre lighten dark hair before use!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing &amp; a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> (she has dirty blonde colored hair).</li>
            <li> At least know how to use the product and if there is a problem with it a # to call.</li>
            <li> The advertisement has you thinking at least your hair would have some noticeable color in it, well let me tell you it does not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I filed a complaint and they immediately contacted me regarding the matter.</li>
            <li> i had a few broken pieces of chalk.</li>
            <li> Use gloves when working with this stuff and also prepare to have your flat iron get dirty.</li>
            <li> Im not trying to be mean but seeing parent gripe because it wont come out of their 9 year olds hair..</li>
            <li> I see the other reviews and figure I must be doing something wrong, but I have not figured out what yet.</li>
            <li> The only problem is they turn her neck the color of the chalk, and it is very difficult to get off.  </li>
            <li> arrival, one color stick was missing out of the crate and one was just slightly chipped but nothing too bad to complain about.</li>
            <li> It looks terrible and now have to go to the salon to get the pink dyed back out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Its common sense!</li>
            <li> But, the colors shown in the photo are not what we got, so that was frustrating.</li>
            <li> but i got alot of broken pieces</li>
            <li> None of them showed up broken, all in tact</li>
            <li> This has been an awkward past couple days in my office.</li>
            <li> We have the goods and it is smashed  and its arrived in a deplorable state and late</li>
            <li> Unless you have completely white hair, this chalk is terrible.</li>
            <li> Maybe this was the wrong way to go</li>
            <li> The shipment took over a month and is very poor product.</li>
            <li> I just received today, and my daughter will be VERY disappointed when she gets home, just like other reviews wrote, it is art chalk, NOT for hair.</li>
            <li> she over looked the disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted to put some crazy color in my hair</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t recommend you use it on the roots of your hair; this makes brushing your hair almost impossible.</li>
            <li> Disappointed  </li>
            <li> That makes me very unhappy.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair look like crap</li>
            <li> I hate it, this does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this stuff my kid hated it</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed with this product, it was a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> this product was horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Difficult to work with and the colors are not vibrant.  Hardly shows up on brown hair. Not easy for kids to use.</li>
            <li> The colors did not work at all on hair but got everywhere else! Very messy + break very easy. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> grand daughter loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Worked really well.  Hair needs to be wet when applied.  Could have had more bright colors in the pack instead of 3 shades of browm</li>
            <li> These do not work at all!  Absolutely no color comes off the chalks and onto the hair. Super disappointed, since I saved them for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, and now can&#x27;t return them. We&#x27;ve had other brands which worked well, but this is not one of them. Do not waste your money on these!</li>
            <li> Unless you have completely white hair, this chalk is terrible.</li>
            <li> they are not very big but okay just for fun. the majority of colors don&#x27;t really show and a lot of them break easy.</li>
            <li> This does not work and I followed the directions very carefully.  I tried using it on dry hair and it did not work.  I tried misting my daughter&#x27;s hair with water and it did not wok.  I&#x27;ve given up on this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money-this is not hair chalk.  I just received today, and my daughter will be VERY disappointed when she gets home, just like other reviews wrote, it is art chalk, NOT for hair.</li>
            <li> These hair chalks arrived yesterday, after waiting only two days! When I opened the package, I was glad to see that all of the chalk was in tact. The first thing that I did was look up a hair chalk tutorial on YouTube. After watching how to do it, I tried it, and these hair chalks worked great, even on my dark brown hair! My mom also tried these chalks on her hair, and she likes them (she has dirty blonde colored hair). Some people complained that the color came out after brushing, but I really like that it does. I brushed my hair yesterday, and most of my hair color came out. Now, it looks like a black, almost, in my hair. Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and the first time I used this it didn&#x27;t work at all (but made a big mess!) so I gave up and put them away. Determined, I decided to give it another shot and it worked! The trick is to WET THE CHALK. You can spritz your hair too of course, but also put some on the chalk. I didn&#x27;t bother twisting my hair since it just made things more complicated. I stroked the color in a downward (only) motion and my hair picked it right up. I tried red, yellow, and green. I recommend planning your colors ahead of time so you don&#x27;t stain your lighter colors with more prominent colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On arrival, one color stick was missing out of the crate and one was just slightly chipped but nothing too bad to complain about. I think better packaging could have prevented that from happening.  Also since the chalk is thin it can snap in half on you. Use gloves when working with this stuff and also prepare to have your flat iron get dirty. Your hair does look dry after it&#x27;s set in. Perhaps try spraying it with oil sheen might help (I didn&#x27;t try it so I don&#x27;t know). It took a couple washes to get the green out. I plan to experiment more with them later.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this item for a church event during the end of October. We had a salon room set up for the kids, and I was looking for a fun, cheaper way to color children&#x27;s hair for the night. Going off other reviews, I ordered this one even though I had not used hair chalk before. I received the package in great timing and the items were intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several attempts to make the chalk work, I finally realized how to make it work well. I needed to make the section of hair I was coloring very wet otherwise the chalk won&#x27;t show up. Once the hair is wet, I ran the chalk down the strand of hair until I got the desired color I wanted. Then I let it air-dry. Sealing it with a heat does help but it is not necessary. Sealing it with hairspray will work for the time you want it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair, and the colors showed up great! Even the black chalk could be seen in my hair, so it will work on all colors. It washed out the next day, using shampoo and conditioner, and it did not seem to stain any clothes, skin or pillow cases. I had one case in which leader with blond hair use the chalk, and it took a week to fade out, but it did wash out. I would recommend using gloves if you are coloring lots of hair for an event, because the chalk comes off on the fingers. Yet it washes out easily with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both boys and girls enjoyed this product. No complaints from parents. We had around 1000 people at this event, and the chalk looks barely used after all the hair we colored. It can last many colorings, price is good, and I liked the product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This hair chalk looked like a great idea, but it made a giant mess and did not make a dent in the color of my very dark hair. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Disappointed  There are no instructions anything receive was in Chinese. and I purposely bought one from someone in America and it felt like the product was from here. At least know how to use the product and if there is a problem with it a # to call.</li>
            <li> Crappy. Doesn&#x27;t even work unless you soak the pastels which is not how it&#x27;s supposed to work. The feel of it is really gross too it makes your hair look like crap</li>
            <li> This product permanently dyed my hair! Don&#x27;t use if you want it to wash out. It looks terrible and now have to go to the salon to get the pink dyed back out of my hair. This has been an awkward past couple days in my office. Rainbow hair is not an appropriate look!</li>
            <li> Fun - crazy hair day during summer for the kids! Some colors work better on lighter hair vs darker. But overall exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions in the package, so once I figured out that I have to spray water on the hair to make the chalk work, it was fine, but very messy to work with.  It probably works best on very light hair.</li>
            <li> Ok for one Don&#x27;t use the chalk on your kids hair.. Its not for little kids anyways... And You have to pre lighten dark hair before use!!! I don&#x27;t know why people don&#x27;t understand that. Its common sense! If you want any of it to show up use white and the put the color on on top of it. It might help a little. Im not trying to be mean but seeing parent gripe because it wont come out of their 9 year olds hair..DONT USE IT ON YOUR KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im a hair stylist been doing it for 5 years I know some stuff...</li>
            <li> I bought this dispite some reviews saying it will not work on dark hair. I have black hair and it looks really good. I also used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is medium brown. The colors are very vividly and very pretty. I will be ordering more. This product rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave color in your hair and gets gooey. Don&#x27;t bother with this stuff my kid hated it and we ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only made in China but the packaging is labeled all in Chineese.  Wasn&#x27;t sure it was what I ordered.  Very concerned about the toxicity of the product coming from China, given their recent history with toxic toys!! You should inform cutomers better!!!</li>
            <li> My little sister has black hair. I have a red-blond color in my hair. We both used this chalk and the bright colors show up well in her hair (not so much the dark colors of course) and the whole color range works pretty well in my hair. There are a lot of different colors to pick from so it&#x27;s easy for everyone to use. When applying to your hair it may get on stuff (like your hands and the bathroom sink) but since it&#x27;s chalk it&#x27;s really easy to clean up. After applying heat it seems to be working really well at staying in.</li>
            <li> Works well when hair is wet, colors are more vibrant if white is used first.  Chalk can be set with some hairspray to help color last longer.  Otherwise, a simple wash removes all traces of color.  Perfect for the 5-12 year old set.</li>
            <li> Is my first time buying a hair chalk and unfortunately this one is not effective. It doesnt stays on my hair. There&#x27;s no instructions. Ot just dont work.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t come with any instructions, and they did not color my daughters hair at all...</li>
            <li> I have gray hair. What a wonderful canvas this is for my hair. I stopped dyeing my hair last year with permanent dyes. But now when I want a quick pick me up to go with an outfit, I use this. I&#x27;ve used all of the colors and many times in combination with others. When It&#x27;s time to go to work on Monday morning, a quick shampoo and I&#x27;m Mrs. Gray again (literally).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these for my kids, my grandkids or the neighbors. I bought them for me. They are good fun! Putting a small streak of color in my grey hair brightens my day. No worries.. it washes right out.</li>
            <li> I have light brown to a blondish hair color. I used a few of the blues and pinks in my hair. First off this is like a chalk kit for artists. That&#x27;s all it looks like. No directions either. Second when you apply it to your hair, either you have to dig the chalk into your scalp or rub the chalk on your hand and then put color onto hair. Either way its a nightmare! Didn&#x27;t color well at all!! Most of it comes out after first wash. But it destroyed my hair and left some color in for longer than 5 days. My hair felt chalky for a week! And I ended up just dying my hair just to get rid of the color streaks that refused to come out.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved these.  The only problem is they turn her neck the color of the chalk, and it is very difficult to get off.  Also, they don&#x27;t completely fade out when she washes her hair.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter  it came in perfect condition and she loves it, very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I bought these to try to temporarily put colored streaks in my hair for a Halloween costume and they did absolutely nothing!  I have light blonde hair and the colors didn&#x27;t even show up in the least.  Very disappointing &amp; a complete waste of money. Hopefully these will work better for someone&#x27;s art projects.. giving them away to a friend.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dark brown hair and the pink, purple, blue and green all show up great.  Orange took a bit more work but we got it to show up too.  Those are the only colors we have tried so far but it was easy.  We just wet the chalk and colored it on.  My 9 yr old thought it was great!</li>
            <li> These did not act like hair chalk.  In order for it to work on my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair her hair had to be wet.  And then the &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; did not wash out for about 3 weeks.  It acted more like an acrylic than chalk.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend these for hair.</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from. Can&#x27;t wait to try each color! It&#x27;s gonna be a fun summer playing with these.</li>
            <li> I hate it, this does not work at all. would not advice anyone to purchase this, especially if you have dark or black hair. They should write on the pack &amp;#34;only for blondes&amp;#34; waste of time and money</li>
            <li> To get the best color on dark hair, it is recommended you wet your hair. However,I found I got better results by weting my hair and soaking the chalk itself. Some colors work better than others so you just gotta be ready to experiment.  I recommend this for highlighting but not to do a large portion of your hair.  It&#x27;s a lot of work and it makes your hair feel really dry.</li>
            <li> Too dry for the hair and break easy</li>
            <li> Good products, Although there are things that should improve,If I had more attachment would be perfect</li>
            <li> My teenage daugther wanted this for christmas so we got it for her.  You have to wet your hair first and it feels like your hair being pulled out your head as the chalk is being applied. It isnt really that viberant in the hair. It was really just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This works really well even on dark hair. My little sister was really excited when she got these. We were kind of disappointed by how small they were though. Wish they would have been bigger. Came a lot sooner than expected</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work as well on dry hair but great on damp or wet hair. The color makes the hair a little more stiff. Put in rollers in damp hair and colored each tuft of hair a different color then put on roller. I am a natural blonde and all the color except for a tinge of pink and blue washed out. Another shampoo and it was all gone. With dry hair I just wet some hair where I want a streak of about an inch wide and color. I can put in a few streaks of color to match any outfit. Really fun.</li>
            <li> I was thinking I wanted to do something fun for my girly girls without permanently changing their hair color.  When I discovered hair chalk, I thought &amp;#34;woo hoo!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were only a couple of chalk pieces that arrived broken.  The colors looked bright and the selection was good.  After reading a few reviews on how to apply this we went with a &amp;#34;wet chalk&amp;#34; option.  Maybe this was the wrong way to go but I&#x27;m not willing to try another way after the mess this left.  It stained my fingers and the counter.  The chalk didn&#x27;t stay just in the hair either.  It came off on my kids face/back/neck/clothes (depending on where in their hair I put it).  The chalk colors were pretty on the hair.  We went with the blue and purple and the colors were vivid on my redheaded and ashbrown little girls.  Maybe in a couple of months I&#x27;ll be willing to try this again but in a different manner.  But with a few notes to self:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wear gloves (rubber gloves made for hair dying)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Try using hairspray to help set the chalk&lt;br /&gt;3.  Wet hair instead of chalk (we&#x27;ll see if this option works better)</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying my seller was awesome.  The product was not damaged and came quickly.  Using the product was interesting, it took some getting used to and some trial and error.  I have very light hair and parts did stain but nothing so serious that it looks like it from every angle, pretty much you can tell on the tips that I used the pink at some point (this is 2 weeks later) if you are really looking and are standing in sunlight. This product was perfect for the funky fun I wanted in my life on my vacation.  I work in a very professional environment so having something that allows me to play and then just wash out was nice. I loved it.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it, works well on hair. Gonna buy some more</li>
            <li> I reseved the package in a tight small pouch, when i opened it i had a few broken pieces of chalk. They are smaller to begin with.</li>
            <li> First of all, it stiffens your hair like hairspray so be sure to style it while wet because it&#x27;s a huge pain to brush through it afterwards. Also, I don&#x27;t recommend you use it on the roots of your hair; this makes brushing your hair almost impossible. I did go with the &amp;#34;wet chalk&amp;#34; technique with the hair wet and it was really easy to apply, but be sure to dry it asap because otherwise the color gets on everything. However, wetting the chalk seemed to make the chalk run out faster. And it will turn out brighter as it dries than it seems while it&#x27;s wet, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re going for a more subtle look. You don&#x27;t need that much application to make the color noticeable, even if you have dark hair. I&#x27;m willing to use it for the tips only, but some of the advertisement pictures you see that show people with a full head of hair chalked up is unrealistic.</li>
            <li> The grandkids have enough toys so this was a great alternative.  They really enjoyed making colors in their hair.  They have had lots of fun and so far no stain on the carpet either very important.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old, who has begged me for the last 6 months to get her &amp;#34;hair chalk&amp;#34;.  So, I gave in and bought the 24 piece set thinking this would be a wonderful Christmas gift for her.  I let her open it early and she was so ecstatic, she could not wait to open it up and get started. I let her open the gift as an early Christmas present, but when she opened up the box, a lot of the chalk sticks were in pieces.  She was so excited, she over looked the disappointment.  However, two hours later, she is in tears, chalk running down her hands, face, neck, on the walls, floor sink, mirror- I was in shock.  I asked her why she was making such a mess and she said it didn&#x27;t work.  I thought she just did not know what she was doing, so I tried to do it for her.  Next thing I know, I have it running down my hands, arms, legs, counter and walls.  Ok, so its extremely messy to do, but does it work.  No, it does not.  You could not even see even the slightest tint to her hair.  She has light brown hair and has used other chalk brands in her hair and worked fine.  She cried for over an hour and I had to assure her that I would find the other brand for her (that we used before) and replace this set.  Let me be clear, when I say messy, it is an understatement.  It was a disaster.  We followed the simple instructions and the chalk seemed better for coloring skin more than hair.  The only good thing I have to say is that it did not stain anything that I can see.  It took a little effort to get the chalk off the wall and sink and our skin but, hot her hairâ€¦it was super easy because the chalk barely stuck to her hair.  I hope if you are looking at this review, you consider your purpose.  If you are buying it to color hair you are wasting your time and money.  If you are buying it to use in coloring books or art projects it would probably work better.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Like any other chalk. Lasts momentarily. Still a fun product for girls. Good buy</li>
            <li> you actually need to wet your hair for the color to work, and it is very messy and a pain to do.</li>
            <li> this product was horrible. It did not work, I accidently pushed the &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; button twice and received 2 of these items. So I have 2 chalk pallets that don&#x27;t work. please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These look very vibrant. However, I can&#x27;t get a smidgeon of color to transfer onto my hair. Wet or dry. I see the other reviews and figure I must be doing something wrong, but I have not figured out what yet. Someone posted you have to rough up the coating on the outside of the chalk first, but I have not been successfull with that. I guess I will try sandpaper. If I can get it to work- I will update this review. I really want it to work since the colors look awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to figure out how to make it stay in your hair. I am a blonde so my hair picked up all the colors very easily. I found out you have to apply it to dry air and dip the chalk in watch then put it on. It makes it A TON easier than putting the dry chalk on dry hair... which doesn&#x27;t work. Once you figure it out it&#x27;s super fun!!! LOVE IT and was a great deal for the reasonable price! Seller shipped two days earlier than what was expected : )</li>
            <li> Not what expected... didn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> These really do not work well at all.  They are now stuck in a drawer, not worth the cost of returning.</li>
            <li> These are a gift for my girls, so we have not used them yet, but they are soooo much larger than another brand I purchased, &amp; I was extremely pleased! Each chalk is about the size of my finger, so I am impressed. They arrived in a sealed package which I opened to make sure they were not broken. They are all intact &amp; I can not wait to see my kids faces when they receive them. I will have to update after they receive them to comment on use &amp; how vibrant the colors are.</li>
            <li> They worked pretty well on both mine and my boyfriend&#x27;s hair for halloween. But, the colors shown in the photo are not what we got, so that was frustrating.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, i love it. The hair chalk is very fun and easy to use. It was just as described.(:</li>
            <li> It looked like I spilled jello in my hair.....</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my girls, they work great and fun to use without using permanent color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to apply and you need to stay away from ware while it&#x27;s in, but it does technically add color. My son loves it, but as a hairstylist I am somewhat less enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> We have the goods and it is smashed  and its arrived in a deplorable state and late and there is no any information about the stages of access</li>
            <li> I love that I can have different hair color every day. Only thing is it kind of fades fast. And makes your hair really dry. Other than that its cool stuff. Im blonde so shows up in my hair really good.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for a friend and she loved it. Thank you! Shipped from China so expected delays. Other than that it was good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t show up in my daughters light blonde hair at all.</li>
            <li> Pretty Disappointed...I have used many pastel chalk dyes in my daughters hair. These were extremely hard to use. So much so I had to grind them into a powder form and put them in a spray bottle with water to get any real color. Forget doing a strand or two. I had to run it up and down my daughters hair about 6 times just to see a change and that was with her hair wet. It plain didn&#x27;t work with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really show up very well on my nieces hair, but she loved the gift anyway. She has light red hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. These chalks are so solid and will not work on dry hair at all! I tried damp hair as per instructions and still, they did not work. I do have dark hair, and it recommends using white before a color to make it show up, But I wasn&#x27;t able to get any color on my hair :(</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  It does not come in the pictured box, those are not the colors you get they lean more to the pale yellows and pale blues and ugly ugly brown colors.  The chalk isn&#x27;t solid it&#x27;s powdery and the colors are all over the other chalk sticks.  I through it in the trash.  I bought this product before and it was awesome, same as this picture with the same colors but now I can&#x27;t find it. Just don&#x27;t order from this company, they are in Hong Kong I believe (not that that matters I guess) but that&#x27;s how I will remember the product so I don&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> I just used these to go out a few nights ago and I have already received so many compliments. Make sure to try a swatch on your hair before going to high up just in case it doesn&#x27;t wash out. I have brown to blonde ombre hair and it washed out after two washes the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use. I have blonde hair, so i don&#x27;t even have to wet it first. It is not very bright, have to use it a lot to get desired effect, but still good to use for fun.</li>
            <li> it is exactly how is advertised and is very easy to use as long as you aren&#x27;t afraid of a little work</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that not one chalk was broken when it arrived.  This is fun stuff to experiment with.</li>
            <li> This product showed no real results. Had to rub really hard on hair and then u could barely see any color..</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t transfer color we&#x27;ll. hair has to be damp for these to work, and if I get my hair damp, then it will frizz so these didn&#x27;t work for me at all. My daughter has light brown hair, and the colors barely showed up.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old loves these hair chalks. What is interesting is that she doesn&#x27;t use them for her own hair. She uses them for her barbies hair, shampoos it out and starts again.</li>
            <li> Finally used this.  Get the hair wet first - the wetter the better the chalk works.  I just sprayed the hair.  Was using on dirty blonde hair - color showed best on the blondest parts.  The only two colors that were great were the hot pink, bright teal, orange and one of the reds .  Some of the other colors just didn&#x27;t show up too great.  The price is good on these but I would be careful about buying on them counting on them for a particular purpose.  I had hoped to do some purple streaks for a costume but after using this I just ended up buying some fake pieces to put in because I didn&#x27;t think this would have the bright effect I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Same as the small pack I bought they arrived with some of them broken and again they were the colors Red &amp; Blue that were broken.&lt;br /&gt;  Paul</li>
            <li> Although I do not know if that is what hair chalk is, the package is very clearly stating the contents are for regular chalk drawing for art classes. Again, this might work, but I wish it would have been packages to specify it was meant for hair.</li>
            <li> What I received was not at all what was pictured. These are not hair chalks they are normal pastels. The shipment took over a month and is very poor product.</li>
            <li> If u have dark hair you will have problems coloring  you&#x27;re hair,  but if you have light hair its really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and it **basically washes right out of your hair! (Some of the darker colors require two washes to come out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so fun and easy to use. I always wanted to put some crazy color in my hair but since I work in an office I wanted to look professional at work as well, this let&#x27;s me have it both ways and have some crazy color for the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This arrived today and there was no mention of \\&quot;hair\\&quot; anywhere.  It is simply artistic chalk.  Fine, but it should not be billed as temporary hair dye chalk.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is light brown.  The color showed up okay, after using white first and wetting the chalk as suggested.  But there are no directions about applying it to hair and there are no applicators, etc.  It is just chalk, that you can rub on your hair.  The description is misleading.  It is not made for hair and clearly, application to hair was not contemplated.  The box simply says \\&quot;Masters Pastel\\&quot; with nothing more.</li>
            <li> The best product the chalk did not come broken its so amazing I put some purple in my hair and stayed there it does not fade I love it!!!!! I don&#x27;t regreat buying this</li>
            <li> These are a little hard to use.  Your hair must be very wet and the colors get all over everything. You need to be careful and wash everything off immediately.  Pull the chalk through your hair with the chalk firmly gripped between your finders so it makes contact to the end.  I&#x27;ve used other hair chalks before and because these looked the same I assumed they were the same.  The colors are vibrant and there is a nice variety but it takes repeated use to get the depth you want. The price is reasonable so I think this item is fair for what you pay for.  Personally, for the convenience I&#x27;d get the more expensive set next time and not worry about the fuss.</li>
            <li> The advertisement has you thinking at least your hair would have some noticeable color in it, well let me tell you it does not work. It also says it works on dry or damp hair, how about only REALLY wet hair. They say you only need a the old shirt while applying, my daughters shirt was very noticeable blue. That ws the only bright colors I have seen. She was very disappointed with this product, it was a gift for Christmas. That makes me very unhappy.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for my kids who always want to dye their hair different colors. It goes on really bright and then fade by the end of the day. So if you want continuous bright color you will have to reapply everyday. But my girls love them and so do I bc they don&#x27;t have harmful dyes every month.</li>
            <li> I just got mine idk how well it works but i got alot of broken pieces</li>
            <li> I colored my wet hair with the colors, and I could see them.  I then used a hot iron to dry the hair.  The only problem was, the chalk came off with the hot iron.</li>
            <li> I have darker hair so it didn&#x27;t show up extremely well the first few times but after watching some reviews on how to make the color pop (use white first) I was able to make it really pretty! Thanks. None of them showed up broken, all in tact but if they weren&#x27;t they were still usable.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Always wanted to have these colors in my hair just not permanent!! Now I have the best of both!!! Woot woot</li>
            <li> Took some trial and error but the effect was just what we needed for my daughters Halloween Costume.  The best part it is came right out with the next shower.</li>
            <li> The colors didn&#x27;t wow me like I thought they would. I still need to find the time to play around with them and figure out how to get them to show up on my highlighted blond hair.</li>
            <li> These where so worth the money! So much fun and they work well!</li>
            <li> Great for light hair.... not so much for dark hair.</li>
            <li> hair chalk is hard to use and messy!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and like got it really cheap as an add-on order. Great as a stocking stuffer or at an expensive gift for a tween girl</li>
            <li> The product was labeled hair chalk but when i received the product it contained pastel art tools. The colors wouldn&#x27;t even transfer to my hair!</li>
            <li> You need to make sure your hair is wet and use gloves, then dry it. Wear a T shirt or towel that you dont mind getting the chalk on.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great!!</li>
            <li> We received the chalk, not the hair styling tools, which is why we ordered this one as oppose to the others that are available. My daughter wanted the styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filed a complaint and they immediately contacted me regarding the matter. The chalk works great.</li>
            <li> There were no directions or suggestion of how to use this product.  Luckily my nieces were familiar with hair chalk &amp; already knew how to use it as there is a wet &amp; dry method.</li>
            <li> I got it beacuse i wanted a new loook and it worked so now i chalk mt hair like every day such a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my friends daughter. It is VERY MESSY, but Very cute when finished! Make sure you get the chalk wet, and you have damp hair before applying, then style as usual. Stayed in all day and while she slept!!</li>
            <li> I tried repeatedly to use this product and ended up throwing it out - it was awkward to use and barely showed up</li>
            <li> We used this product as a fund raiser. The colors were great and the chalk was easy to use. (hint: wear gloves)</li>
