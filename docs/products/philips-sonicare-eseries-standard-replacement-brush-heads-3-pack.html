            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Works great with my Elite that is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Manual toothbrushes are fine, but having a brush that ensures you get 2 minutes of brushing is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive, compact and light weight.</li>
            <li>Great fit.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine sonicare tooth brush head and it works great.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>enjoy the price offered and get great oral are as well.</li>
            <li>Find these replacement heads through Amazon is a great value, just make sure you buy them from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>Performance is spectacular.</li>
            <li>If you own a sonicare you know it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice toiletry luxury</li>
            <li>Really effective in getting teeth clean...especially around the gum line.</li>
            <li>Nice, trouble-free product.</li>
            <li>But found these for quite a reasonable price so I am very, very happy!!!</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for 10 years now, and have never had that kind of experience with any replacement head that I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
            <li>Great product, great service, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Good brush though :)</li>
            <li>And have really liked them.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads I&#x27;ve always used before this are kind of clunky and ridged.  </li>
            <li>that to the fact that the Sonicare was recommended to me by one dentist, and has led to many tooth cleanings at which the hygienist marvels at how good my teeth look.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve bought a Sonicare Eseries toothbrush, you&#x27;ve already made the choice of what kind of replacement head you&#x27;re going to end up buying.</li>
            <li>Nice...</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement; very robust cleaning</li>
            <li>Really Amazon has the best price I have found for these things.</li>

            <li>Authentic Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li>Nothing cleans your teeth better.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare electric  tooth brush for years and am more than pleased.</li>
            <li>Dentist visits have been way better since using Sonicare.</li>
            <li>-- they work much, much better.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for many years and decided to save some money on brush heads</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>I love the way this brush cleans.</li>
            <li>In 2012, the bristles and the part number changed (without explanation -- I love that), and the price went up to $19.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I always shop around for a better price...</li>
            <li>Even though I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, I have for many years used this.</li>
            <li>love my sonic care toothbrush; they hold up well for the 3 months</li>
            <li>These are much better</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Love these, the imitations just dont compare.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with these brush heads, and have been subscribing for years with Amazon, to receive a shipment every 6 months, in order to change my brush head every 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Very happy and will consider same source when I need to replace again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for replacement heads for my Sonicare toothbrush for a while and finally found them at a great price!</li>
            <li>I glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>Better check up since I got it.</li>
            <li>Buyer beware and be sure you are getting authentic Phillips Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li>works perfectly with floss used daily</li>
            <li>More affordable than the ones sold in stores.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE A LOT MORE MONEY.  </li>
            <li>I have used Philips Sonicare for many years and have had to deal with water getting inside the instrument, but I have never seen anything like rusting in the brush section.  </li>
            <li>I try to order them through subscribe and save because it makes them much more affordable.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and love the fact that we can have the heads automatically delivered to us every 3 months via Amazon subscribe-and-save.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon, and I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Okay, so here is what I don&#x27;t like, mold.  </li>
            <li>use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
            <li>I had to grab a 6 pack at Costco to test against it and those worked way better.</li>
            <li>Buy the authentic Phillips replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li>You will love them.</li>
            <li>then you should get your replacement brush heads here, At Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>I love the sonicare</li>
            <li>That may be a bit of overkill intended to sell brush heads, but I realize now that they do need to be replaced much more often than every three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before changing to the Sonicare, I had used another brand of battery-operated brush found in drugstores.</li>
            <li>My kids love the Philips Sonicare itself.  </li>
            <li>and I was very happy to only have to purchase the replacement brushes!</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Have used nothing else for fifteen years and my healthy teeth attest to that fact.</li>
            <li>I would suggest it to everybody that wants to use a elect tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare - I switched to sonicare from oral b based on a family members recommendation.  </li>
            <li>i love that they have changed the packaging and that I can now get these replacement heads a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the preliminary results.</li>
            <li>These ones seem to shake more than the originals that came with it even though they are supposed to be OEM.</li>
            <li>The Brush Head was okay</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Whats not to love.  </li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>so I was glad I could order them online</li>
            <li>I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love this product, keeps the teeth</li>
            <li>I spend more time brushing now.</li>
            <li>are better than none.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than retailat a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li>No too pleased.</li>
            <li>These are cheapest here and at Costco, but at Costco you have to buy like 1,928 of them at once, and I just don&#x27;t have that many teeth.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the brush heads, the price, and the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>helps me replace more often.  </li>
            <li>so I will plan better.</li>
            <li>o d love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for many years.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>Surely recommend them.</li>
            <li>I love the ease and convenience, just remember to change the heads every 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li>These fit perfectly and work far better than the originals they replace.</li>
            <li>The vibration seems more vigorous and the shaped bristles reach better between the teeth.</li>
            <li>These are perfect replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare, but although the write-up said something about no-hassle packaging, it almost takes a chain saw to open the plastic and get the heads out.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with the Philips E Series brush heads.</li>
            <li>What more can you say about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sonic care toothbrushes for over 5 years now and love em.</li>
            <li>the sonic care tooth brush replacement works better than the&lt;br /&gt;generic brands.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates on the holder much better than the&lt;br /&gt;generic brand.  </li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare and love that I can get the replacement heads at a good price delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>so they better be good, right?  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are very useful and effective.</li>
            <li>Once I figured out the right technique of using this toothbrush, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Eventually even with the amazing feel of the electronic brush, my teeth would not be clean after a thorough brush.</li>
            <li>First time after many good replacement orders.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just what is pictured, and what came with the original Sonicare!</li>
            <li>In addition, the toothbrush itself remains strong even after many years of use.</li>
            <li>More vibration, better clean, better debris removal...</li>
            <li>Said cleaning for him was easy and asked how I kept my teeth so healthy and</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are a perfect fit, but they are poorer quality than earlier versions in that the bristles are softer.</li>
            <li>These heads are a perfect fit and now my toothbrushing has never been the same!</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done brushing, my teeth feel really clean!  </li>
            <li>am enjoying this fine product, the brushes are of quality proportions.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after brushing!</li>
            <li>terrific product wife and i have been using it for years every day it does a very good job cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of stocking up if more are still available.</li>
            <li>Read description to make sure it will fit yours.</li>
            <li>No  longer available in stores, so I was glad to find it</li>
            <li>These worked really well and a good price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good quality.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for good service and pricing.</li>
            <li>so we always have fresh brushes when we should - something that we would not have if we had to remember to replace them on our own.</li>
            <li>The right kind of replacement brush for my sonic are brush.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed a significant improvement in performance over the used heads.</li>
            <li>I found the price to be the best, compared to other retailers.</li>
            <li>I bought three packs since they were such a good buy!</li>
            <li>It just makes brushing more fun!</li>
            <li>Overall a good buying experience!</li>
            <li>Came very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are easy to interchange.</li>
            <li>It makes our dentist&#x27;s job easy.</li>
            <li>I appreciate how easy it is to change heads on this model.</li>
            <li>Not always easy to find in a retali store.</li>
            <li>it keeps the the clean feel longer and better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>easy to reorder since it comes automatically....</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t seem to vibrate as strongly.  </li>
            <li>I hope they keep making these, because my E-series handle is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Good replacement parts for a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of embarrassed to admit that I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare model HX5300 for about three years, and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve replaced the brush head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;.They work good but should be replaced at 6-8 months to work as new</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re replacement brush-heads, and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>The comes as a two pack and fit easily on the sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This Brush is Fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes work fine with my Sonicare E series toothbrush.</li>
            <li>work fine and</li>
            <li>Works with the unit just fine.</li>
            <li>and the brush is still fine.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>They do a much better job than any normal toothbrush could do on its own.  </li>
            <li>These fit on the Sonicare easily and may be removed for cleaning.</li>
            <li>the replacement brush seem to be fine, they work with our Sonicare machine.  </li>
            <li>Their toothbrush heads and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, brushes teeth, easy to clean and easy to replace brushes.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is of course AWESOME, if a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Super product, better than the original brushes that came with the unit.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try a version sold by Walgreens, but this was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Color coded for two people or save one for later, these are the genuine replacements and work great.</li>
            <li>These are the genuine Sonicare E-Series replacement heads, but the ones I received were not in frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic heads.</li>
            <li>Purchased them to fit my existing E series Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush heads fit my eseries sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Amazon makes it available, and at a discount price.</li>
            <li>and they just don&#x27;t seem to fit or work as the Philips brand.</li>
            <li>Great price--even beats Walmarts low price</li>
            <li>when will these guys start using frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li>When the tide turns, I&#x27;ll be happy to stop imposing on my friends, and switch from Sams back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Design flaw makes it sound like a buzz saw in your head.</li>
            <li>Genuine Philips brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, Walmart now has a line of replacement brush heads (2 pack) designed to fit e-series Sonic holders</li>
            <li>They brush heads fit</li>
            <li>Was worried the head wouldn&#x27;t fit the brush</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re made by Philips I don&#x27;t have to wonder if they&#x27;ll fit the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>powerful, faster or able to leap tall buildings.....</li>
            <li>I will not buy cheap replacements again.</li>
            <li>They work alright and fit on the toothbrush</li>
            <li>But they fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li>The Free shipping with Subscribe and Save is icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>Free Packaging]]&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They fit like a charm onto my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It the genuine article.</li>
            <li>These were a fantastic price and I will continue to purchase them.  </li>
            <li>but the details stated they would fit my model of my Sonicare</li>
            <li>I went out and bought some cheap replacement heads</li>
            <li>The product came promptly and fit my Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit well and made an ungodly noise.  </li>
            <li>The sonicare toothbrush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it works great and feels like it brought some of the power back to my toothbrush</li>
            <li>Changing your toothbrush is important.</li>
            <li>I have bought cheap knockoffs from Walmart and CVS.  </li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon is very convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush as much as one can love a tooth brush.</li>
            <li>good reminder to toss the old one which I often forget to do....</li>
            <li>Good head action.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly pay way too much for these just for the feeling my teeth have after brushing :)</li>
            <li>, I tried the Target equivalent one time and its nowhere near as good as original Philips brand.</li>
            <li>Great product, I order these for my Sonicare toothbrush mainly because Amazon sells them much cheaper</li>
            <li>These are the original brushes by Philips, in original packaging, and therefore work fine.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads fit my Sonicare toothbrush with no problem, and appear to be from the original manufacturer of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It is designed better, to better and more easily brush your back teeth in all areas.  </li>
            <li>overall great product and good price compared to big box storea.</li>
            <li>it works just like the original.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>These are just like the original - they work well and make brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li>I had not updated my brush heads in a long time and what a great difference in the brush feeling against my teeth.</li>
            <li>These are of the original style and you will notice the difference between the two.</li>
            <li>Original equipment</li>
            <li>Bought these as a replacement for the original brush head that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I believe it is an original replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We still use the original model power handle.</li>
            <li>the heads are weaker than the original ones that came with the Sonic, but are usable.  </li>
            <li>Since my dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement heads and I&#x27;m not disappointed in them at all.</li>
            <li>, they work just like the ones that came with the toothbrush originally.</li>
            <li>I receive my item in a more than reasonable amount of time!</li>
            <li>I have an original series.</li>
            <li>Just visited&lt;br /&gt;the dentist and got a very good report, thanks to regular use of floss and my Sonicare brush!</li>
            <li>Always nice to have the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush keeps my teeth clean</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I like the way my teeth feel clean clean after I use this brush.</li>
            <li>They clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>The replacement brush heads were cheap and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve saved me a lot of time and money by keeping my teeth clean and preventing cavities and gum disease.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean again.</li>
            <li>squeaky clean &amp; plaque-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did what it was supposed to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>Works well, but don&#x27;t try to steam clean it.</li>
            <li>well so they clean my teeth well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are clean because of it.</li>
            <li>Aside from the fast vibration, perhaps the most important feature is it times you for a full 2 minutes or so-</li>
            <li>This spin brush spins super-fast, much faster than the first kind of sonicare electric brush I bought.</li>
            <li>Makes me teeth feel super clean and the charge lasts for a while if you take it on vacation.</li>
            <li>Not a lot more to say really.</li>
            <li>The true Sonic-are do not make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li>enjoyed using my sonicare toothbrush so much, that I decided to buy one for my fiancé.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very functional, however, and ingeniously engineered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These heads always work well, and last a good 4 months.</li>
            <li>I might prefer the smaller heads, which is why this is not 5 stars, but if this is what you want, it is a really good price.</li>
            <li>These are top quality and priced much lower than Walmart, Target</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re always top quality, arrive in record time, packaged securely and the prices are always way better than I can get them for locally.</li>
            <li>This a good price for the heads, especially if you go on auto ship.</li>
            <li>The sonicare is alot better, however the brush heads are alot more vs. oral b and does it really need to come with the whole gadget below the brush?  </li>
            <li>really does a good job getting hard to reach areas as well as cleaning your teeth pretty good!</li>
            <li>The new head has a lot more vigorous vibration, so I think it really is important to replace the heads every 6 months, even if the bristles show no wear.</li>
            <li>It seems it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right, that the magnets may be misaligned.</li>
            <li>Bonus is that it&#x27;s a pretty strong magnet in the brush you can hack and use when done with the brush.</li>
            <li>can buy these anywhere but from now on I will only by them from Sun Valley Dental Products as the customer service is outstanding and the guarantee is amazing - thanks Joseph and the Sun Valley crew!</li>
            <li>I think these work better than the one it originally came with new.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>They seem to wear out quickly, but this is just probably how they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li>I guess 2013 isn&#x27;t a lucky number,</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>i bought these replacement lbrush heads for me an dmy wife and we both oved it very much, next time I will buy more and more.</li>
            <li>Received my brushes quickly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if they will fit the old head, but they did.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Great having these on auto-ship as a reminder to change brush heads-cost is much lower than prices at local stores</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and prompt receipt.</li>
            <li>When it came time to replace the head, I was happy to find Amazon had these at a much lower cost than my local brick-and-mortar stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value, fit just right, big difference when brushes are new!</li>
            <li>and now I am buying the right and original ones....</li>
            <li>fact that I used the original brush head for three years is testimony to the durability of the brush, but I recommend replacing the brush heads much more frequently than that.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this toothbrush the replacements seem to fit well.  </li>
            <li>Like it&#x27;s not the exact fit for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as described, and fit my Sonicare</li>
            <li>That given, I&#x27;m overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and they are the exact fit I need.</li>
            <li>great price for an otherwise overpriced head unit at other stores!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new heads make a HUGE difference compared to my worn out ones!</li>
            <li>sure you HAVE to in the new recommended time period.</li>
            <li>The sonicare system is amazing and my teeth are left amazingly fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>easy to cancel when ready to do cancel</li>
            <li>Just ok the bristle head seemed really small on this one but had a good price.</li>
            <li>And to anyone who is purchasing a Philips Sonicare for the first time - congrats!</li>
            <li>They are higher quality than the original brush my sonicare came with.</li>
            <li>These brushes are the exact replacement ones that came with the original purchase.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush works and last for more than 4 months !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with my new sonicare toothbrush and these replacement brushes are of course the same quality as the one that was provided with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brushes work fine, but the S+H was way to much considering the size and weight.</li>
            <li>These were actually less expensive than Walmart was and are a perfect fit,  Great service from vendor..</li>
            <li>I have purchased several replacement heads from Amazon and most have been fine.  </li>
            <li>I have an old Sonicare Advance (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called?), and these fit the handle just fine.  </li>
            <li>These tooth brushes were exactly as advertised and fit our older Advanced series machine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend highly to anyone interested in keeping their teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>They work very well and are comfortable to use and handle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as before though.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are a case where buying the name-brand is truly worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now and have had no problems of any kind.</li>
            <li>its worth the price</li>
            <li>have been using Sonicare for thirty years or more since we saw Oprah recommend it on her old</li>
            <li>Ok, hear me clearly.  </li>
            <li>They are an improvement over the old series, with a better material for both cleaning and gum massaging.</li>
            <li>kind of expensive but work great</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the month</li>
            <li>Be sure and replace them frequently</li>
            <li>A two pack is essentially/basically a year&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The old brushes looks pretty good until the new ones arrive.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I learned from one of the dental nurses that we should use the sonic brushes in a gentle manner, because of their vibration, its easy to grind teeth faster, than we are generally aware of.</li>
            <li>Worked fine... decent price.  </li>
            <li>SURE THERE ARE OTHER UNITS THAT COULD DO BETTER, BUT</li>
            <li>Not as good as my older one that had 30 second beeps for each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>These are so much louder than the original ones that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good product as expected!</li>
            <li>I was worried about getting the right model but it fits and works</li>
            <li>so I was concerned about getting the right replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to go to the store and try to find the right replacement every time.</li>
            <li>Could not be any easier and the price is right</li>
            <li>All I can say is this product was the right replacement brushes for my Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li>The schedule for shipping is just right.</li>
            <li>Do not hurt your gum and clean very well.</li>
            <li>Then tried new brush head on husband&#x27;s toothbrush and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>The new brushes work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I returned them because I changed toothbrushes and these no longer fit my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were exactly what I wanted and at the right price.</li>
            <li>If you order them I suggest you examine the bristles first for this defect so you can return them right away</li>
            <li>Was exactly what we ordered &amp; right when my son needed them.  </li>
            <li>Delivered super fast, 2 days to Hawaii, unheard of.</li>
            <li>Each iteration of the brushes seems to have slightly different bissell color layout (all have been green),and as far as I can tell this is just a marketing gimmick, which I suppose keeps Phillips engineering/marketing people employed, which is a good thing, but adds no noticeable functional value.</li>
            <li>2 minutes keep your teeth healthy and clean, ready for your next cleaning appointment.  </li>
            <li>Received exactly what I expected to get - very pleased to have found these.</li>
            <li>Better than at Costco / Bj&#x27;s and kinda sad but a great stocking stuffer for our adult yet young - still - in - college - and - probably - not - buying - his - own son.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal at a super price.</li>
            <li>Super fast deliver.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick arrival of my order.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is the only toothbrush for my family this product is outstanding and price is definitely right.</li>
            <li>Not real bad but kind of strange</li>
            <li>After trimming one of the toothbrush hairs in the middle with a pair of scissors, it was fine!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it very much,</li>
            <li>The fit is perfect as expected, but the old handle will not move the new brush head unless I apply pressure to the back of the stem.</li>
            <li>The knock offs are much noisier and don&#x27;t clean as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li>They arrived early, which is a huge plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a huge difference after replacing the old brush head.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Sonicare and the best pricing is on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I currently order these using amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; to make sure I get replacements when I need them.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li>Better price on amazon than at Target - especially if you do &amp;#34;subscribe and save.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Exactly what I thought it was.</li>
            <li>They are factory exact units, bought at a fraction of retail cost.  </li>
            <li>These Sonicare E Series heads were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>amazon never fails.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Sonicare design allows better brushing of all tooth surfaces front to back than manual brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased the replacement heads online.</li>
            <li>I purchased a set of replacement brush heads from a local grocery store and when using them I realized why they were cheap!</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Ever since I began using Sonicare, my teeth actually look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the e series for 3 years and as of recent the battery needs recharging more often.  </li>
            <li>Will upgrade to the Healthy White Sonicare when the time comes.</li>
            <li>authentic Sonicare not generic.  </li>
            <li>the price is better than local store costs.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know as yet about this order!  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>Will buy more later.</li>
            <li>They were a better lower price than at any local store.</li>
            <li>They work better than generic brands and color fades when they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the brush heads.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement brush for this Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would rate it higher if you carried the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I am still using the first from the package of two</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>actually like them better than what I&#x27;ve been using all this time.  </li>
            <li>These have a thinner, more flexible stem and even the brush head is designed differently.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>My super-hot dentist has never failed to compliment my teeth since I started using Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I had wanted and the price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li>This was my first time on autoship</li>
            <li>and I hope they continue selling them at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Good to replace heads after a few months.</li>
            <li>Its good and a bargain price to pay for an everyday use.</li>
            <li>The brushing action of these new heads is much more vigorous.</li>
            <li>these are just like the original and are not loud and cheap.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality, these brush heads are very good and last as long as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>But as durable as it was, the original brush head was clearly worn out, so I ordered the 2-pack replacement set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You might have noticed that I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the price of these heads, because paying more than $2 for a toothbrush that lasts a month instead of a year like my old manuals strikes me asbeing criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all.</li>
            <li>Probably cleans teeth ok, but creates so much gunk in its interstices that it is a constant nuisance.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find these brush heads at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth the money, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The brushing action was more vigorous and the bristles were more firm (but</li>
            <li>I have learned from a long time of using electric toothbrushes, you should always go with the branded heads, they just work better.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a no brainer.</li>
            <li>I would give sonic care credit my  nearly perfect dental checkups for the entire time I used them, before that had some potentially serious gum issues.</li>
            <li>Fit fine at less price than Walmart.</li>
            <li>I use my Sonicare every single day (and I love it).  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of getting a generic brush head replacement for my Sonicare, and they didn&#x27;t ever fit quite right, which mostly showed in how LOUD my Sonicare toothbrush suddenly sounded.</li>
            <li>The formica doesn&#x27;t look as smart as in the picture.</li>
            <li>The box it arrived in was unnecessarily large, bit wasteful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to keep purchasing a new brush - and here I found just what a needed on line - they are on the way to my house right now - thank goodness</li>
            <li>I threw the first brush head away after it&#x27;s first use because it was very loud.</li>
            <li>Came packaged like a standard in-store purchase, no defects, and they are operating just fine.</li>
            <li>The heads themselves are fine, but for some reason, both heads (at some point) starting rattling within the grip.</li>
            <li>I really shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long before replacing the original!</li>
            <li>Although, I think they are costly, they do work as good as the ones that came with the original toothbrush, last a long time, and work quietly.  </li>
            <li>These cost just a little more, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li>After about a month of use, the head does not vibrate as fast even with cleansing.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t even have to really think about it.</li>
            <li>Arrived reasonably well-packed.  </li>
            <li>really has cleaning power.</li>
            <li>so much I have these on subscription status.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The genuine ones are the only way to go.  </li>
            <li>These heads were much needed.  </li>
            <li>Appreciated the discount.  </li>
            <li>After buying the generic replacements, I understand why using the name brand brush heads is so important</li>
            <li>but I have tried some of the generic brands available on Amazon</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, even to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quoting a much stingier discount for the subscription than I&#x27;m being offered.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s turned on, the magnet just rattles loudly without moving the brush as powerfully.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;which is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe these are real sonicare brush replacements.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for years and really like the way it cleans my teeth and saves at the Dentist too.</li>
            <li>Get the real deal--which these are not.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell so much anymore, but I will probably replace it soon.  </li>
            <li>quality inferior to the real deal..</li>
            <li>The product is reasonably priced and it pays to buy online</li>
            <li>The bristles are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>They fit properly and wont stop with the slightest of pressure.</li>
            <li>The heads need to be replaced every six months and these are very well made replacement parts.</li>
            <li>I really like the system.</li>
            <li>I really like Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>This product was sold at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This so much easier than going to the store.</li>
            <li>It matches my Philips Sonicare very well.</li>
            <li>but then I don&#x27;t really have a choice, do I?  </li>
            <li>When they arrived, they were straight.</li>
            <li>and they were very noisy.</li>
            <li>I really like these,</li>
            <li>but at a very reduced cost.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I for the life of me do not understand why these things cost so much.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I received a notice from the Post Office &amp;#34;FINAL WARNING&amp;#34; that unless I was available to sign for the package when they made there last attempt to deliver, the package would be returned to the shipper.</li>
            <li>I had to go to the Post Office to sign for the package, which made ths transaction A REAL PAIN.</li>
            <li>used to use Oral B, but it was nowhere near as powerful.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 packs of these and they came fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy knockoffs, and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>My teeth have been much cleaner and the dentist is much happier when I use the Philips toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They came within a reasonable amount of time and were just like the ones from the store.</li>
            <li>The Generic brushes sound like a chain saw when they run</li>
            <li>Reasonable buy matches the one that came with the toothbrush set.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much else about them.</li>
            <li>Always spring for the real thing.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison to the real thing.  </li>
            <li>and my dentist is much happier.</li>
            <li>And considering that the \\&quot;Standard\\&quot; head is kind of small to begin with, I think the head should be changed at the first sight of bristle-deformation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is difficult to be more enthusiastic than three stars regarding replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>They are too soft and don&#x27;t clean the teeth like the old ones did!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing like screwing on a new sonicare brush and using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>These Sonicare brush heads do an excellent job, along with the base, in keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Both come with a brush head cover and different colored rings, in original packaging.</li>
            <li>When my original brush needed replaced, I bought a generic pack of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare product, won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been ordering these every 3 months to replace our current heads and to maintain a clean environment for our mouths;) They always work, most likely would last longer than 3 months, but this is our dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li>When I brushed my teeth with the new brush head, the brushing action was much more vigorous.</li>
            <li>I prefer the old brush heads for my Essence Sonicare, but apparently they aren&#x27;t available anymore.  </li>
            <li>I will order them again and again as needed for as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li>Remember what your parents taught you (because I  temporarily forgot), if someone has to tell you how honest they are-they usually aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>These heads are exactly what I needed to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li>This particular one is pretty old</li>
            <li>They cost a little more than the other set, but much better quality.</li>
            <li>I do not like these new brushes at all!</li>
            <li>These work well on my older Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>The net result was that my gums were not getting the adequate oral &#x27;exercise&#x27; they need to be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At my age, gum disease is a bigger problem than cavities, but since I changed to the Sonicare, my dental hygienist has given me much better reports on my gums, with the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; being much smaller than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rubber \\&quot;bumpers\\&quot; that transmit the vibrations from the main body of the brush were also worn out.</li>
            <li>I have an older model which speaks well for sonicare.</li>
            <li>Have used this particular brand and&lt;br /&gt;style</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this head.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend these be considered for the cost savings.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>But the toothbrush does the job, and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i prefer the frustration-free subscribe&amp; save, but the price was too high.  </li>
            <li>the price is much to high however.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sonicare tooth brushes - nothing else I have tried compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I love them and will buy again in a few months when I need new ones!</li>
            <li>The price is a little better online than I can get in town.  </li>
            <li>And, they added the new style of brushing, instead of the older rotary movement, both of which I use and both of which have reduced my gingivitis.</li>
            <li>The cheaper imposter brands are loud, and I do not feel like they vibrate as much.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sonicare and my dentist always says I take great care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the generic and they aren&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>They look really different from the old style brush heads, but they actually feel and work much better.</li>
            <li>It is worth paying the extra money for the Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li>product from Amazon is not only practical, it is also economical.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a way they can reduce the waste and cost.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that the brushes are fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s back to working right again.</li>
            <li>but wears down very quickly...</li>
            <li>this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;it feels I&#x27;m replacing 1/2 the toothbrush, rather than just the head, so that&#x27;s not really against these, but the original product......</li>
            <li>These worked just as expected and significantly cheaper than what Walmart carries.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a new one (slimmer)</li>
            <li>These new brush heads keeps the Sonicare brand</li>
            <li>new</li>
            <li>We thought we would have to buy new tooth brushes until we found these.  </li>
            <li>Had to scrap toothbrush and purchase new one.</li>
            <li>toothbrush performs like new.  </li>
            <li>I suppose we should examine the new models.</li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth with the new brush its like</li>
            <li>Well, I live in an apartment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for over 10 years now and all I do is buy new heads.  </li>
            <li>You just get new ones in the mail every 6 months</li>
            <li>Brushes arrived on time, worked as the previous brushes did and installed easily.</li>
            <li>not sure how this one is going to fit the newer model, check model first before you make the purchase</li>
            <li>Brushing my teeth using this sonicare brush is like therapy for my denture, keeping my gums strong, whiter teeth and less dentist work ($$$$) to pay.</li>
            <li>They make this loud high pitch whine.</li>
            <li>I got these in less time than I was told and they work great, like all Philips replacements I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li>The first brush head lasted only 3 months and had to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Today, I finally gave up on the first replacement head &amp; threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li>I received actual Sonicare brush heads in original packaging and not generic knockoffs.</li>
            <li>and you can toss the old ones!</li>
            <li>all have a big white smile now!</li>
            <li>But on the other hand I&#x27;ve likely saved many times that over in dental bills.</li>
            <li>These are exact replacement and are available at various retailers, but having them delivered to your door for a slightly cheaper price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and on time and the frustration free packaging was a little tougher to open than it should have and the they don&#x27;t offer softer brushes so you can strip the enamel off your teeth if you are not careful</li>
            <li>Maybe they have a two-tiered discount rate for old subscriptions vs. new subscriptions.  </li>
            <li>this was the first (and only) electric toothbrush i have used so far, so i cannot compare it to others.  </li>
            <li>My husband has an E-Series toothbrush that is still going strong after a few years.</li>
            <li>easy to replace, lasts several months, brush size is just right to get into small spaces, yet large enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>If you use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, you can only buy certain models of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Though clunky and harder to clean then other leading brands, I would recommend not purchasing the store brand &amp;#34;its good enough to work&amp;#34; and just spend the extra few dollars on the real heads.</li>
            <li>here.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, less noisy than the original version.</li>
            <li>These can be hard to find in local stores and certainly not at such a good price.</li>
            <li>They clearly have customer service issues.  </li>
            <li>these are a must have replacement heads if you have the old sonic brush</li>
            <li>I purchased these and they completely do the job.</li>
            <li>These restored usefulness to an old Sonicare portable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>These are soft without being too soft.  </li>
            <li>Have been using the Sonicare E series for the last year and cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li>I fixed by gorilla gluing the magnet to the stem and shaving off the excess glue, but shouldn&#x27;t have had to.</li>
            <li>(The brush itself now needs to be recharged after every use - batteries getting old</li>
            <li>SO LOUD.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare since the early 1980&#x27;s when it was provided to me by a dentist for a clinical trial.</li>
            <li>It makes an enormous difference in how much plaque builds up between twice-yearly cleanings.</li>
            <li>It was SO LOUD, everytime</li>
            <li>The real Sonicare heads are amazingly different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so loud in my mouth it rattles my nose and makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li>You will really notcie the difference in performance between using the generic brush heads and using these.  </li>
            <li>When using a manual toothbrush some time ago, I developed inflamed gums and bleeding everywhere.</li>
            <li>They were very inexpensive, but they didn&#x27;t help my gums enough to keep them from deteriorating.</li>
            <li>Far cheaper than what I would pay locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The noise level may wake up someone still sleeping if you are an early riser.</li>
            <li>and they aren&#x27;t loud like the store brand ones at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping out of the big box store.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My unit is 4 years old and I change the heads once a year</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time this has happened, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unusual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been thinking of trying out the soft bristle heads.</li>
            <li>This is a well designed, mature product that does what it says.  </li>
            <li>They had different packaging for a while that was much easier.</li>
            <li>face WoW g o</li>
            <li>I found a 10-year old Sonicare toothbrush in some old boxes.  </li>
            <li>They very annoyingly loud.</li>
            <li>and day above Equate brand of brushes for very little&lt;br /&gt;additional expense.</li>
            <li>The product is as described and fits perfectly base perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Had been looking for a good price for this product as they are expensive.  </li>
            <li>While I think they are too expensive, they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>they are brand heads and work perfectly with my base.  </li>
            <li>I love the option of low-plastic easy-to-open packaging, but because of the reviews of possible knock-offs, I went with the normal packaging which would be less likely to have been tampered with.</li>
            <li>They were different and more stiff</li>
            <li>One would think, it&#x27;s still the same brand name, still the same product right?  </li>
            <li>These HX7022/66 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads just feel easier to use and better to get to those back teeth and all other teeth.  </li>
            <li>I just find these are too soft and wear down quickly.</li>
            <li>DO NOT get the imitation brush heads and think you are going to get the same quality, fit and performance from your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Was a little snug fitting in my sonic care, so not sure if I bought the right ones.</li>
            <li>The second brush head lasted one week before it created a loud high pitch noise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to repair a couple of the magnets that came loose after the first use.</li>
            <li>I got these to finally replace my tooth brush heads for an older Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li>I have an older Sonicare toothbrush and these replacement heads are different than the ones I&#x27;ve been buying all along.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended - I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>It is definitely noticeable when comparing the old magnet to the new one.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>If you have not used one before it may take some getting used to, but once you are I can&#x27;t see why anyone would go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The items were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>While it does have holes in it to alalow for air circulation, it is such a tight fit that it mashes the bristles together.</li>
            <li>I used a small piece of metal to scrape around a little in there and then rinsed it out and many large pieces of mold came out</li>
            <li>I think I can get the new ones cheaper locally with a coupon.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a completely new unit and the brush that came with</li>
            <li>I like the smaller brush and the new speed.</li>
            <li>I used the same head for over 6 months (woops) and ordered new ones.</li>
            <li>The return policy for this product happens to not be worth the customer&#x27;s time and trouble--I pay for shipping and then I only receive a partial refund.</li>
            <li>For the first time in at least a year, my gums tingled the way they did when I first got the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>THAT i HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SAME PRODUCT LOCALLY AT WALLGREEN DRUGS FOR $19.99 FOR THE EXACT SAME 2 PACK OF BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t pack his when we go out of town, so he usually brushes his teeth as soon as we get home, to get that clean</li>
            <li>But, I wasted money, they don&#x27;t clean the same.</li>
            <li>This model is definitely less sturdy than the previous model &amp; it rattles a lot more when I&#x27;m using the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My gums are healthy, whereas before I started using the Sonicare and brush picks, my gums were NOT healthy!!</li>
            <li>They are high quality and last me several months.  </li>
            <li>I like these brush head because they have the wear bristles that will remind you to replace them, in case you space the general 3 month rule.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, as I was unable to locate this item locally.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really matter to me, but if you&#x27;re buying these specifically for easier packaging, be careful.</li>
            <li>Literally, if you&#x27;re not careful, they will strip away the flesh on your gums.</li>
            <li>In recent weeks, the head seemed soft and not working well.</li>
            <li>&gt; Extra Soft Bristles</li>
            <li>Would prefer to have the old one back.</li>
            <li>So the selling point for this product is that Amazon offers a subscription service which lets you schedule regular purchases of replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Philips sonicare  E series e toothbrush heads are expensive but effective.</li>
            <li>I bought my Philips Sonicare at a retailer but when looking for replacement heads they were either not available (including the brick and mortar store where I purchased the brushes originally) or way more expensive.  </li>
            <li>They never fit / sounded right when attached.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you would buy in the store but for WAY less.</li>
            <li>Better than other replacements I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>think that after three months, only half the bristles would be pointing in the right direction to probe between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a grocery stores brand instead of the real ones due to the cost.</li>
            <li>After waiting way too long to replace my head I got this and WOW what a difference!</li>
            <li>so I must watch that and clean it out at least once a week.  </li>
            <li>I think these are a fake product, much like the cheap ones you can buy at the discount stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks!</li>
            <li>I found these and when they came in, they were the EXACT same product that Walmart was selling for over $20 less.</li>
            <li>Other ones in past have not broken before but don&#x27;t think its right to try and return a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They do not fit properly and consequently much of the action of the brush is lost.  </li>
            <li>these last the entire 90 days, and are quiet, the others were loud and didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li>First, for all of you out there who brush your teeth, the Philips Sonicare replacement tooth brushes are not cheap.  </li>
            <li>Fits my e-series  brush, hopefully the price will drop some more O,o&#x27;  a little expensive for just replacement brushes where as if you buy the whole set on special it only cost round 30-40.</li>
            <li>I was initially skeptical that these would fit my older Sonicare version</li>
            <li>I am going to try it on my other older handle to see if that one works.</li>
            <li>The little clear plastic cover that fits over the bristles when not in use is a very tight fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting used to the new ones...seem stiffer to me and not as wide.</li>
            <li>It seems the brushes becomes worn much sooner than before, but than, they have changed their recommendation to changing brush every 3 months than the previous 6 month.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit pricy for those of us on fixed incomes but they last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The metal part that makes it vibrate worked loose and it just made a lot of noise but no brushing action.</li>
            <li>bristles wear out a little faster than I had hoped, but my teeth are much cleaner now</li>
            <li>The replacement heads fit my base and work just fine.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Works great with my Elite that is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Manual toothbrushes are fine, but having a brush that ensures you get 2 minutes of brushing is great.  </li>

            <li> Find these replacement heads through Amazon is a great value, just make sure you buy them from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> Performance is spectacular.</li>
            <li> If you own a sonicare you know it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice toiletry luxury</li>

            <li> Great product, great service, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good brush though :)</li>
            <li> And have really liked them.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads I&#x27;ve always used before this are kind of clunky and ridged.  </li>
            <li> that to the fact that the Sonicare was recommended to me by one dentist, and has led to many tooth cleanings at which the hygienist marvels at how good my teeth look.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve bought a Sonicare Eseries toothbrush, you&#x27;ve already made the choice of what kind of replacement head you&#x27;re going to end up buying.</li>
            <li> Nice...</li>

            <li> This is a recommended product that will keep you teeth clean and happy.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars, but I haven&#x27;t yet used the new replacement heads, so four is the best I can give at this time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works great.</li>

            <li> Better check up since I got it.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware and be sure you are getting authentic Phillips Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li> works perfectly with floss used daily</li>
            <li> More affordable than the ones sold in stores.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE A LOT MORE MONEY.  </li>
            <li> I have used Philips Sonicare for many years and have had to deal with water getting inside the instrument, but I have never seen anything like rusting in the brush section.  </li>
            <li> I try to order them through subscribe and save because it makes them much more affordable.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and love the fact that we can have the heads automatically delivered to us every 3 months via Amazon subscribe-and-save.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon, and I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Okay, so here is what I don&#x27;t like, mold.  </li>
            <li> use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
            <li> I had to grab a 6 pack at Costco to test against it and those worked way better.</li>
            <li> Buy the authentic Phillips replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> You will love them.</li>
            <li> then you should get your replacement brush heads here, At Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare</li>
            <li> That may be a bit of overkill intended to sell brush heads, but I realize now that they do need to be replaced much more often than every three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before changing to the Sonicare, I had used another brand of battery-operated brush found in drugstores.</li>
            <li> My kids love the Philips Sonicare itself.  </li>
            <li> and I was very happy to only have to purchase the replacement brushes!</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Have used nothing else for fifteen years and my healthy teeth attest to that fact.</li>
            <li> I would suggest it to everybody that wants to use a elect tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare - I switched to sonicare from oral b based on a family members recommendation.  </li>
            <li> i love that they have changed the packaging and that I can now get these replacement heads a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the preliminary results.</li>
            <li> These ones seem to shake more than the originals that came with it even though they are supposed to be OEM.</li>
            <li> The Brush Head was okay</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love.  </li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> so I was glad I could order them online</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this product, keeps the teeth</li>
            <li> I spend more time brushing now.</li>
            <li> are better than none.</li>
            <li> The price is much better than retailat a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> No too pleased.</li>
            <li> These are cheapest here and at Costco, but at Costco you have to buy like 1,928 of them at once, and I just don&#x27;t have that many teeth.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the brush heads, the price, and the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> helps me replace more often.  </li>
            <li> so I will plan better.</li>
            <li> o d love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for many years.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> Surely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love the ease and convenience, just remember to change the heads every 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and work far better than the originals they replace.</li>
            <li> The vibration seems more vigorous and the shaped bristles reach better between the teeth.</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare, but although the write-up said something about no-hassle packaging, it almost takes a chain saw to open the plastic and get the heads out.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with the Philips E Series brush heads.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonic care toothbrushes for over 5 years now and love em.</li>
            <li> the sonic care tooth brush replacement works better than the&lt;br /&gt;generic brands.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates on the holder much better than the&lt;br /&gt;generic brand.  </li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and love that I can get the replacement heads at a good price delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> so they better be good, right?  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are very useful and effective.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out the right technique of using this toothbrush, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Eventually even with the amazing feel of the electronic brush, my teeth would not be clean after a thorough brush.</li>
            <li> First time after many good replacement orders.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just what is pictured, and what came with the original Sonicare!</li>
            <li> In addition, the toothbrush itself remains strong even after many years of use.</li>
            <li> More vibration, better clean, better debris removal...</li>
            <li> Said cleaning for him was easy and asked how I kept my teeth so healthy and</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are a perfect fit, but they are poorer quality than earlier versions in that the bristles are softer.</li>
            <li> These heads are a perfect fit and now my toothbrushing has never been the same!</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done brushing, my teeth feel really clean!  </li>
            <li> am enjoying this fine product, the brushes are of quality proportions.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after brushing!</li>
            <li> terrific product wife and i have been using it for years every day it does a very good job cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of stocking up if more are still available.</li>
            <li> Read description to make sure it will fit yours.</li>
            <li> No  longer available in stores, so I was glad to find it</li>
            <li> These worked really well and a good price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good quality.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for good service and pricing.</li>
            <li> so we always have fresh brushes when we should - something that we would not have if we had to remember to replace them on our own.</li>
            <li> The right kind of replacement brush for my sonic are brush.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed a significant improvement in performance over the used heads.</li>
            <li> I found the price to be the best, compared to other retailers.</li>
            <li> I bought three packs since they were such a good buy!</li>
            <li> It just makes brushing more fun!</li>
            <li> Overall a good buying experience!</li>
            <li> Came very quickly.</li>
            <li> They are easy to interchange.</li>
            <li> It makes our dentist&#x27;s job easy.</li>
            <li> I appreciate how easy it is to change heads on this model.</li>
            <li> Not always easy to find in a retali store.</li>
            <li> it keeps the the clean feel longer and better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> easy to reorder since it comes automatically....</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem to vibrate as strongly.  </li>
            <li> I hope they keep making these, because my E-series handle is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Good replacement parts for a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of embarrassed to admit that I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare model HX5300 for about three years, and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve replaced the brush head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;.They work good but should be replaced at 6-8 months to work as new</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re replacement brush-heads, and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> The comes as a two pack and fit easily on the sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This Brush is Fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes work fine with my Sonicare E series toothbrush.</li>
            <li> work fine and</li>
            <li> Works with the unit just fine.</li>
            <li> and the brush is still fine.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> They do a much better job than any normal toothbrush could do on its own.  </li>
            <li> These fit on the Sonicare easily and may be removed for cleaning.</li>
            <li> the replacement brush seem to be fine, they work with our Sonicare machine.  </li>
            <li> Their toothbrush heads and they work fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, brushes teeth, easy to clean and easy to replace brushes.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is of course AWESOME, if a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Super product, better than the original brushes that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try a version sold by Walgreens, but this was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> Color coded for two people or save one for later, these are the genuine replacements and work great.</li>
            <li> These are the genuine Sonicare E-Series replacement heads, but the ones I received were not in frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic heads.</li>
            <li> Purchased them to fit my existing E series Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush heads fit my eseries sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Amazon makes it available, and at a discount price.</li>
            <li> and they just don&#x27;t seem to fit or work as the Philips brand.</li>
            <li> Great price--even beats Walmarts low price</li>
            <li> when will these guys start using frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li> When the tide turns, I&#x27;ll be happy to stop imposing on my friends, and switch from Sams back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Design flaw makes it sound like a buzz saw in your head.</li>
            <li> Genuine Philips brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Walmart now has a line of replacement brush heads (2 pack) designed to fit e-series Sonic holders</li>
            <li> They brush heads fit</li>
            <li> Was worried the head wouldn&#x27;t fit the brush</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re made by Philips I don&#x27;t have to wonder if they&#x27;ll fit the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> powerful, faster or able to leap tall buildings.....</li>
            <li> I will not buy cheap replacements again.</li>
            <li> They work alright and fit on the toothbrush</li>
            <li> But they fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li> The Free shipping with Subscribe and Save is icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Free Packaging]]&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They fit like a charm onto my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It the genuine article.</li>
            <li> These were a fantastic price and I will continue to purchase them.  </li>
            <li> but the details stated they would fit my model of my Sonicare</li>
            <li> I went out and bought some cheap replacement heads</li>
            <li> The product came promptly and fit my Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit well and made an ungodly noise.  </li>
            <li> The sonicare toothbrush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> it works great and feels like it brought some of the power back to my toothbrush</li>
            <li> Changing your toothbrush is important.</li>
            <li> I have bought cheap knockoffs from Walmart and CVS.  </li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon is very convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush as much as one can love a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> good reminder to toss the old one which I often forget to do....</li>
            <li> Good head action.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gladly pay way too much for these just for the feeling my teeth have after brushing :)</li>
            <li> , I tried the Target equivalent one time and its nowhere near as good as original Philips brand.</li>
            <li> Great product, I order these for my Sonicare toothbrush mainly because Amazon sells them much cheaper</li>
            <li> These are the original brushes by Philips, in original packaging, and therefore work fine.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Sonicare toothbrush with no problem, and appear to be from the original manufacturer of the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It is designed better, to better and more easily brush your back teeth in all areas.  </li>
            <li> overall great product and good price compared to big box storea.</li>
            <li> it works just like the original.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> These are just like the original - they work well and make brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li> I had not updated my brush heads in a long time and what a great difference in the brush feeling against my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are of the original style and you will notice the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> Original equipment</li>
            <li> Bought these as a replacement for the original brush head that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I believe it is an original replacement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We still use the original model power handle.</li>
            <li> the heads are weaker than the original ones that came with the Sonic, but are usable.  </li>
            <li> Since my dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement heads and I&#x27;m not disappointed in them at all.</li>
            <li> , they work just like the ones that came with the toothbrush originally.</li>
            <li> I receive my item in a more than reasonable amount of time!</li>
            <li> I have an original series.</li>
            <li> Just visited&lt;br /&gt;the dentist and got a very good report, thanks to regular use of floss and my Sonicare brush!</li>
            <li> Always nice to have the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush keeps my teeth clean</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I like the way my teeth feel clean clean after I use this brush.</li>
            <li> They clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads were cheap and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve saved me a lot of time and money by keeping my teeth clean and preventing cavities and gum disease.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean again.</li>
            <li> squeaky clean &amp; plaque-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did what it was supposed to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> Works well, but don&#x27;t try to steam clean it.</li>
            <li> well so they clean my teeth well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are clean because of it.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fast vibration, perhaps the most important feature is it times you for a full 2 minutes or so-</li>
            <li> This spin brush spins super-fast, much faster than the first kind of sonicare electric brush I bought.</li>
            <li> Makes me teeth feel super clean and the charge lasts for a while if you take it on vacation.</li>
            <li> Not a lot more to say really.</li>
            <li> The true Sonic-are do not make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> enjoyed using my sonicare toothbrush so much, that I decided to buy one for my fiancé.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very functional, however, and ingeniously engineered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These heads always work well, and last a good 4 months.</li>
            <li> I might prefer the smaller heads, which is why this is not 5 stars, but if this is what you want, it is a really good price.</li>
            <li> These are top quality and priced much lower than Walmart, Target</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re always top quality, arrive in record time, packaged securely and the prices are always way better than I can get them for locally.</li>
            <li> This a good price for the heads, especially if you go on auto ship.</li>
            <li> The sonicare is alot better, however the brush heads are alot more vs. oral b and does it really need to come with the whole gadget below the brush?  </li>
            <li> really does a good job getting hard to reach areas as well as cleaning your teeth pretty good!</li>
            <li> The new head has a lot more vigorous vibration, so I think it really is important to replace the heads every 6 months, even if the bristles show no wear.</li>
            <li> It seems it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right, that the magnets may be misaligned.</li>
            <li> Bonus is that it&#x27;s a pretty strong magnet in the brush you can hack and use when done with the brush.</li>
            <li> can buy these anywhere but from now on I will only by them from Sun Valley Dental Products as the customer service is outstanding and the guarantee is amazing - thanks Joseph and the Sun Valley crew!</li>
            <li> I think these work better than the one it originally came with new.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> They seem to wear out quickly, but this is just probably how they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I guess 2013 isn&#x27;t a lucky number,</li>
            <li> Seller shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> i bought these replacement lbrush heads for me an dmy wife and we both oved it very much, next time I will buy more and more.</li>
            <li> Received my brushes quickly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if they will fit the old head, but they did.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Great having these on auto-ship as a reminder to change brush heads-cost is much lower than prices at local stores</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and prompt receipt.</li>
            <li> When it came time to replace the head, I was happy to find Amazon had these at a much lower cost than my local brick-and-mortar stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great value, fit just right, big difference when brushes are new!</li>
            <li> and now I am buying the right and original ones....</li>
            <li> fact that I used the original brush head for three years is testimony to the durability of the brush, but I recommend replacing the brush heads much more frequently than that.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this toothbrush the replacements seem to fit well.  </li>
            <li> Like it&#x27;s not the exact fit for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as described, and fit my Sonicare</li>
            <li> That given, I&#x27;m overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and they are the exact fit I need.</li>
            <li> great price for an otherwise overpriced head unit at other stores!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new heads make a HUGE difference compared to my worn out ones!</li>
            <li> sure you HAVE to in the new recommended time period.</li>
            <li> The sonicare system is amazing and my teeth are left amazingly fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> easy to cancel when ready to do cancel</li>
            <li> Just ok the bristle head seemed really small on this one but had a good price.</li>
            <li> And to anyone who is purchasing a Philips Sonicare for the first time - congrats!</li>
            <li> They are higher quality than the original brush my sonicare came with.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the exact replacement ones that came with the original purchase.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush works and last for more than 4 months !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my new sonicare toothbrush and these replacement brushes are of course the same quality as the one that was provided with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brushes work fine, but the S+H was way to much considering the size and weight.</li>
            <li> These were actually less expensive than Walmart was and are a perfect fit,  Great service from vendor..</li>
            <li> I have purchased several replacement heads from Amazon and most have been fine.  </li>
            <li> I have an old Sonicare Advance (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called?), and these fit the handle just fine.  </li>
            <li> These tooth brushes were exactly as advertised and fit our older Advanced series machine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend highly to anyone interested in keeping their teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> They work very well and are comfortable to use and handle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as before though.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are a case where buying the name-brand is truly worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now and have had no problems of any kind.</li>
            <li> its worth the price</li>
            <li> have been using Sonicare for thirty years or more since we saw Oprah recommend it on her old</li>
            <li> Ok, hear me clearly.  </li>
            <li> They are an improvement over the old series, with a better material for both cleaning and gum massaging.</li>
            <li> kind of expensive but work great</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the month</li>
            <li> Be sure and replace them frequently</li>
            <li> A two pack is essentially/basically a year&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The old brushes looks pretty good until the new ones arrive.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I learned from one of the dental nurses that we should use the sonic brushes in a gentle manner, because of their vibration, its easy to grind teeth faster, than we are generally aware of.</li>
            <li> Worked fine... decent price.  </li>
            <li> SURE THERE ARE OTHER UNITS THAT COULD DO BETTER, BUT</li>
            <li> Not as good as my older one that had 30 second beeps for each quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> These are so much louder than the original ones that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good product as expected!</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting the right model but it fits and works</li>
            <li> so I was concerned about getting the right replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to go to the store and try to find the right replacement every time.</li>
            <li> Could not be any easier and the price is right</li>
            <li> All I can say is this product was the right replacement brushes for my Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li> The schedule for shipping is just right.</li>
            <li> Do not hurt your gum and clean very well.</li>
            <li> Then tried new brush head on husband&#x27;s toothbrush and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> The new brushes work just fine.  </li>
            <li> I returned them because I changed toothbrushes and these no longer fit my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were exactly what I wanted and at the right price.</li>
            <li> If you order them I suggest you examine the bristles first for this defect so you can return them right away</li>
            <li> Was exactly what we ordered &amp; right when my son needed them.  </li>
            <li> Delivered super fast, 2 days to Hawaii, unheard of.</li>
            <li> Each iteration of the brushes seems to have slightly different bissell color layout (all have been green),and as far as I can tell this is just a marketing gimmick, which I suppose keeps Phillips engineering/marketing people employed, which is a good thing, but adds no noticeable functional value.</li>
            <li> 2 minutes keep your teeth healthy and clean, ready for your next cleaning appointment.  </li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected to get - very pleased to have found these.</li>
            <li> Better than at Costco / Bj&#x27;s and kinda sad but a great stocking stuffer for our adult yet young - still - in - college - and - probably - not - buying - his - own son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal at a super price.</li>
            <li> Super fast deliver.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick arrival of my order.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the only toothbrush for my family this product is outstanding and price is definitely right.</li>
            <li> Not real bad but kind of strange</li>
            <li> After trimming one of the toothbrush hairs in the middle with a pair of scissors, it was fine!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it very much,</li>
            <li> The fit is perfect as expected, but the old handle will not move the new brush head unless I apply pressure to the back of the stem.</li>
            <li> The knock offs are much noisier and don&#x27;t clean as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li> They arrived early, which is a huge plus</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a huge difference after replacing the old brush head.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Sonicare and the best pricing is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I currently order these using amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; to make sure I get replacements when I need them.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> Better price on amazon than at Target - especially if you do &amp;#34;subscribe and save.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> They are factory exact units, bought at a fraction of retail cost.  </li>
            <li> These Sonicare E Series heads were exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> amazon never fails.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sonicare design allows better brushing of all tooth surfaces front to back than manual brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased the replacement heads online.</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of replacement brush heads from a local grocery store and when using them I realized why they were cheap!</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Ever since I began using Sonicare, my teeth actually look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the e series for 3 years and as of recent the battery needs recharging more often.  </li>
            <li> Will upgrade to the Healthy White Sonicare when the time comes.</li>
            <li> authentic Sonicare not generic.  </li>
            <li> the price is better than local store costs.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know as yet about this order!  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Will buy more later.</li>
            <li> They were a better lower price than at any local store.</li>
            <li> They work better than generic brands and color fades when they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement brush for this Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher if you carried the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am still using the first from the package of two</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> actually like them better than what I&#x27;ve been using all this time.  </li>
            <li> These have a thinner, more flexible stem and even the brush head is designed differently.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> My super-hot dentist has never failed to compliment my teeth since I started using Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I had wanted and the price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This was my first time on autoship</li>
            <li> and I hope they continue selling them at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Good to replace heads after a few months.</li>
            <li> Its good and a bargain price to pay for an everyday use.</li>
            <li> The brushing action of these new heads is much more vigorous.</li>
            <li> these are just like the original and are not loud and cheap.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality, these brush heads are very good and last as long as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> But as durable as it was, the original brush head was clearly worn out, so I ordered the 2-pack replacement set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You might have noticed that I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the price of these heads, because paying more than $2 for a toothbrush that lasts a month instead of a year like my old manuals strikes me asbeing criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> Probably cleans teeth ok, but creates so much gunk in its interstices that it is a constant nuisance.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find these brush heads at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth the money, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The brushing action was more vigorous and the bristles were more firm (but</li>
            <li> I have learned from a long time of using electric toothbrushes, you should always go with the branded heads, they just work better.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I would give sonic care credit my  nearly perfect dental checkups for the entire time I used them, before that had some potentially serious gum issues.</li>
            <li> Fit fine at less price than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I use my Sonicare every single day (and I love it).  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting a generic brush head replacement for my Sonicare, and they didn&#x27;t ever fit quite right, which mostly showed in how LOUD my Sonicare toothbrush suddenly sounded.</li>
            <li> The formica doesn&#x27;t look as smart as in the picture.</li>
            <li> The box it arrived in was unnecessarily large, bit wasteful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to keep purchasing a new brush - and here I found just what a needed on line - they are on the way to my house right now - thank goodness</li>
            <li> I threw the first brush head away after it&#x27;s first use because it was very loud.</li>
            <li> Came packaged like a standard in-store purchase, no defects, and they are operating just fine.</li>
            <li> The heads themselves are fine, but for some reason, both heads (at some point) starting rattling within the grip.</li>
            <li> I really shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long before replacing the original!</li>
            <li> Although, I think they are costly, they do work as good as the ones that came with the original toothbrush, last a long time, and work quietly.  </li>
            <li> These cost just a little more, but are well worth it.</li>
            <li> After about a month of use, the head does not vibrate as fast even with cleansing.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even have to really think about it.</li>
            <li> Arrived reasonably well-packed.  </li>
            <li> really has cleaning power.</li>
            <li> so much I have these on subscription status.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The genuine ones are the only way to go.  </li>
            <li> These heads were much needed.  </li>
            <li> Appreciated the discount.  </li>
            <li> After buying the generic replacements, I understand why using the name brand brush heads is so important</li>
            <li> but I have tried some of the generic brands available on Amazon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, even to Hawaii.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quoting a much stingier discount for the subscription than I&#x27;m being offered.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s turned on, the magnet just rattles loudly without moving the brush as powerfully.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;which is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are real sonicare brush replacements.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years and really like the way it cleans my teeth and saves at the Dentist too.</li>
            <li> Get the real deal--which these are not.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell so much anymore, but I will probably replace it soon.  </li>
            <li> quality inferior to the real deal..</li>
            <li> The product is reasonably priced and it pays to buy online</li>
            <li> The bristles are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> They fit properly and wont stop with the slightest of pressure.</li>
            <li> The heads need to be replaced every six months and these are very well made replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I really like the system.</li>
            <li> I really like Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> This product was sold at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This so much easier than going to the store.</li>
            <li> It matches my Philips Sonicare very well.</li>
            <li> but then I don&#x27;t really have a choice, do I?  </li>
            <li> When they arrived, they were straight.</li>
            <li> and they were very noisy.</li>
            <li> I really like these,</li>
            <li> but at a very reduced cost.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I for the life of me do not understand why these things cost so much.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I received a notice from the Post Office &amp;#34;FINAL WARNING&amp;#34; that unless I was available to sign for the package when they made there last attempt to deliver, the package would be returned to the shipper.</li>
            <li> I had to go to the Post Office to sign for the package, which made ths transaction A REAL PAIN.</li>
            <li> used to use Oral B, but it was nowhere near as powerful.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packs of these and they came fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy knockoffs, and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> My teeth have been much cleaner and the dentist is much happier when I use the Philips toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They came within a reasonable amount of time and were just like the ones from the store.</li>
            <li> The Generic brushes sound like a chain saw when they run</li>
            <li> Reasonable buy matches the one that came with the toothbrush set.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much else about them.</li>
            <li> Always spring for the real thing.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> and my dentist is much happier.</li>
            <li> And considering that the \\&quot;Standard\\&quot; head is kind of small to begin with, I think the head should be changed at the first sight of bristle-deformation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is difficult to be more enthusiastic than three stars regarding replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> They are too soft and don&#x27;t clean the teeth like the old ones did!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like screwing on a new sonicare brush and using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare brush heads do an excellent job, along with the base, in keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Both come with a brush head cover and different colored rings, in original packaging.</li>
            <li> When my original brush needed replaced, I bought a generic pack of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare product, won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been ordering these every 3 months to replace our current heads and to maintain a clean environment for our mouths;) They always work, most likely would last longer than 3 months, but this is our dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li> When I brushed my teeth with the new brush head, the brushing action was much more vigorous.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old brush heads for my Essence Sonicare, but apparently they aren&#x27;t available anymore.  </li>
            <li> I will order them again and again as needed for as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> Remember what your parents taught you (because I  temporarily forgot), if someone has to tell you how honest they are-they usually aren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> These heads are exactly what I needed to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> This particular one is pretty old</li>
            <li> They cost a little more than the other set, but much better quality.</li>
            <li> I do not like these new brushes at all!</li>
            <li> These work well on my older Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> The net result was that my gums were not getting the adequate oral &#x27;exercise&#x27; they need to be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At my age, gum disease is a bigger problem than cavities, but since I changed to the Sonicare, my dental hygienist has given me much better reports on my gums, with the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; being much smaller than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rubber \\&quot;bumpers\\&quot; that transmit the vibrations from the main body of the brush were also worn out.</li>
            <li> I have an older model which speaks well for sonicare.</li>
            <li> Have used this particular brand and&lt;br /&gt;style</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this head.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend these be considered for the cost savings.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> But the toothbrush does the job, and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i prefer the frustration-free subscribe&amp; save, but the price was too high.  </li>
            <li> the price is much to high however.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sonicare tooth brushes - nothing else I have tried compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I love them and will buy again in a few months when I need new ones!</li>
            <li> The price is a little better online than I can get in town.  </li>
            <li> And, they added the new style of brushing, instead of the older rotary movement, both of which I use and both of which have reduced my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> The cheaper imposter brands are loud, and I do not feel like they vibrate as much.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sonicare and my dentist always says I take great care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the generic and they aren&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> They look really different from the old style brush heads, but they actually feel and work much better.</li>
            <li> It is worth paying the extra money for the Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> product from Amazon is not only practical, it is also economical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a way they can reduce the waste and cost.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that the brushes are fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to working right again.</li>
            <li> but wears down very quickly...</li>
            <li> this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;it feels I&#x27;m replacing 1/2 the toothbrush, rather than just the head, so that&#x27;s not really against these, but the original product......</li>
            <li> These worked just as expected and significantly cheaper than what Walmart carries.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a new one (slimmer)</li>
            <li> These new brush heads keeps the Sonicare brand</li>
            <li> new</li>
            <li> We thought we would have to buy new tooth brushes until we found these.  </li>
            <li> Had to scrap toothbrush and purchase new one.</li>
            <li> toothbrush performs like new.  </li>
            <li> I suppose we should examine the new models.</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth with the new brush its like</li>
            <li> Well, I live in an apartment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for over 10 years now and all I do is buy new heads.  </li>
            <li> You just get new ones in the mail every 6 months</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived on time, worked as the previous brushes did and installed easily.</li>
            <li> not sure how this one is going to fit the newer model, check model first before you make the purchase</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth using this sonicare brush is like therapy for my denture, keeping my gums strong, whiter teeth and less dentist work ($$$$) to pay.</li>
            <li> They make this loud high pitch whine.</li>
            <li> I got these in less time than I was told and they work great, like all Philips replacements I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> The first brush head lasted only 3 months and had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Today, I finally gave up on the first replacement head &amp; threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I received actual Sonicare brush heads in original packaging and not generic knockoffs.</li>
            <li> and you can toss the old ones!</li>
            <li> all have a big white smile now!</li>
            <li> But on the other hand I&#x27;ve likely saved many times that over in dental bills.</li>
            <li> These are exact replacement and are available at various retailers, but having them delivered to your door for a slightly cheaper price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and on time and the frustration free packaging was a little tougher to open than it should have and the they don&#x27;t offer softer brushes so you can strip the enamel off your teeth if you are not careful</li>
            <li> Maybe they have a two-tiered discount rate for old subscriptions vs. new subscriptions.  </li>
            <li> this was the first (and only) electric toothbrush i have used so far, so i cannot compare it to others.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an E-Series toothbrush that is still going strong after a few years.</li>
            <li> easy to replace, lasts several months, brush size is just right to get into small spaces, yet large enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> If you use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, you can only buy certain models of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Though clunky and harder to clean then other leading brands, I would recommend not purchasing the store brand &amp;#34;its good enough to work&amp;#34; and just spend the extra few dollars on the real heads.</li>
            <li> here.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, less noisy than the original version.</li>
            <li> These can be hard to find in local stores and certainly not at such a good price.</li>
            <li> They clearly have customer service issues.  </li>
            <li> these are a must have replacement heads if you have the old sonic brush</li>
            <li> I purchased these and they completely do the job.</li>
            <li> These restored usefulness to an old Sonicare portable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These are soft without being too soft.  </li>
            <li> Have been using the Sonicare E series for the last year and cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I fixed by gorilla gluing the magnet to the stem and shaving off the excess glue, but shouldn&#x27;t have had to.</li>
            <li> (The brush itself now needs to be recharged after every use - batteries getting old</li>
            <li> SO LOUD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare since the early 1980&#x27;s when it was provided to me by a dentist for a clinical trial.</li>
            <li> It makes an enormous difference in how much plaque builds up between twice-yearly cleanings.</li>
            <li> It was SO LOUD, everytime</li>
            <li> The real Sonicare heads are amazingly different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud in my mouth it rattles my nose and makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li> You will really notcie the difference in performance between using the generic brush heads and using these.  </li>
            <li> When using a manual toothbrush some time ago, I developed inflamed gums and bleeding everywhere.</li>
            <li> They were very inexpensive, but they didn&#x27;t help my gums enough to keep them from deteriorating.</li>
            <li> Far cheaper than what I would pay locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The noise level may wake up someone still sleeping if you are an early riser.</li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t loud like the store brand ones at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks for keeping out of the big box store.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My unit is 4 years old and I change the heads once a year</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time this has happened, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unusual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thinking of trying out the soft bristle heads.</li>
            <li> This is a well designed, mature product that does what it says.  </li>
            <li> They had different packaging for a while that was much easier.</li>
            <li> face WoW g o</li>
            <li> I found a 10-year old Sonicare toothbrush in some old boxes.  </li>
            <li> They very annoyingly loud.</li>
            <li> and day above Equate brand of brushes for very little&lt;br /&gt;additional expense.</li>
            <li> The product is as described and fits perfectly base perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Had been looking for a good price for this product as they are expensive.  </li>
            <li> While I think they are too expensive, they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> they are brand heads and work perfectly with my base.  </li>
            <li> I love the option of low-plastic easy-to-open packaging, but because of the reviews of possible knock-offs, I went with the normal packaging which would be less likely to have been tampered with.</li>
            <li> They were different and more stiff</li>
            <li> One would think, it&#x27;s still the same brand name, still the same product right?  </li>
            <li> These HX7022/66 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads just feel easier to use and better to get to those back teeth and all other teeth.  </li>
            <li> I just find these are too soft and wear down quickly.</li>
            <li> DO NOT get the imitation brush heads and think you are going to get the same quality, fit and performance from your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Was a little snug fitting in my sonic care, so not sure if I bought the right ones.</li>
            <li> The second brush head lasted one week before it created a loud high pitch noise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to repair a couple of the magnets that came loose after the first use.</li>
            <li> I got these to finally replace my tooth brush heads for an older Sonicare handle.</li>
            <li> I have an older Sonicare toothbrush and these replacement heads are different than the ones I&#x27;ve been buying all along.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended - I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> It is definitely noticeable when comparing the old magnet to the new one.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> If you have not used one before it may take some getting used to, but once you are I can&#x27;t see why anyone would go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The items were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> While it does have holes in it to alalow for air circulation, it is such a tight fit that it mashes the bristles together.</li>
            <li> I used a small piece of metal to scrape around a little in there and then rinsed it out and many large pieces of mold came out</li>
            <li> I think I can get the new ones cheaper locally with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a completely new unit and the brush that came with</li>
            <li> I like the smaller brush and the new speed.</li>
            <li> I used the same head for over 6 months (woops) and ordered new ones.</li>
            <li> The return policy for this product happens to not be worth the customer&#x27;s time and trouble--I pay for shipping and then I only receive a partial refund.</li>
            <li> For the first time in at least a year, my gums tingled the way they did when I first got the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> THAT i HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SAME PRODUCT LOCALLY AT WALLGREEN DRUGS FOR $19.99 FOR THE EXACT SAME 2 PACK OF BRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t pack his when we go out of town, so he usually brushes his teeth as soon as we get home, to get that clean</li>
            <li> But, I wasted money, they don&#x27;t clean the same.</li>
            <li> This model is definitely less sturdy than the previous model &amp; it rattles a lot more when I&#x27;m using the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My gums are healthy, whereas before I started using the Sonicare and brush picks, my gums were NOT healthy!!</li>
            <li> They are high quality and last me several months.  </li>
            <li> I like these brush head because they have the wear bristles that will remind you to replace them, in case you space the general 3 month rule.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, as I was unable to locate this item locally.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really matter to me, but if you&#x27;re buying these specifically for easier packaging, be careful.</li>
            <li> Literally, if you&#x27;re not careful, they will strip away the flesh on your gums.</li>
            <li> In recent weeks, the head seemed soft and not working well.</li>
            <li> &gt; Extra Soft Bristles</li>
            <li> Would prefer to have the old one back.</li>
            <li> So the selling point for this product is that Amazon offers a subscription service which lets you schedule regular purchases of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Philips sonicare  E series e toothbrush heads are expensive but effective.</li>
            <li> I bought my Philips Sonicare at a retailer but when looking for replacement heads they were either not available (including the brick and mortar store where I purchased the brushes originally) or way more expensive.  </li>
            <li> They never fit / sounded right when attached.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what you would buy in the store but for WAY less.</li>
            <li> Better than other replacements I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> think that after three months, only half the bristles would be pointing in the right direction to probe between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a grocery stores brand instead of the real ones due to the cost.</li>
            <li> After waiting way too long to replace my head I got this and WOW what a difference!</li>
            <li> so I must watch that and clean it out at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> I think these are a fake product, much like the cheap ones you can buy at the discount stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I found these and when they came in, they were the EXACT same product that Walmart was selling for over $20 less.</li>
            <li> Other ones in past have not broken before but don&#x27;t think its right to try and return a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They do not fit properly and consequently much of the action of the brush is lost.  </li>
            <li> these last the entire 90 days, and are quiet, the others were loud and didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> First, for all of you out there who brush your teeth, the Philips Sonicare replacement tooth brushes are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Fits my e-series  brush, hopefully the price will drop some more O,o&#x27;  a little expensive for just replacement brushes where as if you buy the whole set on special it only cost round 30-40.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical that these would fit my older Sonicare version</li>
            <li> I am going to try it on my other older handle to see if that one works.</li>
            <li> The little clear plastic cover that fits over the bristles when not in use is a very tight fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to the new ones...seem stiffer to me and not as wide.</li>
            <li> It seems the brushes becomes worn much sooner than before, but than, they have changed their recommendation to changing brush every 3 months than the previous 6 month.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit pricy for those of us on fixed incomes but they last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The metal part that makes it vibrate worked loose and it just made a lot of noise but no brushing action.</li>
            <li> bristles wear out a little faster than I had hoped, but my teeth are much cleaner now</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit my base and work just fine.</li>
            <li> I believe that I get throught the winters without getting sick by taking good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This set cost me only about twenty bucks which is much less than local retail stores were charging and has given my Sonicare new life.  </li>
            <li> I bought them as a replacement for my older one, it works with few different models.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make the loud noises or extreme vibrations like some of the store brand heads do.</li>
            <li> but I have to put a little extra torque on the them when I put them on to get them to the normal level of noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s criminal that a toothbrush head with a magnet that needs to be replaced every 3-4 months should cost over 10$, but the off-brand replacements are not much better price-wise, and are not as effective.  </li>
            <li> It is very loud once this happens, and can feel a slight off balance in the head as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened, but it&#x27;s like the head got off center and wouldn&#x27;t brush right?</li>
            <li> These were half price As far as I can tell, they are the same as the full-price heads.</li>
            <li> I told them I was going to attach their rude emails to me  to this review, and if anyone is interested I saved them.</li>
            <li> This is the standard (not sensitive) replacement heads - what a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Long life; low price.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads last as long as you want them to</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fit into electric holder is not as simple as it should be - it doesn&#x27;t just slide in and will allow reverse installation, which is a very minor inconvenience.,</li>
            <li> They seemed a little harsh to my wife but they work all right for me.</li>
            <li> I placed a poor review and the seller immediately contacted me and sent out a new order priority mail with no need to send the old brushes back.  </li>
            <li> Part of its green bristles slowly get lighter as it wears out, unlike the original brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little loud.  </li>
            <li> despite expiring after a few months of vigorous cleaning, these little beasts will leave your teeth sparkling like a candle floating through a crisp geneva moon-lit sky.</li>
            <li> First of the two failed within 3 uses (magnet came loose, and it buzzes very loudly).  </li>
            <li> any where either..I will continue to purchase these as long as my sonic toothbrush hold up</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even close, was way too long.  </li>
            <li> (too long to attach)  </li>
            <li> complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> They took way too long to arrive......... .. .. ... ..... . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Been using these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I could tell it was way too long.  </li>
            <li> It holds a long charge while traveling, so we just keep replacing the heads on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a generic store brand at a nation wide pharmacy chain.</li>
            <li> What good is brush is the power base falls apart.</li>
            <li> Will go for the generic store brands that are half price next time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did find a generic brand later at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2 less...</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they are supposed to be, no more or less.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I used to use a plain old manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrush replacements are well built last just as long as any you buy from the store, but buyer beware; when buying from sellers other then Amazon you may receive units that are of subpar build</li>
            <li> (although I also alternate them, one at night and the other in the morning, so hopefully I can use them twice as long).</li>
            <li> The other continues to work but makes a strange buzzing noise constantly.</li>
            <li> After reading other views, I went with the traditional packaging bc</li>
            <li> Lost a star &#x27;cause they are still so darn expensive, (but worth it!)</li>
            <li> Price is inline with generic options sold at Walmart and other discount store.  </li>
            <li> This product is another one that is hard to find at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very jarring and the bzztt sound is annoying.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth get cleaner then with a regular brush, but the bristles in the head seem to wear out faster than a conventional brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tool lasts forever and these replacement brushes are exactly like the originals - we&#x27;ll keep buying these heads until we get tired of the unit (we&#x27;ve had it about 6-8 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come up with anything new to say about these Sonicare Brush Heads---I&#x27;ve been buying and reviewing them for years now.</li>
            <li> Was expecting to have to do some modifications to make it fit my older base, but they must have done something to make them backward compatible.</li>
            <li> They were in a typical plastic clamshell that I cut open with scissors.</li>
            <li> A definite upgrade over the previous version sold by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this replacement head for about 2 months or less.</li>
            <li> This is the same product one might buy in Target or Walmart, except it cost less money and saved me a trip.</li>
            <li> I saved half off the regular price.</li>
            <li> I find these work for about 4 and a half months, brushing twice daily.  </li>
            <li> So I only cover half the bristles.</li>
            <li> Brushes slightly different than previous ones.</li>
            <li> They do not last very long, you have to keep on changing them and they are a little bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I would have certainly return it because it is a rip-off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less jarring than the new line of small jolting toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second one in the package lasted a little bit longer and now it is buzzing.</li>
            <li> and they last a little longer than 2 months each with my braces.</li>
            <li> Before I order or buy next time, I need to do a little research on how to tell the difference in the brush head bristles by looking at them in the package.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the packaging is sooooo hard to open.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the other one lasted as long as it should.</li>
            <li> Even though the mfr has &amp;#34;cost reduced&amp;#34; the item a few years back, it still works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re refills, so not much to write about.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not real sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I received these when expected.  </li>
            <li> Anyone can sell a product but a real company stands behind their product and focuses on customer service.</li>
            <li> The vendor was timely,and all was as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much else you can say for a replacement head on a toothbrush</li>
            <li> Brushes do last a few months.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed and expected.  </li>
            <li> Although I had not noticed the slow decline it appears that the magnet in my old toothbrush head had weakened over time.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I was using the Kroger replacement brush heads for a long time, not realizing that they honestly do not work the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush (for only a few dollars less than Amazon&#x27;s price for these), and they were noisy junk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just any other toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced my other Phillips Sonicare with this.  </li>
            <li> Buy other electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> otherwise, the brush heads are the same as usual.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase any other products from this seller because of this experience.</li>
            <li> And it is cheaper compared to other convenient stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I would recommend the other series i tried.</li>
            <li> These heads are stiff - not soft  </li>
            <li> These brush heads seemed to have harder bristles than any of previous ones purchased at department stores, drug stores and warehouse stores.  </li>
            <li> Other replacement brush cost less</li>
            <li> This means a lot of gum irritation because its hard to ensure it only hits your teeth.</li>
            <li> It arrived that way, and stupid me, I figured it would be ok.</li>
            <li> Ask your dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a bit expensive for a tooth brush, much much cheaper than a dental bill..</li>
            <li> Not worth the money you save.</li>
            <li> I was really peeved that the product was that lousy, so I returned them and bought these.</li>
            <li> Sometimes store brand substitutions are not worth the savings.</li>
            <li> On average, they are about 12 dollars per brush.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer packaging is plastic clamshell which required scissors and some strength for me to open, but at least the heads were in pristine shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wait too long between replacing brush heads</li>
            <li> It works OK except that water gets into the well of the base</li>
            <li> Bristles were all chopped down with maybe 6 bristles at correct height on both items.</li>
            <li> and I would order from them again without any hesitation, in fact, I will look for items from them as opposed to other sellers since I know they take care of their customers!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for the past 4 years and have never had a single issue.</li>
            <li> I found if I loosen the brush head quite a bit, it will somewhat work, but then water/toothpaste/saliva run down into the handle and its a mess.  </li>
            <li> It will charge and then when I go to use it,it will vibrate for less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> Rougher vibrations than previous replacements.</li>
            <li> you can afford it (expensive relative to the standard brush)</li>
            <li> and then with a disguised voice or Groucho Marx black glasses and</li>
            <li> but you get less.</li>
            <li> and this particular brush makes the noise randomly.</li>
            <li> expensive, but glad these are made for m old sonicare base.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the head is small and not large.</li>
            <li> The magnet does not stay tightly connected to the brush.</li>
            <li> ...screws on easily to e-series brush base, no unusal noises....</li>
            <li> The first order I received had one defective brush that did not contact the base properly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare as long as it has been on the market,,,,,sad to see such a poor product!</li>
            <li> these seem to be made a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Picked these up because they had the Phillips name on the package, but were a little cheaper than the others.  </li>
            <li> The bristles seem a little stiffer than what I had before, but after using them for a month, had my cleaning appointment at the periodontist, and came out with flying colors.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;m fuming a little.  </li>
            <li> A little over priced here since they&#x27;re about 30 in stores</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I ordered this, because the stem of the brush head looked a little skinny and flimsy in the photo.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to open the packaging that the heads are packaged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so unpleasant first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> One of these broke a few weeks after use.</li>
            <li> what a waste of $.  </li>
            <li> These bristlers are much harder and sharper than the ones that come with the sonicare (at least mine).</li>
            <li> I posted feedback on Amazon and within a few hours I had a voicemail and an email letting me know a replacement was in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the brush bristles were coming out in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the cheaper off-brand brushes at a discount store and they also give you the same poor result.  </li>
            <li> These were not genuine sonicare heads</li>
            <li> The brush head is firm and allows a brushing with ease.</li>
            <li> They also have a green head that will start to fade when they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I still used them, because I don&#x27;t like to waste money.</li>
            <li> so I was not available to sign for the package.</li>
            <li> My wife uses a Sonic toothbrush and gets these replacement heads a few times each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dentist told me a few years ago, &amp;#34;I want to tell you in the nicest way I can, that your teeth and gums are terrible&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> They vibrate mad fast.</li>
            <li> There are less expensive ones, but it is pay me now or pay me later.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not ok, and I just wasted my money buying them online.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that the generic version of this head is a poor substitute for the name brand.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was slightly difficult to open but Frustration-Free packaging was not available in Canada.</li>
            <li> totally satisfied - tried a knock off brand of replacement brush heads and was very disappointed -</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little too hard for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow.</li>
            <li> No more excuses now</li>
            <li> I usually buy the replacement at Target.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading some reviews about these heads seeming to be knock-offs or not fitting correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is raving about these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brush heads for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> i have been using sonicare for years, my dentist recommended to me there is no better  product on the market</li>
            <li> the 2 minute timer is a bonus, i usually do 2 2 minute sessions when i brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> Not sure what others received.</li>
            <li> But in terms of convenience, the price difference is a small consideration.</li>
            <li> The heads have always lasted well over 3 months in the past.</li>
            <li> for the past 7-8 years.  </li>
            <li> Gotta brush your teeth everyday!  </li>
            <li> this expensive should last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> They are a little less expensive then the stores</li>
            <li> These causes the brush head to vibrate on the toothbrush base and thus slows down the brush action against my teeth.</li>
            <li> The generics also will stop vibrating if you press too hard.  </li>
            <li> Brush is not to hard</li>
            <li> if I hand brush, I hardly ever brush that</li>
            <li> At least they</li>
            <li> Soft\\&quot; for decades, and when you switch from manual, regular-soft toothbrushes, there is a feeling of disappointment at the \\&quot;extra</li>
            <li> but they make a HORRIBLE sound as you brush.  </li>
            <li> When I contacted the company they were argumentative, rude, and basically offered no solutions.</li>
            <li> They told me  &amp;#34; I &amp;#34; was being rude.  </li>
            <li> my experience at least.</li>
            <li> At least 3-4 months</li>
            <li> I have owned Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for at least 15 years....</li>
            <li> These make it happen at least if you have a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started slow to get my gums &#x27;up to speed&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Also very little tartar and plaque builds up on my teeth anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never brush with an ordinary toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> One of the Brush heads will not screw on so not able to use!</li>
            <li> I have an older model base</li>
            <li> This is the second shipment of these replacement brush heads I have received where they do not screw on tightly to the base.  </li>
            <li> But the express fee is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a Chinese made product now which is too bad, is there anything not made n China...</li>
            <li> After a few days, one broke -- the magnets inside detached, rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> I use these and Doctor&#x27;s brush picks, and The hygienist went from having to do a LOT of work twice a year, to hardly anything once a year!</li>
            <li> These seemed to be of extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li> so it made an awful noise and did not vibrate much.  </li>
            <li> so am a bit behind in tossing</li>
            <li> Hate using a regular toothbrush now!</li>
            <li> They were HORRIBLE and barely worked.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these obvious knockoffs.</li>
            <li> two little magnets on the base of the brush section appear to be rusting????  </li>
            <li> I do find it weird that we have to replace so much&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Be wary.</li>
            <li> It is now difficult to find in the &amp;#34;stores.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads tend to be fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> They are but too expensive for two heads</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush type for years, and I always dread buying the replacement heads because they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> (People are uncomfortable about a statement like that.</li>
            <li> Too expensive replacement.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but you knew that when you purchased the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It is TOOOO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> They ARE expensive.</li>
            <li> but it was extremely difficult to get it because of the shipping method used.</li>
            <li> But way too expensive for some brush heads.</li>
            <li> Then the wife dropped the unit and it sounds like there is a rabid wolverine getting attacked by angry bees when its turned on.</li>
            <li> Remember this is Pastor George, and I wouldn&#x27;t steer you wrong.</li>
            <li> i AM SORRY TO REPORT THAT i AM DISSAPPOINTED  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> A very poor design.</li>
            <li> Inside the toothbrush and the head mold grows like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds crazy but after a couple of weeks I had to throw them both away.</li>
            <li> The replacement toothbrush heads are stupid expensive at the store, so we&#x27;ve been buying these from Amazon instead.</li>
            <li> giving it one star because of bad packaging.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.  </li>
            <li> Packaged so badly that when trying to remove one of the two brushes I damaged it beyond repair.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this price.</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> but they were so expensive!!</li>
            <li> It is the battery base that does not hold up over time.</li>
            <li> They made noise, didn&#x27;t tighten on base correctly, and basically did nothing.</li>
            <li> The connection to the base has a color band and a gap where all your dribbled out toothpaste and spit accumulate.  </li>
            <li> I get very uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t use sonicare!!</li>
            <li> Plus they make a terrible buzzing noise.  </li>
            <li> but they were awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> At least they fit,&lt;br /&gt;but I do find it weird that we have to replace so much&lt;br /&gt;for this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;it feels I&#x27;m replacing 1/2 the toothbrush, rather than just the head, so that&#x27;s not really against these, but the original product......</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my philips electric touthbrush that I bought at Amazon so I am happy to be able to get the replacement.Best of all it only took one day with amazon prime!!</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little too hard for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect except for the gunk that gets underneath and into the handle...</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  It was as advertised and has been working flawlessly with my eSeries Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way that the generic version of this head is a poor substitute for the name brand.  The price is a little better online than I can get in town.  Highly recommend this head.</li>
            <li> these are a must have replacement heads if you have the old sonic brush and you can&#x27;t beat the price any where either..I will continue to purchase these as long as my sonic toothbrush hold up</li>
            <li> Magnetic force could last longer. After about a month of use, the head does not vibrate as fast even with cleansing.</li>
            <li> it works and it came in timely manner. I recommend it to any one.. I have been using philips tooth brush for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Sonicare for many years! This particular one is pretty old and I wanted a new one (slimmer) so I gave this one to hubby. These new brush heads keeps the Sonicare brand new plus they come with a lid to keep bathroom germs from getting onto your brush. You should replace the brush head every 3 months which is what we do. Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Sonicare and the best pricing is on Amazon. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are the genuine Sonicare E-Series replacement heads, but the ones I received were not in frustration-free packaging. They were in a typical plastic clamshell that I cut open with scissors. I didn&#x27;t really matter to me, but if you&#x27;re buying these specifically for easier packaging, be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare tooth brush for quite some time.  I currently order these using amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; to make sure I get replacements when I need them.  They are high quality and last me several months.  No cavity&#x27;s yet!</li>
            <li> This is the second shipment of these replacement brush heads I have received where they do not screw on tightly to the base.  These causes the brush head to vibrate on the toothbrush base and thus slows down the brush action against my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got a really great price for these replacement brush heads.  It has been about six months and its time to change brush heads, I found these just in time.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes and I like getting them on a recurring plan so I don&#x27;t even have to really think about it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic heads. I purchased these and they completely do the job. Saw my hygienist last week and she commented that the tartar, plaque on my teeth is virtually nonexistent. also, my gums are in perfect shape after using these heads. Love these brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for more than 15 years, and the product continues to do a remarkable job keeping my teeth, including tartar, amazingly clean. In addition, the toothbrush itself remains strong even after many years of use.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever.  My dentist is pleased also.</li>
            <li> works great, great price also!</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> One of these broke a few weeks after use. Not sure what happened, but it&#x27;s like the head got off center and wouldn&#x27;t brush right? Other than that, the other one lasted as long as it should. I will definitely reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what we wanted and they work great.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads for the value. They came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It will charge and then when I go to use it,it will vibrate for less than a minute.  what a waste of $.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Arrived reasonably well-packed.  Replacement heads worked like a charm.  I enjoyed a significant improvement in performance over the used heads.</li>
            <li> Amazing cleaning power!</li>
            <li> I really love the Sonicare toothbrush.  Makes me teeth feel super clean and the charge lasts for a while if you take it on vacation.</li>
            <li> works great , fits our hx5910 e series</li>
            <li> These restored usefulness to an old Sonicare portable toothbrush.  And, they added the new style of brushing, instead of the older rotary movement, both of which I use and both of which have reduced my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> i will never buy the generic refills again</li>
            <li> Good value, worked perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fits my e-series toothbrush holder perfectly!  A great value!</li>
            <li> Good price, delivered at door and cleans teeth.</li>
            <li> use 3 times a day.  really has cleaning power.</li>
            <li> Great replacement and as much cheaper than in stores.  I have purchases these about 3 times.</li>
            <li> Great value to purchase two for one and the quarterly shipping program is wonderful.  Keeps you on target in changing out your toothbrush heads timely. Recommend the autoship. easy to cancel when ready to do cancel</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!  My teeth and gums always feel great after brushing with the Sonicare brush.  I like them so much I have these on subscription status.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the generic and they aren&#x27;t worth it.  These are soft without being too soft.  The generics also will stop vibrating if you press too hard.  Better price on amazon than at Target - especially if you do &amp;#34;subscribe and save.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Worked fine... decent price.  Love my Sonicare</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush but always forget to buy the replacement heads.  No more excuses now that I figured out I can buy them on Amazon.  Why didn&#x27;t I realize this earlier?</li>
            <li> got the items in a timely maner. good fit thanks</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re replacement brush-heads, and they work just fine.  Not a lot more to say really.</li>
            <li> Be wary. These bristlers are much harder and sharper than the ones that come with the sonicare (at least mine). Literally, if you&#x27;re not careful, they will strip away the flesh on your gums. It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with a chain saw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s attractive, compact and light weight. whenever I accidentally touch it to a tooth it&#x27;s very jarring and the bzztt sound is annoying.</li>
            <li> Works fine, brushes teeth, easy to clean and easy to replace brushes.</li>
            <li> They dont seem to vibrate as agressivley as the regular Philips heads</li>
            <li> been using this toothbrush for some years.  great to have the refills.</li>
            <li> The comes as a two pack and fit easily on the sonicare toothbrush. Great price, excellent delivery, arrived on time and work as they should. Would recommend this seller and will do business with them again.</li>
            <li> The head on my Sonicare toothbrush was getting worn and needed replacing.  This set cost me only about twenty bucks which is much less than local retail stores were charging and has given my Sonicare new life.  Delivery was quick.  Although I had not noticed the slow decline it appears that the magnet in my old toothbrush head had weakened over time.  The brushing action of these new heads is much more vigorous.</li>
            <li> Use Phillips Sonicare every morning and night.  Have cut way back on plac and no cavities!</li>
            <li> performs as well as the orginal brush head...screws on easily to e-series brush base, no unusal noises....overall great product and good price compared to big box storea. i will definaltely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Happy with the quality and purchase. No complaints. Purchased them to fit my existing E series Sonicare. Came packaged like a standard in-store purchase, no defects, and they are operating just fine. I would recommend to anyone looking for replacement brush heads. And to anyone who is purchasing a Philips Sonicare for the first time - congrats! Welcome to the world of impressing your dentist with your whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and still using it.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush heads fit my eseries sonicare.  They seem to wear out quickly, but this is just probably how they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I wanted to be sure not to get&lt;br /&gt;the generic ones.  The true Sonic-are do not make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> They work as they should but couldn&#x27;t give five stars do to the fact they are noisier than originals.</li>
            <li> Dropped on the floor and one head broke.  Other ones in past have not broken before but don&#x27;t think its right to try and return a toothbrush.  Will go for the generic store brands that are half price next time.</li>
            <li> No complaints! We use these brush heads for last 5 years and replace every 4-5 months (should replace 3 every months). I think replacing every 6 months make no sense,. I learned from one of the dental nurses that we should use the sonic brushes in a gentle manner, because of their vibration, its easy to grind teeth faster, than we are generally aware of. I get very uncomfortable if I don&#x27;t use sonicare!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It is now difficult to find in the &amp;#34;stores.&amp;#34;  Amazon makes it available, and at a discount price.</li>
            <li> These are great brush heads.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried the &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; ones you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.  The genuine ones are the only way to go.  I&#x27;ve been buying these for the past 4 years and have never had a single issue.</li>
            <li> Good price, great delivery...what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This toothbrush head is great.  I can&#x27;t believe I used to use a plain old manual toothbrush.  It&#x27;s the best thing since before sliced bread. :-)</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush.  When I&#x27;m done brushing, my teeth feel really clean!  I also like the fact that the head is small and not large.</li>
            <li> The brushes work fine, but the S+H was way to much considering the size and weight.</li>
            <li> These heads were much needed.  Appreciated the discount.  Would recommend to family and friends.  Thanks a bunch for the great deal.</li>
            <li> Great product, I order these for my Sonicare toothbrush mainly because Amazon sells them much cheaper then anywhere else (except for the larger packs found at Sam&#x27;s Club and Costco). These toothbrush replacements are well built last just as long as any you buy from the store, but buyer beware; when buying from sellers other then Amazon you may receive units that are of subpar build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance I order a set and only one worked, when I pressed the toothbrush too my mouth that ultra-fast oscillation stopped and the toothbrush became just any other toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed using my sonicare toothbrush so much, that I decided to buy one for my fiancé. Find these replacement heads through Amazon is a great value, just make sure you buy them from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> Performance is spectacular.</li>
            <li> We thought we would have to buy new tooth brushes until we found these.  Great!</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting the right model but it fits and works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did find a generic brand later at Walgreen&#x27;s for $2 less...</li>
            <li> I purchase two brush heads. I threw the first brush head away after it&#x27;s first use because it was very loud. The second brush head lasted one week before it created a loud high pitch noise. Sonicare has a problem with this product and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads tend to be fairly expensive. These were half price As far as I can tell, they are the same as the full-price heads. I&#x27;m thinking of stocking up if more are still available.</li>
            <li> Good price on the replacement heads, and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> these seem to be made a little cheaper.  they are ok.</li>
            <li> I only use these replacement brush heads and I am very happy with them. I have used them for years, and will continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting the Phillips Sonicare refil toothbrushes for several years now. They are a little less expensive then the stores and it also reminds me to change every 3 months</li>
            <li> Received item as described.</li>
            <li> Authentic Sonicare brush heads. Delivered super fast, 2 days to Hawaii, unheard of. Both come with a brush head cover and different colored rings, in original packaging. There&#x27;s nothing like screwing on a new sonicare brush and using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> great - but wears down very quickly...</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> We use them 2 to 3 times daily&lt;br /&gt;.They work good but should be replaced at 6-8 months to work as new</li>
            <li> These heads are stiff - not soft  and they work great. Nothing cleans your teeth better.  I have used the Sonicare electric  tooth brush for years and am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> Picked these up because they had the Phillips name on the package, but were a little cheaper than the others.  The bristles seem a little stiffer than what I had before, but after using them for a month, had my cleaning appointment at the periodontist, and came out with flying colors.  Would highly recommend these be considered for the cost savings.</li>
            <li> I returned them because I changed toothbrushes and these no longer fit my new toothbrush. I think I can get the new ones cheaper locally with a coupon.</li>
            <li> Dentist visits have been way better since using Sonicare. Doesn&#x27;t get any easier that mail order replacement heads that are always in stock.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is the standard (not sensitive) replacement heads - what a pleasure to use. I recommend this to the sonicare users</li>
            <li> After buying the generic replacements, I understand why using the name brand brush heads is so important -- they work much, much better.</li>
            <li> Rougher vibrations than previous replacements.</li>
            <li> These work great, and why wouldn&#x27;t they?!  They are factory exact units, bought at a fraction of retail cost.  I compare pricing for a living, and these are sold by this vendor at a great price!  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I replaced my other Phillips Sonicare with this.  It is a clean design and good quality as before.  It doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as before though.</li>
            <li> Just ok the bristle head seemed really small on this one but had a good price. Will look around when I need to purchase bristle heads in the future.</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;m still able to get these heads since my Sonic is old but still the best.</li>
            <li> Must have tooth brush heads. The sonicare system is amazing and my teeth are left amazingly fresh and clean. Will continue to buy replacement heads as needed.</li>
            <li> I have loved my Sonicare since the day I got it. The brush heads are more expensive than I would like but I have tried some of the generic brands available on Amazon and they just don&#x27;t seem to fit or work as the Philips brand.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came very quickly. Have been using the Sonicare E series for the last year and cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for many years and decided to save some money on brush heads so I bought these.  I don&#x27;t understand the reviews on this product, unless I received a different product.  This brush is so soft that it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> Works great. In recent weeks, the head seemed soft and not working well. I hadn&#x27;t realized it had been 2 years since I got it. Switched to head #2 and it&#x27;s back to working right again. Long life; low price.</li>
            <li> Best tooth cleaning product on the market.  Doctor recommended and hygienist recommended.  Glad I purchased it and my husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for any one that wants to Have just out of the Dentist office clean..............I wouldn&#x27;t ever use anything else!!!!!!!!!!! Been using this system for the last 15 yrs......can&#x27;t imagine my teeth without these</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are a perfect fit, but they are poorer quality than earlier versions in that the bristles are softer. I guess they don&#x27;t make them like they used to. They arrived early, which is a huge plus and I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare E Series heads were exactly as advertised. There are not generic replacements and they work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes were exactly as advertised and fit our older Advanced series machine.  Although time will tell about durability, they have worked perfectly to date (one month of usage).</li>
            <li> Great price--even beats Walmarts low price</li>
            <li> This is a replacement head for the E5300 it works just like the original.  I have learned from a long time of using electric toothbrushes, you should always go with the branded heads, they just work better.</li>
            <li> When I got these and installed one on toothbrush.....nothing happened. Then tried new brush head on husband&#x27;s toothbrush and it worked fine. Had to scrap toothbrush and purchase new one. Will still need these brush heads for the future. I love the way this brush cleans.</li>
            <li> hope you keep having them as i order them often</li>
            <li> fit my series 1 perfect</li>
            <li> Great product.. Fast shipping, even to Hawaii. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the this and one of the heads was noisy and defective. I posted feedback on Amazon and within a few hours I had a voicemail and an email letting me know a replacement was in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I can buy these anywhere but from now on I will only by them from Sun Valley Dental Products as the customer service is outstanding and the guarantee is amazing - thanks Joseph and the Sun Valley crew!</li>
            <li> These worked really well and a good price.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape and as advertised.</li>
            <li> giving it one star because of bad packaging. when will these guys start using frustration free packaging. otherwise it is a standard product</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> It works with Sonicare and the price is good. Ship and Save option takes the need to remember to replace toothbrush when you&#x27;re supppose to.  I recommend you try Ship and Save.</li>
            <li> We purchased some Equate brand replacement heads at Wal-mart. They were HORRIBLE and barely worked. Within one day I ordered the Phillips brand replacements. Never again will I try an off-brand head for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;Like Philips says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Extra Soft Bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they were \\&quot;Regular Soft,\\&quot; then maybe they would last longer before deforming.  By making the bristles \\&quot;Extra Soft\\&quot; and short lived, it adds to the market-abuse by this overpriced product.  Also 5-out-of-4 dentists have recommended \\&quot;Regular Soft\\&quot; for decades, and when you switch from manual, regular-soft toothbrushes, there is a feeling of disappointment at the \\&quot;extra softness\\&quot; of the sonicare heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Replace Every Three Months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the advice to Replace Every Three Months is way too optimistic.  In my experience, the heads last about a month before the bristles start showing visual signs of deforming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that after three months, only half the bristles would be pointing in the right direction to probe between the teeth.  And considering that the \\&quot;Standard\\&quot; head is kind of small to begin with, I think the head should be changed at the first sight of bristle-deformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Jan 8 2013,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2010 and 2011, a subscription to these brush-heads ran about $18 to ship a pair.  In 2012, the bristles and the part number changed (without explanation -- I love that), and the price went up to $19.  I guess 2013 isn&#x27;t a lucky number, because now the price for a pair [on my subscription] has jumped to $23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting; on the Item Page, the price for a subscription says, \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save: Save 5% $25.52.\\&quot;  They&#x27;re quoting a much stingier discount for the subscription than I&#x27;m being offered.  But when I look at \\&quot;My Subscriptions,\\&quot; they still show a 15% discount.  Maybe they have a two-tiered discount rate for old subscriptions vs. new subscriptions.  Either way, they&#x27;re starting to scrimp on their subscription discount for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have noticed that I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to the price of these heads, because paying more than $2 for a toothbrush that lasts a month instead of a year like my old manuals strikes me asbeing criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I will hit on a friend who has a membership at Sams Club to get me 4-packs of these for (calculating...) $19.50 per pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I&#x27;m impressed that Amazon used to have Sams beat.  When the tide turns, I&#x27;ll be happy to stop imposing on my friends, and switch from Sams back to Amazon.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m fuming a little.  Occupy Philips.</li>
            <li> Excellent price. Great fit. Fast shipping. What more can you ask for? If you own a sonicare you know it&#x27;s quality. I always shop around for a better price...amazon never fails.</li>
            <li> Affordable and a perfect fit! Set of 2! Fits my sonic are eseries!! Definitely recommended if you are looking for replacement heads!!</li>
            <li> Part of its green bristles slowly get lighter as it wears out, unlike the original brush heads.  So I like them.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at good price. I use Elite Sonicare for 3 years and it meets my needs. I recommend it to people with tartar problems.Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the best system to use for keeping your teeth and gums healthy.  I will always purchase Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> I knew what I needed but could not find at Walgreens. It was simple to order this and no tax</li>
            <li> These are great replacement heads. Having them shipped automatically from Amazon ensures I change my brush heads every six months as recommended.</li>
            <li> They work very well and are comfortable to use and handle. They are easy to interchange. Provided a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Each iteration of the brushes seems to have slightly different bissell color layout (all have been green),and as far as I can tell this is just a marketing gimmick, which I suppose keeps Phillips engineering/marketing people employed, which is a good thing, but adds no noticeable functional value. I floss, use a waterpik and the Sonicare. Sonicare design allows better brushing of all tooth surfaces front to back than manual brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit into electric holder is not as simple as it should be - it doesn&#x27;t just slide in and will allow reverse installation, which is a very minor inconvenience.,</li>
            <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, I have for many years used this. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> love my sonic care toothbrush; they hold up well for the 3 months I keep them&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it (expensive relative to the standard brush) it&#x27;s a nice toiletry luxury</li>
            <li> The first brush head lasted only 3 months and had to be replaced. The metal part that makes it vibrate worked loose and it just made a lot of noise but no brushing action.</li>
            <li> Big difference between these and the generics. These are much better</li>
            <li> This Brush is Fine. Every thing you would want in a replacement. It is the battery base that does not hold up over time. What good is brush is the power base falls apart.</li>
            <li> I think these work better than the one it originally came with new. I saw the reviews on the aftermarket brushes from no-name places... stick with OEM. It&#x27;s well worth it! It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I got these to finally replace my tooth brush heads for an older Sonicare handle. The fit is perfect as expected, but the old handle will not move the new brush head unless I apply pressure to the back of the stem. Very strange. I am going to try it on my other older handle to see if that one works. Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li> I buy these on subscription. If I didn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t change the brush as often as I do.  My husband and I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several replacement heads from Amazon and most have been fine.  However, the brush heads in the last order have a problem as they do not function (vibrate) when installed on the Sonicare handle.  I found if I loosen the brush head quite a bit, it will somewhat work, but then water/toothpaste/saliva run down into the handle and its a mess.  Would return, but I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare products for years now and am very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> these brushes give their everything in service to my mouth. despite expiring after a few months of vigorous cleaning, these little beasts will leave your teeth sparkling like a candle floating through a crisp geneva moon-lit sky.</li>
            <li> Even though the mfr has &amp;#34;cost reduced&amp;#34; the item a few years back, it still works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love these, the imitations just dont compare.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have an older model base so I was concerned about getting the right replacement brush heads. These fit perfectly extending the life of my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Design flaw makes it sound like a buzz saw in your head. The magnet does not stay tightly connected to the brush. When it&#x27;s turned on, the magnet just rattles loudly without moving the brush as powerfully. I fixed by gorilla gluing the magnet to the stem and shaving off the excess glue, but shouldn&#x27;t have had to.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my Sonicare</li>
            <li> A good value for the money. What else is there to say about tooth brush heads for heaven&#x27;s sake? Gee whiz!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these brush heads, and have been subscribing for years with Amazon, to receive a shipment every 6 months, in order to change my brush head every 3 months.  With the subscription, the price is great, no shipping charges, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about ordering them in order to have them when I need them. Great deal!</li>
            <li> I like this brush keeps my teeth clean and i do recommend this product to every one give it a try</li>
            <li> I use my Sonicare every single day (and I love it).  The replacement heads were exactly what I wanted and at the right price. Very happy and will consider same source when I need to replace again.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything like it,the results of its use is great I wish I had it sooner I would  recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> Genuine Philips brushes. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my replacement heads. Fast shipping and good quality. I have used a Sonicare for 15 years and have replaced the heads several times. Have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and love it.  It&#x27;s much less jarring than the new line of small jolting toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;However, Walmart now has a line of replacement brush heads (2 pack) designed to fit e-series Sonic holders&lt;br /&gt;which is much cheaper.  Look at that one before you buy this one.</li>
            <li> Sonicare tooth brushes are great.  This is a genuine sonicare tooth brush head and it works great.  Keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for replacement heads for my Sonicare toothbrush for a while and finally found them at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush.  Well worth the money.  Amazon had a great price on the replacement brushes.  Recommended by my dentist.  I glad I got it.  Better check up since I got it.</li>
            <li> This product has always worked wonders for teeth cleaning and the price was beyond great! I usually buy the replacement at Target. What a value!</li>
            <li> I started using my sonicare about 20 years ago, and have been hooked on it since.  These are the perfect fit for my brand</li>
            <li> When my original brush needed replaced, I bought a generic pack of replacement brushes. Big mistake! They made noise, didn&#x27;t tighten on base correctly, and basically did nothing. These are just like the original - they work well and make brushing a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my new sonicare toothbrush and these replacement brushes are of course the same quality as the one that was provided with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for several years, regularly replacing the heads. This is the first time I have purchased the replacement heads online. These seemed to be of extremely poor quality. After just a few uses, the brush bristles were coming out in my mouth. The return policy for this product happens to not be worth the customer&#x27;s time and trouble--I pay for shipping and then I only receive a partial refund. Just thought I&#x27;d share a warning.</li>
            <li> Really effective in getting teeth clean...especially around the gum line. I&#x27;ll never brush with an ordinary toothbrush again! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a case where buying the name-brand is truly worth it. I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush (for only a few dollars less than Amazon&#x27;s price for these), and they were noisy junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phillips heads are well-made, durable, and quiet; I&#x27;m purchasing these from now on!</li>
            <li> Brush part - good.  No problems there.  The connection to the base has a color band and a gap where all your dribbled out toothpaste and spit accumulate.  Even if you rinse it off after use, it seems to collect stuff in the gap that after a week or so looks gross.  A very poor design.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are real sonicare brush replacements.  They do not fit properly and consequently much of the action of the brush is lost.  Plus they make a terrible buzzing noise.  I have purchased the cheaper off-brand brushes at a discount store and they also give you the same poor result.  I think these are a fake product, much like the cheap ones you can buy at the discount stores.  They don&#x27;t work!  I recently bought a completely new unit and the brush that came with it works perfectly. Buyer beware and be sure you are getting authentic Phillips Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years and really like the way it cleans my teeth and saves at the Dentist too.</li>
            <li> They were great, exactly hat I was looking for. Costco just has them cheaper and I didn&#x27;t realize it. A little over priced here since they&#x27;re about 30 in stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s criminal that a toothbrush head with a magnet that needs to be replaced every 3-4 months should cost over 10$, but the off-brand replacements are not much better price-wise, and are not as effective.  Go with the OEM heads.</li>
            <li> These can be hard to find in local stores and certainly not at such a good price. Highly recommended - I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> These heads fit great and they work great also. After using Sonicare I could never go back to using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was worried after reading some reviews about these heads seeming to be knock-offs or not fitting correctly. I love the option of low-plastic easy-to-open packaging, but because of the reviews of possible knock-offs, I went with the normal packaging which would be less likely to have been tampered with.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to open the packaging that the heads are packaged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes work fine with my Sonicare E series toothbrush.</li>
            <li> terrific product wife and i have been using it for years every day it does a very good job cleaning teeth.  Philips Sonicare replacement brush heads</li>
            <li> 2 minutes keep your teeth healthy and clean, ready for your next cleaning appointment.  works perfectly with floss used daily</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushheads for four years and have been very pleased with them.My dentist has also been quite happy with the results of using them .</li>
            <li> Good fit on my existing sonic are e series toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had not updated my brush heads in a long time and what a great difference in the brush feeling against my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the original brushes by Philips, in original packaging, and therefore work fine.  These are not aftermarket.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of replacement brush heads from a local grocery store and when using them I realized why they were cheap! These are of the original style and you will notice the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> These work well on my older Sonicare brush. (The brush itself now needs to be recharged after every use - batteries getting old no do</li>
            <li> Because of the mixed reviews for the generic heads, I stick to the OEM heads, and have never had any issues.</li>
            <li> I have an old Sonicare Advance (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called?), and these fit the handle just fine.  They look really different from the old style brush heads, but they actually feel and work much better.</li>
            <li> Works very well! I&#x27;m never going back to regular toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and it saved me a trip to Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has save my teeth. This is a recommended product that will keep you teeth clean and happy. Ask your dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a bit expensive for a tooth brush, much much cheaper than a dental bill.. Brush and floss the teeth you want to keep.</li>
            <li> Ever since I began using Sonicare, my teeth actually look better. This product is worth the money, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare brush heads for several years. They are excellent in cleaning teeth and good for the gums.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering these brush heads thru Amazon I found the price to be the best, compared to other retailers.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and on time and the frustration free packaging was a little tougher to open than it should have and the they don&#x27;t offer softer brushes so you can strip the enamel off your teeth if you are not careful</li>
            <li> Once I figured out the right technique of using this toothbrush, I loved it. After reading other views, I went with the traditional packaging bc some said the actual toothbrushes didn&#x27;t hold up as well if they were packaged in the cardboard. Who knows. However these were just as if I had bought them from the store. I also bought those Steripod things to sanitize and protect it while it sits out on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! A definite upgrade over the previous version sold by Sonicare. I thought I&#x27;d try a version sold by Walgreens, but this was a huge mistake. These cost just a little more, but are well worth it. I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now and have had no problems of any kind. In fact, it seems to do a good job of staying ahead of plaque issues. As a periodontal patient, this is a must!</li>
            <li> The heads fit perfectly and work as advertised.  I would definitely recommend this product to others.  Received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the e series for 3 years and as of recent the battery needs recharging more often.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other&lt;br /&gt;kind of power brush.  Will upgrade to the Healthy White Sonicare when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it protects against sun burn, does not smell, and feels good on the skin. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> They brush heads fit but they make a HORRIBLE sound as you brush.  SO LOUD. Not worth the money you save. Get the real deal--which these are not.</li>
            <li> Nice, trouble-free product.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my toothbrush.  Had purchased one at Walmart that said it was the correct one and it wasn&#x27;t even close, was way too long.  These were actually less expensive than Walmart was and are a perfect fit,  Great service from vendor..</li>
            <li> Probably cleans teeth ok, but creates so much gunk in its interstices that it is a constant nuisance.</li>
            <li> These were not genuine sonicare heads so I returned them. The knock offs are much noisier and don&#x27;t clean as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fits with my Sonicare HX 5610 e series. More affordable than the ones sold in stores. Legitimate brand and not a dupe. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Original equipment so they better be good, right?  They are but too expensive for two heads but that&#x27;s Sonicare for you.</li>
            <li> Works great! Fair quality!!! This is a Chinese made product now which is too bad, is there anything not made n China...but it works.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find these brush heads at such a reasonable price.  I bought three packs since they were such a good buy!</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company they were argumentative, rude, and basically offered no solutions. They wanted me to do all the work tracking the package, instead of remembering that I was the customer and they were the seller.  They have not given my money back and they have not sent the product.  They  say that the name of their company is (get this) &amp;#34;super honest.&amp;#34;  You can&#x27;t make this stuff up.  Remember what your parents taught you (because I  temporarily forgot), if someone has to tell you how honest they are-they usually aren&#x27;t.  I told them I was going to attach their rude emails to me  to this review, and if anyone is interested I saved them. (too long to attach)  I even tried to make a joke in ONE OF MY SEVERAL EMAILS back and forth to them(because they argue not solve)by telling them my dogs did  not sign for the package.  There is no sense of humor at that workplace. They told me  &amp;#34; I &amp;#34; was being rude.  They clearly have customer service issues.  The issue is there &amp;#34;is&amp;#34; no customer service.</li>
            <li> Always nice to have the new brush heads.  What&#x27;s to say....toothbrush performs like new.  Very happy with them.  Just as described.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product! We&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for years and it does a great job. It makes our dentist&#x27;s job easy. It&#x27;s nice that you can still get the older model heads on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB.  I&#x27;M SURE THERE ARE OTHER UNITS THAT COULD DO BETTER, BUT THEY ARE A LOT MORE MONEY.  THIS WILL SUFFICE FOR NOW.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been ordering these every 3 months to replace our current heads and to maintain a clean environment for our mouths;) They always work, most likely would last longer than 3 months, but this is our dentist recommendation.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush type for years, and I always dread buying the replacement heads because they are so expensive. I found these and when they came in, they were the EXACT same product that Walmart was selling for over $20 less. I am VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, plain and simple. Was worried the head wouldn&#x27;t fit the brush but it was perfect. :)</li>
            <li> authentic Sonicare not generic.  work fine and the price is better than local store costs.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth with these babies.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re refills, so not much to write about.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know as yet about this order!  It works OK except that water gets into the well of the base so I must watch that and clean it out at least once a week.  Also, and more disturbing, the (I believe) two little magnets on the base of the brush section appear to be rusting????  I have used Philips Sonicare for many years and have had to deal with water getting inside the instrument, but I have never seen anything like rusting in the brush section.  Can anyone explain this to me????</li>
            <li> My husband has an E-Series toothbrush that is still going strong after a few years. The replacement toothbrush heads are stupid expensive at the store, so we&#x27;ve been buying these from Amazon instead. Since they&#x27;re made by Philips I don&#x27;t have to wonder if they&#x27;ll fit the toothbrush. These fit and work perfectly every time we&#x27;ve ordered them. I try to order them through subscribe and save because it makes them much more affordable. I also appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to go to the store and try to find the right replacement every time. Convenient &amp; affordable</li>
            <li> wish this was cheaper but its worth the price</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and love the fact that we can have the heads automatically delivered to us every 3 months via Amazon subscribe-and-save. New brush heads are healthy and a joy to use!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and years. I have these on subscribe and save, it is sent to be every two months. Works great.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a replacement for the original brush head that came with my toothbrush. They were different and more stiff so I did have to get used to it. After I got used to the brush heads, it was great. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Manual toothbrushes are fine, but having a brush that ensures you get 2 minutes of brushing is great.  The replacement heads fit my base and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect toothbrush and comes to your own home every three months.  Could not be any easier and the price is right</li>
            <li> Use these with my rechargeable Phillips Sonicare Toothbrush. I like the way my teeth feel clean clean after I use this brush.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, THAT is what they are supposed to feel like!  After waiting way too long to replace my head I got this and WOW what a difference!</li>
            <li> perfect fit and replacement for the original head that came with my toothbrush. i like the face its a double pack</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I purchased Equate Brand heads from Wal-Mart, because they were $5 cheaper. It was SO NOISY. I was really peeved that the product was that lousy, so I returned them and bought these. I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare since the early 1980&#x27;s when it was provided to me by a dentist for a clinical trial. It makes an enormous difference in how much plaque builds up between twice-yearly cleanings. I would never go back to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads were scheduled to be delivered in 2 days, but they arrived the very next day! The new head has a lot more vigorous vibration, so I think it really is important to replace the heads every 6 months, even if the bristles show no wear. I love Amazon, and I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Okay, so here is what I don&#x27;t like, mold.  Inside the toothbrush and the head mold grows like crazy.  I kept smelling this foul odor while brushing my teeth and took it apart.  I saw mold where the two connect.  I cleaned that and still smelled something.  So I looked an inside the body of the replacement head and it had a lot of mold.  I used a small piece of metal to scrape around a little in there and then rinsed it out and many large pieces of mold came out and I know I could not get all of it.  It doesn&#x27;t smell so much anymore, but I will probably replace it soon.  I have only been using this replacement head for about 2 months or less.</li>
            <li> They are replacement heads. Not much else to say. They work perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is raving about these replacement heads. These are so much louder than the original ones that came with my toothbrush. Even the logo wore off after a week of brushing ... Makes wonder if these are are impostors. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this product was the right replacement brushes for my Sonicare handle. Works for me!</li>
            <li> It is worth paying the extra money for the Philips brush heads. The cheaper imposter brands are loud, and I do not feel like they vibrate as much. Just pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> The formica doesn&#x27;t look as smart as in the picture. It&#x27;s very functional, however, and ingeniously engineered.</li>
            <li> Have used Sonicare for manny years and have received compliments on how well I have been caring for my teeth between dental appointments.</li>
            <li> First time after many good replacement orders. Bristles were all chopped down with maybe 6 bristles at correct height on both items. Could not return as the return time had run out. If you order them I suggest you examine the bristles first for this defect so you can return them right away</li>
            <li> Brissels keep falling out.</li>
            <li> These brushes do NOT hold up.</li>
            <li> I always get good compliments from the dentist on my brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heads always work well, and last a good 4 months. Overall I can&#x27;t complain, but I do wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Philips sonicare  E series e toothbrush heads are expensive but effective. Don&#x27;t try the generic ones...quality inferior to the real deal..my experience at least.</li>
            <li> It is the brand name type. Works just like the one that came with the sonicare out of the box</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected to get - very pleased to have found these. I will order them again and again as needed for as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> I have the toothbrush and I needed replacement heads. The product is reasonably priced and it pays to buy online</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and happy with the product. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy online. Will buy more later.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I ordered this, because the stem of the brush head looked a little skinny and flimsy in the photo.  But it is quite sturdy and fits my Sonicare Advance perfectly, and has been working great for weeks.  Seller shipped quickly.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> These are exact replacement and are available at various retailers, but having them delivered to your door for a slightly cheaper price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.</li>
            <li> Works with the unit just fine.</li>
            <li> I just find these are too soft and wear down quickly. Eventually even with the amazing feel of the electronic brush, my teeth would not be clean after a thorough brush. I&#x27;ve since returned to manual toothbrushes. Bonus is that it&#x27;s a pretty strong magnet in the brush you can hack and use when done with the brush.</li>
            <li> The first order I received had one defective brush that did not contact the base properly so it made an awful noise and did not vibrate much.  I placed a poor review and the seller immediately contacted me and sent out a new order priority mail with no need to send the old brushes back.  The new brushes work just fine.  This company very much impressed me and I would order from them again without any hesitation, in fact, I will look for items from them as opposed to other sellers since I know they take care of their customers!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> They were a better lower price than at any local store. They work better than generic brands and color fades when they need to be replaced. I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these and they don&#x27;t work correctly. I think they may get damaged in shipping and the magnets on the bottom loosen up from the plastic? I had to grab a 6 pack at Costco to test against it and those worked way better.</li>
            <li> As a sonicare family, we look for great deals when replacing our toothbrush heads. The product arrived on time and packed well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a 2 pack of Sonicare brush heads. They go on the handle. They vibrate mad fast. They clean your teeth. Joyous celebration.</li>
            <li> Been meaning to buy some brush heads for my Sonicare but they were so expensive!! But found these for quite a reasonable price so I am very, very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price. It fits my husband&#x27;s and my tooth brush perfectly. Read description to make sure it will fit yours.</li>
            <li> I appreciate how easy it is to change heads on this model. I might prefer the smaller heads, which is why this is not 5 stars, but if this is what you want, it is a really good price.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve ever ordered my Sonicare replacement heads online. I will never do it again! I will go back to purchasing them at the store. This is a 2-pack. Today, I finally gave up on the first replacement head &amp; threw it in the trash. It was SO LOUD, everytime I brushed my teeth I had a headache &amp; ringing ears when I was done! I have used Sonicare for 10 years now, and have never had that kind of experience with any replacement head that I&#x27;ve EVER used. I believe it may have been the fact that one of the magnets was corroded. It arrived that way, and stupid me, I figured it would be ok. But, it&#x27;s not ok, and I just wasted my money buying them online. I will never purchase them online again.</li>
            <li> I change the brush head every 3 months on my Sonicare electric toothbrush. I have been using these brush heads for the past 10 years. Great product. I have good dental checkups every six months and believe it is because of the product.</li>
            <li> Good product as expected!</li>
            <li> Work for me, and cheaper than others I have ordered or purchased locally.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect just like the original.  No problems with it.  The bristles are very sturdy. I believe it is an original replacement.</li>
            <li> The schedule for shipping is just right. The old brushes looks pretty good until the new ones arrive.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using Sonicare for thirty years or more since we saw Oprah recommend it on her old&lt;br /&gt;show. (People are uncomfortable about a statement like that. Probably 30 million viewers watched&lt;br /&gt; but only 1 million admitted it....and then with a disguised voice or Groucho Marx black glasses and mustache.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We still use the original model power handle. It has been factory replaced about five or six times&lt;br /&gt;with a minimum cost on each occasion. I suppose we should examine the new models. Perhaps they are&lt;br /&gt;more powerful, faster or able to leap tall buildings.....We are M &amp; F 82 &amp; 81. Probably best if we stay with&lt;br /&gt;the person who brought us to the dance.  Clarke &amp; Lois&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(James E. &amp; Elizabeth M. Connelly.Jr.)</li>
            <li> I was using the Kroger replacement brush heads for a long time, not realizing that they honestly do not work the same. I bought these after I read another review stating the operation and feel was different in the knockoffs. The real Sonicare heads are amazingly different. More vibration, better clean, better debris removal...I will not buy cheap replacements again.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush as much as one can love a tooth brush. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the brush heads. It was no problem switching them out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand maybe they are defective or knock offs or something. I was just trying to save a couple dollars buy buying them on amazon. I tried both brush heads. They make this loud high pitch whine. It&#x27;s so loud in my mouth it rattles my nose and makes me sneeze. I know that sounds crazy but after a couple of weeks I had to throw them both away. It was so unpleasant first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> worked great and a nice cost savings</li>
            <li> Just as expected. I&#x27;m just happy I got a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Buy the authentic Phillips replacement brush heads.  Other replacement brush cost less but you get less.</li>
            <li> Too expensive replacement. Buy other electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sometimes store brand substitutions are not worth the savings. Though clunky and harder to clean then other leading brands, I would recommend not purchasing the store brand &amp;#34;its good enough to work&amp;#34; and just spend the extra few dollars on the real heads. They fit properly and wont stop with the slightest of pressure.</li>
            <li> The brush head is firm and allows a brushing with ease. The handle fits in your hand and the speed of the brushing is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love my Eseries toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement brush for this Sonicare electric toothbrush. Not always easy to find in a retali store.</li>
            <li> fit perfectly on my sonicare toothbrush and was the best price around</li>
            <li> we love our sonics and these heads work perfect</li>
            <li> am enjoying this fine product, the brushes are of quality proportions. give my regards to the current manufacturer..Have a good day.</li>
            <li> Not real sonicare brush. Very disappointed in these obvious knockoffs.</li>
            <li> These are top quality and priced much lower than Walmart, Target</li>
            <li> last time, I bought an off brand won&#x27;t do that ever again.  this is one product where buying the brand matters!  these last the entire 90 days, and are quiet, the others were loud and didn&#x27;t make it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush rocks! It changed my mouth. And I later found out that it&#x27;s the same thing my prosthodontist and his family use!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, as I was unable to locate this item locally.</li>
            <li> They work alright and fit on the toothbrush but the head is much smaller than the last time I ordered them.</li>
            <li> These heads are exactly what I needed to replace my old ones. Brush is not to hard and they come in two different colors.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare product, won&#x27;t use any other. Please reduce your pricing.</li>
            <li> Replacements fit perfectly and at a price cheaper than can be had in stores</li>
            <li> another great buy, thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. Great product, great service, fast shipping. What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! Just what is pictured, and what came with the original Sonicare! I love them and will buy again in a few months when I need new ones!</li>
            <li> Did not notice this was a generic product when purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It is noisy, It &amp;#34;stutters&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t seem to do the work.&lt;br /&gt;a complete waste of money. Had I tried it earlier I would have certainly return it because it is a rip-off</li>
            <li> A quality replacement head.</li>
            <li> Ok, hear me clearly.  DO NOT get the imitation brush heads and think you are going to get the same quality, fit and performance from your toothbrush.  These replacement brush heads are awesome. They are expensive, but you knew that when you purchased the toothbrush.  On average, they are about 12 dollars per brush.  But they fit like a glove.  You will really notcie the difference in performance between using the generic brush heads and using these.  They are just as good as the original heads.  You will love them.</li>
            <li> I would rate it higher if you carried the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, great price.</li>
            <li> Over all it is a good product. Once in a while one of the heads isn&#x27;t glued properly. I&#x27;ve had to repair a couple of the magnets that came loose after the first use. Most of them work great though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come up with anything new to say about these Sonicare Brush Heads---I&#x27;ve been buying and reviewing them for years now. ;)  They&#x27;re always top quality, arrive in record time, packaged securely and the prices are always way better than I can get them for locally. The Free shipping with Subscribe and Save is icing on the cake. ;)  If you use a Sonicare (and you should---my dentist has always been thrilled with the results for tarter and plaque control!) then you should get your replacement brush heads here, At Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> I received these when expected.  They were packaged well.  They work great.  Replaced my others just as stated.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my older one that had 30 second beeps for each quadrant of your mouth. also they do not provide a travel charger and mine burned out in the UK where they use 220 volts. But the toothbrush does the job, and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> After trimming one of the toothbrush hairs in the middle with a pair of scissors, it was fine!</li>
            <li> excellent quality, sent quickly</li>
            <li> i prefer the frustration-free subscribe&amp; save, but the price was too high.  cut my finger on the plastic edge when opening. otherwise, the brush heads are the same as usual.</li>
            <li> just work as good as the original brush heads!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in excellent condition. They were an excellent buy and fit just perfectly. I am still using the first from the package of two and it is working superbly!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, do a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> There are cheaper options out there.</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare and I recommend it to all my friends. These heads are needed about every 3 months.</li>
            <li> They are an improvement though I was not dissatisfied with the former replacement heads.  Recommend this because it promotes dental health.</li>
            <li> When using a manual toothbrush some time ago, I developed inflamed gums and bleeding everywhere. The net result was that my gums were not getting the adequate oral &#x27;exercise&#x27; they need to be healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Phillips Sonicare System--I will never be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started slow to get my gums &#x27;up to speed&#x27;.  After I used this product for a while my mouth has never been healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: don&#x27;t just brush your teeth with this product, brush your gums as well!!  (Your dentist, like mine, will be amazed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor--ALSO USE A PRODUCT CALLED &amp;#34;BRUSHPICKS&amp;#34; (from AMAZON) AS WELL! (You&#x27;ll Thank Me!)</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush since I admitted that I don&#x27;t floss (I know, shame on me) and these sonicare toothbrush heads do the trick. They are higher quality than the original brush my sonicare came with. They also have a green head that will start to fade when they need to be replaced. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what we ordered &amp; right when my son needed them.  Saves on dentist bills - he&#x27;s teeth are healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of ordering these for my spouse online, especially as I usually cannot find the additional compact heads that I need in stores. Would recommend also purchasing the Sonic Seal (apparently currently unavailable on Amazon, hope it returns) to keep water out of the well between this temporary brush head and the permanent part of the handle.</li>
            <li> These brushes show &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; - the brush that has always worked well for me. What I received says &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare&amp;#34; on them. One would think, it&#x27;s still the same brand name, still the same product right?  NO! I don&#x27;t understand why they&#x27;re different - maybe Philips lowered its quality, or the version that says &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare&amp;#34; on them is their &#x27;generic&#x27; version of &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; - hence a lower model.  But, I wasted money, they don&#x27;t clean the same. I made a presumption that it was a good product and ditched the packaging too soon, so I messed up and can&#x27;t return now. Don&#x27;t know who to blame, Philips or POMO Associates. I guess myself, for believing in the advertising.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads and at a better price than in stores. I use the product daily and replace about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Just like the originals</li>
            <li> I use the Sonicare every day.  The heads need to be replaced every six months and these are very well made replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I believe that I get throught the winters without getting sick by taking good care of my teeth. This product helps.</li>
            <li> This is the same product one might buy in Target or Walmart, except it cost less money and saved me a trip.</li>
            <li> i bought these replacement lbrush heads for me an dmy wife and we both oved it very much, next time I will buy more and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very happy with these. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone with a Sonicare toothbrush that&#x27;s compatible with these brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of embarrassed to admit that I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare model HX5300 for about three years, and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve replaced the brush head. But as durable as it was, the original brush head was clearly worn out, so I ordered the 2-pack replacement set. For me, there&#x27;s no question that the Sonicare brushes are more effective than manual toothbrushes. At my age, gum disease is a bigger problem than cavities, but since I changed to the Sonicare, my dental hygienist has given me much better reports on my gums, with the \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; being much smaller than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a huge difference after replacing the old brush head. It wasn&#x27;t just the bristles that were frayed and worn out. The rubber \\&quot;bumpers\\&quot; that transmit the vibrations from the main body of the brush were also worn out. When I brushed my teeth with the new brush head, the brushing action was much more vigorous. For the first time in at least a year, my gums tingled the way they did when I first got the Sonicare. The manufacturer recommends replacing the brush head every three months. That may be a bit of overkill intended to sell brush heads, but I realize now that they do need to be replaced much more often than every three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before changing to the Sonicare, I had used another brand of battery-operated brush found in drugstores. They were very inexpensive, but they didn&#x27;t help my gums enough to keep them from deteriorating. Using the Sonicare has helped greatly to reverse the gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I used the original brush head for three years is testimony to the durability of the brush, but I recommend replacing the brush heads much more frequently than that.</li>

            <li> totally satisfied - tried a knock off brand of replacement brush heads and was very disappointed - did not work as well</li>
            <li> They are as good as the ones that came with the Sonicare. There are less expensive ones, but it is pay me now or pay me later. This is my second purchase of this product. Will buy these again when I need them.</li>
            <li> They fit like a charm onto my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived on time, worked as the previous brushes did and installed easily.</li>
            <li> My kids love the Philips Sonicare itself.  These replacement brush heads are as good as the originals that came with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I really like the system. And my dentist like them too. Keeps me in the mode of semi-annual checkups only.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a replacement for my older one, it works with few different models. It does the job</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It just makes brushing more fun! And the dentist more happy....</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical that these would fit my older Sonicare version but they did and I was very happy to only have to purchase the replacement brushes!</li>
            <li> Far cheaper than what I would pay locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these heads are made by the mfr for the mfr&#x27;s product.  Not a 3rd party &amp;#34;fits most&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for awesome toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does a good job cleaning my teeth.  It&#x27;s just a little loud.  The noise level may wake up someone still sleeping if you are an early riser.</li>
            <li> I really like Sonicare.  The replacement brush heads were cheap and delivered quickly.  I recommend this site for this type of thng.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are wonderful.  This product was sold at a reasonable price.  I saved half off the regular price.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sonicare and my dentist always says I take great care of my teeth. I like this product and the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush system is great. This a good price for the heads, especially if you go on auto ship. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> They took way too long to arrive......... .. .. ... ..... . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Good price and works just like original heads. Good to replace heads after a few months. Pretty much a no brainer.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of these toothbrush head replacements for my Soniccare toothbrush.  This so much easier than going to the store.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific deal! Better than at Costco / Bj&#x27;s and kinda sad but a great stocking stuffer for our adult yet young - still - in - college - and - probably - not - buying - his - own son. It&#x27;s a win win situation!!! Especially because his fiance is going to med school to be a dentist!</li>
            <li> Get these if you want to save money from buying at your local store.  They work perfect and come quickly to your front door.</li>
            <li> I got the sonic tooth brush from my dentist when I got my braces. But after 2 years it was digusting, these heads are the perfect fit.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this toothbrush the replacements seem to fit well.  Since I bought these it works ok but the heads make a vibrating noise.  Like it&#x27;s not the exact fit for the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They fit my Sonicare and we glad they make this series!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product--good brand name, and it delivers.  This spin brush spins super-fast, much faster than the first kind of sonicare electric brush I bought. Dentist said my teeth look A+, and I give credit to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have used nothing else for fifteen years and my healthy teeth attest to that fact.</li>
            <li> These Phillips Sonicare brushes were to replace existing stock...so performance and quality were excellent.  Product was shipped on time, with no damage and priced competitively.  Overall a good buying experience!</li>
            <li> I do not like these new brushes at all! They are too soft and don&#x27;t clean the teeth like the old ones did! Will not buy these again.I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare as long as it has been on the market,,,,,sad to see such a poor product!</li>
            <li> Great value and no complaints. Name brand and lasts a while. At least 3-4 months</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth get cleaner then with a regular brush, but the bristles in the head seem to wear out faster than a conventional brush.</li>
            <li> the heads are weaker than the original ones that came with the Sonic, but are usable.  Thank you for stocking them</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would buy in the store but for WAY less. I use these now and they aren&#x27;t loud like the store brand ones at all.</li>
            <li> I use these and Doctor&#x27;s brush picks, and The hygienist went from having to do a LOT of work twice a year, to hardly anything once a year! My gums are healthy, whereas before I started using the Sonicare and brush picks, my gums were NOT healthy!! Also very little tartar and plaque builds up on my teeth anymore!</li>
            <li> Brushing my teeth using this sonicare brush is like therapy for my denture, keeping my gums strong, whiter teeth and less dentist work ($$$$) to pay. My dentist also recommends this toothbrush... it keeps the the clean feel longer and better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and i wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I would suggest it to everybody that wants to use a elect tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using Sonicare, my dental check-ups have been great.&lt;br /&gt;My hygenist and dentist have said my home care is excellent.  I give all the&lt;br /&gt;credit to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> No problem with the order but I think the brushes used to last 3 months and now only 2 months.</li>
            <li> These are the best in the line of electric toothbrush heads. They are an improvement over the old series, with a better material for both cleaning and gum massaging.</li>
            <li> Fit fine at less price than Walmart.</li>
            <li> TERRIFIC.  IT IS EAST TO CHOOSE THE CORRECT REEPLACEMENT BRUSHES.  GOOD PRICE.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using these heads for quite some time. I have them automatically shipped every two months, because that seems to be the heads&#x27; lifetime. They&#x27;ve saved me a lot of time and money by keeping my teeth clean and preventing cavities and gum disease. My hygenist is impressed with how well my gaps are doing.</li>
            <li> Package only contained 1 brush head</li>
            <li> i have been using sonicare for years, my dentist recommended to me there is no better  product on the market I.only use Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is the only way to shop. Thanks for keeping out of the big box store.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a generic product. It the genuine article. Great buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal at a super price.</li>
            <li> Good value for a product that I use all the time</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tool lasts forever and these replacement brushes are exactly like the originals - we&#x27;ll keep buying these heads until we get tired of the unit (we&#x27;ve had it about 6-8 years.</li>
            <li> Great product quickly despatched and just as advertised on the web site, would recommend this product to anyone that needs replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do a great job of minimizing plaque buildup and it keeps my dental hygienist happy with me!!!</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare - I switched to sonicare from oral b based on a family members recommendation.  The sonicare is alot better, however the brush heads are alot more vs. oral b and does it really need to come with the whole gadget below the brush?  I would rate this five stars if sonicare would just sell a replacable brush head and not the bulky part that goes with it to screw it on and who knows what else.  I&#x27;m sure there is a way they can reduce the waste and cost.  You do not need to replace these every time the blue disappears - also wasteful because that takes about one month and the brush is still fine. Sonicare needs to re-evaluate their commitment to the environment and my pocketbook!  Good brush though :)</li>
            <li> i love that they have changed the packaging and that I can now get these replacement heads a cheaper price.  After brushing my teeth with the new brush its like I am just coming home from the dentist.  And the fact that you get the option for a subscription means i can get the brushes on a health schedule for your teeth.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good. It matches my Philips Sonicare very well. I will consider using it after using out these ones.</li>
            <li> Since my dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ve been buying these replacement heads and I&#x27;m not disappointed in them at all.</li>
            <li> If you use a Philips Sonicare toothbrush, you can only buy certain models of replacement heads.  Recently Philips discontinued the replacement head model I had been using.  This was the recommended model to purchase.  This model is definitely less sturdy than the previous model &amp; it rattles a lot more when I&#x27;m using the toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t like it very much, but then I don&#x27;t really have a choice, do I?  Thank you, Philips, for lowering the quality of your product.</li>
            <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THIS TOOTHBRUSH FOR 5 YEARS AND RALLY LIKE THE RESULTS. the price is much to high however.</li>
            <li> kind of expensive but work great</li>
            <li> Great price, excellent quality, I don&#x27;t need to buy the cheep imitations any more.</li>
            <li> Good replacement parts</li>
            <li> easy to replace, lasts several months, brush size is just right to get into small spaces, yet large enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have always used manual toothbrushes all my life until I was introduced to Philips Sonicare. These brushes are great for use!</li>
            <li> The product is as described and fits perfectly base perfectly.  Better than other replacements I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Sonicare toothbrush with no problem, and appear to be from the original manufacturer of the Sonicare. Sonicare is of course AWESOME, if a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the manufacturer packaging rather than the frustration-free packaging because, surprisingly, it was $5 cheaper. The manufacturer packaging is plastic clamshell which required scissors and some strength for me to open, but at least the heads were in pristine shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new heads make a HUGE difference compared to my worn out ones! The brushing action was more vigorous and the bristles were more firm (but not painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these on Amazon for 75% of what I would have paid from Walgreens. And, delivered to my door. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> On line info said these were angled heads. When they arrived, they were straight. You should change your on line description.</li>
            <li> Have used a Sonicare since it&#x27;s inception.  These were a fantastic price and I will continue to purchase them.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fits my e-series  brush, hopefully the price will drop some more O,o&#x27;  a little expensive for just replacement brushes where as if you buy the whole set on special it only cost round 30-40.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush head ever. The only drawback is its price. It is TOOOO EXPENSIVE. Had to go with alternatives.</li>
            <li> The box it arrived in was unnecessarily large, bit wasteful.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are very useful and effective. For the price, this series is what I would recommend for anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the supermarket. And the service is also good. Recommended for home use. But the express fee is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I find these work for about 4 and a half months, brushing twice daily.  After that, I can tell it&#x27;s time to swap the head.  Good design, and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Received my brushes quickly. they work great! I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years and won&#x27;t go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely spend the money on the name brand Sonicare replacements heads.  I bought a generics once and they were very noisy.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare brush heads do an excellent job, along with the base, in keeping your teeth clean. Just visited&lt;br /&gt;the dentist and got a very good report, thanks to regular use of floss and my Sonicare brush!</li>
            <li> this was the first (and only) electric toothbrush i have used so far, so i cannot compare it to others.  it does the job, and i have no complaints!  the 2 minute timer is a bonus, i usually do 2 2 minute sessions when i brush.</li>
            <li> Good buy. Was a little snug fitting in my sonic care, so not sure if I bought the right ones. But they work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these in the past.  And have really liked them.  These don&#x27;t seem to vibrate as strongly.  They also &#x27;pause&#x27; about every 30 seconds.  Would prefer to have the old one back.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement Sonicare heads, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them. By ordering them through Amazon, I saved quite a bit of money from buying them retail. And according to my dentist, they&#x27;re working great.</li>
            <li> Was expecting to have to do some modifications to make it fit my older base, but they must have done something to make them backward compatible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to keep purchasing a new brush - and here I found just what a needed on line - they are on the way to my house right now - thank goodness</li>
            <li> Seems like these replacement heads are louder than the ones that came with my Sonicare.  Not sure why, but I have to put a little extra torque on the them when I put them on to get them to the normal level of noise.</li>
            <li> I have an older Sonicare toothbrush and these replacement heads are different than the ones I&#x27;ve been buying all along.  I was reluctant to buy these but the details stated they would fit my model of my Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like them better than what I&#x27;ve been using all this time.  These have a thinner, more flexible stem and even the brush head is designed differently.  It is designed better, to better and more easily brush your back teeth in all areas.  The replacement heads I&#x27;ve always used before this are kind of clunky and ridged.  They were almost like sticking a ridged stick with a brush on the end of it into your mouth.  No flexibility.  These HX7022/66 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads just feel easier to use and better to get to those back teeth and all other teeth.  I really like these, which is why I gave them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare brush heads are a wonderful product. The dentist said my gums are improving. I am quite pleased with the preliminary results.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using the Sonicare toothbrushes for several years after I was diagnosed with gum disease. My hygienist is happy, so I&#x27;m happy. And my gums are happy. I recommend this product for anyone&#x27;s teeth. My hygienist saw an improvement after I started using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> As always, the Phillips Sonicare replacement brush heads arrived per set time schedule and I have to again thank Amazon.com for setting this up for me on an on-going basis..</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacements for original brush heads! I tried generic type brush heads which did not work at all. I will only buy these in the future!</li>
            <li> These ones seem to shake more than the originals that came with it even though they are supposed to be OEM. This means a lot of gum irritation because its hard to ensure it only hits your teeth.</li>
            <li> First of the two failed within 3 uses (magnet came loose, and it buzzes very loudly).  The second one in the package lasted a little bit longer and now it is buzzing.</li>
            <li> just the best price for a great product with fast delivery :)&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Sonicare,  (and you should)  plan ahead and have some delivered save some money.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought some cheap replacement heads and now I am buying the right and original ones....these are just like the original and are not loud and cheap. I was the dummy and cheapskate.....don&#x27;t do it BUY THESE!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, don&#x27;t know how to was effusive about replacement brushes, but these work!</li>
            <li> One of the Brush heads will not screw on so not able to use!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit. I wasn&#x27;t sure if they will fit the old head, but they did. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I bought my Sonicare years ago, use it 2-3 times daily, wouldn&#x27;t part with it. Yes, the replacement heads aren&#x27;t inexpensive, but each lasts at least 3 months depending upon use, &amp; it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I can take it with me for a week of travel without recharging is a great plus. This is one of those products that nails it!</li>
            <li> The brushes perform quite well. They seemed a little harsh to my wife but they work all right for me.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare replacement heads are what is advertised.  They are exactly as described, and fit my Sonicare just fine but at a very reduced cost.  I now have these on my automatic delivery so I can continue to save money.  Thanks Amazon for good service and pricing.</li>
            <li> great price for an otherwise overpriced head unit at other stores!</li>
            <li> Works just like it suppose to. And yes this is a set of two. They cost a little more than the other set, but much better quality. worth it.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. No issues. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Super product, better than the original brushes that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> Great price. Excellent product. Super fast deliver. Thanks</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean again.</li>
            <li> Have this on subscription. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  They fit my brush perfectly.  I change about every 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> Not sure what others received. I received actual Sonicare brush heads in original packaging and not generic knockoffs. Love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> My dentist complimented my teeth at the last check-up.  Said cleaning for him was easy and asked how I kept my teeth so healthy and gum-tooth separation was at a minimum.  I credit it to my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great quality,not a close copy!</li>
            <li> Just match my toothbrush. Good</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and this are perfect and made my life so much easier!!!</li>
            <li> Great value and packaging!</li>
            <li> The heads themselves are fine, but for some reason, both heads (at some point) starting rattling within the grip. It is very loud once this happens, and can feel a slight off balance in the head as well. Nothing that will tear up your mouth, but enough to get your attention.</li>
            <li> The product came promptly and fit my Sonicare handle. The little clear plastic cover that fits over the bristles when not in use is a very tight fit. While it does have holes in it to alalow for air circulation, it is such a tight fit that it mashes the bristles together. This can&#x27;t be good for air circulation. So I only cover half the bristles.</li>
            <li> The Brush Head was okay, It fit perfectly my Sonicare toothbrush, but the package where it came was not presentable.</li>
            <li> Amazon product delivered on time and at a good price. Brushes slightly different than previous ones. Look nicer, but don&#x27;t know if it makes any difference in use.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality, these brush heads are very good and last as long as you&#x27;d expect. I tried the Walmart version once, and took it back immediately. It didn&#x27;t fit well and made an ungodly noise.  I do think the E-series is more expensive than they have to be. That given, I&#x27;m overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using sonicare for years, and won&#x27;t use anything else.  My husband doesn&#x27;t pack his when we go out of town, so he usually brushes his teeth as soon as we get home, to get that clean he&#x27;s used to.  I sometimes buy these at our local big box store, but they lock them up now, and the packaging is a pain, so I&#x27;ll stick with Amazon for buying these in the future.</li>
            <li> love the price! would order all over again..plan to actually. great deal and came on time and quality is great.</li>
            <li> I for the life of me do not understand why these things cost so much.  Toothbruhes are getting to be non-existant in stores.  What the deal?</li>
            <li> The product was received but did not function properly. I received an email asking about my experience.  I informed them of the issue and they immediately sent out another product that worked flawlessly. Excellent customer service.  Anyone can sell a product but a real company stands behind their product and focuses on customer service. I will purchase from them again as well as recommend them to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting a generic brush head replacement for my Sonicare, and they didn&#x27;t ever fit quite right, which mostly showed in how LOUD my Sonicare toothbrush suddenly sounded. I still used them, because I don&#x27;t like to waste money. But after I ordered these, and replaced the generic ones with these, I was amazed at the whisper buzz of my Sonicare toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add that to the fact that the Sonicare was recommended to me by one dentist, and has led to many tooth cleanings at which the hygienist marvels at how good my teeth look. I usually wait too long between replacing brush heads (although I also alternate them, one at night and the other in the morning, so hopefully I can use them twice as long). They ARE expensive. But they&#x27;re worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I&#x27;ve been using this brush. We replace the brush head every 6 months. It is definitely noticeable when comparing the old magnet to the new one.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the only toothbrush for my family this product is outstanding and price is definitely right.Thanks for the quick arrival of my order.</li>
            <li> Whats not to love.  I have been buying Sonicare products for over 10 years.  I can&#x27;t believe they haven&#x27;t asked me to do a commercial for the word of mouth sales I have gotten for Sonicare.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve bought a Sonicare Eseries toothbrush, you&#x27;ve already made the choice of what kind of replacement head you&#x27;re going to end up buying. So the selling point for this product is that Amazon offers a subscription service which lets you schedule regular purchases of replacement heads. There&#x27;s no longer any need to set yourself a reminder, go to the drugstore (or wherever), ask the clerk to retrieve the product from a locked cabinet, pay for the product and then take it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time around I bought a handle, though, I wish I&#x27;d remember to buy the Sonicare handle with the &amp;#34;quad-sector&amp;#34; timer. There&#x27;s a big price difference between that brush and the brush without the &amp;#34;quad sector&amp;#34; feature. But in terms of convenience, the price difference is a small consideration.</li>
            <li> This product is great but it was extremely difficult to get it because of the shipping method used. It was shipped UsPS with a signature required. Well, I live in an apartment and I am at work all day, so I was not available to sign for the package. I do have a mail box but it couldn&#x27;t be left there because of the signature requirement. They could not even leave it with the leasing office because of the signature requirement. Eventually I received a notice from the Post Office &amp;#34;FINAL WARNING&amp;#34; that unless I was available to sign for the package when they made there last attempt to deliver, the package would be returned to the shipper. I had to go to the Post Office to sign for the package, which made ths transaction A REAL PAIN. I would not purchase any other products from this seller because of this experience.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes aren&#x27;t the same as the originals but work. I have an older model which speaks well for sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush. How ever Sams club has a 6 pack for the same price. I would recommend going there.</li>
            <li> Nice... But way too expensive for some brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is my second order about this product. Do not hurt your gum and clean very well. So I recommend to who never used this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My unit is 4 years old and I change the heads once a year but I probably should step that up to every 6-9 months.  I can&#x27;t find the replacement heads in the stores anymore so I was glad I could order them online and they are the exact fit I need.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what they are supposed to be, no more or less.  It is difficult to be more enthusiastic than three stars regarding replacement toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Thanks! Item received as stated.</li>
            <li> I prefer the old brush heads for my Essence Sonicare, but apparently they aren&#x27;t available anymore.  I&#x27;m getting used to the new ones...seem stiffer to me and not as wide.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for toothbrush, they work just like the ones that came with the toothbrush originally. Packaging was slightly difficult to open but Frustration-Free packaging was not available in Canada.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sonicare tooth brushes - nothing else I have tried compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Oral B, but it was nowhere near as powerful.</li>
            <li> If you are using the Sonicare these replacement heads are perfect. Color coded for two people or save one for later, these are the genuine replacements and work great. Purchase with confidence.</li>
            <li> Purchased this two pack and got through two minutes of brushing.  Then the wife dropped the unit and it sounds like there is a rabid wolverine getting attacked by angry bees when its turned on.</li>
            <li> Like tooth brush, but by time I bought replacement heads the charger or brush broke. If it lasts 3 months you will be lucky.&lt;br /&gt;A tooth brush this expensive should last at least 6 months. This is the 2nd time this has happened, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unusual.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing the generic heads and they were garbage, ended up throwing them away.  Stick with the Philips brand heads. I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packs of these and they came fast. If you use a sonicare then you know that when the brush is on it makes a noise when it is time to switch sides brushing and this particular brush makes the noise randomly. Other than that the brushes are fine.</li>
            <li> These worked just as expected and significantly cheaper than what Walmart carries. No complaints from me about these, as you should know what you are buying.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect on the Philips E-series brush handle. It does what it promises. Don&#x27;t buy knockoffs, and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement; very robust cleaning</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a good price for this product as they are expensive.  You will not be disappointed with this price.</li>
            <li> My wife uses a Sonic toothbrush and gets these replacement heads a few times each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She swears by the Sonic toothbrush and obviously, it needs a brush to work so well.</li>
            <li> good replacement brushes for my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had-----strong vibration rate !  I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.  I give it an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The right kind of replacement brush for my sonic are brush. And it is cheaper compared to other convenient stores.</li>
            <li> The fit and function was perfect. I really shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long before replacing the original! Neither should you.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the exact replacement ones that came with the original purchase.  I tried buying the generic brand replacement heads to save money but they were awful.  Worth the month</li>
            <li> Works great and best price available vs stores.  Shopped around but this was the best price I could find. Brush away my friends!</li>
            <li> Good value and promptly delivered.</li>
            <li> My teeth have been much cleaner and the dentist is much happier when I use the Philips toothbrushes.  Be sure and replace them frequently and they will do good things for your teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> This is the actual Philips replacement heads. I&#x27;ve been very happy with these over the years.  I&#x27;ve been thinking of trying out the soft bristle heads.</li>
            <li> Love this product, keeps the teeth squeaky clean &amp; plaque-free.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend highly to anyone interested in keeping their teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> The two pack will last for about four months.  The brush heads are durable and the disappearing color strips ensures that I can replace the head in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Automatic so we always have fresh brushes when we should - something that we would not have if we had to remember to replace them on our own. Good service.</li>
            <li> Good vendor, good product.  Shop with confidence here.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is almost the cheapest among all the Sonicare products, but his brush head is not.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would recommend the other series i tried.</li>
            <li> The dentist told me a few years ago, &amp;#34;I want to tell you in the nicest way I can, that your teeth and gums are terrible&amp;#34;.  He suggested the sonicare toothbrush and I went out and bought one that day.  Every six months I go back for a cleaning and he always tells me how good things look. I didn&#x27;t actually realize that when you get your teeth cleaned it only knocks the placque back for a day and then it&#x27;s forming again.  The sonicare toothbrush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just in time for my replacement. Toothbrush works and last for more than 4 months ! I spend more time brushing now.</li>
            <li> easy to reorder since it comes automatically....good reminder to toss the old one which I often forget to do....so am a bit behind in tossing</li>
            <li> No  longer available in stores, so I was glad to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, less noisy than the original version.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush!  It won&#x27;t work without the heads so these get a five star rating.  Item is exactly as described.  I highly recommend these.  They do a much better job than any normal toothbrush could do on its own.  If you have not used one before it may take some getting used to, but once you are I can&#x27;t see why anyone would go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love these! My teeth feel so clean after brushing!</li>
            <li> are better than none. Bristley and Brushy, these heads are both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently I can&#x27;t write a review that is that short.</li>
            <li> Tthese brush headsworl perfectly with my Series e Sonicare.  The price is much better than retailat a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> My super-hot dentist has never failed to compliment my teeth since I started using Sonicare.  This is a well designed, mature product that does what it says.  Lost a star &#x27;cause they are still so darn expensive, (but worth it!)</li>
            <li> The only problem is the packaging is sooooo hard to open. They had different packaging for a while that was much easier.</li>
            <li> They came within a reasonable amount of time and were just like the ones from the store. And that&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Good Deal  for a great product. I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare for over 10 years now and all I do is buy new heads.  A two pack is essentially/basically a year&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years.  These replacement heads last as long as you want them to and they do a very good job on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dental visits are just for cleaning as the toothbrushes and waterpick do their jobs well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> OEM replacement...Love my Sonicare and love that I can get the replacement heads at a good price delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> No too pleased. When I brush with pressure, they stop vibrating.</li>
            <li> As always, these replacement toothbrushes are excellent!  Automatic replacement scheduling by Amazon saves us having to remember to reorder.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described and appears to be OEM - no problems. I&#x27;ll be having this on autoship.</li>
            <li> They do not last very long, you have to keep on changing them and they are a little bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.  Definitely worth the money.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for replacement heads for their Philips Sonicare E series.</li>
            <li> Hi Amazonians...Here is my review of the Philips Sonicare Tooth Brushes.  First, for all of you out there who brush your teeth, the Philips Sonicare replacement tooth brushes are not cheap.  They are a bit pricy for those of us on fixed incomes but they last a long time.  I made a mistake and purchased the &amp;#34;Generic&amp;#34; replacement toothbrushes and I&#x27;ll never do that again.  The Generic brushes sound like a chain saw when they run and I wonder if they may damage the power handle.  The O.E.M brushes are nice and quiet and seem to run perfectly in the power handle.  Although, I think they are costly, they do work as good as the ones that came with the original toothbrush, last a long time, and work quietly.  So Pastor George gives these replacement brushes a big 5 star rating.  So happy brushing and see your dentist often.  Remember this is Pastor George, and I wouldn&#x27;t steer you wrong.</li>
            <li> great product, work amazing, would order again</li>
            <li> Nice price, fast shipping, fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> i simply needed a replacement head for my toothbrush. it works great and feels like it brought some of the power back to my toothbrush</li>
            <li> Works perfect!  Price is inline with generic options sold at Walmart and other discount store.  Twin pack is convenient for always having a replacement on hand.</li>
            <li> did what it was supposed to clean my teeth and they last a little longer than 2 months each with my braces.</li>
            <li> Great original heads. Doesn&#x27;t make the loud noises or extreme vibrations like some of the store brand heads do.</li>
            <li> The vendor was timely,and all was as expected. Not much else you can say for a replacement head on a toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great having these on auto-ship as a reminder to change brush heads-cost is much lower than prices at local stores</li>
            <li> These are cheapest here and at Costco, but at Costco you have to buy like 1,928 of them at once, and I just don&#x27;t have that many teeth.</li>
            <li> A great improvement over brushing by hand.  Good head action.  Brushes do last a few months.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads and received them on time!</li>
            <li> Changing your toothbrush is important. With automatic delivery, you can get these regularly and then change your toothbrush head every 3 months, as recommended. These fit on the Sonicare easily and may be removed for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth in the two minutes. I like the smaller brush and the new speed.</li>
            <li> While I think they are too expensive, they do a good job.  Checkups have been very good since using them.</li>
            <li> Its good and a bargain price to pay for an everyday use. Always been a reliable product to use. Awesome brush head.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the brush heads, the price, and the prompt delivery. I would give it five stars, but I haven&#x27;t yet used the new replacement heads, so four is the best I can give at this time.</li>
            <li> Great mixer for the money.  I use it to mix my ice tea and scramble eggs in the morning.</li>
            <li> Sign up for the Subscribe &amp; Save for these toothbrush heads and you never have to think about buying them again! You just get new ones in the mail every 6 months and you can toss the old ones! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have owned Phillips Sonicare toothbrush for at least 15 years....Nothing else beats this product...I replace the brush heads every 4 months...My dentist says I do a real good job....Gracie</li>
            <li> Continues to serve my needs.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> not sure how this one is going to fit the newer model, check model first before you make the purchase</li>
            <li> A replacement head broke after just 3 Weeks of use. :-(  The heads have always lasted well over 3 months in the past.</li>
            <li> the replacement brush seem to be fine, they work with our Sonicare machine.  Reasonable buy matches the one that came with the toothbrush set.</li>
            <li> Excellent product It&#x27;s exactly what I had wanted and the price was unbeatable. I receive my item in a more than reasonable amount of time!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing with the Sonicare. Hate using a regular toothbrush now! I&#x27;ll gladly pay way too much for these just for the feeling my teeth have after brushing :)</li>
            <li> I got these in less time than I was told and they work great, like all Philips replacements I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> The best of the best.  Have used this particular brand and&lt;br /&gt;style for the past 7-8 years.  Lost without it.</li>
            <li> Happy it&#x27;s on  autoship...helps me replace more often.  Shipping was a little slow. This was my first time on autoship so I will plan better.</li>
            <li> Their toothbrush heads and they work fine.  Can&#x27;t say much else about them.</li>
            <li> It seems the brushes becomes worn much sooner than before, but than, they have changed their recommendation to changing brush every 3 months than the previous 6 month.  Maybe Phillips just muke sure you HAVE to in the new recommended time period.</li>
            <li> A+ ... t w o face WoW g o o d love i t  ... g o o d .</li>
            <li> Gotta brush your teeth everyday!  These make it happen at least if you have a Sonicare toothbrush.  Sign up for the subscription and you won&#x27;t forget to buy them!  Man that sounded like a commercial.  Really Amazon has the best price I have found for these things.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this product for several years and will continue. It does a great job keeping dental problems to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Have used this item for years &amp; have never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to stay on auto fill for the replacement.</li>
            <li> I have bought cheap knockoffs from Walmart and CVS.  They were noisy and lower quality than these.  Always spring for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I found a 10-year old Sonicare toothbrush in some old boxes.  I didn&#x27;t even know if the brushes would work, so i ordered these replacement heads instead of paying retail at a big-box store.  These heads are a perfect fit and now my toothbrushing has never been the same!</li>
            <li> Does a great job. Every brushing feels like a polishing from the dentist.  Don&#x27;t buy the imitator E series brands though, I tried the Target equivalent one time and its nowhere near as good as original Philips brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brush heads for many years. They do the intended job perfectly. I only use the Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> i AM SORRY TO REPORT THAT i AM DISSAPPOINTED  THAT i HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SAME PRODUCT LOCALLY AT WALLGREEN DRUGS FOR $19.99 FOR THE EXACT SAME 2 PACK OF BRUSHES.  Lowell Merrell</li>
            <li> Great brush!! really does a good job getting hard to reach areas as well as cleaning your teeth pretty good!</li>
            <li> They work. What more is there to say? I hope they keep making these, because my E-series handle is still going strong.</li>
            <li> expensive, but glad these are made for m old sonicare base.</li>
            <li> Does what it supposed to.</li>
            <li> I used the same head for over 6 months (woops) and ordered new ones. After two days my teeth were whiter - no need for a whitening kit! I do use whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li> One of the best tootbrush in the market, my dentist was the one who introduce me to this product and keeps my teeth and mouth healthy</li>
            <li> Been using these for a long time.  Surely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Good replacement parts for a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Came on time and worked perfectly. The items were exactly what I expected.  I would give it 5 stars if they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> cheap, convenience and good quality. This three are always the reasons I choose to purchase things in amazon. Love them!</li>
            <li> Every dentist I&#x27;ve been to said they can tell that I am using a Sonicare.  I love the ease and convenience, just remember to change the heads every 3-6 months.  I went 7 months and I could tell it was way too long.  I&#x27;m trying 5 months, and we will see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Very happy with once exception.  It appears that the brushes &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are falling out periodically.  Not real bad but kind of strange since I&#x27;ve not ever had that happen before.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush and getting the replacement heads at Amazon makes it very easy.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush, great heads.</li>
            <li> I have an original series. These fit perfectly and work far better than the originals they replace. The vibration seems more vigorous and the shaped bristles reach better between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Works well, but don&#x27;t try to steam clean it. The rubber melts and leaves you with a funky looking toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> They never fit / sounded right when attached.  After a few days, one broke -- the magnets inside detached, rendering it useless.  The other continues to work but makes a strange buzzing noise constantly. It seems it doesn&#x27;t fit quite right, that the magnets may be misaligned. Whatever the reason, they did not perform well and I would not buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I got this tooth brush from my mother for Christmas last year and was in dire need of a replacement head. I got this on Amazon. Great product but I think it is WAY over priced for just a head replacement.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how great these are! I&#x27;ve been using a grocery stores brand instead of the real ones due to the cost. When I found these on Amazon and they were offered at a great price I had to buy them.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! I could tell the difference immediately! There is no comparison to the real thing.  Very happy with my purchase and I hope they continue selling them at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> We have had the Sonicare toothbrush for several years now with no issues. It holds a long charge while traveling, so we just keep replacing the heads on it. Amazon has the best prices for replacement brushes that I have seen so far. I like these brush head because they have the wear bristles that will remind you to replace them, in case you space the general 3 month rule.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are working great.  They retain their stiffness well so they clean my teeth well.  When I consider the cost of the brushes I feel I am receiving good value.</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare, but although the write-up said something about no-hassle packaging, it almost takes a chain saw to open the plastic and get the heads out.  I swear it&#x27;s a wonder the stems on the brushes don&#x27;t break from the effort to get them out.  Nonetheless, the heads are great.</li>
            <li> I purchased a generic store brand at a nation wide pharmacy chain.They very annoyingly loud. I was quite pleased with the Philips E Series brush heads. Ordering from Amazon is very convenient and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and prompt receipt. Brand name that owrks&lt;br /&gt;night and day above Equate brand of brushes for very little&lt;br /&gt;additional expense. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Prompt arrival an I like the fact that I do not have to worry about ordering them.  They are an excellent value and I could recommend this type of purchase to anyone.</li>
            <li> they are brand heads and work perfectly with my base.  enjoy the price offered and get great oral are as well.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed and expected.  I am happy with the product.  My teeth are clean because of it.</li>
            <li> Great value, fit just right, big difference when brushes are new! Good way to get replacements.&lt;br /&gt;We all have a big white smile now!</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads.  This product is another one that is hard to find at a decent price.  Works great with my Elite that is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Packaged so badly that when trying to remove one of the two brushes I damaged it beyond repair. Shape up!</li>
            <li> Simply put, why go anywhere else?  I bought my Philips Sonicare at a retailer but when looking for replacement heads they were either not available (including the brick and mortar store where I purchased the brushes originally) or way more expensive.  Plan ahead and get them online and save a lot of hassle and a good amount of money.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product.  The price was the best part.&lt;br /&gt;Works well with no problems.  What more can you say about&lt;br /&gt;a toothbrush replacement head?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonic care toothbrushes for over 5 years now and love em. I would give sonic care credit my  nearly perfect dental checkups for the entire time I used them, before that had some potentially serious gum issues. Aside from the fast vibration, perhaps the most important feature is it times you for a full 2 minutes or so- if I hand brush, I hardly ever brush that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I still think these replacement heads are  overpriced, and never last the suggested 3 months But on the other hand I&#x27;ve likely saved many times that over in dental bills.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I jumped at the chance to purchase these replaceable brush heads at this remarkably low cost. They work great and will allow us to change them more often.</li>
            <li> One thousand bristles&lt;br /&gt;Like a dentist in your home&lt;br /&gt;Highly effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist never thought I was brushing my teeth well enough with a standard tooth brush. So I ended up getting the Sonicare Elite. When it came time to replace the head, I was happy to find Amazon had these at a much lower cost than my local brick-and-mortar stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles wear out a little faster than I had hoped, but my teeth are much cleaner now and my dentist is much happier.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seemed to have harder bristles than any of previous ones purchased at department stores, drug stores and warehouse stores.  Before I order or buy next time, I need to do a little research on how to tell the difference in the brush head bristles by looking at them in the package.</li>
            <li> the sonic care tooth brush replacement works better than the&lt;br /&gt;generic brands.  It vibrates on the holder much better than the&lt;br /&gt;generic brand.  The price was good too.</li>
