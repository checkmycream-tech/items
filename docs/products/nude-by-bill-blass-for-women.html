            <li> My 4yr old said, \\&quot;Mommy you smell like a Grandma!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It leaves a long lasting fragrance and lasts for up to 10 hours.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Then I bought NUDE from two other perfume vendors.</li>
            <li> all you can smell is that old alcohol smell of outdated perfume.   </li>
            <li> It is not uncommon to receive a compliment...</li>
            <li> Seems fake, smell alcohol.</li>
            <li> I bought a replacement bottle, I thought maybe Bill Blass&#x27; Co. had made a bad batch, so I got a refund, &#x27;cause there was NO WAY that I was going to wear that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in a product from Amazon....</li>
            <li> but I was a bit disappointed at the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> but this was awful!!!!</li>
            <li> It was like spraying insect repellent on!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nude for a long time, all the boys love it, always telling me how good I smell. Maybe it&#x27;s the chemistry. Just LOVE Nude!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I wear it all the time.  It is not uncommon to receive a compliment...even at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve purchased Bill Blass Nude for over 10 years and can only find it at discount perfume stores or online.  I was very impressed with this online purchase.  The 3 bottles I ordered were received in perfect condition and within just a couple of days.  I will be returning to order this in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume for the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nude.  It&#x27;s the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it since the middle 90&#x27;s and it&#x27;s definitely the best.  I&#x27;ve got some cologne that cost more than this one and I never get any compliments.  I&#x27;ve had people stop me on the street to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, people ask me in the stores, everywhere I go I&#x27;m getting asked what I wear.  I should be a spokesman for Bill Blass Nude cologne.  I tell people to buy it online because you can&#x27;t get it in the stores.  It leaves a long lasting fragrance and lasts for up to 10 hours.  The trick is to put it on when you get out of the shower and it will last all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Nude by Bill Blast...but the perfume I received from Amazon was so old...all you can smell is that old alcohol smell of outdated perfume.   I&#x27;ve never been disappointed in a product from Amazon....but this was awful!!!!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume!  I get lots of comment that I smell soo good!  I just with they would have a body lotion and a shower gel.  I would recommend it to anybody who wants to smell nice!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years, get lots of good compliments  about it , love it.</li>

            <li> Seems fake, smell alcohol.</li>
            <li> Gross is the only word I can think of to describe Nude.... It was like spraying insect repellent on!! I sprayed this on after a shower and I hated it. Before I could wash it off my husband laughed and said, \\&quot;What in the hell are you wearing? Honey that&#x27;s just awful!\\&quot; Lol... My 4yr old said, \\&quot;Mommy you smell like a Grandma!\\&quot; I truly don&#x27;t understand how this fragrance got so many great reviews. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry..... I returned it immediately. Still waiting on my refund.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, great perfume, I was happy I can still find it online, since it is difficult to find in stored now, love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and the people around me too.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent of this cologne.  It smelled good on my clothes, but it smelled like bug spray on me.  I sent it back.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  It really has a pleasant scent and it stays with you a long time.  Really a pleasant product.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great smell but I was a bit disappointed at the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume its awesome... not to strong. its perfect and my husband loves it.....and the bottle is very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to order more.</li>
            <li> I have worn Nude for many years and it is the only scent I will wear.  I get so many compliments on what a light and lovely scent it is.  I cannot imagine we3aring anything else!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for years. I am happy that I found it. I am happy with how quickly It was shipped.</li>
            <li> Nude was my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; cologne for over 20 years, it smelled so beautiful on me that countless people in the public would stop me &amp; ask, &amp;#34;What is that beautiful perfume you&#x27;re wearing? !&amp;#34;  (the same occured to my daughter)&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of my NUDE last year,  &amp; the first&lt;br /&gt;time I bought a replacement bottle, I thought maybe Bill Blass&#x27; Co. had made a bad batch, so I got a refund, &#x27;cause there was NO WAY that I was going to wear that&lt;br /&gt;STINKING stuff!!!  Then I bought NUDE from two other perfume vendors. .....I got the exact same STINKING----!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew why Bill Blass&#x27; Co. RUINED my beautiful signature cologne!!</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Clean musk, I&#x27;m a sophisticated orchestra that gives you a feeling of sexiness. Whoever created this knew it would put you in the mind of a clean freshly showered nude body getting ready to cuddle with your significant other-genius! One of my faves!</li>
