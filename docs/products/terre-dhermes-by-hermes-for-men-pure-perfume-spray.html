            <li>The silliage is good but not over powerful.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to try them out at a store like Nordstrom before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>i have the cologne &amp; love it</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Chanel Bleu\\&quot; (all three are outstanding bottles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When buying fragances, it&#x27;s much better to try it in person.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Many have favorably complimented this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knock off!</li>
            <li>your money and buy from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>Make sure you find a sample of this somewhere before you buy, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li>The gf fell in love with it, as well as her girl friends and so on.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and have choose Terre D&#x27; Hermes as my favorite men scents ever.  </li>
            <li>Ladies... Love...</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>This smell is top 10, I can easily think of 5 colognes i prefer off the top of my head than this.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product it was sent to me right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please make sure you buy the original product and don&#x27;t worry about spending more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon, as always, shipped it out very quickly and it arrived intact.</li>
            <li>The scent is earthy, but not so strong it telegraphs his presence from twenty feet away.</li>
            <li>, I wear it everywhere, but if you are on a tighter budget, I recommend picking up something a bit more mainstream and using this on special occasions only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started wearing this cologne on the advice of a clerk at a Duty Free boutique in Paris.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it is worth splurging to buy the Parmum as it has longer staying power, and smells more luxurious.  </li>
            <li>You are going to pay a lot more for this, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well, if smelling like a million bucks is important to you, then yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw the larger bottle, I thought great, let&#x27;s get that.</li>
            <li>I was worried about spending so much money on a cologne that I cannot smell, because no one around here carries it, but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>And this scent is very distinct from others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is masculine, spicy and woodsy with a classy full bodied aroma that leaves those who experience it talking about it in a great way!!!</li>
            <li>All I will say is buy it, wear it - but only if you have the confidence to walk your own path - this is no Aqua de Gio or Coolwater!  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I thought it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stunning, for anyone interested in moving away from the atrocity that has become of this.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is definitely unique which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The scent of the real stuff is fantastic and while I can&#x27;t speak to the authentic parfum, the toilette lasted for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li>see EDP (eau de parfum) lasts much longer and has a more wholesome range of smell.</li>
            <li>and then it fades to a mild flinty mineral note.</li>
            <li>but quickly the fragance fades.</li>
            <li>Has a unique aroma that is incredibly crisp and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own it already, purchase it in the parfum form which is smoother and longer lasting than the eau de toilette.  </li>
            <li>It smells extremely classy, and I will also note that it is one of these unique kind of colognes that can create vivid memories for those who wear it and those around the wearer.  </li>
            <li>feel it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>And the stronger scent that lingers about you will engender the inevitable question, \\&quot;what kind of Cologne are you wearing?\\</li>
            <li>I smell fresh to death.</li>
            <li>any case, despite the smell being great, the &#x27;Parfum&#x27; is nowhere near as strong as the previous bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes parfum I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Parfum Spray is superior to the EDT, it is very potent and a little will last all day.  </li>
            <li>And they were right.</li>
            <li>little is needed to get a nice scent on the skin!</li>
            <li>It has a very natural and fresh smell with a hint of sweetness without being sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>It smells good maybe like a combo of a little bit of patchouli, wood, and  also orange.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely mysterious scent my husband loves.</li>
            <li>Considerable savings available if you purchase the largest Parfum Spray container.</li>
            <li>For sure next one I will buy from the store.</li>
            <li>I thought, right, that&#x27;s what I want, a large bottle of Parfum, so I don&#x27;t run out so frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another Product I am really interested in is the Hermes Bath Shower Gel  \\&quot;Eau D&#x27;Orange</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I was buying coffee at one of those street vendors, at first I couldn&#x27;t understand him because of his accent.  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing!</li>
            <li>I am one of those mindless collectors who likes to buy anything that&#x27;s good and for a while now I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a Hermes.</li>
            <li>I have used Terre d&#x27; Hermes for several years now, mostly the EDT but also the pure perfume.</li>
            <li>so i ordered the parfum thinking it would be more intense &amp; last longer...not quite so!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i like this particular Product and wants very much to be credited or substituted for a creed cologne</li>
            <li>I bought the toilette on Amazon and the scent stayed and lasted so much longer than this.  </li>
            <li>Buy the real thing.  </li>
            <li>, it is the most money I have spent on Cologne ever but</li>
            <li>I personally much prefer the smell when sprayed on clothes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for a Fall/Winter fragrance!</li>
            <li>Much richer in smell and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>much softer than the eau de toilette</li>
            <li>so much that I think I&#x27;m going to refrain from telling people what this</li>
            <li>I like Terre D&#x27; Hermes and thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I went to a near by dept. store at the mall to validate, I was right.</li>
            <li>not the original Terry D&#x60;hermes the package looks so obvious its not the original one with a black ribbon that nothing close to the original box.</li>
            <li>the price  was better than all the other sellers.</li>
            <li>The authenticity of your item is guaranteed only by the original receipt provided at the time of purchase, whether from our website or an Herm&amp;egrave;s boutique.</li>
            <li>See my other review of terre fraiche for more details.</li>
            <li>First time I ordered a Parfum version and tell you what, I am sold and feel it is worth the extra $$</li>
            <li>I catch scents of the Terre D&#x27;Hermes throughout the day and it makes me not only feel clean, but lifts my mood.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And unlike most other citrus colognes out there, this stuff lasts!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The EDP will run ~30-40% more in cost, but it&#x27;s a wash when you consider the fewer #of sprays typically needed throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I expected</li>
            <li>you have never smelled this perfume, just for kicks, I implore you to get out into the world, find a high end store and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>Has a subtle masculine smell that is good for all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and of course a fresh citrus scent mixed in.  </li>
            <li>A warm semi woodsy cedar&lt;br /&gt;scent at least on my husbands skin.</li>
            <li>Actually I&#x27;m using the, Eau De Toilette, and I was expecting for the parfum to be much better, but to my surprise it&#x27;s the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I was looking for new cologne and purchased a bunch of the sample vials.</li>
            <li>, last week, I got in touch with a friend at BG&#x27;s, and he confirmed that something was different in the formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like this is a kind of cologne that you either fall in love with or hate so much.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>When I first noticed the smell dissipating, I thought my allergies were just acting up.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Ill be honest, i smelled it for the first time</li>
            <li>The scent is close to the original but does not last long at all and seems a tad lighter.</li>
            <li>The Eau de toilette version of this seems to last just as long on my skin, but the parfum is still worth it since its a different smell, although I can see someone liking the other one more.</li>
            <li>I paid for the Parfum version since you really cannot beat the low price.</li>
            <li>The parfum does have a different top note to it but the middle and base notes are great.</li>
            <li>I finally went to a store in Dubai and asked the clerk how much a 100 ml costs</li>
            <li>For instance, I could spray two notches of this perfume and it would last me the whole night.</li>
            <li>I found the Amazon reviews to be very helpful, especially those that recommended the Eau de PARFUM over the EDT.</li>
            <li>A couple spritzes of this parfum lasted nearly all damn day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this parfum for a long time and every time that I bought a new one it was the same beautiful, sensual smell, but this time the one that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon was truly a fake product because the smell is not the same, and mind you on top of that I&#x27;ve paid quite a few dollars for it.</li>
            <li>If you like something different with a Great smell and a long lasting subtle scent then this is the cologne for you.</li>
            <li>Actually, this does not remotely smell like the real product that I have purchased before from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>For a guy who likes a classic, modern and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Though they were not given full details, they were told to accept all returns immediately for this, and a few others.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t blame anyone per se for this mixup, and I can live with the Toilet for this purchase... but the 2 really should not be on the same page, or the product title needs to change when the product is actually different.</li>
            <li>Unlike most men&#x27;s colognes out there (which are usually too unisex, fresh and floral for my tastes), this cologe is subtle, mature, European, and masculine without being &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The next week, while having lunch with some old friends, they said that they were suprised that I wasn&#x27;t wearing my signature scent...</li>
            <li>This resembles Old Spice and possesses none of the same notes or characteristics.</li>
            <li>Luckily HERMES is not available locally where I&#x27;m situated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I come back and checked the page, in the description, it clearly says Toilet, but in the Title, it clearly says Parfum.</li>
            <li>The main note in this is bitter orange.</li>
            <li>Last month, I bought my typical large bottle at Nordstrom (the large lasts me about two years when circulating with other scents).</li>
            <li>Packaging is VERY suspicious as the barcodes are altered and the box itself has been taped with what appears to be black electrical tape?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I started wearing this cologne on the advice of a clerk at a Duty Free boutique in Paris.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it is worth splurging to buy the Parmum as it has longer staying power, and smells more luxurious.  </li>
            <li> You are going to pay a lot more for this, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well, if smelling like a million bucks is important to you, then yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw the larger bottle, I thought great, let&#x27;s get that.</li>
            <li> I was worried about spending so much money on a cologne that I cannot smell, because no one around here carries it, but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> And this scent is very distinct from others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is masculine, spicy and woodsy with a classy full bodied aroma that leaves those who experience it talking about it in a great way!!!</li>
            <li> All I will say is buy it, wear it - but only if you have the confidence to walk your own path - this is no Aqua de Gio or Coolwater!  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I thought it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stunning, for anyone interested in moving away from the atrocity that has become of this.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is definitely unique which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The scent of the real stuff is fantastic and while I can&#x27;t speak to the authentic parfum, the toilette lasted for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li> see EDP (eau de parfum) lasts much longer and has a more wholesome range of smell.</li>
            <li> and then it fades to a mild flinty mineral note.</li>
            <li> but quickly the fragance fades.</li>
            <li> Has a unique aroma that is incredibly crisp and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own it already, purchase it in the parfum form which is smoother and longer lasting than the eau de toilette.  </li>
            <li> It smells extremely classy, and I will also note that it is one of these unique kind of colognes that can create vivid memories for those who wear it and those around the wearer.  </li>
            <li> feel it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> And the stronger scent that lingers about you will engender the inevitable question, \\&quot;what kind of Cologne are you wearing?\\</li>
            <li> I smell fresh to death.</li>
            <li> any case, despite the smell being great, the &#x27;Parfum&#x27; is nowhere near as strong as the previous bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes parfum I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Parfum Spray is superior to the EDT, it is very potent and a little will last all day.  </li>
            <li> And they were right.</li>
            <li> little is needed to get a nice scent on the skin!</li>
            <li> It has a very natural and fresh smell with a hint of sweetness without being sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> It smells good maybe like a combo of a little bit of patchouli, wood, and  also orange.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely mysterious scent my husband loves.</li>
            <li> Considerable savings available if you purchase the largest Parfum Spray container.</li>
            <li> For sure next one I will buy from the store.</li>
            <li> I thought, right, that&#x27;s what I want, a large bottle of Parfum, so I don&#x27;t run out so frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another Product I am really interested in is the Hermes Bath Shower Gel  \\&quot;Eau D&#x27;Orange</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I was buying coffee at one of those street vendors, at first I couldn&#x27;t understand him because of his accent.  </li>
            <li> This is the real thing!</li>
            <li> I am one of those mindless collectors who likes to buy anything that&#x27;s good and for a while now I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a Hermes.</li>
            <li> I have used Terre d&#x27; Hermes for several years now, mostly the EDT but also the pure perfume.</li>
            <li> so i ordered the parfum thinking it would be more intense &amp; last longer...not quite so!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i like this particular Product and wants very much to be credited or substituted for a creed cologne</li>
            <li> I bought the toilette on Amazon and the scent stayed and lasted so much longer than this.  </li>
            <li> Buy the real thing.  </li>
            <li> , it is the most money I have spent on Cologne ever but</li>
            <li> I personally much prefer the smell when sprayed on clothes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for a Fall/Winter fragrance!</li>
            <li> Much richer in smell and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> much softer than the eau de toilette</li>
            <li> so much that I think I&#x27;m going to refrain from telling people what this</li>
            <li> I like Terre D&#x27; Hermes and thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I went to a near by dept. store at the mall to validate, I was right.</li>
            <li> not the original Terry D&#x60;hermes the package looks so obvious its not the original one with a black ribbon that nothing close to the original box.</li>
            <li> the price  was better than all the other sellers.</li>
            <li> The authenticity of your item is guaranteed only by the original receipt provided at the time of purchase, whether from our website or an Herm&amp;egrave;s boutique.</li>
            <li> See my other review of terre fraiche for more details.</li>
            <li> First time I ordered a Parfum version and tell you what, I am sold and feel it is worth the extra $$</li>
            <li> I catch scents of the Terre D&#x27;Hermes throughout the day and it makes me not only feel clean, but lifts my mood.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And unlike most other citrus colognes out there, this stuff lasts!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The EDP will run ~30-40% more in cost, but it&#x27;s a wash when you consider the fewer #of sprays typically needed throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected</li>
            <li> you have never smelled this perfume, just for kicks, I implore you to get out into the world, find a high end store and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Has a subtle masculine smell that is good for all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and of course a fresh citrus scent mixed in.  </li>
            <li> A warm semi woodsy cedar&lt;br /&gt;scent at least on my husbands skin.</li>
            <li> Actually I&#x27;m using the, Eau De Toilette, and I was expecting for the parfum to be much better, but to my surprise it&#x27;s the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new cologne and purchased a bunch of the sample vials.</li>
            <li> , last week, I got in touch with a friend at BG&#x27;s, and he confirmed that something was different in the formula.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like this is a kind of cologne that you either fall in love with or hate so much.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> When I first noticed the smell dissipating, I thought my allergies were just acting up.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Ill be honest, i smelled it for the first time</li>
            <li> The scent is close to the original but does not last long at all and seems a tad lighter.</li>
            <li> The Eau de toilette version of this seems to last just as long on my skin, but the parfum is still worth it since its a different smell, although I can see someone liking the other one more.</li>
            <li> I paid for the Parfum version since you really cannot beat the low price.</li>
            <li> The parfum does have a different top note to it but the middle and base notes are great.</li>
            <li> I finally went to a store in Dubai and asked the clerk how much a 100 ml costs</li>
            <li> For instance, I could spray two notches of this perfume and it would last me the whole night.</li>
            <li> I found the Amazon reviews to be very helpful, especially those that recommended the Eau de PARFUM over the EDT.</li>
            <li> A couple spritzes of this parfum lasted nearly all damn day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this parfum for a long time and every time that I bought a new one it was the same beautiful, sensual smell, but this time the one that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon was truly a fake product because the smell is not the same, and mind you on top of that I&#x27;ve paid quite a few dollars for it.</li>
            <li> If you like something different with a Great smell and a long lasting subtle scent then this is the cologne for you.</li>
            <li> Actually, this does not remotely smell like the real product that I have purchased before from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> For a guy who likes a classic, modern and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Though they were not given full details, they were told to accept all returns immediately for this, and a few others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame anyone per se for this mixup, and I can live with the Toilet for this purchase... but the 2 really should not be on the same page, or the product title needs to change when the product is actually different.</li>
            <li> Unlike most men&#x27;s colognes out there (which are usually too unisex, fresh and floral for my tastes), this cologe is subtle, mature, European, and masculine without being &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The next week, while having lunch with some old friends, they said that they were suprised that I wasn&#x27;t wearing my signature scent...</li>
            <li> This resembles Old Spice and possesses none of the same notes or characteristics.</li>
            <li> Luckily HERMES is not available locally where I&#x27;m situated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I come back and checked the page, in the description, it clearly says Toilet, but in the Title, it clearly says Parfum.</li>
            <li> The main note in this is bitter orange.</li>
            <li> Last month, I bought my typical large bottle at Nordstrom (the large lasts me about two years when circulating with other scents).</li>
            <li> Packaging is VERY suspicious as the barcodes are altered and the box itself has been taped with what appears to be black electrical tape?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, powerful but not intense.</li>
            <li> Our previously purchased EDT&#x27;s fragrance is pure Hermes and it is long lasting,complex and layered.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you are selling the right product, it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> perfume is made  with  essential oil that makes it last for as long as 12 hours .</li>
            <li> , it has also got a long lasting scent which you would definitely consider.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting, not over bearing and attracts women unlike anything I have ever known in my life.</li>
            <li> Well the trial size did not last long at all</li>
            <li> It stays long enough.</li>
            <li> Yet, it will easily last a long time as I said</li>
            <li> I spray it on my skin, weather my wrist or neck, I get a similar smell to what is described above, but there it seems to last only about half an hour</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived today, and it&#x27;s Toilet.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s a strong suffocating scent.</li>
            <li> I usually opt for a musk-dominant EDT over the highly floral scents.</li>
            <li> It lasts really long.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to discover it.</li>
            <li> I was frankly a little shocked when I first smelled this cologne, and I knew instantly that I had found the unique scent I had always been after.  </li>
            <li> On clothes the strongest note I get is pine tree, but not that nasty burning pine sol bathroom cleaner, this is sweet sappy smooth and delicate pine, it smells very luxurious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown tired of the relative short-acting EDTs, but stay within the highly musk-oriented category.</li>
            <li> We have a little of the EDT that we purchased at Nordstrom left.</li>
            <li> the product arrive  before the day  expected  and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity.</li>
            <li> this stuff IS expensive, but i think its worth the investment for an evening/winter cologne.</li>
            <li> Subtle, professional, it lasts, but doesn&#x27;t blast the room.  </li>
            <li> collection includes Bvlgari Man/Aqua , Calvin Klein, Armani Code, Lacoste, Davidoff, Polo, One Million, Fierce by A&amp;F (possible favourite in past) , Burberry, etc etc.</li>
            <li> Five total sprays, as usual.</li>
            <li> I have had bottles from neiman and other places to compare.</li>
            <li> bar code and the ID is exacto-knife cut off of the box.. and replaced with a dummy bar code and a black square</li>
            <li> As a serious cologne fan I&#x27;ve tried several scents over the years.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I get a little bit of citrus peel, wood, leather and spice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> have had a few compliments on occasion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing Terre for a few years.</li>
            <li> Usually when one puts on such an expensive fragance it&#x27;s expected to have some compliment from family members,  coworkers or friends.</li>
            <li> I hate the overly musky scents and I do not want a sweet cologne on a man, but this is just yummy.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is the oiginal one.</li>
            <li> I will find a small crowd assemble/</li>
            <li> With people waiting behind me he wrote it down.  </li>
            <li> There is hardly any perfume in it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the seller intentionally sold the fake one.</li>
            <li> when I wear it, I never get tired of admiring it</li>
            <li> fake one avoid to buy it</li>
            <li> I think that one I received is fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we cannot verify the authenticity of any item.</li>
            <li> it is ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> Having read the comments about this product I guess I purchased the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I randomly received a fake product with the preposterous label of &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I read a bad review that had said this stuff was fake.  </li>
            <li> It makes me imagine a cold, muddy day in the spring - just before everything blooms...  </li>
            <li> bottle.&lt;br /&gt;You just CAN&#x27;T go wrong with Terre D&#x27;Hermes!</li>
            <li> Lets not deny it, this is a very expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> A terrible perfume for men.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful orange scent, not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this item.</li>
            <li> As it progresses to medium and base notes, the mineral takes over.</li>
            <li> and I hate the price point.</li>
            <li> Terrible purchase; I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unlike most men&#x27;s colognes out there (which are usually too unisex, fresh and floral for my tastes), this cologe is subtle, mature, European, and masculine without being &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is most assuredly fake.  I bought the toilette on Amazon and the scent stayed and lasted so much longer than this.  Terrible purchase; I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  The scent of the real stuff is fantastic and while I can&#x27;t speak to the authentic parfum, the toilette lasted for hours and hours.  Buy the real thing.  Avoid this at all costs.  You&#x27;re just throwing money away.</li>
            <li> I paid for the Parfum version since you really cannot beat the low price. Not a day goes by with me wearing Terre D&#x27;Hermes Parfum without a woman commenting on it. I love the attention. And I put it on even when I&#x27;m alone at home at night. The smell is amazing and the best cologne I ever have owned. It is long lasting, not over bearing and attracts women unlike anything I have ever known in my life.</li>
            <li> Smell before you buy. Don&#x27;t buy based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like this is a kind of cologne that you either fall in love with or hate so much. Nothing in between. To me it&#x27;s a strong suffocating scent. It made me want to jump in a pool last time I used it. Reminds me of when my apartment was fumigated.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own it already, purchase it in the parfum form which is smoother and longer lasting than the eau de toilette.  It is masculine, spicy and woodsy with a classy full bodied aroma that leaves those who experience it talking about it in a great way!!!</li>
            <li> A terrible perfume for men.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful orange scent, not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected but the scent is mellow and it grows on you. Females definitely love it.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this cologne on the advice of a clerk at a Duty Free boutique in Paris.  I was frankly a little shocked when I first smelled this cologne, and I knew instantly that I had found the unique scent I had always been after.  It smells extremely classy, and I will also note that it is one of these unique kind of colognes that can create vivid memories for those who wear it and those around the wearer.  It makes me imagine a cold, muddy day in the spring - just before everything blooms...  Minerals, ash, flint, granite, mud, ponds... and of course a fresh citrus scent mixed in.  All I will say is buy it, wear it - but only if you have the confidence to walk your own path - this is no Aqua de Gio or Coolwater!  Also, I have purchased two bottles of the more expensive Parfum and one bottle of the Eau de Toilette.  I will say that it is worth splurging to buy the Parmum as it has longer staying power, and smells more luxurious.  Quite simply, Terre makes me feel good in the morning, and that&#x27;s just about the best thing you can say about a scent.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am very pleased with the product it was sent to me right away. I got it at a good price thank you I have no complaints the service is exceptional!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for new cologne and purchased a bunch of the sample vials. I like a good number of them, but when I tried this it was just it. Terre D&#x27;hermes smells very sophisticated and manly, and improves my mood every time I wear it. Amazon, as always, shipped it out very quickly and it arrived intact.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband. The scent is earthy, but not so strong it telegraphs his presence from twenty feet away.</li>
            <li> fake one avoid to buy it</li>
            <li> This  is the best purchase that  I have ever made .this  perfume is made  with  essential oil that makes it last for as long as 12 hours . this  combine  with  regular Hermes au the perfume  makes  a  great  pair for  day or evening wear. the product arrive  before the day  expected  and the price  was better than all the other sellers. Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought the trial Cologne and let me tell you this is the best smelling cologne I have ever tried. Well the trial size did not last long at all so I read the reviews on the Parfum and decided to take to plunge, it is the most money I have spent on Cologne ever but feel it will be worth it. I cannot wait to wear it once it arrives and will update this review accordingly.</li>
            <li> Ive tried literally hundreds of colognes, in search of the one amazing sent, each time I find one, it gets discontinued.  This smell is top 10, I can easily think of 5 colognes i prefer off the top of my head than this.  Save your money and buy something your sure of.</li>
            <li> The perfume is great but it doesn&#x27;t spread out in the air, so people should be really close to you to smell the perfume. still love it</li>
            <li> I wish I could post photos to show the box and the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product ID is etched off of the bottle..&lt;br /&gt;The bar code and the ID is exacto-knife cut off of the box.. and replaced with a dummy bar code and a black square sticker.&lt;br /&gt;It was then re-wrapped as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it was a factory second.. I hope it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;fake\\&quot;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, despite the smell being great, the &#x27;Parfum&#x27; is nowhere near as strong as the previous bottle of Terre d&#x27;Hermes parfum I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the EDT I&#x27;ve owned lasts longer than this &#x27;parfum&#x27;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do what I&#x27;m doing next time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the extra $25 and buy it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUSPECT.</li>
            <li> Very good smell! The parfum does have a different top note to it but the middle and base notes are great. The silliage is good but not over powerful.  For a guy who likes a classic, modern and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest citrus products there is. The main note in this is bitter orange. And unlike most other citrus colognes out there, this stuff lasts! You are going to pay a lot more for this, but it&#x27;s worth it. It smells great, and lasts through the day. One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Lets not deny it, this is a very expensive cologne. Is it worth it? Well, if smelling like a million bucks is important to you, then yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this cologne smells depends where you sprayed it. I personally much prefer the smell when sprayed on clothes. On clothes the strongest note I get is pine tree, but not that nasty burning pine sol bathroom cleaner, this is sweet sappy smooth and delicate pine, it smells very luxurious. Besides that, I get a little bit of citrus peel, wood, leather and spice.&lt;br /&gt;When I spray it on my skin, weather my wrist or neck, I get a similar smell to what is described above, but there it seems to last only about half an hour and then it fades to a mild flinty mineral note. Overall this Parfum smells to me, like a pine forest on a rainy morning. It has a very natural and fresh smell with a hint of sweetness without being sickeningly sweet. It just exudes confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through a 2.5 ounce bottle of this stuff in just over 6 months because the smell makes me feel great, I wear it everywhere, but if you are on a tighter budget, I recommend picking up something a bit more mainstream and using this on special occasions only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that my description of the smell differs from others, but everyone perceives smell a bit differently. The Eau de toilette version of this seems to last just as long on my skin, but the parfum is still worth it since its a different smell, although I can see someone liking the other one more. Make sure to try them out at a store like Nordstrom before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I thought it&#x27;s okay but I might not buy it again. About 30 minutes later, I changed my opinion. It starts as incense aromatic. Consider tobacco rubbed on cedar. As it progresses to medium and base notes, the mineral takes over. It&#x27;s heavy, powerful but not intense. Assertive in one word. It is perfect for close-up moments. It stays long enough. I think it is not everybody&#x27;s fragrance. Try it if you can before you buy it.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely mysterious scent my husband loves. Just a tad is all that&#x27;s needed. A warm semi woodsy cedar&lt;br /&gt;scent at least on my husbands skin. He loves it and I hate the price point. Yet, it will easily last a long time as I said&lt;br /&gt;so little is needed to get a nice scent on the skin! Highly recommend for a Fall/Winter fragrance!</li>
            <li> If you like something different with a Great smell and a long lasting subtle scent then this is the cologne for you.</li>
            <li> A marvelous bottle houses a delightful, brisk, woody fragrance that never disappoints. My highest recommendation.  Considerable savings available if you purchase the largest Parfum Spray container.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, fresh and clean, has a manly smell!  Bought this for my son for Christmas, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Not sure it is the oiginal one. The scent is close to the original but does not last long at all and seems a tad lighter. For sure next one I will buy from the store.</li>
            <li> I have used Terre d&#x27; Hermes for several years now, mostly the EDT but also the pure perfume. However, this purchase is very low quality. It is watery. There is hardly any perfume in it. You would need a lot on your body to even smell this stock, and it won&#x27;t  last an hour. I would hesitate to buy cologne or perfume by this method. I would now prefer to know what I&#x27;m buying and where I can complain and return the item purchased.</li>
            <li> Much richer in smell and lasts longer. Has all the awesome qualities as the cologne but more intense, although not overpowering by any means. First time I ordered a Parfum version and tell you what, I am sold and feel it is worth the extra $$</li>
            <li> Excellent!  The Parfum Spray is superior to the EDT, it is very potent and a little will last all day.  Has a unique aroma that is incredibly crisp and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I like the product so I&#x27;m giving it a 5, but please note, I&#x27;m not critiquing the product, I&#x27;m critiquing the product descriptors on the sales page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to the Parfum page because I had purchased it before (buy it again). When I saw the larger bottle, I thought great, let&#x27;s get that. The Title didn&#x27;t change, so I thought, right, that&#x27;s what I want, a large bottle of Parfum, so I don&#x27;t run out so frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today, and it&#x27;s Toilet. I come back and checked the page, in the description, it clearly says Toilet, but in the Title, it clearly says Parfum. I can&#x27;t blame anyone per se for this mixup, and I can live with the Toilet for this purchase... but the 2 really should not be on the same page, or the product title needs to change when the product is actually different.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think that one I received is fake. The smell goes away after 2 hours. I went to a near by dept. store at the mall to validate, I was right. Not sure if the seller intentionally sold the fake one. The original smells great and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is some fancy cologne or &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; or whatnot.  It smells good maybe like a combo of a little bit of patchouli, wood, and  also orange.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i like this particular Product and wants very much to be credited or substituted for a creed cologne</li>
            <li> not the original Terry D&#x60;hermes the package looks so obvious its not the original one with a black ribbon that nothing close to the original box.</li>
            <li> One of the best for men!, love it!</li>
            <li> i have the cologne &amp; love it so i ordered the parfum thinking it would be more intense &amp; last longer...not quite so! much softer than the eau de toilette</li>
            <li> Subtle, professional, it lasts, but doesn&#x27;t blast the room.  I will be re-ordering when the time comes - 100% chance.</li>

            <li> I am one of those mindless collectors who likes to buy anything that&#x27;s good and for a while now I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a Hermes. I finally went to a store in Dubai and asked the clerk how much a 100 ml costs and he showed me EDT and EDP but there was a MASSIVE DIFFERENCE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see EDP (eau de parfum) lasts much longer and has a more wholesome range of smell. For instance, I could spray two notches of this perfume and it would last me the whole night. Six notches and I will find a small crowd assemble/gather to admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My collection includes Bvlgari Man/Aqua , Calvin Klein, Armani Code, Lacoste, Davidoff, Polo, One Million, Fierce by A&amp;F (possible favourite in past) , Burberry, etc etc. but I have to ADMIT, I now only feel like using this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine this, it outshines \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; , \\&quot;Bvlgari Man\\&quot; , \\&quot;Chanel Bleu\\&quot; (all three are outstanding bottles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that I think I&#x27;m going to refrain from telling people what this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is ridiculously expensive but I know I&#x27;m going to wear this forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I wear it, I never get tired of admiring it and it&#x27;s been 25 days since that began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you buy the original product and don&#x27;t worry about spending more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never smelled this perfume, just for kicks, I implore you to get out into the world, find a high end store and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends are forbidden from using this cause only I want to sport it. Luckily HERMES is not available locally where I&#x27;m situated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Product I am really interested in is the Hermes Bath Shower Gel  \\&quot;Eau D&#x27;Orange Verte\\&quot; is GODLY. I&#x27;m ordering that soon as I have the resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I like to wear this to the gym? Local bar? Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I like to wear this on a date? Hell yes. Party? Yes. Celebrations/Gatherings? Yes. It lasts really long.</li>
            <li> Unlike eau fraiche version from Amazon, this one actually smells the same as Neiman marcus version.  See my other review of terre fraiche for more details. Seems online fragrances always a crapshoot, but possibly deserved when saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.  Fast shipping!  Perfect Christmas gift ans my son was thrilled when he opened the package. He was one happy camper!</li>
            <li> my husband said he like the smell of this parfum spray so we tried it.very nice smell on the body</li>
            <li> Usually when one puts on such an expensive fragance it&#x27;s expected to have some compliment from family members,  coworkers or friends. Nothing of this happened! It&#x27;s because the smell fades from the time one leaves home to the time one arrives at work (in my case 45 minutes). Having read the comments about this product I guess I purchased the wrong product. It smells nice but quickly the fragance fades. It&#x27;s a pity. Maybe I randomly received a fake product with the preposterous label of &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34;. The lesson: When buying fragances, it&#x27;s much better to try it in person.</li>
            <li> My husband gets so many compliments, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Great for daytime wear. Has a subtle masculine smell that is good for all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a few compliments on occasion. Does not attack the sensory glands.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the one from the department store (which is also a bit pricier).  Packaging is VERY suspicious as the barcodes are altered and the box itself has been taped with what appears to be black electrical tape?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne. Everywhere I go, I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how it smells. Thumbs up to Hermes!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is outstanding.  I was buying coffee at one of those street vendors, at first I couldn&#x27;t understand him because of his accent.  He was asking what I was wearing.  With people waiting behind me he wrote it down.  Many have favorably complimented this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knock off! Don&#x27;t buy it. I read a bad review that had said this stuff was fake.  I didnt believe it. Well I 100% now believe this is a imposter perfume.  Actually, this does not remotely smell like the real product that I have purchased before from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy from a reputable source. Btw... since this is a flammable/glass product, you cannot return it for exchange. I&#x27;m out 80 bucks!</li>
            <li> very lovely and chic fragrance from hermes, it has also got a long lasting scent which you would definitely consider.</li>
            <li> ATTENTION!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just from buying it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wearing Terre for a few years. Last month, I bought my typical large bottle at Nordstrom (the large lasts me about two years when circulating with other scents). When I first noticed the smell dissipating, I thought my allergies were just acting up. The next week, while having lunch with some old friends, they said that they were suprised that I wasn&#x27;t wearing my signature scent... I was. Five total sprays, as usual. Yeah I know. I like to make an entrance...&lt;br /&gt;Well, last week, I got in touch with a friend at BG&#x27;s, and he confirmed that something was different in the formula. Though they were not given full details, they were told to accept all returns immediately for this, and a few others. I guess there&#x27;s some sort of shift in the industry?&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I&#x27;m moving on to Bond #9&#x27;s Amber. It&#x27;s stunning, for anyone interested in moving away from the atrocity that has become of this.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing! I have read several reviews about the authenticity of this. I have had bottles from neiman and other places to compare. This is exactly the same. The fragrance is definitely unique which is what I wanted. Make sure you find a sample of this somewhere before you buy, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I like Terre D&#x27; Hermes and thought the price was reasonable.  Received the product within a week after ordering it; very satisfied with the vendor; would recommend both the cologne and vendor.</li>
            <li> This perfume is excellent, I recommend everyone to give it a try</li>
            <li> Screams sophistication.  Its Hermes, they know how to do it, don&#x27;t they?</li>
            <li> Ill be honest, i smelled it for the first time and I was unsure of what to think. (obviously my opinion doesn&#x27;t count its the girls that counts) The gf fell in love with it, as well as her girl friends and so on. this stuff IS expensive, but i think its worth the investment for an evening/winter cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this parfum for a long time and every time that I bought a new one it was the same beautiful, sensual smell, but this time the one that I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon was truly a fake product because the smell is not the same, and mind you on top of that I&#x27;ve paid quite a few dollars for it. Actually I&#x27;m using the, Eau De Toilette, and I was expecting for the parfum to be much better, but to my surprise it&#x27;s the complete opposite. I really don&#x27;t think you are selling the right product, it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and have choose Terre D&#x27; Hermes as my favorite men scents ever.  I just can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to discover it.</li>
            <li> As a serious cologne fan I&#x27;ve tried several scents over the years. I usually opt for a musk-dominant EDT over the highly floral scents. I&#x27;ve grown tired of the relative short-acting EDTs, but stay within the highly musk-oriented category. Well, no longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched the Terre D&#x27;Hermes quite a lot. I found the Amazon reviews to be very helpful, especially those that recommended the Eau de PARFUM over the EDT. And they were right. A couple spritzes of this parfum lasted nearly all damn day. And this scent is very distinct from others I&#x27;ve used. Ladies... Love... It. It&#x27;s like getting them to ask, \\&quot;so, what&#x27;s the name of your puppy?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dose myself after the a.m. shower (it only takes a couple sprays), even if I am staying in for the day or just heading to Starbuck&#x27;s for some reading. I catch scents of the Terre D&#x27;Hermes throughout the day and it makes me not only feel clean, but lifts my mood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EDP will run ~30-40% more in cost, but it&#x27;s a wash when you consider the fewer #of sprays typically needed throughout the day. And the stronger scent that lingers about you will engender the inevitable question, \\&quot;what kind of Cologne are you wearing?\\&quot; I just say, \\&quot;Aqua Velva\\&quot; - I don&#x27;t want the competition to know what cologne I&#x27;m sportin&#x27;. I&#x27;m an enigma... for about $100 for a 2.5oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;You just CAN&#x27;T go wrong with Terre D&#x27;Hermes! Here&#x27;s the link:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002Z7FSK8/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1?qid&#x3D;1363457617&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;pi&#x3D;SL75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy,&lt;br /&gt;Aqua Velva</li>
            <li> Thank you for your excellent service and good quality</li>
            <li> still a tracks the ladies</li>
            <li> I was worried about spending so much money on a cologne that I cannot smell, because no one around here carries it, but it is amazing. As soon as my husband put it on, I knew I liked it. I hate the overly musky scents and I do not want a sweet cologne on a man, but this is just yummy. Perfect for anyone who wants a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> as advertised.  I smell fresh to death.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this item. We have a little of the EDT that we purchased at Nordstrom left. This should smell richer than it but it smells like carbonated cologne - as if this fragrance has been diluted. Our previously purchased EDT&#x27;s fragrance is pure Hermes and it is long lasting,complex and layered. This resembles Old Spice and possesses none of the same notes or characteristics. If it seems too good to be true than it is. We are returning this item.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I get many compliments when I wear it.  I collect colognes and this is now in my top 5 that I own.</li>
