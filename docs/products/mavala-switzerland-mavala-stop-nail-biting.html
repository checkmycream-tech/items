            <li>When she ahd a fully successful day ( no thumb sucking at all)</li>
            <li>and they both have successfully stopped thumbsucking.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t use it per instructions because he got used to the taste and actually liked it!  </li>
            <li>Now I have nice manicured fingernails!</li>
            <li>Successfully helped me to stop bite my nails.</li>
            <li>we thought this would be the best and most</li>
            <li>Effective results!</li>
            <li>and more importantly, he is so proud of himself!!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has stopped biting her nails and they are growing out nicely!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been successful.</li>
            <li>your nail clippers handy!</li>
            <li>So... with that kind of feedback, I&#x27;ve never dared to put this on my fingernails and taste it!</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this product is that it works while they&#x27;re sleeping too!</li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>Regardless not as successful as i had hoped for her.</li>
            <li>And somewhat successful for me.</li>
            <li>Makes a great gift! :)</li>
            <li>Forget that, I slathered some on her thumbnails once a night before bedtime for about 3 weeks (called it \\&quot;magic fingernail polish\\&quot;) and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>We have been using it for a couple weeks a noticed remarkable results.</li>
            <li>Remarkable product.  </li>
            <li>Truly remarkable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and wanted to share it with moms who are looking for a product to get rid of Thumb sucking hassle free way!</li>
            <li>so it looks nice!</li>
            <li>but it is not 100 percent successful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know it would this successful.</li>
            <li>We have tried all sorts of home remedies and none have been successful, but this product did the trick.</li>
            <li>but that is what makes it effective!</li>
            <li>This is great product although I do recommend reading some reviews so you can get a good idea of what to expect or so...</li>
            <li>Effective!</li>
            <li>It was successful in that.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;m glad that my child has beautiful nails now!!!</li>
            <li>BUT they will have nice nails!</li>
            <li>I&#x27; have that kind of time!</li>
            <li>and it worked great as I started right away!!!!</li>
            <li>This will be a pleasant surprise for Granny and Poppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very glad that we got it, seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews unless a product really is impressive and this stuff is awesome!!</li>
            <li>One of this products best features is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li>It is very very strong!</li>
            <li>but with this stuff it was a very easy transition!</li>
            <li>It is very strong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful feeling to look at healthy nails that are your own!</li>
            <li>oh so brightly colored world</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and her progress, this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I would put bright nail polish on to discourage my nail bitting</li>
            <li>My twins teeth aleady don&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>( a good thing)</li>
            <li>so I would draw in a star for good effort and honesty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked online for some products, and i saw this product, it had really good reviews from hundreds of people.</li>
            <li>By the 5th days she was good.</li>
            <li>The pepper nail polish flavor tasted good and</li>
            <li>Good idea to keep lozengers on hand to get rid of the taste if you should accidently taste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff ..  </li>
            <li>We set my daughter up by telling her someday her thumbs wouldn&#x27;t taste good.  </li>
            <li>We continued the nightly application for a week just for good measure.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter is 2 and-a-half and loved to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li>The thumb did not taste good anymore.</li>
            <li>We tried Thumb, which may as well have been candy for as good as it worked.  </li>
            <li>loved it.</li>
            <li>Helps, but no product is the answer for the underlying issue - good supplemental.</li>
            <li>Product worked soo good</li>
            <li>you need to stop biting your nails for good, THIS IS YOUR STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>but probably good we didn&#x27;t because it says ages three and up.</li>
            <li>I regretted that decision with a good 15 minutes of bitterness in my mouth and throat.</li>
            <li>and it had good reviews</li>
            <li>I loved this product it worked with in 4 days</li>
            <li>Good luck to others</li>
            <li>Also good for practical joke.</li>
            <li>The taste is a good deterrent from nail biting.</li>
            <li>It took a good week or two</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good, but</li>
            <li>Good:</li>
            <li>Good God.  </li>
            <li>We reward him for each time we clip all 10 of his finger nails to reinforce the good habit of not biting fingers.  </li>
            <li>We gave her fair warning that this product was coming, and when it arrived (about 6 weeks ago)</li>
            <li>She kept saying that her thumbs didn&#x27;t taste good anymore.</li>
            <li>i saw this had really good reviews on amazon</li>
            <li>So I asked him to lick his painted thumbnail and tell me how it tasted, and he did and repeated that it tasted good, like food.</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this product a try after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good everyone who bites there nails should use this</li>
            <li>Lot of good that did.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>and she stopped sticking her thumb in her mouth for a good month.</li>
            <li>Best to try the cheap alternatives first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to put it again and again I just tell him that if he put it again I will use Mavala on his finger and the good boy will listen.</li>
            <li>In reflecting on my habit, I realized that biting and picking at my nails was a sort of compulsion to make things perfect, even, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were so good...</li>
            <li>Good luck to you all-</li>
            <li>Good luck to you</li>
            <li>Truly the miraculous cure you&#x27;ve been needing for you or your loved one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and they look good now.</li>
            <li>At works good but you need to do it every week</li>
            <li>helped me quit, then i started getting used to the taste, not as effective now, great for starters</li>
            <li>Product is good , go for it</li>
            <li>and he said he didn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>Mommy and Daddy don&#x27;t suck our fingers because they don&#x27;t taste good anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is a good idea, but my son didn&#x27;t stop sucking his finger after I applied it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works,so it is good</li>
            <li>My nails look good.  </li>
            <li>It started off good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the ease and effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li>If it tasted good it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>She loved helping with the nightly application.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>and this product will get in your mouth a surprising amount of times per day</li>
            <li>Taking it everywhere with us to ensure he had it on for a good amount of time to hopefully break the habit.  </li>
            <li>I had to write the review for this as it worked so good.</li>
            <li>good thing</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Yuck, which is actually a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li>when she&#x27;s reading a good book and gets to a stressful scene there she goes on auto-pilot.  </li>
            <li>This product is a good prevention for thumb sucking and nail biting.</li>
            <li>So if you reapply this after getting a bath, you should be good.</li>
            <li>this product is a really good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is a really good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, he put it in his mouth and he cried himself to sleep for a good 10 minutes</li>
            <li>After years of trying to get our son to stop sucking his thumb with no avail, we decided to give this a try after reading all the good reviews here.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t do any good for a toddler who is adicted to his thumb.</li>
            <li>it works good.</li>
            <li>I told him it didn&#x27;t taste good so he should try to keep his fingers out of his mouth.</li>
            <li>Bite\\&quot; which is as good, but can&#x27;t find anymore and started biting again.</li>
            <li>This was a good way to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb while awake.  </li>
            <li>On Friday, before my daughter went for her nap, I told her that once she wakes up, her thumb will no longer taste good.  </li>
            <li>The night went surprisingly well</li>
            <li>works good.</li>
            <li>My husband purchased THUM from the drug store and she said her fingers tasted good, so I went searching online and found Mavala.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but maybe it is good for others.</li>
            <li>I Googled to find solutions and found Mavala a Thumb Guard as options with good results.  </li>
            <li>However, not so good with my son.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an aid in the finger sucking battle this is a good one.</li>
            <li>and I think you will have good results.</li>
            <li>Good idea in theory</li>
            <li>I would estimate it took him a good 2 months to be done and not need it on his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It was effective and a great aid in helping him break a habit.</li>
            <li>Product is a good quality nail polish that prevents nail bitting or thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>product had good reviews</li>
            <li>Good idea, but my daughter figured out that you can peel the polish off after it dries.</li>
            <li>This is a good deterrant for my son is who trying to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I came on Amazon and stumbled across Mavala and decided to order it because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I tried Thum, which was about as good as putting water on this thumb for all the good it did.</li>
            <li>It has bn a good start.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews not lying when saying Vomit inducing.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get the taste out for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The taste stays in your mouth, and coats you lips, which is good if you truly want to break the habit.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>My daughter said it does not taste good</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>and if she did good not biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to all the parents out there that are in our situation.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to all the parents out there that are in our situation.  </li>
            <li>The polish DOES NOT taste good at ALL</li>
            <li>It gets under the nail and onto the skin around the nail, so I also think its good for finger chewers.  </li>
            <li>but that is a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li>serum.good good good</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps the change of scenery along with the Mavala Stop would be a good combination.  </li>
            <li>I tried socks,and tape,putting tape on his fingers and all that good stuff,and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Good Luck to you.</li>
            <li>I told her, honey, your thumb doesn&#x27;t taste good at this age and it&#x27;s time to stop.  </li>
            <li>and I seem to be good to go.</li>
            <li>Good news:</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>because if their lip accidentally even touches your finger nail they will be gagging and hating you for a good 5</li>
            <li>part is good.  </li>
            <li>, none were as good as Mavala Stop which is why I purchased a replacement bottle.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but just might not work for stubborn toddler like mine...</li>
            <li>Foods didn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good product, and does what you will expect.</li>
            <li>This product received a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li>which probably attributed to the lack of good results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mavala is a good deterrent.</li>
            <li>She admitted these products didn&#x27;t taste good, but they didn&#x27;t stop her from biting.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li>And I stopped licking the BBQ sauce off my fingers because it no longer tasted good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep putting it on her until I&#x27;m sure the habit is kicked for good!</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest it for children struggling with giving up thumb sucking!!</li>
            <li>My nails are beautiful now. :)</li>
            <li>I am so happy it was easy!</li>
            <li>That itself - just seeing them there is so awesome that it&#x27;s a super motivator for</li>
            <li>But, I didn&#x27;t purchase this for a delicious taste so this product quickly breaks the habit.</li>
            <li>unless you are soaking htem in water like in a pool, it will fade faster) but for best results if you apply it every 2 days that would be best, but it could last for 3 days.</li>
            <li>It works perfect but be aware of eating any finger foods!</li>
            <li>son&#x27;s face was priceless the first time he tasted it!  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and we are so happy not be repeating \\&quot;Get your thumb out of your mouth!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The taste will remain very potent on your nails for about three days.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the result.thing that might touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Great Product - sure it would also&lt;br /&gt;work</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product I also apply it every day rather than ever two day</li>
            <li>The stuff is very potent and doesn&#x27;t come off for days.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that it worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li>am very, very pleased.</li>
            <li>Me and her are both happy with it :)</li>
            <li>We both are very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>With all the 5-star reviews and great comments, I thought for sure this would be our answer.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re done, it&#x27;s an ongoing process, but I have been very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>on the very top of the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My son is very proud of his success.  </li>
            <li>She is doing great now :-)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the outcome because I have nails now...</li>
            <li>but he is now so proud of himself that he was able to get this habit under control.</li>
            <li>This works great when I am able to put it on my daughters fingernails.</li>
            <li>and she was very excited and happy.  </li>
            <li>I got this awesome 5 star pizza, and right before eating..</li>
            <li>I started using this about 2 weeks ago and am getting nails - beautiful strong nails.  </li>
            <li>very effective, but it didnt occur to me that i might want to be able to stick my fingers in my mouth on occasion when NOT biting at them, which proved to be an issue.</li>
            <li>It recommends use for children over 3, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a good product for anyone!</li>
            <li>So glad we purchased it!</li>
            <li>My nails do look better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks since I started using it, and I&#x27;m enjoying watching my nails grow!</li>
            <li>And my son is pretty proud of that too!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>If it could stop my daughter&#x27;s thumbsucking, it can stop most anybody&#x27;s thumbsucking!</li>
            <li>Again, magic!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li>So team up and share with someone else or another mom who might be able to use it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li>After all, he bit his fingers for most of his life!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I told him not to worry, I&#x27;d be ordering more, TODAY!</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I got Mavala!</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding!</li>
            <li>every once in a while to make sure to keep the habit gone!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>The taste is the most horrendous taste ever!</li>
            <li>But after that...no more thumbsucking!  </li>
            <li>Even in some of the most stressful times!</li>
            <li>Interestingly, if it wears off and he finds himself at the finger tip snack bar, he asks us for a re-application!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more!</li>
            <li>5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding!, April 26, 2009&lt;</li>
            <li>and my nails look way better!</li>
            <li>I have to say that it has been pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many things, but nothing has worked as well as this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>:)IT!  </li>

            <li>We love this product!</li>
            <li>He has not put his thumb in his mouth one more time since!</li>
            <li>and it was a winning combination!  </li>
            <li>I applied Mavala Stop for three days and like magic the habit was GONE!</li>
            <li>it isnt as potent!</li>
            <li>We bought more just to give to fellow struggling parents!</li>
            <li>Dear God why... My boyfriend told me about some of the reviews so the first day I was REAL good about not biting them, which incidentally makes me not want to pick at them either because of the temptation that brings to bite them.</li>
            <li>Was able to break out of it in 2 weeks time!</li>
            <li>and he still doesn&#x27;t bite his nails :) this was a win-win product!</li>
            <li>After 10 days, I removed the Mavala with fantastic results!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this stuff worked!</li>
            <li>Some say their child gagged, and or threw up, stopped eating favorite foods etc!</li>
            <li>Now she is very happy &amp; proud of herself that she stopped sucking &amp; ready to start her school with confidence :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I bought the Mavala Stop and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>and I love choosing nail varnish and painting my nails - something I have never done until now!</li>
            <li>What was more amazing was, even while he slept, he didn&#x27;t dare put his finger in his mouth!</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome</li>
            <li>and the tast lingers in your mouth so you are sure to keep your fingers out!..</li>
            <li>Now for me to get some more for my daughter!</li>
            <li>and since I work in the food service industry, I had to make sure to get nail polish remover!</li>
            <li>Would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li>and she is thumb sucking free!!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work for this too!</li>

            <li>Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing, and the taste is just horrendous.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing to jolt me from a nice afternoon gnawing at my nails quite as well as the flavor of a bottle of nail polish concentrated on one fingernail.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing to jolt me from a nice afternoon gnawing at my nails quite as well as the flavor of a bottle of nail polish concentrated on one fingernail.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I put it on our own fingers to support her</li>
            <li>Mavala does quite effectively.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does taste horrid, being the kind of Mom</li>
            <li>she now applies STOP on her own.  </li>
            <li>and he actually liked the flavor...</li>
            <li>We even used it on a friends kiddo who was about to have the dentist do some kind of \\&quot;cure</li>
            <li>Downsides are ruining any kind of finger food, and if you inadvertently lick your fingers after a chip or something, you&#x27;re in for a ruined snack.</li>
            <li>She did try to stop on her own and agreed to bandaids on her thumb</li>
            <li>it would be kind of a unsconcious act, so</li>
            <li>cost effective attempt at \\&quot;quitting.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d turn somewhere else to find a truely effective product to stop these habits.</li>
            <li>When I caught him doing it, he told me he liked the taste of it.</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED and her dentist will be, too.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I kind of stopped when I thought he was over the nail biting, but we had a couple \\&quot;relapses\\&quot; where he would bite one of them</li>
            <li>I have come to realize my son loves to suck his thumb and will have to stop on his own terms.  </li>
            <li>She really wanted to stop, and was proud of herself!  </li>
            <li>we let her apply it onto her own thumb.  </li>
            <li>I now have nice nails and when I catch myself with my hands in my mouth I stop.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how effective this product was.  </li>
            <li>advice is to go ahead and get this polish if your own kids need help with nail biting or thumb sucking and are at an age to appreciate the help.</li>
            <li>Well, this product was effective on our 4-year-old son.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it wears away on its own.</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li>I was very happy that it worked so fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t nearly so effective on my son.</li>
            <li>I tried it on one of my own thumb nails, just to know what it tastes like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a chemical-ish kind of taste.  </li>
            <li>but I can honestly say this product worked for me to quit biting my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it has worked wonders for others.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my own nails</li>
            <li>LMAO  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t notice any flavor at all, just liked that her nails were shiny.</li>
            <li>But I must say, it&#x27;s nice having nails!&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can get it from any kind of drug store or Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
            <li>you can get it from any kind of drug store or Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
            <li>I say it - nice.  </li>
            <li>but in this case it was not as effective, she would put the thumb in her mouth, make a \\&quot;this is so yucky \\&quot;</li>
            <li>Always keep it handy.</li>
            <li>I had hoped she would stop on her own</li>
            <li>Our boy liked to bite his shirt collar.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic, but it worked very well, and I am so happy it did!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even more pleased at how proud he is that he&#x27;s quit.</li>
            <li>After that it was not so effective.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my 5 year who liked  to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li>He always has his fingers in his mouth, catching a ton of germs and colds.  </li>
            <li>after that, he would just scrape it off with his teeth and proclaim that he liked the taste.</li>
            <li>and I thought it looked nice.</li>
            <li>She tried to stop on her own, but couldn&#x27;t break the habit.</li>
            <li>:) It does not taste good.</li>
            <li>My son liked the stuff, so it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>After attempting to remove the product, I put her thumb in my own mouth</li>
            <li>So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>My 3 oldest have all stopped sucking their fingers thanks to this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Recommended to many friends they loved it.  </li>
            <li>It tastes like you&#x27;ve just liked 10 envelopes all at once....</li>
            <li>within a day it&#x27;s gone.......not to mention my children still sucked their thumb and said they liked the flavor.</li>
            <li>We keep buying more with the hopes that he will kick the habit for good.</li>
            <li>Aside from that it gives my nails a nice gloss</li>
            <li>I suggest anyone try it if they just can&#x27;t stop biting on their own.  </li>
            <li>I tried to get him to stop on his own, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>; For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>but just didn&#x27;t have the will power to do it on her own.</li>
            <li>( to be completely honest I have painted it on her nails every two days since purchasing just in case she gets the desire</li>
            <li>I log onto amazon and because it is a \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li>Worked very well, in fact PERFECT for us.</li>
            <li>Best if the child wants to make the change, as this is meant to be a reminder when the child unconsciously puts his/her fingers in his/her mouth.  </li>
            <li>The best - a gentle reminder that hands do not belong in mouth.</li>
            <li>I love to look at my hands and see my gorgeous nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Too effective.</li>
            <li>Plus she liked getting her fingernail&#x27;s painted by her loving father</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>(I think baths vs. showers shorten the effective life in children).</li>
            <li>But, during the day the Mavala is 100% effective.</li>
            <li>I told him that its a good weight loss plan for people too then. :)</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s loving it ,,,</li>
            <li>This product was effective and efficient.</li>
            <li>did not expect the product to be this effective .&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li>and yes, it is effective.</li>
            <li>, I liked the reviews and decided to give it a try, and I got to say,</li>
            <li>I keep it handy in case I need it again.</li>
            <li>I put it on my own thumb to see.  </li>
            <li>Disgustingly effective...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thoroughly thrilled</li>
            <li>how effective this product has been.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think he actually liked the taste.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I would never get her to stop.  </li>
            <li>The one time that I can use it is effective in preventing my son from sucking his thumb though.</li>
            <li>The oral LD(50) for acute exposure to ethyl acetate is 4,935 mg/kg for rabbits and 5,620 mg/kg for rats; and the 8-hour rat inhalation LC(50) is 1600 ppm [Sax and Lewis 1989].\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend and painted my own thumb and stuck it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I put one coat on her fingernails and she didn&#x27;t bite them for a week or so and her nails healed nicely.  </li>
            <li>So it never looks nice, but you won&#x27;t bite your nails.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much this stuff is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bear to look at my own hands,</li>
            <li>It kind of gets over everything you touch and then put in your mouth.</li>
            <li>My daughter liked it because it&#x27;s nail polish.</li>
            <li>The instructions say don&#x27;t apply to skin, but I applied it to my cuticles and fingertips and it is effective.</li>
            <li>It kind of burns for about 30 seconds, but not like an acid burn.</li>
            <li>Amazed at how effective this product is.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best anti-nail biting product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I put some on my own fingernail in solidarity, and when I licked my finger after eating a snack I got to see how vile this stuff is, as I had to try rubbing my tongue on my sleeve to get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li>We just gave her the option that she can try not to do it on her own, but if she does it again, we have to apply it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li>She liked the bandaid but eventually would pull them off and suck.</li>
            <li>I might have liked this product</li>
            <li>:) Good Luck</li>
            <li>I think that is what makes it so effective</li>
            <li>so I tasted it on my own nail</li>
            <li>Honestly, I did not think this stuff would work.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say how thrilled we are that we are to this point in kicking this dependent habit.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus it leaves a nice gloss on your nails.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot believe it worked so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told &amp;  it really works great!</li>
            <li>THANKFULLY HE HAS STOPPED ON HIS OWN ACCORD.</li>
            <li>It is effective.</li>
            <li>but is highly effective.</li>
            <li>I even let him paint his own nail...</li>
            <li>I am now working on kicking the habit on my own, it&#x27;s been almost a week of no nail bitting, longest I have gone.</li>
            <li>coat looks shinny and nice.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I don&#x27;t know how the kids from these reviews muscled through the taste of this product all in the name of thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like Antabuse</li>
            <li>we thought that it was kind of-</li>
            <li>But I am thrilled with the results of this.</li>
            <li>He started remembering to stop all on his own.</li>
            <li>His speech therapist AND dentist are thrilled.  </li>
            <li>worked perfect in my 4year old kid!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found what works best for me is to paint them a pretty color with a good quality nail polish (one that won&#x27;t chip easily) and then continue to paint the Mavala on every morning during the week.</li>
            <li>Great product it really works!!!</li>
            <li>Great, he is even excited to put it on now</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li>Another good thing is that his appetite has increased significantly!  </li>
            <li>It works wonders even for older kids, it is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>We are very happy with the results and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is way too good to be true!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the best way to stop a child from sucking his or her finger is to stop them while they are new borns by wearing mittens.  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;d like to find something nice to say about it (okay, it came nicely packaged) but</li>
            <li>But with this product, a nail biter for many years, I was able to get gorgeous and groomed and manicured nails.</li>
            <li>- maybe to effective, powerful, and long-lasting, lol</li>
            <li>I advise you to re-apply after 2-3 days just to keep the taste very strong.</li>
            <li>She is very strong willed and did not want to stop because &amp;#34;it still tastes good&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off very easily, so it will still be there at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>VERY strong stuff.</li>
            <li>This was so very easy to put on my daughter&#x27;s thumb to get her to stop sucking it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s me, but this stuff isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>Be warned it is very strong.</li>
            <li>taste is very strong and it lingers.</li>
            <li>it is very very strong.</li>
            <li>Stop stays very strong.</li>
            <li>She is definately speaking more and much better enunciation!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>You will have healthy nails in no time! :)</li>
            <li>You will have healthy nails in no time! :)</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>must use a fork and knife especially at first, which is better for eating mindfully too!  </li>
            <li>I had heard great things about Mavala STOP from many people and was so excited to try it to get our son to stop sucking his finger.  </li>
            <li>Very good, really taste baaad.</li>
            <li>Maybe the most effective product invented ever.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, this one stood out as the most effective.</li>
            <li>Wow this has to be the best money</li>
            <li>The best part was, despite nearly 20 years of biting, after using this stuff for 2 or 3 weeks, I stopped using it, and I didn&#x27;t start biting again.</li>
            <li>Great product and well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully to get my 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve heard great stories of success from others.  </li>
            <li>We have seen great success.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfectly to get my 2 year old to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>If you are busy doing alot of cleaning (washing clothes, dishes, etc) it will NOT stay on very good!!!</li>
            <li>The problem is that it&#x27;s so effective that I sometimes don&#x27;t reapply it because I know how potent it is.</li>
            <li>Excellent product! , just used twice and my 4 years old stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best thing we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Best product we have used so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 4 yr old son who was bitting his nails and it worked great!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think there was anything that would so effectively and safely discourage thumb-sucking, but this product did.  </li>
            <li>This product is an amazing deterrent and cheap!  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used to help my seven year daughter stop sucking her thumb, which she has done since she was 4 months old.</li>
            <li>All I can say is anything that could stop my thumb-suck-a-holic from even wanting to get her thumbs near her lips, awesome!</li>
            <li>(I made sure to try it on my own nails 1st and to taste it 1st</li>
            <li>working marvelously, my will not put his fingers anywhere near his mouth</li>
            <li>So far best money I ever spend for thumb sucking product.</li>
            <li>We let our child paint it on his own thumbs to have more ownership of his choices about sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best product I have ever used to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly for my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My daughter was able to stop on her own with the help of this product and no one had to nag or push her to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I painted her thumbs and painted my own to be sympathetic.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 3-year old because our dentist said it was best to break her thumb-sucking before turning 4.  </li>
            <li>The problem is sometimes I have literally damaged my hands to the point where a bandaid is more effective and to apply this would be salt on a wound.</li>
            <li>We used this on my orally fixated, thumb sucking 4 year old and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>So far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, this product is great at making a yucky taste on your thumb/fingers, and the yuck lasts for days, even after washing hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay so I purchased this to stop my own nail bitting.</li>
            <li>Great product, worth your $$$&lt;</li>
            <li>So far, So good!!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the reaction of my son to the first time he put his fingers in his mouth after applying Mavala- YUCK!!!</li>
            <li>NAil biting has been a habit on my children, that I want to stop right away, Both of my kids started biting their nails at the age of 2, with my son I ordered the omega cream, which worked great on him....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got 9/10 nails looking great right now</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was and that it works!  </li>
            <li>Of course, this product is not designed to come off easily (the instructions say to apply every TWO DAYS!)</li>
            <li>It was that easy!</li>
            <li>but once you apply it its easily transferable to EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>This stuff works and very quickly!  </li>
            <li>This product is super amazing!</li>
            <li>Quick and effective!</li>
            <li>the taste is strong!</li>
            <li>Really strong!</li>
            <li>Thanks and good luck!</li>
            <li>I originally got this product for my son thinking that it will curb his nail biting habit for good.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and consider it a good price!</li>
            <li>but then the top started to get all sticky and the lid won&#x27;t screw on/off very easily and also the contents in the bottle have started to solidify.</li>
            <li>So if you use it after a bath or are washing your hands all day at work or home, make sure you reapply since it is very easy to get rid of the product on your nails.</li>
            <li>First bottle worked great for me for not biting my fingernails.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first day.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked great at first.  </li>
            <li>It works great the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>It works my daughter nails look great for the first time in 10 years</li>
            <li>great product .. for a kid trying and willing to quit.</li>
            <li>He made one or two comments that he didn&#x27;t want it but ever since the first day he is happy to have it put on his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I talked to him about it at first and explained he would feel proud accomplishing this</li>
            <li>He was upset the first night or two (of course), but he adjusted and is doing great.  </li>
            <li>Even after a full day of washing hands and working out then showering it was still on there good.</li>
            <li>but it was fine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying Mavala Stop very lightly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for stopping any kind of finger to mouth habits, it works great.  </li>
            <li>I looked up the best nail biting solutions that worked the most effectively, and this product instantly came up on top.</li>
            <li>She quickly understood that this did not taste good and no longer has a desire to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li>very quick and effective.</li>
            <li>Strong and effective.</li>
            <li>The first three weren&#x27;t very effective as I&#x27;d just bite through the taste.</li>
            <li>In fact, I envied people who chewed on their nails because their fingers looked light years better than mine did!</li>
            <li>Now I have nice, long, ladylike nails that I love!!!  </li>
            <li>It was amazing to see how quickly this product worked without any frustration or heartache for us and our son!</li>
            <li>i think this is a great product, but as others have said- if your kid is smart or stubborn, they&#x27;ll find a way around it.</li>
            <li>Soooooo glad it worked.</li>
            <li>Great product it really works</li>
            <li>I sure won&#x27;t do that again.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried so many things and when I saw everyone singing the praises of this product I thought, \\&quot;A ha.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Because this is the most horrible&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things to stop and nothing has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>This was my experience, maybe you will have better luck with this product but keep in mind if your child has</li>
            <li>I do use it more often.</li>
            <li>also bought a book called \\&quot;Thumbuddy to Love - Ballerina Sue\\&quot; here on Amazon as well</li>
            <li>product[[ASIN:0615273645 Thumbuddy to Love</li>
            <li>So I put one more coat on, and she never did it again.  </li>
            <li>3 weeks she was done :-)  </li>
            <li>To the best of my knowledge I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my entire life.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it lingers like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li>I doubt that your desire to chew your nails will overcome the thought of another dose of this touching your lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we could put some more on.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about this awesome product.</li>
            <li>No child has been able to withstand</li>
            <li>I found it and saw how cheap it was!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is proud of this as much as we are</li>
            <li>just having it on made me stop for the most part</li>
            <li>I have been a chronic nail biter for most of my life.</li>
            <li>His fingers look so much better</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how great this produce is!</li>
            <li>I think for our son he just needed to break the habit for 1-2 days, he has never looked back and is so proud of himself!</li>
            <li>BECAUSE I DID MORE RESEARCH</li>
            <li>(We had to try it too :-) )</li>
            <li>After trying many things, I bought a kit at [...]  </li>
            <li>I have been reapplying every 2 days just to make sure there is no relapse.</li>
            <li>(Mostly it was at night just out of habit)  </li>
            <li>This went on for about 2 more weeks until she broke the habit of putting it in her mouth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well for those that bite their nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>THEREFORE, I MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better to have a restless night sleep during the summer than on a school night.  </li>
            <li>I continued to re-apply for 2 weeks just to be sure my child knew the taste was still there.</li>
            <li>But it is so potent</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad we gave it a try - it does not work for everyone -</li>
            <li>The product indicates that children under 3 can&#x27;t use this (or won&#x27;t be able to taste the undesirable taste)...</li>
            <li>Helped my daughter stop her thumb sucking habit better than the retainer that was put in her mouth by the orthodontist.</li>
            <li>It is the PERFECT amount of discouragement, especially for those of us who bite unconsciously.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Sure, it was cute when her thumb was in her mouth</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail chewer for most of my life and haven&#x27;t bitten them since using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that this will speed up the end of her finger sucking.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re doing such a great job with not sucking your thumb!</li>
            <li>stuff is grand</li>
            <li>P.S. make sure your baby does not associate it with a punishment or threat.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>We all really love this product, my husband even started using it on his nails.</li>
            <li>Your child needs to be able to TASTE this for it to work.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d be able to fall asleep without it.</li>
            <li>and he is finger sucking free!</li>
            <li>I applied it to the kids favorite fingers as soon as the Mavala Stop came in the mail.</li>
            <li>I love this and have already got two more friends using it too.</li>
            <li>We did another light application after that and again, he did not bite them!  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t altogether work for us like it did for so many of the reviews that I read before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Although the smell and taste is horrendous, it is non-toxic and safe for consumption.</li>
            <li>We are so proud of her because she did this as much as the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the interesting part.</li>
            <li>I am sure the manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t indorse this.</li>
            <li>totally.aim the happiest mom, feeling proud to have found this product that works for real.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for a battle to just get the Mavala on her thumbnails because she&#x27;d say, \\&quot;I love to suck my thumb.\\&quot;  However, she accepted it, and almost immediately stopped.  </li>
            <li>We are so pleased with the results and are kicking ourselves because we didn&#x27;t try this sooner.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure your nails stay</li>
            <li>Love this product:)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>:) If you&#x27;re like me though, and habitually just touch your face a lot and eat many foods with your hands.. you may be making a lot of bitter-mouthed faces during meal times.</li>
            <li>just pay attention to what you eat :)</li>
            <li>This was such an awesome find and</li>
            <li>I would have never guessed I would be able to break the habit of biting my nails.  </li>
            <li>He kept saying I have so many parents say it works.</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t stand the taste of it and it has curbed his biting for sure.  </li>
            <li>(if i wanted),then applied Mavala Stop as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and would have paid more for this product.</li>
            <li>I try many things with my child to stop sucking her thumb but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>the act of auto-cannibalism, which I am sure is surely a sin in most of the world.</li>
            <li>; but mommy doesn&#x27;t know how to take it off :).</li>
            <li>I caught her with her thumb one more time after that and painted it once more.</li>
            <li>I even took to painting it on more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I know I will have to use this product probably for the rest of my life, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>I put the product on his finger morning and nigt for the next 3 days and he did GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>and I was able to reduce my use</li>
            <li>We were all confident (my son included)</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>For me, the nailbiter, I do need a bit more assistance with the Mavala Stop, which I will continue using.</li>
            <li>As for my boogie snacker, he still needs it as he&#x27;s been able to manuever around the Mavala Stop a bit.</li>
            <li>my 5-year-old sucked her finger mostly at night -</li>
            <li>We tried several off the shelf products as well as devices but this worked the best.  </li>
            <li>My son did try to bite (more than my daughter) - and would then go get a drink to wash the taste out.</li>
            <li>realized, in the end, that it ended up being more of a \\&quot;realization\\&quot; for my son rather than the taste when he put his nails in his mouth.</li>
            <li>But fractured his knee and became more depended at six.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but after 3 days of putting it on his thumbnail.</li>
            <li>And my friend has lovely teeth.  </li>
            <li>anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala for making such a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be able to stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop.</li>
            <li>, I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...</li>
            <li>Defiinitely recommend this product for nailbiters of all ages :)</li>
            <li>Maybe if she is 5 and still sucking her thumb :)</li>
            <li>They sure don&#x27;t like the taste of it.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product, it really helped my brother stop biting his nails which was a great accomplishment!</li>
            <li>and I figured I better try it on myself before I give it to her to see what I should expect,</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that this will work and will gladly post an update in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems my child must love the taste as he will ask me to put it on his thumb.  </li>
            <li>so I was confident that it would work for us.  </li>
            <li>I re-applied a couple more times to be sure,</li>
            <li>She did so mostly when she was trying to relax, ie.</li>
            <li>it will stop him then 8).</li>
            <li>Mavala works like a magic.</li>
            <li>Okay the day that i got it</li>
            <li>(She knows better than to do so at school).  </li>
            <li>how many times your hands touch your mouth, or touch something that goes in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve told mine that the polish is there to help make their nails all better and they love getting their \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; to make their nails shiny.</li>
            <li>We had considered having a retainer-like instrument put in her mouth that blocks the thumb from fitting in, though my dentist even described it as \\&quot;cruel\\&quot; and \\&quot;a</li>
            <li>Needing to remember to apply nightly is challenging.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  </li>
            <li>My son (8) chews his cuticles and it has stopped him from ruining his skin.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t be pleased.</li>
            <li>stop on top it.</li>
            <li>Its been more then 2 weeks and looks like she gave up on sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li>One day she said, ok, put it on.  </li>
            <li>(just turned 5)because her speach was starting to be affected and her teeth were becoming bucked!!!!</li>
            <li>I am amazed that more people don&#x27;t know about this.</li>
            <li>She knew she wasn&#x27;t supposed to suck her fingers and was ok with us putting this on her fingers</li>
            <li>I am sure this product would work for some people just not for me or my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the stuff in the drugstores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>the taste bc its so potent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, we decided that we needed something more potent - the thumb guard.  </li>
            <li>or so before you upgrade to a more costly option like the thumb guard.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many things to stop my daughter from sucking her thumb</li>
            <li>but they cost a lot more and seem quite cumbersome.</li>
            <li>do think the polish helped prevent him from most of the daytime thumbsucking, and for that I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many times to stop.  </li>
            <li>I also have plenty more in the bottle jusssst in case</li>
            <li>but this is the only that worked the best</li>
            <li>That made him more cooperative.</li>
            <li>Thus, I can say with some certainty that it ought to stop most grownups from EATING anything at all that requires using your fingers to assemble or eat it</li>
            <li>#34;for sure my kiddo won&#x27;t suck her thumb when this stuff is painted on.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>how many times you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than THUM.  </li>
            <li>Second time using the product, and it&#x27;s great!!!!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product, but gave it a try</li>
            <li>...You do need to be sure to reapply the product every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>sure she&#x27;s done..  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and then the Mavala just to make sure she wasn&#x27;t biting her nails.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize I had!  :)</li>
            <li>and Mavala worked like magic.</li>
            <li>I have tried many product named like \\&quot;Doctor Thumb\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This worked incredibly well for our almost-four year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>But after 2 or 3 applications I guess she must have grown used to the taste, because it sure doesn&#x27;t stop her now.  </li>
            <li>Not 100% sure if it was this product but the 1st day she used it she puked.</li>
            <li>It has only been a month and her nails are BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li>I just reapplied every 2-3 days to make sure it didn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li>My daughters have been able to eat off everything we&#x27;ve purchased before this.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s way more putrid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that using this over a period of time will help break that habit.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for more than 15 years</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you put it on and touch it up.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you put it on and touch it up.</li>
            <li>This product works better than anything.</li>
            <li>Works great if you are really trying to stop biting your nails.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to have to do that twice at $300 a pop, so I ordered Malava stop, couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product</li>
            <li>Let me tell you it was like magic.  </li>
            <li>It more serves as a reminder.  </li>
            <li>* Being vegetarian, I had to email the company to make sure that it is a vegetarian formula, given all the flavor reviews made me doubt it,  but it is safe for vegetarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At night, to pass time until she fell asleep, she figured out she could watch the clock to get her mind off of not being able to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I made sure we applied this to her nail every 2 days, just to be sure it was on there.  </li>
            <li>However she discovered that if she kept drinking water it would be better.</li>
            <li>Buy with confidence. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this product after buying or trying many products/tricks to stop may son from biting his nail.</li>
            <li>as many nail-biters do, consider visiting your doctor, a therapist, even a psychologist.</li>
            <li>and many chronic nail biters</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mavala Stop has definitely been the best product I&#x27;ve found for deterring my nail biting.</li>
            <li>and many chronic nail biters</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mavala Stop has definitely been the best product I&#x27;ve found for deterring my nail biting.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>There is one more thing I should tell you, though.</li>
            <li>in all, a winning product after I thought nothing would work.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the thumb that I&#x27;ve been sucking for the last 2 years and have grown to love as a best friend!\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I was glad that she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb again.</li>
            <li>and it linguers, but not a cruel taste.</li>
            <li>I kept telling her to keep her fingers out, and she would be OK.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many more times it would have happened</li>
            <li>when my daughter broke her thumb-sucking arm seven months ago, we thought surely having to wear a cast for four weeks would effortlessly break the habit for us.  </li>
            <li>and I got scared, but thought of applying it one more time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to apply it more than 5 times.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re much better off with this stuff to help you stop chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ool/places where you tend to bite your nails the most.</li>
            <li>I have tried it for 4 nights and applied more each night, but it did not help.  </li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my hands :)</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to apply it every couple of days though because it will come off and biting could start again.  </li>
            <li>we all love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s taste, and is now more focused on not sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect such great result!</li>
            <li>a couple of weeks with the product I was able to stop using it, and haven&#x27;t bitten my nails for 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I still put in on her fingers once week night to be  on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll love it : )</li>
            <li>I pay more attention to when i am biting my nails now.</li>
            <li>I catch myself more and more.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t want to suck my thumb any more.</li>
            <li>It will work, but like quitting anything, you must make an effort because even the most stubborn nail biter could work through a coat of fermented death.</li>
            <li>This works immediately and I can tell when it&#x27;s time to put more Mavala on because my daughter starts sucking her thumb again.</li>
            <li>I tried thum and it did not work, mostly because it comes off.</li>
            <li>also, I have to brush my teeth more often because if I do stick my fingers in my mouth</li>
            <li>sons nails grew back, and in 2-3 weeks his nails looked perfectly healthy...and required clipping!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I got creative and put the Glad Press n Seal</li>
            <li>No terrible taste, nothing.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>All of a sudden he was like, &amp;#34;THAT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE DORITO!!!&amp;#34; And proceeded to rinse his mouth out in the sink) LOL!!!!  </li>
            <li>We give it 2 thumbs up :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love mavala.</li>
            <li>If I have more kids I won&#x27;t ever hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li>Read all the great reviews and compared to the price of some finger contraption that cost $70, there wasn&#x27;t much options for finger sucking.  </li>
            <li>My daughter sucked her thumb for six years and was able to stop all together in four weeks.  </li>
            <li>I then came up with a trick that helped much more</li>
            <li>think this stuff works for the most part</li>
            <li>it applied, your nails are safe.</li>
            <li>I tried removing the product and reapplying to make sure I was getting JUST the nail and not any of the skin around the nail.  </li>
            <li>I probably didn&#x27;t need to buy two bottles, but I&#x27;m painting it on his thumbs every day and night until I know for sure</li>
            <li>I love my mother, but she had instilled within me with something of a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic non-toxic deterrent for nail biting, this is the stuff!</li>
            <li>I ENJOY IT!</li>
            <li>So the deeper or more</li>
            <li>So the deeper or more</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>At dinner there was an added bonus of him not eating anything with his fingers (something we&#x27;re always getting on him for! :)).  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>for a couple days after application to be safe.</li>
            <li>Maybe for most cases this works well, but still searching for a way to break my son&#x27;s habit.</li>
            <li>I know it was more out of habit as a way for her to comfort herself before falling asleep, but I started to notice a visible change in her front teeth as a result.</li>
            <li>it was pricey that did not work, she was able to pull it off.  </li>
            <li>but then she stopped worrying about the taste and started sucking her fingers more.</li>
            <li>and so started doing it more.</li>
            <li>have applied it 2 more times after that day and it has had no effect, his thumb sucking continues as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top paper lid/cover had been opened and a crumpled piece of paper was stuffed inside on top of the bottle as if to protect the bottle during shipping, that is after having three layers in the packaging alredy</li>
            <li>Chronic nail biter, I have tried many things.</li>
            <li>Great product... Works very well for nail biting and thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>But as for nail biting and thumb/finger sucking, I&#x27;m sure it would work quite well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m love this product and will recommend it for anyone that has had problems with breaking the habit of sucking of the thumb/finger or nail biting.  </li>
            <li>I reapplied and reapplied, but it no longer deters him for more than a day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because he can paint it on while he sleeps</li>
            <li>Things have gotten better though.</li>
            <li>We were getting more and more concerned as her permanent teeth started coming in.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another just to make sure I have one for my handbag</li>
            <li>Better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It was your favorite restaurant and you ate there all the time.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 8 and she is been biting her nails for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better than Bite It.</li>
            <li>then would bite the cuticles - so I made sure and put this polish on the nails and cuticle</li>
            <li>I painted it on my son’s thumb and it lasted for about 5 days before HE asked me to put more on.</li>
            <li>will continue to use the product until I finish the bottle just to be on the safe side of no relapses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I figured all I had to do was keep my fingers out of my mouth, but the problem is there are so many situations where putting your fingers in your mouth is unavoidable.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for better results by now.</li>
            <li>As a guy it makes my nails look all shiny, but even still it&#x27;s better than the alternative.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Another week or two, and we&#x27;ll be sure this habit is over with.</li>
            <li>We use silverware and toothpicks a lot more now , it helps :)</li>
            <li>Thanks, cannot express how great</li>
            <li>This stuff is hilarious.</li>
            <li>The faces he made when he absently put his fingers in his mouth was hilarious (for me, anyways).</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how well this product worked for us.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but my pediatrician said it was okay.  </li>
            <li>I think it would work on most kids,</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re using this on your kids to stop them from nail biting, they won&#x27;t be able to remove the product to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I applied one more dose.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>He gagged a bit I washed his finger and put more on</li>
            <li>BUT, I used it for about 2 more days and then quit thinking I was done.  </li>
            <li>(One too many bugs this year)</li>
            <li>Great product and really fast shipping..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t have to find</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to return this...</li>
            <li>I tried many things.</li>
            <li>This product works great and fast.</li>
            <li>and we are so glad we did.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied with results and purchase.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my nails to avoid chewing skin on sides and it ruined the taste for many minutes and reminded me not to do it.&lt;br /&gt;One of the tricks we used was that my wife will start putting nail polish in front of him and out of curiosity he will also want some on his nails</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>he kept squirting more and more in the water and playing with the bath soap, mark you I taste it</li>
            <li>My 9 and 7-year-old daughters had this thumb-sucking habit for so many years.  </li>
            <li>It is still amazing to me to look in the car&#x27;s rear-view mirror and see them free of thumb-sucking!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put any more on my cuticles just because it was too much, but it was a great shock factor to teach me not to do it any more.</li>
            <li>Be creative and give this product a try, you won&#x27;t disappointed!teach</li>
            <li>me not to do it any more.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It sure helped me avoid chewing my nails though.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this product in hopes of stopping and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>it was us that was applying the \\&quot;magic</li>
            <li>We told him the tooth fairy must have sprinkled magic dust on his thumbs to help him stop sucking his thumbs...</li>
            <li>but it sure did make a believer out of me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month since I bought it and for the most part I have stopped.  </li>
            <li>Eventually, I was able to stop painting them and not have the urge to bite them.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I chose the bit on the tip of the nail as the better choice.  </li>
            <li>She was actually HAPPY about it too, because by the time I got up the nerve to put the stuff on her, she was really hurting and looking for a better solution to help her quit than lansinoh and bandaids and socks, you name</li>
            <li>I have been a nail biter most of my life</li>
            <li>I have been a nail-biting for many years</li>
            <li>When I run out I&#x27;m and buying more.</li>
            <li>she understood it was for her to stop sucking her thumb and called it medicine :)</li>
            <li>This is probably not a problem for most people</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that my dentist recommended this.</li>
            <li>so i am sure if it doesn&#x27;t work for you on day 1,</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s still free of her thumb sucking habit!</li>
            <li>to be absolutely sure-</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure, BUT</li>
            <li>As for nail bitting she will often break one but as Im on top of it she will tell me</li>
            <li>I think better is trying to encourage your child out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I never thought I was going to be able to stop him from his thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bite my nails, and the skin/cuticle area around my nails, so I ended up having to basically paint the top parts of my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After some more searching on the web I came across Mavala Stop and read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>He was sucking his fingers when laying on the couch watching a movie, so I put more on.  </li>
            <li>I believe that after another year of applying this, she will be able to stop.  </li>
            <li>Did not make her stop but trying it one more week</li>
            <li>So glad we tried again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 100% sure this will help you stop biting your nails or sucking your thumb or putting your fingers in your mouth while you eat or whatever it is</li>
            <li>Keeps me from doing it even more.</li>
            <li>daughter now asks for the medicine for her boo-boo on her thumb, but avoids tasting her thumb even if there happens to be chocolate on it :-)</li>
            <li>We are extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I put it over my nail polish (it didn&#x27;t affect the look at all) and then a top coat.</li>
            <li>After using this product for just one week, I have stopped biting and my daughter has mostly stopped (without putting on the solution).</li>
            <li>sucking appliance&amp;#34; in the top of her mouth (to the tune of $300).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say he has stop the thumb sucking,</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD I did</li>
            <li>I put it on her favorite thumb....</li>
            <li>awesome product my daughters nails are finally growing out</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this when I did.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product my two toddlers ages 2 and 3 have been sucking their thumbs since birth NOTHING has worked until i found this product.</li>
            <li>I applied a smudge on the top of my thumb on Tuesday.  </li>
            <li>She tried sucking her thumb about two more times that day.  </li>
            <li>One day after she turned 3 it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>For the most part it works, but I need to put it on every day.  </li>
            <li>and I just kept going until I got into this interesting habit of improving my looks.</li>
            <li>I have figured that its better to eat fries with a fork any way.</li>
            <li>So be it, just more reason to quit.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best product on the market for this purpose.</li>
            <li>Love it when I am consistence on applying.</li>
            <li>does it ever end?  :-)</li>
            <li>Three stars: because it worked with one application for my son, but gagged him and induced vomiting from the taste even though he wasn&#x27;t chewing his nails, just touching his mouth to get a piece of hair.</li>
            <li>I tried many others that did not stop my daughter from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>ok.... Parents-</li>
            <li>I successfully quit nursing without much effort and pain for both of us!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>After many pediatricians told us that my almost 6 yo daughter would \\&quot;grow</li>
            <li>I tried it again twice more.</li>
            <li>I used this product some time last year and it has worked marvelously well.</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>My fingers don&#x27;t hurt, I can finally scratch an itch, and best of all I can see a resemblance to what fingernails should look like.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been biting my nails for 30 years.</li>
            <li>If it were spicy for example the result would have been more immediate.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m off to research more products.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>taste for our child was not horrible just annoyong and letting her apply it empowered her to be able to stop sucking her thumb by herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I refresh it every two days while she is sleeping just to make sure she won&#x27;t start again.</li>
            <li>I found an article about Thum and foud that many people said it didn&#x27;t work and that their children started to like the taste</li>
            <li>and I thought then it couldn&#x27;t be any better than the tobasco sauce</li>
            <li>This product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I even used it on myself and was able to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>Interestingly I didn&#x27;t see reviews that questioning the safety of this</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I hope you have a better experience, did not work for us at all</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;ll have to resort to something more before she causes permanent damage.</li>
            <li>once she realized she didn&#x27;t need her thumb any more.  </li>
            <li>Important!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it wasn&#x27;t challenging for her, but now she doesn&#x27;t even think about it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I was worried before I tried it because she used her thumb so much for comfort, but she did great, and your kid will too.  </li>
            <li>This is way better than the drug store version.  </li>
            <li>and my nails already look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li>I put on again each morning just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I still put it on every once in a while to make sure he doesn&#x27;t suck his finder anymore.</li>
            <li>Withing two more weeks, she stopped sucking at night as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought.</li>
            <li>and he said for most kids it either works immediately, like it did with my son, or it won&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>I am glad we gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that there would be a better product out there to help someone stop sucking their thumb or biting fingernails.  </li>
            <li>But I put some more on her thumb and now once again she is not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>But I put some more on her thumb and now once again she is not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>and then we had to put more on.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>The biggest drawback is that it&#x27;s so potent, if you find yourself accidentally touching your lips to it you will taste it for hours.  </li>
            <li>One thing is for sure though, it does the trick.</li>
            <li>One more time</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d be glad to have to trim someone elses nails.  </li>
            <li>Did that, he ask if he could have some more.</li>
            <li>and my daughter  does not suck her fingers more.</li>
            <li>if I told him I was going to put this product on it would have been a fight, but doing it while he was asleep (made sure I monitored him for 2 min after I put it on</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and after being used on two children the bottle is still completely filled.</li>
            <li>no biting :)</li>
            <li>lol great product for nail bitter like meeee</li>
            <li>However, my daughter does not bite her nails when she wears it, and she likes to wear it because it&#x27;s shiny :)</li>
            <li>By the way, it does not matter who many times u wash your hands to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>but it surely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m OK with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this polish..</li>
            <li>She asked me to buy some more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even been tempted to use any more of the product...</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference within a week of using Mavala and I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>more potent.&lt;br /&gt;Also&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend, might help with dieting too!:-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure it would be best to break your kid of the habit before they ruin dinner at a later age....</li>
            <li>and i lost most of the polish.  </li>
            <li>and she was OK.</li>
            <li>We love this product since it does the job its supposetoo</li>
            <li>if you are using this for a toddler, make sure you have a bib or towl close by, my daughter is drooling all over the place.  </li>
            <li>We stopped using it and decided to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it myself and it sure would keep me from biting/sucking.  </li>
            <li>well mostly.</li>
            <li>(pay it forward concept:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a taste that stays in your mouth for an hour most, to remind your brain chewing your nails</li>
            <li>; Let&#x27;s just say she doesn&#x27;t do that any more.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for this I would love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that this product has worked for so many children and adults, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with it.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t do it more than a couple of times if you put this on your fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope once my nails grow out the taste will eventually go away because I can&#x27;t take much more of this.</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop is just ok.</li>
            <li>But you need to reapply it more often</li>
            <li>It helps me be more polite all around.</li>
            <li>As many others have said, it DOES make finger food taste terrrible.</li>
            <li>It is designed more of a REMINDER for those kids who know they shouldn&#x27;t be sucking.</li>
            <li>However, we still applied more to ensure there wasn&#x27;t a relapse.</li>
            <li>My daughter just won&#x27;t stop picking her nose, and I&#x27;ve tried so many incentives and threats.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m glad we got it done as soon as we did.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to apply Mavala every 1-2 days to for a while to make sure they don&#x27;t start again.</li>
            <li>The product leaves more of an after taste.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Thum stuff at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>You sure won&#x27;t wanna taste it ever again.</li>
            <li>A sure recommend from a pediatrician</li>
            <li>But you must apply every 2 days to make sure it hasn&#x27;t chipped off.</li>
            <li>BUT it works like magic and now he doesn&#x27;t wear it anymore</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Our son is doing a lot better with biting his fingers and they are healing.</li>
            <li>He even asks us now to paint his nail because he likes how healthy his hands are looking.</li>
            <li>So it helped with table manners too :)</li>
            <li>She stopped in 3 days.:-)</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work much better.  </li>
            <li>BUT when the dentist said that he needed to break the habit and stop sucking his thumb, because of interference with his top jaw and teeth growth..</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I read about this on Amazon and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I did a coat of Mavala stop on top of that.</li>
            <li>Touching my mustache and swimming would result in foul-tasting water leaking into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use it anymore as she doesn&#x27;t even remember to suck :)</li>
            <li>Ok so it started well</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t they just love me the way I am?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>You can always add more...</li>
            <li>Not awful as some say.</li>
            <li>She won&#x27;t even lick food off of her fingers. :)</li>
            <li>You have to make sure that you keep applying it every day or so till you kick the habit.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I decided to use a treatment so she will feel better.</li>
            <li>but she was totally OK and get used not to suck it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>We call it his thumb medicine and he always tells us how his thumb is &#x27;getting better&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Our daughter had sucked her thumb (mostly at night/with lovey) for over 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I apply it every day just to be sure it works.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep putting it on.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for a while just to be sure, but he has not had any problems even though I have accidentally gone three nights in between applications 2 or 3 times.  </li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb any more.</li>
            <li>(I am now 4 months free of nail biting!)</li>
            <li>so okay</li>
            <li>Her fingers and nails look 100% better now.  </li>
            <li>after reading review and at our child&#x27;s dentists recommendation I&#x27;m so glad we tried it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wear it for one more week just to be sure, but I haven&#x27;t even tried to bite my nails in days.</li>
            <li>if thumbsucking is an issue for you, make sure you get this</li>
            <li>I even tasted her nail to be sure it was still there.</li>
            <li>I would theorize that the sooner you use it, the better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it is working wonderfully for our dog whose paw is currently bandaged for two weeks while his surgery heals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to stop many times, but I&#x27;m the type that bites them when I&#x27;m sitting idle (at a movie, watching tv, etc).</li>
            <li>He was so proud of himself, thanks to his dentist and Mavala, he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about being embarrassed in front of his friends.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t be)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several of these products and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>The best surprise with this product is that it actually strengthens the nails!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you re-apply a coat or two every three days.</li>
            <li>I will update after his nails have grown more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>She mostly did it at stressful or sleepy times.  </li>
            <li>If I put it on my child&#x27;s fingers to condition him to keep his fingers out of his mouth, I make sure to wash his hands thoroughly before he eats anything because he will taste it on his fingers and stop eating.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been biting my nails for the better part of 25+ years.</li>
            <li>, I was biting my nails non-stop to the point of pain most of the time.  </li>
            <li>They started growing and look healthy again.  </li>
            <li>No side effects and completely safe.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>He also twirls his hair simultaneously and was developing a bald spot on the top of his head.  </li>
            <li>Hubby is none too pleased with me at the moment.</li>
            <li>I needed something safe and harmless but did the job</li>
            <li>Anyway, he has stopped and if we have the problem again, I will purchase more.</li>
            <li>Astonishingly, she stopped sucking her thumb immediatly.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for about 15 years now and have never been able to stop.  </li>
            <li>You had to reapply more than was recommended.</li>
            <li>but I stopped using it on her because she eats many finger foods and although she continued to bite her nails</li>
            <li>I saw that he was able to afford and suck his thumb from now and</li>
            <li>she was more cranky because she wasn&#x27;t able to self soothe</li>
            <li>It may be better for adults or order children.  </li>
            <li>She was actually glad that her tongue &amp;#34;felt spicy&amp;#34; whenever she put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li>Her nails look much, much better than 2 years ago:-)))</li>
            <li>worked perfectly -- just a tiny dab and in a week or so, she stopped.</li>
            <li>I felt like this product worked for the most part, although it seemed to lose most of it&#x27;s strength after a couple of hand washings.  </li>
            <li>nails have never looked better and I even go in for a manicure now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s changed my life for the better</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you bought</li>
            <li>itYou&#x27;ll be glad you bought it</li>
            <li>Acoording to some reviews i put 2 layers of mavala on her thumb ( and all nails), then she asked for one more layer.</li>
            <li>i researched many products online before making a decision.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After you put this on your nails, you will slip up at most one or two times before you will begin to think twice about biting your nails.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ok with this, go for it.  </li>
            <li>so you will end up having to put more on or hope you dont</li>
            <li>but sure makes me think again about biting.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to start off by saying that I had many talks with my daughter about stopping sucking her thumb before I tried Mavala.</li>
            <li>I used this as the top coat and didn&#x27;t mention a thing about it to her.</li>
            <li>it became more of a &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>We are now about 4 weeks from when we started and we still apply every morning just to be safe another habit doesn&#x27;t start.  </li>
            <li>it worked ok.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So I guess you can say that it workedlike a magic.  </li>
            <li>but it was OK.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it works for someone just not us.</li>
            <li>Thank you my son stopped sucking his fingers overnight :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I applied a coat to all of my nails once every two days for two weeks and still have most of the bottle remaining.</li>
            <li>so u can be sure that you will notice if your nail go to your mouth</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Ordering and shipping were fast and great.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that played into it</li>
            <li>, i.e. she likes spicy food, and more grown up flavors that most kids do not like.  </li>
            <li>The reviews weren&#x27;t TOO helpful because most of them were about kids sucking their thumb</li>
            <li>recommend applying it once a day, you can use it as a top coat, but its not as shiny as a top coat...</li>
            <li>He learned real quick not to put his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li>I would just say that you have to make sure to paint every 2 days.  </li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s safe to say this product works</li>
            <li>I use it on top of nailpolish and it doesn&#x27;t affect my manicure.</li>
            <li>I was always able to stop by myself by just getting my nails done and painting them.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to break the habit soon and not need it anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I looked over the many reviews and ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is disguising for sure.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I are very excited :)</li>
            <li>what do I do with a nearly full bottle of Mavala Stop that I don&#x27;t need any more?!  :-)</li>
            <li>Three weeks later I have beautiful nails that are getting better every day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure at some point, I&#x27;ll have to re-use it again, but it worked quick, and easy, and my daughter loved having me paint her nails with it.</li>
            <li>It was also a little exasperating to see my beautiful daughter at her ballet class doing lovely dance moves with great posture, pointed toes</li>
            <li>This Stuff REALLY works!!!!  </li>
            <li>so I ended up putting a spill proof cup of water by his bed AND 4 tic tac&#x27;s which REALLY helped!!!!</li>
            <li>This really works!!!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it, this stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li>I put some on my friends&#x27; daughters&#x27; thumb &amp; she quit after the first application as well!!!</li>
            <li>it really does!!!!</li>
            <li>I tried everything for my toddler and STOP did exactly what it says STOP!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product for my 5 year-old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Read all the reviews and was very excited.  </li>
            <li>and she was very excited.</li>
            <li>and we were very excited about it.</li>
            <li>He liked that and was actually excited about using it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Highly effective, and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It has almost been a month now, and I love to see her so excited about not sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li>and it was worth every cent!! :)</li>
            <li>I suppose if you think the vomiting is a good enough deterrent for the child it would be a successful product for you to use.</li>
            <li>The main problem I have experienced is that I work in a job where I have to wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li>My youngest will have this on her fingers too when she is older, so she can happily suck her fingers now.</li>
            <li>but I am an Indian, so there is a lot of bread or rice that we eat with our bare hands, so if this thing accidentally touches your food, well you can say good bye to good taste.</li>
            <li>but the fact that it was consistent for a good period is what helped the most.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, it&#x27;s really great when you take a chance on something like this</li>
            <li>I came across Mavala and saw the great reviews and high star rating.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with it and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>This worked great to help my 6 yr old stop sucking his thumb!!</li>
            <li>Worked great for my 8 yr old son!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy we were able to tackle this habit while he is young!  </li>
            <li>So, it may be a great product for successful results with other customers, but Mavala Stop is not for us.</li>
            <li>They pretty much laughed at me.  </li>
            <li>Parents must be persistent in using it, consistent in reapplying it, and  don&#x27;t give up even if they cry because you are doing a good thing.</li>
            <li>I bought it again because it did great achievements with my 3y daughter regarding her the thumb sucking habit, BUT  we had a kind of relapse which is my fault that didn&#x27;t use it regularly, SO here we are again with more commandment.</li>
            <li>It is a bit heartbreaking to watch him struggle, but I think in the long run it is for the best.  </li>
            <li>She loved it on first day because it looked like nail polish and made her nail shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have used it now for well over 8 months and WHEN it is on her thumb it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea to try it during the day first.</li>
            <li>so it must be pretty good, it just did not work for us</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful clear coat ...</li>
            <li>It really works and effective!</li>
            <li>It also worked awesome for our friend who&#x27;s been a LONG time nail biter.  </li>
            <li>I was becoming more and more concerned as he was becoming more and more comfortable sucking his fingers at home and even in the presence of some friends, but not at school.  </li>
            <li>We have been thumb sucking free for two months and going strong!  </li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is strong, in a good way!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>so excited!</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m very pleased with this polish.</li>
            <li>Great product, did a better job than a braking habit braces which cost us $500 placed by the dentist on our 4 years old kid to stop thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li>After all of the great reviews I thought for sure this would help my 9 year old son stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li>It also seems to wash off much more easily than I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>It was amazingly how quickly my brain connected nail biting to unpleasantness.</li>
            <li>And for adults, slather it on every 2 days with someone else to watch you, since it would be easy to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to put it on without a support system to make sure you follow through.</li>
            <li>And for adults, slather it on every 2 days with someone else to watch you, since it would be easy to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to put it on without a support system to make sure you follow through.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li>be SURE the mavala stop is out of reach of even the most crafty toddler.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is very proud of herself since her thumb is no longer constantly wet, and she feels that her \\&quot;boo boo thumb\\&quot; is getting better</li>
            <li>We were amazed by all the products available and probably more so by the price tags on many of these products.</li>
            <li>I love this product, we just started it yesterday with my 4 year old and she is doing great</li>
            <li>I was very surprised and happy to see her take her fingers out, spit, and yell &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; after she put her fingers in her mouth with the Mavala Stop on them.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly in great packaging, bought it for my mom who ha been bitting here nails for over 20 years and in 2 weeks she had completely stopped!</li>
            <li>but it honestly worked from the very first minute we put it on.  </li>
            <li>Great for my adult chewers!  </li>
            <li>for a couple weeks I had my husband do most of the chopping and that worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is wonderful and well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I have been biting my fingernails for over 20 years and this is honestly the first product that has worked for me!</li>
            <li>Star rating is more accurate.  </li>
            <li>The first time it was applied we had great success.  </li>
            <li>And to top it all off, it is light on the pocket.  </li>
            <li>and we are thumb free and don&#x27;t even twirl her hair any more.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old son was not to happy</li>
            <li>Worked great for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>We are three weeks free of finger sucking and she is suprisingly much more vocal with her needs.</li>
            <li>stuff worked GREAT on my just-turned 4 year old boy who was biting his nails.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old stop sucking her thumb in 2 weeks and is now proud of herself.</li>
            <li>She is a happy young girl who does not suck her thumb</li>
            <li>This worked great on my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of frustration about dissuading our 3.5 yrs old from thumb sucking, we are so happy to found this product.</li>
            <li>It saved my sanity, but more importantly, it saved my daughter&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li>I have not grown to enjoy the flavor nor have I been able to ignore</li>
            <li>This product had great reviews, so I tried it for my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li>the immediate elimination of it resulted in him acting out in uncharacteristic ways - queue Bruce Banner&#x27;s change into the Incredible Hulk.  </li>
            <li>I have to say these are the best $10 I ever spent.</li>
            <li>, my nails are the longest they&#x27;ve EVER been, and I&#x27;m thoroughly happy even if the taste of this stuff is completely rancid.</li>

            <li>Works great for my three year old</li>
            <li>So far this is working great to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>He bought the whole thing and was proud of his body helping him and was proud to have stopped sucking his thumb &amp;#34;all by himself.&amp;#34; Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>At 3.5 years old, I was done with this habit although I knew it brought her great comfort</li>
            <li>Would work great for adult nail-biters, too.</li>
            <li>Worked great for my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>She was becoming mal-nutraioned because of her thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>This worked great for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>Product worked great for stopping my 2 year old from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I am now giving my bottle of Mavala to my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s best friend, who also wants to quit thumbsucking!  </li>
            <li>So far, the most successful method we&#x27;ve used to defeat thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>Works great so far...</li>
            <li>This was the best $12 we ever spent.</li>
            <li>This worked great for my 6 year old daughter...</li>
            <li>Working great so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report I have been free of nail biting for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, the stuff seems to be working great.  </li>
            <li>Best 12 bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the people who did not have a good experience were perhaps doing it before their children were ready.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful, but this product got good reviews</li>
            <li>The stuff taste absolutely horrid, and stays in your mouth for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Telling her how much she&#x27;s growing....and that one day a her thumb is not going to taste good anymore....</li>
            <li>I took matters in to my own hands, went out the garden and picked a chilli and painted his nail with fresh chilli juice.</li>
            <li>- effective, powerful, and long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>he bit right through it and liked it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy for this product as it helped to quickly and easily stop a 1-2 year old from sucking thumb at night (which is the hardest!!!)  </li>
            <li>Very effective because as soon as that taste hits you realize you put your hands near your mouth.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this one!</li>
            <li>I still have a bunch left, so this is a good deal!</li>
            <li>Other then that WORKS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>Its made with Cayenne pepper and actually tastes good!</li>
            <li>, so just wanted to keep this updated and let you all know it has been a full week with NO THUMB SUCKING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been successful for us so far!</li>
            <li>people with a nail biting problem, I find it best to first paint my nails with Mavala and then with a regular nail polish over top.</li>
            <li>the bottle is still full!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried one or two other thumb sucking deterrents but this is the best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure she was not giving her thumbs up for anything but needed that comfort of thumb sucking a bit longer!</li>
            <li>we had tried other products but this works the best.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe it, I am more than excited to write this review.</li>
            <li>and she told me in was not bad!</li>
            <li>I must say I was hoping for the best, but not expecting much due to the strong attachment my daughter had with her thumb.</li>
            <li>: THE TASTE GOES AWAY VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>We would even let him put the product on his thumb to encourage active participation in this endeavor - he was very proud to use it</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d never get him to quit, let alone so easily.  </li>
            <li>(the organic cayenne pepper one didn&#x27;t work, too easy to suck it off)</li>
            <li>I agree to a degree, but my child was easy to reason with and I told him to use a fork and the issue was gone.</li>
            <li>, it does easily get on food if she eats with it on her fingers.</li>
            <li>Its really easy to transfer to food.</li>
            <li>You will notice its really easy to take off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should transfer so easily.  </li>
            <li>After that, it was easy.</li>
            <li>Also it seems to wear off rather easily.</li>
            <li>Not too happy about the shippng charges - costs more than the actual product.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been easy for him.  </li>
            <li>Now if only we were able to keep her from spitting when she puts her fingers in her mouth out of habit lol.</li>
            <li>It was easy to pull it out of the hand brace to suck.  </li>
            <li>It worked very quickly for her.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>In so pleased it worked so great, especially when nothing else would.</li>
            <li>Easy choice.</li>
            <li>However, make sure you clean off the bottle and cap before resealing it..  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be so easy.  </li>
            <li>It was SO EASY.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>The tastes transfers way to easy</li>
            <li>The plus side is that you don&#x27;t bite your nails...and also a great way to lose weight since you aren&#x27;t able to physically touch food for days!</li>
            <li>We never thought it would be this easy.  </li>
            <li>I never thought about trying something like this because it seemed like a gimmick and was just too easy.</li>
            <li>Just as described, shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cup or sippy they drink from to clean their mouth out is also cleaned or change after drinking.  </li>
            <li>I applied it when she was sleeping, so that it would be easy</li>
            <li>the Easy Way to Stop Nail Biting]]</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t appear like women nails.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t easy to take it off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4)Though we didn&#x27;t need to do this, I think a person could easily re-apply on a child who is sleeping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4)Though we didn&#x27;t need to do this, I think a person could easily re-apply on a child who is sleeping.</li>
            <li>It seems to get off easily when they bath or wash their hands</li>
            <li>The polish chips off easily</li>
            <li>can see great improvement as we tried many ways before such as covering his thumb and even talking with him</li>
            <li>so it was easy to talk to her about it</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, the taste doesn&#x27;t go away easily once you have it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>If your child has a strong will to keep sucking, this product will probably not work either.</li>
            <li>He is now almost 3 years and still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, if it was me, I would stop, but my daughter is strong willed and would rather put up with the aweful taste</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong and I imagine it will cause a gag</li>
            <li>the closest I can describe it as is a really strong dandelion stem taste.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, my nails are growing strong.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong nail polish smell so it doesn&#x27;t bother people around me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>the desire I know, is strong.  </li>
            <li>the desire I know, is strong.  </li>
            <li>have never written a review before, but I feel this strongly about this product</li>
            <li>(This is a child who loves strong olives, spicy food, and pickles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s why I felt so strongly about posting this review.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned this was too strong and bordered on \\&quot;child abuse\\&quot; as one reviewer put it.</li>
            <li>Almost instantaneously, my daughter had a strong aversion to</li>
            <li>recommend this stuff over the cayenne pepper stuff, that didn&#x27;t work at all, wasn&#x27;t strong and wouldn&#x27;t have stopped me either.</li>
            <li>we received Mavala Stop, I explained him that this will help him stop biting his nails and makes them strong again.</li>
            <li>Her palate can tolerate the strong taste.  </li>
            <li>the foul taste is so strong that you just have to use a fork for everything while you&#x27;re using the product.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>this was a strong reaction</li>
            <li>but now I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, this product is really strong.</li>
            <li>equals strong incentive not to put your thumb in there.</li>
            <li>I even tried it myself to see how strong it was</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong as I remember products like this when I was a kid, this one is must be deluded</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Based on our experience, I strongly recommend this product to end nail biting and thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>He has a strong gag reflex and he would gag and throw up from the taste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that the taste is so strong she feels the need to spit in the sink after putting her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li>Definitely strong stuff</li>
            <li>The taste is strong, and lasts for up to a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning, this is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li>the Mavala Stop was still on as strong as ever...</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t work, because it was too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I can&#x27;t see the whites of my nails growing longer, then the temptation to bite them is not as strong.</li>
            <li>My nails are growing and they are growing strong, therefore I do not expect them to break and tear.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is strong yet bearable.</li>
            <li>So strong that it makes you want to gag if you put your fingers in your mouth</li>
            <li>One caution is it has a strong odor while painting.</li>
            <li>My daughter was sucking her finger in the womb and at the age of 8 was still going strong.  </li>
            <li>He never complained too loudly, but he was really good about eating with a fork that&#x27;s for sure!!  </li>
            <li>I told him the mavala was a special magic potion.  </li>
            <li>She continued to allow me to put it on her because she felt so special being able to use this polish</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use this right before feeding your child finger foods or anything that will give them reason to lick their fingers... unless you want them to stop liking that food.  :)</li>
            <li>I used this and within three weeks I saw pretty amazing progress.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing omg this product helped me so much!</li>
            <li>the end of the day, if you are consistent in applying Mavala Stop to your finger nails, and you make an honest effort</li>
            <li>the end of the day, if you are consistent in applying Mavala Stop to your finger nails, and you make an honest effort</li>
            <li>I have tried to eliminate the habit only because she simultaneously pulls her hair out - creating pitiful bald spots on her beautiful head.  </li>
            <li>My daughter (4 years old) successfully quit nail biting in one week.</li>
            <li>i have been a nail-biter all my life and now my nails look so beautiful after only a week of using this \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; product!</li>
            <li>asked our daughter if she would like to have some help to stop sucking her thumb, and she said yes, so we introduced her to this product and allowed her to hold the box and instruction pamphlet while I first painted some on my own thumbnail and then hers.</li>
            <li>He kind of likes it, which isn&#x27;t exactly the reaction we were hoping for.</li>
            <li>The bottle of Mavala is still 3/4 full, so no need to buy more than 1 \\&quot;serving\\&quot;.</li>

            <li>I have grown several sets of beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li>At first it did, she would kind of gag when she put her finger in her mouth.</li>
            <li>I have so far been successful in not biting my nails since I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit uncertain at first about it because it smelled kind of like fingernail polish?  </li>
            <li>The first time it was completely effective, but after about 2 weeks he noticed that the taste wore off and he started sucking again.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for a full 4-5 weeks just to make sure she has kicked this habit.  </li>
            <li>and we have been successful thus far.</li>
            <li>Two coats work better than one and it lasts about 3-4 days with full \\&quot;flavor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s first applied, it is effective.</li>
            <li>This product has successful stopped both completely.</li>
            <li>I continued to put in on her fingers for 3 weeks, but she honestly quit in the first day.</li>
            <li>It successfully got my 7 year old to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li>No one can believe my pretty nails are actually my own.</li>
            <li>I now have a beautiful french manicure.</li>
            <li>This stuff is way more effective than anything else we have tried, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I immediately took off the product with nail polish remover and he was fine for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with that though.</li>
            <li>but she did eat snacks with her hands and was fine.</li>
            <li>Every night after that, he slept just fine.  </li>
            <li>In most cases he would bite his nails without even realizing he was doing so,this product helped him become more aware.</li>
            <li>Once we stopped using it, the fingertips healed up just fine.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, she does not have an easy gag reflex, so we never had to deal with vomit like others on here.</li>
            <li>I reapplied it and she is doing fine and not sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but she is fine with it.  </li>
            <li>I applied this stuff at night and was fine.</li>
            <li>The one time I did use it it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that she will eventually be more aware of Mavala Stop and discontinue this habit.</li>
            <li>She just rinses with water and is fine.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes she was fine.</li>
            <li>And sometimes she asks me if she can do it herself, and that is totally fine with me.</li>
            <li>I am proud to say, my nails are long and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Might be its good for older people biting finger nails but not so good for 2 year old kids.</li>
            <li>Add a bit on each nail and you will quickly realize that you put your hands in your mouth more often you think.</li>
            <li>Maybe the flavor gets more mild after awhile?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li>and it helped our children break the habit quickly!</li>
            <li>She still puts her thumb to her mouth out of habit, but removes it quickly!  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with how quickly the nail biting was cured.</li>
            <li>Its wayy to strong for little children, but perfect for adults.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes that it would work after reading so many excellent reviews on it.</li>
            <li>Nacala stop really worked fast and we were so impressed, we should have started here first</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop works very well for even the most stubborn thumb sucking child (I can testify!)</li>
            <li>We found it had to be applied a lot more often than it said, and very consistently, along with reminders to the child.</li>
            <li>Very useful and easy to use</li>
            <li>The flavor is very powerful and it is easy to taste if you are eating something with your hands.</li>
            <li>stop+nail+biting.&lt;br /&gt;I would still suggest this book as a great read on the insight of biting, made me realize its not as cut and dry as biting it&#x27;s more of a OCD.&lt;br /&gt;People who don&#x27;t understand call it a nervous habit asking; \\&quot;what are you nervous about?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but it quickly passed and we are home free now :)</li>
            <li>From the reviews we were warned that this was very strong for my son however after the first 2 days my son was fine and could bear the taste and continue sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>I am proud to say that my cuticles are healing up wonderfully and I am less likely now to try to put my fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Very strong - the first time my daughter put her fingers in her mouth</li>
            <li>While making those delicious apple-cider pancakes, a little batter got onto my finger.  </li>
            <li>While making those delicious apple-cider pancakes, a little batter got onto my finger.  </li>
            <li>i use it on my little toddler woow great product!</li>
            <li>My son was more willing to do it when he saw I would too!  </li>
            <li>If you eat hot wings wear gloves! :)</li>
            <li>It worked from the very first night!  </li>
            <li>This is the best deterant that i&#x27;ve found for my little boy, but he still finds a way to suck his thumb even with this on.  </li>
            <li>Her little hands look great!</li>
            <li>While I certainly can&#x27;t advocate for it having a very pleasant flavor, that&#x27;s pretty much the point.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to get the after taste out of your mouth and is a HUGE reminder not to bite.</li>
            <li>He had to drink 2 huge cups of juice to get rid of the taste in his mouth, and has tried a couple times to put his thumb in again, but I haven&#x27;t seen him sucking it at all...</li>
            <li>We licked her fingernail and determined her description was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>The reason my husband was so insistant on getting her to stop is because she keeps scratching huge gashes on the bridge of her nose and then picking the scabs</li>
            <li>After just two weeks of using this product, I already notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this product is wonderful for my 6 year old and my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>We are not applying it anymore and have been about 3 weeks bite free.</li>
            <li>some which served just as a reminder as the light reflected off my nails and into my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Because it was so important to her, we just let her go and didn&#x27;t force her to stop...</li>
            <li>My baby girl is almost three, she had a fit when i 1st put it on but</li>
            <li>It does work, but you have to stay attentive.</li>
            <li>One important thing we had to do was, when he slept we put his mitts on.</li>
            <li>, I tried it and still felt comfortable using it on my boys</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still filled to the brim, so it&#x27;s a lifetime supply if I ever need it again, which I doubt.</li>
            <li>We let him to do it, so that he is comfortable with</li>
            <li>Now, two week later, she&#x27;s so proud of herself and even asks me to reapply the Mavala every couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I don&#x27;t have to constantly nag her anymore</li>
            <li>this is a great product and so simple to use!</li>
            <li>The side effects for my child greatly outweighed the possible benefits.</li>
            <li>This item worked great, I only had to reapply it once and the thumb-sucking habit was kicked in a week.</li>
            <li>*Important to know**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product worked fast and was immediately effective in stopping my daughter from sucking her finger.</li>
            <li>She has used the paci for over 3 years and is now paci free for 2 weeks...</li>
            <li>We gave him a lot of encouragement about being a big boy and we were so proud of him</li>
            <li>she had a fit again but still asked for it when it started wearing off.  </li>
            <li>He was ready to stop sucking his thumb, but admitted he couldn&#x27;t do it on his own.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t expect him to not suck his thumb when he is sound asleep</li>
            <li>wHich is great as it will last thru 2 - 3 days of handwashing.</li>
            <li>Her teeth are messed up and she can&#x27;t pronounce the &#x27;k&#x27; sound.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I just have to have the will power to keep applying Mavala until my urges stop.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I would not try it before a vacation or an important family event.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the use of Mavala Stop to be an emotional battle that might take a week or so to win.  </li>
            <li>They are now proud to show off their shiny nails and that is worth much more to me than any price this polish could possibly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy the thumb sucking is finally over.</li>
            <li>and my daughter is doing fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and my daughter is doing fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>She is now thumb-sucking free for 7 months.</li>
            <li>my experience was much more enlightening.  </li>
            <li>and now she is free of nail biting and</li>
            <li>so it was a fast and effective product.</li>
            <li>She was so proud of herself, it&#x27;s now been 8 months since she sucked her fingers, and she hasn&#x27;t gone back at all.  </li>
            <li>In addition to having this painted on his thumbnails, I had a reward system for every week that he didn&#x27;t suck his thumb, ending in the eventual earning of a big-boy two wheeler bike when he was thumb-sucking free for two months.  </li>
            <li>It took me a month or two to get brave enough to put it on her nails.  </li>
            <li>Sure, his nails would avoid being bitten, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth it if it makes your kid throw up.</li>
            <li>and I am soo happy to say he has stopped after only 10 application from august till now...</li>
            <li>She has been free of the habbit for 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Happy to say, that we are almost 3 weeks no thumb sucking and it hasn&#x27;t gone back in his mouth.</li>
            <li>If I had started when she was 3 and not so skillful, it would most likely have been more effective.</li>
            <li>I read reviews on lots of different ones before opting for this one and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am now about 10 weeks bite free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say, I&#x27;m a former nail biter</li>
            <li>and im happy to say i have not bitten my nails not even once..... i used to bite my nails until there was literally nothing left now</li>
            <li>We have been thumb sucking free for almost a year now with no relapse.  </li>
            <li>Children should enjoy the food they ingest.</li>
            <li>Then she puts light pair of mittens over her hands to keep her from involuntarily sucking in her sleep.  </li>
            <li>It would be interesting to know why there was success with our son but not our daughter.</li>
            <li>I tried something cheap from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally have nails.</li>
            <li>She is happy, adjusted and hasn&#x27;t relapsed and I only used this product 2 times.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s proud of her hands again, instant confidence boost.</li>
            <li>Its really important to keep reapplying the solution to curb the habit.</li>
            <li>and she is free of her thumb.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for nail biting.</li>
            <li>This stuff deterred me from biting and now I get to enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li>it looks like I&#x27;m home free.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;s home free.</li>
            <li>Just within a couple of days not she was thumb sucking free.</li>
            <li>so she was about ready to drop this habit, but just couldn&#x27;t do it on her own.  </li>
            <li>Its a fantastic deterrent for nail biting.</li>
            <li>That every 2 days is important.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note that she does want to stop, so I think that helps some.</li>
            <li>This item was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>We had tears on day 1, but smooth sailing after that.  </li>
            <li>Some people have had the fortunate &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve wanted to stop many times but have not had success.</li>
            <li>personal experience was great</li>
            <li>but i feel this is important.</li>
            <li>It is amazing really help because the test herbal 😷😷😷</li>
            <li>The cheap drug-store nail biting/thumb sucking products</li>
            <li>For me this is why I stopped using it, coupled with the fact that I enjoy cooking and was concerned about it rubbing off on my food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then he came to show me the white growth, and he is SO proud that he now lets us put it on without a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He went to bed and the next day when I came home from work he proudly announced that he put his finger in his mouth once during the day but it tasted yucky.  </li>
            <li>Up until my daughter was four years old, she loved sucking her finger.</li>
            <li>A couple days later she informed me that she kind of liked the taste though.  </li>
            <li>This was for a 5 year old who really loved his thumb.  </li>
            <li>put it on my daughter (4 1/2 yr old) who loved the taste of Thum and chewed off the Orly No Bite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such an awesome product!</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>While my use of napkins has gone up considerably while eating, I see it as a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 11 year old son who just Loved to suck his thumb when he was&lt;br /&gt;feeling</li>
            <li>Only problem is it isn&#x27;t as glossy a most topcoats, so a mani doesn&#x27;t look as good with this painted over.</li>
            <li>I will be returning it and definitely not suggesting to anyone else despite the many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Wish the pediatrician/dentist/orthodontist had not been so nonchalant about the thumb sucking in the first place, as he pushed the roof of his mouth up pretty good.  </li>
            <li>We told him he may be getting too old for his fingers  to taste good.  </li>
            <li>It has been three weeks, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t use it as consistently as we should have, but it still did a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>So far so good been using it a week and my 4yr has gone to bed every night , not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>When I asked my 4 yr old if she wanted to stop sucking her thumb she told me she loved her thumb and did not want to stop.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t in good conscious give this to my child.</li>
            <li>But that is a good thing, because it has completely cured my husband&#x27;s habit.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Fortunately she was able to laugh about it, and our shared disgust with the taste had us both in stitches.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this nail polish and it has been doing good so far.</li>
            <li>Thanks great product, fast transaction and shipping</li>
            <li>Now I have long beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>This worked really good for my 5 year old grandchild.  </li>
            <li>The good news her teeth went back to the right position and she feels much more confident too.</li>
            <li>Whenever she noticed the taste was not as strong as it is when first applied, she asked to have more applied to keep her from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>After all these years of biting I now how beautiful long nails!</li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure I bought the right thing.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to work so easily and quickly, nor did I expect such a jump in his expressive language.</li>
            <li>She is really proud of herself, and we are no longer grossed out of her wet thumb! :-)</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>really worked!!!</li>
            <li>It really works !!!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HELPS!!!</li>
            <li>For the first time in years we cut her nails!!</li>
            <li>He has so much confidence now!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>I can not believe how fast it worked!!!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>exactly as it should!!</li>
            <li>Worked really well!!!</li>
            <li>Mavala, worked from the first night we put it on her thumb!!</li>
            <li>Nor did trying to talk very calmly with her about stopping, and how she can come talk to me if she ever feels like she needs to bite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rare that she puts her fingers in her mouth and when I do, I put Mavala on her nails.  </li>
            <li>This is a very useful tool for people have years of chewing nails habit.</li>
            <li>We will try again when he&#x27;s older and be able to understand better.  </li>
            <li>The Good: This product does as advertised, it leave a very strong bitter taste in your mouth if you bit your nails or cuticles.</li>
            <li>the first time make sure you are in area that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This worked great for the first couple of weeks until my 3 year old figured out that if he peeled if off he could continue chewing his fingernails.</li>
            <li>Ok so yea what the reviews are saying are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>After getting a good taste of this stuff, my daughter pretty much stopped sucking her finger.  </li>
            <li>So I turned to Mavala Stop, mostly because I&#x27;m cheap and its really not expensive.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly and easily it worked.  </li>
            <li>I then decided to put a light color nail polish first then marvala stop on top.</li>
            <li>At the risk of sounding corny: One bottle of Mavala Stop- eight dollars; Having my daughter feel proud of herself for breaking a very difficult and embarrassing habit, PRICELESS.</li>
            <li>At the risk of sounding corny: One bottle of Mavala Stop- eight dollars; Having my daughter feel proud of herself for breaking a very difficult and embarrassing habit, PRICELESS.</li>
            <li>Bought the Orly and do not bother with that stuff, way too mild and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>The problem I have with it is that it wears off too easily and too quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good first step rather than going straight to the thumb guard contraptions.</li>
            <li>However, two days later she proudly announced that she hadn&#x27;t chewed on her nails in a full day.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff ever to stop your little one from sucking their thumb!</li>
            <li>Make sure the top is on good and tight.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>She adjusted very well to the new place and made great friends but would not quit biting her nails.</li>
            <li>I grew beautiful nails, but as soon as I stopped using it, I went right back to biting.</li>
            <li>A quick drink of water and he was out light a light.</li>
            <li>We continue to try to use this - but probably could be more consistent.</li>
            <li>Thum makes the thumb have a hot taste which my daughter enjoyed.</li>
            <li>, that is so exciting!</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop has been the only thing that I&#x27;ve tried that has successfully gotten me to stop putting my fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Worth it though!</li>
            <li>We encouraged him to apply it, so he was excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was excited to put it on because it is nailpolish</li>
            <li>I polished her nail with a color first and put Mavala on as a top coat.</li>
            <li>My son hiding this away proves that it works as advertised!</li>
            <li>Of course, that first day they both put their fingers in their mouth of out habit and were not AT ALL pleased with the flavor.</li>
            <li>Being a nail biter for pretty much most of my life I was excited to find out you can add flavoring to spice up a lifetime habit.</li>
            <li>Originally I was given this product by a friend of mine.  </li>
            <li>I am a guy so this product was not too appealing to me at first.  </li>
            <li>After two weeks of using it, I am more aware than ever when I bite my nail.  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to work.  </li>
            <li>The first day it seemed like it might be the magic charm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like putting on nailpolish where you put on a normal amount of liquid and spread nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself first to make sure.  </li>
            <li>After eight years and a month ago found this on amazon, read reviews and bough - and first time for many years</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure, today, that he knocked it off the kitchen counter on purpose.  </li>
            <li>A drink of water and washing the lips gets rid of the taste though, but I have to admit, it is a powerful deterrent--and no amount of hand washing gets rid of it on the fingers!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Now she is excited that she is not sucking her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li>But it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>She was resistant at first, but we told her it was magic and would help her to remember not to suck her thumb</li>
            <li>Initially I thought it was successful.</li>
            <li>I think if I can get more consistent it&#x27;ll do the trick for this guy.</li>
            <li>Guess my first boy was just more tolerant/stubborn, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li>I think if I can get more consistent it&#x27;ll do the trick for this guy.</li>
            <li>Guess my first boy was just more tolerant/stubborn, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li>We only had to use it one more time, and she was magically done with thumb sucking!</li>
            <li>We had tears the first two nights that they would not be able to sleep without their thumbs but somehow they did</li>
            <li>Well worth it !</li>
            <li>I even made sure to apply nail polish first</li>
            <li>and that it was coming in the mail (exciting for her!)</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>It took a while to ship, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>It worked like magic the first 2 days, but then I guess he got used to it, because it works for about 10 minutes after application</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but was willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product and read all the reviews about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it  for the past 3 weeks and found it is an excellent aide in reminding me to get my fingers out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Way worth it!</li>
            <li>Beginning in the dental field, having pretty and healthy teeth is a must.</li>
            <li>She likes my pretty nails. :)</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product because of my son.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>besides flossing, I&#x27;m wondering what other situations might cause me to put my fingers in my mouth, and hopefully I&#x27;ll have the good sense to avoid it before it happens!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure her front teeth changed within days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is exactly why I love it.  </li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;d like to say I did read many reviews BEFORE trying this product.  </li>
            <li>I explained this product after purchasing it and she was of course excited and nervous.</li>
            <li>: The first day I used this product, I put a lot of it on and all over my cuticles just for safe measure.</li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>For the price, it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It stays pretty prominent even after hand washing, showering, etc.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about the number of 5s this product received.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the outcome so far with using Mavala on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have used so many products over the years and this is the first time it worked.  </li>
            <li>so it was worth it!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Now if I could just find that bottle, I&#x27;m pretty sure she hid it from me.</li>
            <li>It worked the first day (and that may have been more of a placebo).</li>
            <li>I put nail hardener on first then apply this to the top of that every 2 days.</li>
            <li>She let me put it on and was really excited.</li>
            <li>She was excited about it happening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 15 years and this is the first time I&#x27;v been able to stop.</li>
            <li>My child didn&#x27;t like the taste, but had not wild/far out reactions, it seemed to be the perfect level of motivation to stop sucking without going overboard.</li>
            <li>I Bought this product for my 4 year old granddaughter and we were very pleased...</li>
            <li>but if you touch your finger on a nail and eat, you better be ready for that treat!</li>
            <li>Worth the price even for just one use!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>We sill keep using until we achieve success!</li>
            <li>Well worth your money!</li>
            <li>Her first application was hilarious are putting it on my daughters thumb as she didn&#x27;t even suck her thumb but somehow got a taste of it in her mouth not knowing what it from was spitting all over the floor.  </li>
            <li>First time in my life that I can paint my nails and feel confident about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited, after years of nail biting</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>She was so excited.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was cute.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore I originally bought this product when she was 18 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d find myself doing it at the most inopportune moments and people would look at me funny.  </li>
            <li>I put it on every 2 days for the first week just to make sure she was done.</li>
            <li>from my original post-</li>
            <li>This is powerful stuff and works!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid nail biter for most of my 29 years.  </li>
            <li>I still tried to use it for my 1 yr old daughter, looks like she is having a real strong intent of \\&quot;thumb sucking\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I waited - it appears it is most effective on kids 3 and older as their taste buds are not fully developed before then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You probably shouldn&#x27;t try this with real little kids, and it will probably be more successful if the child is motivated to top sucking.  </li>
            <li>my 2.5 year old daughter actually LIKED the taste and requested it be put on her finger so she could enjoy</li>
            <li>I think the best thing is just to ignote it until he gets old enough to want to stop.</li>
            <li>I will say that she no longer sleeps thru the night in her own bed since no longer sucking her thumb, but that&#x27;s a different problem. :)</li>
            <li>Keeps my hands clean though, so</li>
            <li>The vet also suggested a premie &amp;#34;onesie.&amp;#34;  We went with that option, but it&#x27;s been less than ideal as it rides up unless it&#x27;s snapped shut at the butt</li>
            <li>For the first couple of days Mavala Stop seemed pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>Their doctor told me buying products like this one would be a waste of money, but I was confident about this product because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I am also much more conscious of biting them and you start to see how much better</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had to continue using Mavala, applying every three to four days, as she &#x27;taste tests&#x27; her thumbs to see if they are yet &#x27;clean&#x27;, in her words.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple different products to stop nail biting and this stuff is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Now he has nails that I have to actually clean and trim.</li>
            <li>This got such great reviews, even a friend of mine had success with this when nothing else worked.  </li>
            <li>She liked putting the polish on and even asks for more but we only put it on her thumbs because the taste does come off on food</li>
            <li>(We had tried another product called Thum earlier, but she liked it and would ask for applying more on her fingers).</li>
            <li>Before too long, my beautiful, healthy and much longer nails were being nibbled to the quick.  </li>
            <li>My five year old took great pride each night in putting her sticker on the little enclosed chart when she got through the day successfully.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will take before he stops wishing he could suck his thumb, but I have to say this is a very effective product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything, positive reinforcement and rewards, hugs and one over the counter pharmacy product (containing cayenne pepper which he enjoyed) but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I took a leap of faith on this product because of the overwhelming positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews about it on here, but was still leary about it woking for my daughter because of the severity.  </li>
            <li>This amazing product got my four year old to stop sucking her thumb in one day!</li>
            <li>It was more about becoming aware of my nail biting habit and that is exactly what this does.</li>
            <li>you cook frequently, make sure to wear gloves at all times when using Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li>We tried everything, the sour stuff (she loved the taste!)</li>
            <li>So he was quite happy to just suck it right off, even though it&#x27;d only been an hour since I&#x27;d reapplied it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it wears off of skin pretty quickly as opposed to nails, but it is doing the trick.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that with lots of hand-washing, you may need to apply it more often (maybe each night) because it washes off more easily.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to finally have good nails!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>stuff is really strong and can sometimes &amp;#34;bite you&amp;#34; even when you are not actually biting at your nails; I tend to even keep my hands away from my face more when using this which has the added bonus of not getting as many germs in your mouth from your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We gave her one of her baby sisters pacifiers to use and a special  stuffed bunny to squeeze if she needed to suck her thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He went seven days without sucking his thumb and he got a special toy.</li>
            <li>I had some special nail gloss.  </li>
            <li>The special polish was Mavala.  </li>
            <li>Our dentist even wanted to put a special appliance in his mouth to make him break the habit.  </li>
            <li>, it will certainly take more than one try to break it.  </li>
            <li>If they could make this something more of a combo it would be 5 stars, but it certainly does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I told her it was special nail polish just for her.  </li>
            <li>He thinks its something special.</li>
            <li>yeah, right!  </li>
            <li>stop right away!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li>She would suck it right off!</li>
            <li>Worked right away!  </li>
            <li>It has a very bitter taste and is absolutely the best anti-biting I ever used.</li>
            <li>We are definitely satisfied customers and proud parents of two little girls that no longer suck their fingers! :</li>
            <li>Better to do this than to spend thousands on orthodontists fees when your child is older!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Mavala Stop-there were so many HELPFUL  reviews,TIPS and high ratings from lots of consumers which is important to</li>
            <li>I was NOT expecting such a strong overwhelming, lingering taste!</li>
            <li>the first day it worked great and after that it was over just simply hopeless</li>
            <li>Amazing my 3 years old daughter stop biting her nails within A WEEK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff and at for under $20 bucks, it was money well spent to me.</li>
            <li>She hates the bitter taste and happily keeps her fingers out of her mouth.</li>
            <li>so happy no more thumb sucking :)</li>
            <li>I now have long nails and it is so wonderful to write a check at a store or unpeel some old tape without being embarressed.</li>
            <li>My son can&#x27;t stand the taste and has greatly reduced how much he tries to put his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li>she is not so happy at night, but in the long run, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s working amazingly well so far.</li>
            <li>The taste, I&#x27;m told, is vile and it does last 2 days at a stretch, even with good hand-washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her dentist said it was okay to let it go until age 4, but now that I&#x27;ve gone through this, I would encourage fellow parents to stop their children with finger sucking MUCH sooner.  </li>
            <li>Another thing, about people who are saying that their kids got used to the taste, thats actually true..</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>I gave my 7 and 10 year old (yes, 10) sons the chance to quit their thumb sucking on their own with the threat of ordering this stuff if they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It really truely worked.</li>
            <li>I tested it out on my pinky finger to make sure it wasnt too much for him.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to not use too much.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t reapplied the polish in a good week and the habit has not come back, not even at night.</li>
            <li>But thanks to this stuff I was able too.  </li>
            <li>before I got a full blast.</li>
            <li>4 yr  old apparently liked the taste.  </li>
            <li>Longevity seems good, although I got in the habit of painting daily just to do it.</li>
            <li>and I really just wanted to go get mani&#x27;s:)</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be able to eat much with your fingers, so use utensils while you have it on your nails.</li>
            <li>We have found that to be true because we tried a nail biting inhibitor when he was around three and sucked his thumb anyway.</li>
            <li>It really works, plus it&#x27;s made in Switzerland and is safe for kids.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my 2 year old who liked to suck two fingers.</li>
            <li>Well it has come true.</li>
            <li>My own son was a nailbiter and from the moment I put it on he would not go near his mouth.</li>
            <li>Effective while on the nails, I found myself reapplying to my 4 year old&#x27;s fingers nightly.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it actually taste bad,the concept is good</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s full of chemicals, and that means she&#x27;s ingesting those chemicals.</li>
            <li>&quot; but the dentist stated she was starting to see some changes in her palate from the thumbsucking and her teeth, which were in good health, looked obvisouly like she sucked her thumb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go for 2 full weeks 14 days, but I&#x27;m 100%</li>
            <li>We did put it on his thumb a second time, but just for good measure.</li>
            <li>It can help to freshen it up during the week to keep the taste at full unpleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your nails will probably not look natural, but if that&#x27;s a concern, you could probably lie and say it&#x27;s just a nice, buffed manicure.</li>
            <li>Your nails will probably not look natural, but if that&#x27;s a concern, you could probably lie and say it&#x27;s just a nice, buffed manicure.</li>
            <li>myself, the absent-minded nail biting is my real problem, been doing it for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bitten my nails my whole life, and I never thought I would be able to stop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful, and cheap.</li>
            <li>She was 8 years old and had no intention of stopping on her own.  </li>
            <li>but it kind of got used and old.</li>
            <li>BUT - the next night was easier and by the 3-4 he was good to go!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was VERY nervous about trying this product because so many reviews said that it made their child vomit.  </li>
            <li>only fair.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it works well as a clear nail polish, although it is kind of pricey for just that.</li>
            <li>2 days later I re-applied for good measure.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve been thrilled to see that the habit is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>We kept some juice handy to wash the taste away when she accidentally did it in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li>He was ready and we tried many things, but this did the trick</li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old been-biting-my-nails-forever kind of guy.  </li>
            <li>I think $6-$8 is a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Now spends a lot more time coloring and getting into real trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My almost five year old son has been wanting to stop sucking his thumb and could not do it on his own.</li>
            <li>Well it definitely doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve collected my fair share of nervous habits over the years and finally I got fed up with my inability to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things....</li>
            <li>He licked his fingers and true to form</li>
            <li>The next day at nap he asked if there was still medicine on his hand, I said there was, and it didn&#x27;t taste good, so he should try not to put them in his mouth.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even mind that 98% of the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li>after about 2 weeks of applying twice per week my four year old daughter got use to it its no linger effective</li>
            <li>It says it may not be effective on kids under 3 years old, but it still worked for us.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I still have the bottle almost full.</li>
            <li>It really works, I feel so much better about my hands now.</li>
            <li>I hesitated, because I thought it would be too traumatizing, but it actually helped him and he feels good about himself now that he&#x27;s kicked the habit.</li>
            <li>I have really liked the results to far.</li>
            <li>and my nails finally looked good.</li>
            <li>This woke her up immediately in full tears.</li>
            <li>I love this item so much.</li>
            <li>We will start leaving it on full time after 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using it without the true desire to stop will probably not be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on and it went on nice and clear.</li>
            <li>That really motivated her; the M.S. was more of a reminder not to do it (like when asleep).</li>
            <li>Loved this product, my youngest daughter sucked her index and middle finger</li>
            <li>Biting my nails has been a habit my whole life, and it did not make me magically stop.</li>
            <li>Especially something he loved</li>
            <li>So, for $10.99 + free shipping we figured that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I still have a FULL bottle and will us this for my daughter as well.  </li>
            <li>Impressive, to say the least.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be quite effective.</li>
            <li>so it was full and waisted..</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;---This is the best honestly no chemicals or nothing.</li>
            <li>and she stopped completely on her own, just because she did not want another application of the Mavala on her nails.</li>
            <li>It is true what others say about transfer onto food</li>
            <li>Whenever it&#x27;s applied, we&#x27;re usually good for several days before it wears off.</li>
            <li>He still does it occasionally but we found this to be good deterrent.</li>
            <li>I personally find that to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all for his own wellness and the dentist told that sucking the thumb near to 5 or 6 years can affect his permeation</li>
            <li>We still have a full bottle leftover.</li>
            <li>Once I started working dating my boyfriend he has helped me to not bite as much, but i still bite my nails and most of the time</li>
            <li>You have to reapply it if they take a bath and make sure not to put too much on their nail or it will affect their food.</li>
            <li>What they say about tastebud development is true bc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only fair that you know what they&#x27;re going through.</li>
            <li>If you use this product and continue to bite your nails with it on, you have my respect because you are truely dedicated to your habit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but it is there.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but has a lot of shine</li>
            <li>just went away with no tears, no bad taste, and no trauma.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old loved her thumb and her teeth/bite were pretty messed up because of it.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST $9 I&#x27;ve EVER spent!!!!!</li>
            <li>But I can honestly say, after about 20 years of nail biting it actually is becoming rapidly less appealing to me.</li>
            <li>I am truly convinced that I have kicked the habit and am so excited to start getting manicures for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>Pretty cool, eh!?  </li>
            <li>I surely does taste bitter, and yes I have stopped biting my nails for the most part, but the taste gets on anything I put my hands in!</li>
            <li>This product does not smell or look funny, so it&#x27;s very easy to just put on top of nail polish or on bare nails.</li>
            <li>However, it would be wonderful if it was made of natural ingredients such as aloe vera which is bitter ang good for one&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this worked great.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>I think we could have used this and other techniques to greatly shorten the sucking period, in a caring way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great to encourage and tease each other along the way.</li>
            <li>None of them work - if anyone has other ideas, that would be great.</li>
            <li>It is a very very bitter taste and makes for a great deterrent for biting nails.</li>
            <li>(we are continuing the use till we are certain the habit is gone)!!</li>
            <li>but it dries quickly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any irritation to my eyes, luckily.  </li>
            <li>A last note, her teeth moved back into correct position in about 6 weeks and her bite is perfect.  </li>
            <li>They had to take a quick drink of water or juice to get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li>I can see how it is better on older children.</li>
            <li>Three days later I checked his nails and they were all growing back wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the last part was more than people wanted to know</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the last part was more than people wanted to know</li>
            <li>So far so good no thumb sucking for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Our 3 year-old quickly figured out how to take a suck at her thumb and then take a drink repeatedly until the mavala was sucked off and she had rinsed the taste from her mouth.  </li>
            <li>It dries quick</li>
            <li>It lingers and conditions you quickly to avoid biting your nails.</li>
            <li>Overall i was very impressed with the initial results.</li>
            <li>Two days later we applied it once more just to be safe, but I don&#x27;t think she ever tried again.  </li>
            <li>but with all the Thai food I ate when I was pregnant with my him</li>
            <li>It is incredibly mild and had no impact on breaking my childs habit.  </li>
            <li>She could wash it off (and did so at school) and it faded quickly so the spicy cayenne pepper taste would lessen</li>
            <li>It comes with more than enough to hopefully cure even the most relentless of nail</li>
            <li>i tried about 3 times, and learned quickly.  </li>
            <li>After that I put on two coats of Mavala Stop and it didn&#x27;t wear off so quickly.</li>
            <li>We did need to apply it to her fingers as well, because she tried to bypass it, but quickly realized that would not work.  </li>
            <li>It comes off so quickly that you will gradually get conditioned to the taste</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s the point, but it would be more effective if it was immediately bitter.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried everything to get him to stop, from telling him that his nail would fall of from bugs and worms growing out of it, to chili powder mixed with hot sauce (he liked it!).</li>
            <li>I received the order quickly and would recommend this product if you need help to end a thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li>Luckily, she stopped it before the bottle ran out.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my 3 year old and her 7 year old cousin.</li>
            <li>Luckily, we had a blanket, as I will spare the details and cleanup.  </li>
            <li>Super.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, he still has his baby teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that with his particular habit, he was able to avoid tasting the Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li>Did keep my husband from biting his nails for awhile but would wear off way to quickly.</li>
            <li>She made the connection quickly and has basically stopped thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work, my daughter was not deterred and it wears off quickly</li>
            <li>so I had to do something quick.</li>
            <li>She actually started sucking her thumb more and more - bed time, watching TV, in the car...</li>
            <li>Being older, I think it had a better impact on her</li>
            <li>I never thought it would work so quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it worked that quickly.  </li>
            <li>He learned to stop quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>My child quickly learned from it</li>
            <li>The hardest part for him was learning to fall asleep but he quickly adjusted.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very proud of herself and talks about being such a big girl now that she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb.</li>
            <li>If I could do it over I would have waited till he was older, for sure, if at all.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly on the naila nd even finger area underneath the nail.  </li>
            <li>fixed the issue of finder nail bitting fast and works good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe fir 3 and older</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>her nails did grow fairly quick too.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this product worked for just that.  </li>
            <li>In trying several similar products, this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping by the seller.</li>
            <li>but he figured out quickly</li>
            <li>I love that it stays on for more than a day and doesn&#x27;t require constant reapplication.</li>
            <li>advice for the first day or days depending on your child age: the first time you apply make sure you have time to stay with your child to monitor him or her as the need to suck is already a habit for him or her.</li>
            <li>This shipped out and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>He ended up just biting anyway and the stuff seemed to wear off quickly once that started.</li>
            <li>But, he quickly learned how to suck through the smell/taste and now does it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was quick drying.</li>
            <li>Our three-year-old just started sucking his thumb out of nowhere, and it quickly became an all-day, all-night habit.</li>
            <li>You do learn to use utensils really quick with this product too.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s mainly a nervous thing because I notice I do it more when I am stressed</li>
            <li>It goes on very easily, just like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>like - 80&#x27;s high hair made sure everyone knows how a mouthful of that tastes.)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My 3 year old stopped biting her nails!! :))</li>
            <li>This stuff is extremely potent and will easily taint food if prepared with bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THANKS MALAVA STOP for such a fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li>I would very highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>It works the very first night.</li>
            <li>The nail biting somehow faded over the course of few month, mostly under a threat of Mavala:), so credit goes to them anyway:)</li>
            <li>I ordered Malva stop and from the very first day we put it on his thumb</li>
            <li>I found this product on amazon and ordered without any second thought and I am very glad that I found this product because my daughter stopped her thumb sucking habit from the very first application.</li>
            <li>This product made my 4 year-old son stop sucking his fingers on the very first day.  </li>
            <li>The very first night I used it, she was sucking her thumb within 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>He was very willing to not suck his thumb while awake, but while sleeping it would just happen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It wears off in 3 days or so, and while you can still taste bitterness, it&#x27;s bearable, so this product is most effective for me if I put it on every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Be very aware when u use this product ...</li>
            <li>It worked the very first time we applied it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product (she will be three in 2 months) and one the very first day of using this</li>
            <li>At the first stop light I got to-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that most dentists believe it is a good idea to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs as early as possible.</li>
            <li>The very first time she tasted it, she cried but I gave her some water</li>
            <li>This helped very much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very potent, the only downside is you&#x27;ll have to eat finger foods with forks.</li>
            <li>Made me very aware of when my hands made it to my mouth.  </li>
            <li>He was a very willing participant and was grateful for something that would help him break the habit.</li>
            <li>She cried (and drooled) for three hours and fidgeted all night long, so she did not get a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as we keep reapplying every 2 days, she should be good.  </li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s strong and smart and could pull them off no matter</li>
            <li>(insert jumping up and down - HAPPY).  </li>
            <li>I have a pair of 3 year-olds and this worked great for one but not the other (she was just determined to suck her thumb no matter what!).</li>
            <li>My  3 yeard dauther leave the thum sucking since the first day, I put Mavala each 2 dya for 10 days, this really work!!!</li>
            <li>not only got better about not biting my nails, but I also was more conscious of licking my fingers, touching my face, and eating food with my fingers.</li>
            <li>Specially when its a huge mood changed haha.</li>
            <li>No matter how many deals we made to get them a new toy or throw them a party they couldn&#x27;t kick the habit.  </li>
            <li>Just to be sure the habit was gone, we applied a new coat every two or three days for about a month.  </li>
            <li>You need to make sure to add a new coat every 2 days thought because it does fade with soap.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product because, for any normal person, it will be a great deterrent to putting fingers in the mouth.</li>
            <li>applied, the first day it works great and tastes horribly bitter.</li>
            <li>It was really that easy.  </li>
            <li>Fast &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I painted her nails before putting it on, and she was excited about that since I&#x27;d never let her paint them before because I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea due to her thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>My two elementary school kids who we could not get to stop sucking their thumbs quickly stopped after we started painting their thumbs with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Be ready for gagging and some throw up if your child throws up easily.</li>
            <li>I finally have long, beautiful nails after biting mine to the nub for over 40 years!</li>
            <li>it tastes pretty gross, but a good teeth scrubbing and</li>
            <li>The taste from these two products wears off fast and is too easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>Perfect product, last for a long time on nail.</li>
            <li>This worked very well, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I made sure they were ready and wanted to try it, I tried it first.</li>
            <li>When I tasted it, it was almost like fish oil (very salty and strong).</li>
            <li>I love my new nails and can&#x27;t wait to go for my first manicure!</li>
            <li>your child is very young make sure you remaind him or her from</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the fact that they look so good that I haven&#x27;t had a single bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put the product on the first day and that was it, THUMBSUCKING HAS STOPPED!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 2 weeks and for the first time in my life I have nails!</li>
            <li>Well Mavala Stop worked the first time!</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop works, but prepare yourself for the traumatic first steps!</li>
            <li>The first night, success!  </li>
            <li>It worked the first day!</li>
            <li>oh boy - this should have been our first choice!  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>It felt like it was the first time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li>I was amazed by the fast results!!</li>
            <li>and she evidently disagreed!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny because it makes you very aware of what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember exactly, but we did it for about 2 weeks and his nails started growing!</li>
            <li>The first day she stopped!</li>
            <li>She learned fast not to do that anymore!!</li>
            <li>First nite I used it, it worked!  </li>
            <li>I asked our dentist what he would recommend, and he said Mavala Stop is the only thing he&#x27;s been able to find that works!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Other then that,  I&#x27;m loving the results!</li>
            <li>This is for real!!</li>
            <li>Worked the first time we used it!</li>
            <li>A week after that, I clipped her nails for the first time in 18 months!</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this it truly works!!!</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy to say my son no longer sucks his thumb!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many methods to get our stubborn 5 year old twins to stop sucking their thumbs and this product worked on day one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect negative reinforcement!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome for this age, at least!</li>
            <li>She stopped that first day, and hasn&#x27;t done it since!</li>
            <li>That night she got up several times to get a drink because of the taste in her mouth, but after that we have not had any more thumb sucking!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>works very well!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I have never been able to shake biting my nails--32 years old but cannot stop it!</li>
            <li>This product stopped it the first day!</li>
            <li>He still says he can&#x27;t wait to stop using it so he can suck his thumb again, but I told him I&#x27;d put it on him till he was married if I had to!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Mavala!!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have nails!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>My son is, scratch that, WAS an avid thumbsucker after 1 application before nap time and one at bed he was done!</li>
            <li>Within a WEEK of our first application his nails were growing and he was no longer putting his fingers in his mouth!</li>
            <li>I just painted my nails for the first time at 25!</li>
            <li>But now, they stopped since first week of using Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li>We talked to him about it before using it and he was resistant but within the first week he stopped sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li>I should have bought it when he first told me, it would have saved thousands in orthodontist bills and braces!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>My 3 year old hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb yet!:)</li>
            <li>She has not sucked her thumbs day or night since the first 2 weeks of this!</li>
            <li>I stayed strong (but compassionate and comforting) and the next morning, like magic</li>
            <li>but i stayed strong with what i wanted for my daughter, and just kept explaining that shes a big girl now, and it ll be better tomorrow</li>
            <li>Many similar products can easily be sucked off, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>Always envious of guys/gals with nice long nails and spent many nights contemplating growing my own (nails..</li>
            <li>on the plus side, it&#x27;s pretty fun to shove your fingers into significant others&#x27; mouths and ruin their night.</li>
            <li>I think my son&#x27;s going to grow up being a hot sauce junky because he just sucked it clean off his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she stopped sucking at her thumb right away, I used it for a month since I heard that it takes 21 days to stop or to get a new habit so,just to make sure..</li>
            <li>and she wanted to stop wanted to stop but needed a little help and this product worked great for her.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, painting little stubs is NOT that attractive to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my little one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it that offensive, but our little guy holds it in great disdain.</li>
            <li>I think if it came in a spray, one little poof on donuts or ice cream would make this a great weight-loss product as well.  </li>
            <li>This is probably not something you want to put on really little kids fingers, but it works great for our 4 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We discussed why it wasn&#x27;t good to suck her thumb or bite her nails (germs under her nails and on her hands, not being able to wear polish, hurt to bite too much, would mess up her grown up teeth coming in,</li>
            <li>There should be enough in there to share with someone else once we&#x27;re certain that we&#x27;re finished with it for good.</li>
            <li>I wanted something safe, yet effective and did a little research.</li>
            <li>is coming from helping them not to taste it all the time specially in the first hours because as time passes by they understand then you don&#x27;t have to remaind that often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>me and my husband were excited to get this product because of the wild reviews saying how strong it was.</li>
            <li>I was ignorant to the fact that such a wonderful product existed!&lt;br /&gt;So for a little background my daughter was more than ready to stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li>We started him off with a seven day period that he had to stop and then we would give him a cheap toy that he really wanted.</li>
            <li>you only see fingers w a huge head :)  </li>
            <li>He got a couple tastes of it and of course needed to drink water and wipe his mouth but really didn&#x27;t throw much of a fit.</li>
            <li>She seemed to enjoy it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that it worked for her because it&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li>(the top teeth or sticking farther out) and the huge callous on her middle finger.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product for those kids who want to stop, but just need some extra help.</li>
            <li>I will be searching for another alternative despite having such amazing success years ago.</li>
            <li>Amazing results, stopped thumb sucking instantly.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up because all kids are different, but it did work for me truly amazing.</li>
            <li>short, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>worked amazingly well, We only had to apply maybe 3 days in a row and he stopped biting his nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that the nail biter WANTS to quit.</li>
            <li>It worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>product is amazing, it&#x27;s finally allowing me to let go of my 25 year habit.</li>
            <li>At school, he fidgeted a lot since he couldn&#x27;t calm himself by sucking his fingers.  </li>
            <li>His thumb was what he used to calm and soothe himself.  </li>
            <li>What I liked the most was that the polish stayed on for a few days.  </li>
            <li>nice product and definitely gets</li>
            <li>It does not have a matte finish and is not a liquid which is simply absorbed into the nail...</li>
            <li>It does not have a matte finish and is not a liquid which is simply absorbed into the nail...</li>
            <li>in the end it worth it.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to have</li>
            <li>I want to be sure we completely break the habit.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>For those who said they couldn&#x27;t eat finger food, or the taste made them want to vomit, I honestly wonder if they received the same product I did.</li>
            <li>Husband did it with her to make it fun.  </li>
            <li>think this is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>My son has also had success, with a couple of setbacks.</li>
            <li>36 years worth of nail biting</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Someone recommended this product so I thought it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, success depends on the child.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>It is well worth it.</li>
            <li>the results are worth the effort and cost of the product.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money for us.  </li>
            <li>It does wear off after a day or two, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li>into consideration that my now 13-year-old sucked his two middle fingers until he was three (stopping on his own), we even tried waiting it</li>
            <li>It is worth the money to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li>so worth the money</li>
            <li>Her teeth took about 2-3 months and her smile is out of control beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>My 4 month old is already a thumbsucker, so we&#x27;ll be pulling out the bottle again in a couple of years. :)</li>
            <li>Worth It</li>
            <li>but im glad to say it has worked so far</li>
            <li>There may be vomitting when tasted but its worth it.</li>
            <li>We also purchased to keep our 6 year old from putting her hands in her mouth so much in hopes of reducing the number of viruses she&#x27;s constantly catching from school.</li>
            <li>and it ended up getting kind of short.</li>
            <li>Sure, it leaves a \\&quot;polish\\&quot; on your nails (like clear nail polish).  </li>
            <li>Unless you use this for kids, then it might be useful.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it for the money</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not afraid of the taste, he even asked me to put on \\&quot;yikie\\&quot; for him.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting though that my friend tried it and the taste did not deter him from biting his nails, so this may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Also helped make sure that thumb sucking was DONE in my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>We had to apply it just twice to break the thumb sucking habit of our two year old (but we continued to apply it for a week to be sure).</li>
            <li>My daughter has been sucking her thumb since before she was born (sonogram picture proves it).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It worked like magic, one taste and the fingers never went near her mouth again, and we didn&#x27;t even get any complaints about it.</li>
            <li>and I thought I was on the road to success.  </li>
            <li>I was so worried he would be made fun of</li>
            <li>When it was time to reapply, which was 2 days later the product was not as effective.</li>
            <li>so when she went to kindergarten they wouldn&#x27;t make fun of her.  </li>
            <li>However, it may be worth the $10</li>
            <li>I love not being self conscious about my nails.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so exciting</li>
            <li>it is worth me taking the time to write a review to let people know that this product worked for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>it is worth me taking the time to write a review to let people know that this product worked for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I became extremely confident that this would be the solution for my 4 year old daughter to stop biting her nails and fingers.</li>
            <li>It will take probably 4-6 more weeks for my nails to completely grow out</li>
            <li>She was even honest enough to tell me when the product was wearing off.  </li>
            <li>Try some thing else for kids, it migth be useful for adults.</li>
            <li>It was totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>This worked to stop my son from putting his thumb in his mouth, but I think it is worth sharing our experience with it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever write an on-line review</li>
            <li>I simply smile and ask her if she remembers me doing so.</li>
            <li>I tried thumb guards and didn&#x27;t have any success with those.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try, though.</li>
            <li>It is powerful stuff, but if you have stubborn kids, it is just what you need.</li>
            <li>My daughter quit eating my wife&#x27;s freshly baked sugar cookies the moment her fingers touched her mouth.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve found this product useful to us as a family...</li>
            <li>Also worth noting</li>
            <li>is that my friend says that the product, once painted on the fingernails, works for several days even with frequent hand washing, which he is happy about (since he doesn&#x27;t have to re-apply as often).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Every day I asked him to show his nails, and complimented him with not biting them and how they were growing back so nicely.</li>
            <li>For the price of this product, it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many ways to get our almost 3 year old son to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>My son went to feed him a Dorito and my hubby over bites so he gets our sons fingers to make him laugh.</li>
            <li>She said it had a 100% success rate.  </li>
            <li>Used this for my 6 year old son who was sucking his thumb, mostly at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>He seemed to think this was pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, I&#x27;ve tried many solutions.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>We also did NOT use it when her incision was fresh, but waited until day 5 when the wound was crusting over (and probably itching) and the cat was obsessively attending to it.  </li>
            <li>just enough so that if she licked that area again, she&#x27;d get a light taste that might stop her from wanting to lick there any more.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s manageable and well worth it.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again, this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to arrange a brown-uniformed guy to drive my Mavala to my home in a brown van.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as useful for guys.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my 3 year old son, after he started biting his nails, but only for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I have a three years old girl that had a problem of sucking her tomb and we tried to many things  before and nothing didn&#x27;t work until now.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to apply it, my 5 year will not put his hands near his mouth just to avoid having to have it put on.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost</li>
            <li>We had tried everything else without success.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands throughout the day and find I need to use the product more frequently.  </li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>it has been well worth the effort</li>
            <li>well worth whatever they charge as it does the job.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is worth it for a baby to experience this in order to stop the habit.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a shot....</li>
            <li>This worked great for my 4 year old daughter who constantly sucked her figures.  </li>
            <li>I actually tested it on my own nail before putting it on either of them.</li>
            <li>warning, it gives me headaches so the initial couple weeks of use kind of sucked</li>
            <li>so it was actually quite amusing.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad it did work for my daughter as early as 2.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product worked great both for helping my 4 year old stop sucking her thumb as well as helping my husband cut back on his nail biting.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I rarely review anything.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at him...</li>
            <li>totally worth the money</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot).  </li>
            <li>We tried a thumb guard without sustainable success.</li>
            <li>We had tried everything for three years without success.</li>
            <li>I have been a professional nail biter since before I can remember, with more cuticle infections then I can count.</li>
            <li>She was rarely putting her fingers in her mouth anymore</li>
            <li>and she would just smile, look at me, and suck those fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it on the cuticle of my almost 3 yr old&#x27;s thumb who had been sucking his thumb more than ever.</li>
            <li>She reports almost immediate success.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The desire to bite my nails is completely gone :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard some people have success with this</li>
            <li>The only thing that was effective was an appliance by the dentist.</li>
            <li>Be careful as children that love to eat finger food will not be so pleased.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
            <li>That is obviously why it is so effective.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, and haven&#x27;t been able to stop biting my nails since before I can remember.  </li>
            <li>Success for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I can say, is this product is worth</li>
            <li>But it was worth kicking the habit.</li>
            <li>so I had a towel ready and could quickly cover her mouth and keep things clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product now for several years and found it quite effective although it remains a maintenence issue</li>
            <li>I do find that you have to use it more frequently for it to truly work.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now only if they had something this effective with potty training.</li>
            <li>While I still have months to go for my nails to regrow, I am taking one picture a day to document my success story with Mavala.</li>
            <li>especially not Thanksgiving Day biscuits everyone else would (have liked to) eat.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter hates the taste, but asks me to apply it daily since it does a great job of reminding her to stop biting.  </li>
            <li>Wow, way over the top.  </li>
            <li>Good Lord, this stuff is bitter, I don&#x27;t doubt this will work to quit nail biting.</li>
            <li>not be able to put fingers near mouth for any reason</li>
            <li>Mavala is a miracle worker and I am amazed at it success.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>However, as an elementary school teacher, I would NOT put this stuff on a child.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price of the bottle</li>
            <li>I will continue to apply for another week to make sure she&#x27;s weaned completely.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought we were never going to get this habit under control and in a short time it has stopped altogether!</li>
            <li>That said, it is worth it and for me it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to jeopardize calorie intake in a smile child.</li>
            <li>We will continue using this product for a while longer to ensure her success.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to jeopardize calorie intake in a smile child.</li>
            <li>We will continue using this product for a while longer to ensure her success.</li>
            <li>Nice to finally have some fingernails!!!</li>
            <li>But, again, worth it to stop the habit.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice size bottle and tastes gross, but doesn&#x27;t make her gag or throw up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a solution early on.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a cheaper option to get my son to stop sucking his thumb, figuring it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>It was worth a try</li>
            <li>Figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>But after reapplying, I&#x27;m back to letting them start to look nice</li>
            <li>Decided that they like the taste of the stuff, when it actually tastes I bit hazardous and toxic in my opinion (</li>
            <li>this stuff is really powerful.  </li>
            <li>A week worth of using this, we haven&#x27;t had any problems with her biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really useful to correct the nail-biting.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>but we use this as an effective threat when he comes back from school with bitten nails.</li>
            <li>It is worth the try though and lasts through hand washings.</li>
            <li>Being 30 years old now, having a habit most people broke when they were 12 has always been a source of shame and Mavala Stop ridded me of it.  </li>
            <li>She was blow drying the Mavala with the biggest smile on her face not knowing what was to follow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, in our case.</li>
            <li>One bottle was more than enough to coat my nails through the whole process and was more than effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered it, thinking it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter was a bit more of a challenge.</li>
            <li>I had to convince her that as a big girl, she should try to stop on her own and the &amp;#34;nasty polish&amp;#34; was just to remind her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a 13 year old who has been a nail biter most of her life.  </li>
            <li>So, six weeks in, I would say it is worth every dime</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I cannot emphasis enough how effective this polish is at stopping thumb-sucking or nail biting.  </li>
            <li>&quot; - funny, we let her keep her thumb for another year but just ordered a new bottle :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But really this is the thing to get when you&#x27;re ready!!!</li>
            <li>is still so young, what does it matter right now&amp;#34; until he started getting sores, calluses and cracking skin - then we knew it was a problem we better solve now.  </li>
            <li>It is so strong, you pretty much have to give up finger foods.</li>
            <li>I used it on my 20 month old and she stopped sucking her thumb the first day!!!</li>
            <li>you plan to use this for a very young child, I suggest scanning these reviews first for more opinions.  </li>
            <li>Would look great plain or over nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For her, she needs a fresh application right before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we had a glimmer of hope, until he consecutively tore right through his nails even with this stuff freshly applied.  </li>
            <li>Best ten dollars spent ever!</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s me completely honest, dumping slime of someone was just an opportunity for show producers to have a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; friendly wet t-shirt contest, but that&#x27;s not my point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very proud of myself, and wish other people cared to pat me on the back for something which seems so inconsequential to them.  </li>
            <li>Easily saves $300-$400 that one would normally pay for a habit appliance from the dentist or orthodontist.</li>
            <li>We are now at day 40 and no relapse, only had to put in on every other day and IT WORKED PERFECTLY!!!</li>
            <li>We have tried other similar pruducts but this one has worked best.</li>
            <li>first night she was super upset and after putting her thumb in her mouth she said her tummy hurt and spit in a bowl for quite a while.</li>
            <li>it washed off with water and my son figured that out pretty darn quick.</li>
            <li>He might forget and put his thumbs close to his mouth, but he remembered pretty quick that he didn&#x27;t want them in his mouth.</li>
            <li>The first night she forgot and put her thumb in her mouth quickly removing it.  </li>
            <li>I knew things were serious, when I caught him biting his TOENAILS because he really couldn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;good gnaw\\&quot; going on his fingers anymore!!  </li>
            <li>Another positive is that one application stays on for a full day</li>
            <li>My son wants to stop, so he was actually excited about putting it on.  </li>
            <li>With this stuff I have been averaging 8-9 good and 1 sacrificial, but  i think in due time i will get to 10,</li>
            <li>After 7 long years of trying to break my son this stuff sure worked!</li>
            <li>It is an awesome product that is small enough to fit until your purse and go anywhere, is always there when you need it.</li>
            <li>cause my daughter tried to move to other fingers so its good to paint all fingers.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product that I was hearing so much about.</li>
            <li>Ok, my daughter has been sucking her thumb steadily and she is 5 years old!!!</li>
            <li>Convenient and work fine - for my son 8 yrs old!!</li>
            <li>(My son also sucked his thumb but was able to quit on his own, and had already really cut down on the amount of thumb sucking he did by the time he was her age.)  </li>
            <li>Well, I guess that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>Now, here&#x27;s hoping the Dentist is right, and her teeth will correct on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She accidentally put her thumb in her mouth twice that day but took it out right away.</li>
            <li>I bit right through it.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I applied it to her fingers right away.</li>
            <li>and she would break the habit of finger nail chewing right away.</li>
            <li>meaning right before eating.  </li>
            <li>Right after that, he started sucking it again.  </li>
            <li>I bought Mavala, put it on her fingers and toes, and she goes right on biting, even 2 minutes after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>It works right from the get go.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am looking for a nail-biting-deterrent polish.  </li>
            <li>yeah, it works, and maybe if purchased for children who need a stronger deterrent, it&#x27;s the right product.</li>
            <li>and she stopped sucking them right</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m bound to notice it being right there.</li>
            <li>her eyebrows furrowed and the thumb popped right out of her mouth.</li>
            <li>I checked and he was right.</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;- you&#x27;re reading that right.</li>
            <li>It did not work right away</li>
            <li>Washed right off hours after application but didn&#x27;t detour my son at all from nail biting or nose</li>
            <li>Yes, you guessed right.</li>
            <li>If you look at the photo on the right</li>
            <li>(my son sucked right over it)</li>
            <li>I ordered it, it was shipped out right away.  </li>
            <li>My husband put it on him right before dinner time.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was the right time for me, but this product must receive some of the credit for my nails growing out and me stopping my entrenched habit.</li>
            <li>They are right</li>
            <li>(right when she turned 3).  </li>
            <li>I purchased it on Amazon right there in his office.  </li>
            <li>There were times I thought she was bound to suck the thumb print right off her skin.  </li>
            <li>yes that&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop was recommended to us by friends for their thumb-sucker and they were right.  </li>
            <li>got this product on Monday, right after Easter, and applied this product.</li>
            <li>Yes you read that right.</li>
            <li>This worked right away.</li>
            <li>right?).</li>
            <li>My daughter continued sucking her thumb, right through the appliance placed on the roof of</li>
            <li>and she stops right away.</li>
            <li>n spit and try it right away again.  </li>
            <li>I received it right on time.</li>
            <li>When he was 3 we tried it and he would just cry and lick right through it.  </li>
            <li>Right into their mouth.</li>
            <li>I applied it right to her thumb nail.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>considering I ordered it right before a weekend</li>
            <li>I put it on her thumb right away.</li>
            <li>This worked right from the start.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t start off right away or after one hand washing.</li>
            <li>Yes, you read that right...</li>
            <li>But, after that she would just chew right through like it wasn&#x27;t even there.</li>
            <li>I got it right on time and started using it.</li>
            <li>and now she can suck right through it.</li>
            <li>I was too scared to continue because they just suck it right off, and Keep right on sucking their fingers.</li>
            <li>I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away.</li>
            <li>and he took his fingers out right away.  </li>
            <li>But then she should pull them out right away and cry.  </li>
            <li>Son stopped RIGHT away sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>This product tastes very bitter (which is a good thing) but the taste doesn&#x27;t go away for hours.</li>
            <li>Both now have normal nails and were clear on how effective this was.  </li>
            <li>I actually am starting to have nice nails for the first time that I can remember.</li>
            <li>Santa brought this product to my son as an early gift with the promise of a big reward on christmas morning if he was successful and committed to changing this behavior.</li>
            <li>Two coats of polish will last for more than one full week before rubbing off.</li>
            <li>Also, since she is 4 and not younger, I think the Mavala was nice because no one else was aware of it</li>
            <li>I was exceptionally surprised and pleased to find that this works exactly as it claims to.</li>
            <li>I was content and completely ignored the fact that I need to re-apply another coat in two days until she started sucking her thumb again, so just make sure to be consistent just like the label states otherwise</li>
            <li>As someone who has been biting his nails for more than 33 years, this product has provided me with more success than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously.  </li>
            <li>We thought for sure this would work when we put it on the first night, because neither one wanted their fingers anywhere near their mouth.  </li>
            <li>This works great for my two little nail biters in the house!</li>
            <li>I still have a full bottle and am certain I will not need it.</li>
            <li>, the taste remained *very* strong for several hours.</li>
            <li>It wasnt a very easy task, daily things like cooking, cleaning, showers, you had to take them off and remember to put them on again.</li>
            <li>Again not the products fault, its doing exactly what it should be doing, but just something to be aware of in advance because it will sneak up on you!</li>
            <li>Started applying this right away, it works great for my 5 year old, as long as I apply it every day!</li>
            <li>it really worked right away!</li>
            <li>I ordered on amazon got in 2 days thanks to my special arrangement with amazon called prime membership.</li>
            <li>This item came highly recommended to me by other experienced parents.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product to get 4 year old to stop sucking her finger!!  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly gorgeous since there was so little to work with, but they filed everything smooth, got rid of the ragged cuticles, and applied a very neutral polish.</li>
            <li>This product is really bitter tasting, and is super effective for me.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s teeth quickly looked noticeably better and moved back in quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Find a pleasant game  or activity the child likes the most to occupy him or her to pass this time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is SUPER strong, and if not carefully used can be transferred to food when eating!</li>
            <li>He has not bitten them once since then, and even he is proud and gets a big smile when I show him he has white on his nails now.  </li>
            <li>I am so proud of her, and I am a firm believer in Mavala Stop!  </li>
            <li>At 2.5 years old the roof of his mouth was becoming deformed and two of his teeth were not coming in.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t really say if the accident he claims was true or he bit his nails at school, but either way I can&#x27;t continue to give this to him if it&#x27;s going to upset his stomach each time.</li>
            <li>I could never mentally make myself stop for more than a couple of days...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how long it stays on my nails.</li>
            <li>Doctors always dismissed my concerns, but the habit only became more and more fixed.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product for a week and after that first day, I have rarely put my fingers to my mouth as I don&#x27;t want to taste that taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for a week and after that first day, I have rarely put my fingers to my mouth as I don&#x27;t want to taste that taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>We tried hot salsa, jalapeno juice, rubbing a fresh garlic clove on her thumb, and another OTC product called THUM.  </li>
            <li>This worked great for us on our 4 year old son, who sucks his thumb mostly at night.  </li>
            <li>cuz my nails are long and nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I bought Mavala thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve had my nail biting habit as long as I can remember (30+ years).</li>
            <li>At first I tried to have my boyfriend and other friends just stop me when they saw me, but they can&#x27;t watch me all the time, and I just got really good at waiting for them to stop looking.</li>
            <li>After the first day we noticed our son trying to suck other fingers when the thumbs didn&#x27;t taste good. ...  </li>
            <li>Working on breaking this life long habit on my own.</li>
            <li>My wife is gorgeous but has chewed her nails down to nubs since we&#x27;ve dated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly makes me a lot more conscious of how often I bite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, we did have to use more on the knuckle of his thumb as well as his nail because he would still suck his thumb occasionally, but the added mavala stop put an end to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>In fact, to see my nails for the first time in 15 years and actually growing and actually looking healthy like I can do something is amazing.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind hard to stay on top of.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for another two weeks to where my nails will be nice and LONG!  </li>
            <li>This product is the best I have come accross, although I had to apply it daily, not every other day!!  </li>
            <li>Reapplying first thing in the morning, and possibly right before bed, should be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pure motivation to break the habit!</li>
            <li>This certainly does it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very bitter and lasts a couple of days before needing re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re simply amazed how effective Mavala Stop is and give it an enthusiastic \\&quot;thumbs up!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter finally has good looking nails again.</li>
            <li>An easy move, just paint the thumbnail once a week with the clear polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mavala Stop is easy to use: paint on thumb as you would nail polish, dries clear within seconds.</li>
            <li>Luckily she didn&#x27;t eat much finger foods because it does linger.  </li>
            <li>, it sounded far too easy.</li>
            <li>After few more reminders and encouragements, she was able to forget about thumb sucking within a week.</li>
            <li>Be careful of eating finger foods,  the bitter and will ruin the best foods.  </li>
            <li>This has made me far more capable in terms of trying to take these OCD habits by the horns and work them out.</li>
            <li>My dentist strongly recommended this to me for my daughter at about 4-5 years old-</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, my 6 year old son has been sucking his thumb since he was 3 months old.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve had more success than she has but only because I know when it needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old son is doing much better with biting his nails and it&#x27;s all thanks to Mavala..</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been reapplying every few days just to be sure she doesn&#x27;t start up again, but our results have been fantastic!</li>
            <li>A quick swipe on the whole nail for these two kids did the trick.  </li>
            <li>So far a huge success.</li>
            <li>It might be a tad bit strong for young children.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old  grandson had a fair amount of upheaval in his short life.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time as well, and it dries in minutes and is clear, so men (like me) can use it and not be worried :p</li>
            <li>My 3 year old stopped thumb sucking very quickly.</li>
            <li>Does the job and is effective, however it was unexpected to find it looks like glossy, clear fingernail polish when applied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There were a few downsides to applying polish to my nails, the most notable being the shine and smell of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  and read great things about this product and have tried many others, which have failed.</li>
            <li>My daughter did not love this option but it worked very effectively.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this product is that the taste of it is so overwhelming, even if you consciously want to bite your nails, the effects of the product are not worth the satisfaction of biting.</li>
            <li>My little girl is 7 years old and still loved that thumb!  </li>
            <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t try to stop a child from sucking their thumb but his thumb sucking was causing significant speech and dental problems.  </li>
            <li>I used Mavala Stop on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s thumb and she finally quit sucking her thumb for good since the first application.  </li>
            <li>The reason it didn&#x27;t completely work is it was so strong when you first put it on, you can taste it on everything you eat (finger foods).  </li>
            <li>We got the product very quickly, and so far it has really helped!</li>
            <li>The delivery was very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li>Very much like nail polish, painted it over the entirety of her thumb.</li>
            <li>It also arrived in a timely manner, which I very much appreciate.</li>
            <li>I used it daily for a week and now 3 weeks later I have nails that are very nice looking.  </li>
            <li>I still put the Mavala on ever other day or so (after baths) because the dentist said it takes a good six months to know that you have really kicked the habit because stress, holidays, etc can cause relapse</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews regarding this product and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>We laughed a little because he would think about putting his thumb in his mouth but then shake his head and scream at his thumb.</li>
            <li>liquid is very potent so make sure to follow the directions and only use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would caution people that it is strong so less is more.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old had a HUGE problem sucking her index finger.</li>
            <li>Really not knowing what I would find I searched nail bitting on Amazon and found this product and the reviews were amazing</li>
            <li>It is, quite simply, the most vile flavor I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth before.  </li>
            <li>The first is that it relies upon user compliance with the application regimen.  </li>
            <li>The first is that it relies upon user compliance with the application regimen.  </li>
            <li>This works very well!  </li>
            <li>From the first time i put some mavala stop on her paci, she spit it out and didnt want it again.  </li>
            <li>She tried one more time later that day but smae reaction.  </li>
            <li>It worked the first day as my son was into trying to stop sucking his fingers</li>
            <li>In the first week, she had a day or two that she would say she forgot and put here finger in her mouth, but the Mavala reminded her to stop...</li>
            <li>and we went through the chart 2 times ( double stars on each block) just to be sure there was no bcaksliding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try reminding them they are big boy or girl and do not need their thumb, rewarding them with a sticker and take away the sticker when they do suck thier thumb, or time out.</li>
            <li>that i start to become aware whenever i try to bite it.</li>
            <li>I love that it is applied ONLY ONCE every two days.</li>
            <li>My Daughter hasn&#x27;t even tried to suck her thumb after the first day.</li>
            <li>I bought the Mavala Stop, and at first my son fought me on using it.</li>
            <li>I encouraged only fork and spoon use for the week we were using it the most.  </li>
            <li>After the first week, he had a couple relapses, and we just told him to tell us if he was getting the urge to bite</li>
            <li>I had maybe 6-10 instances where I tried to bite my nails for the first 1-4 days.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review more than a year after buying the product and she has never gone back.  </li>
            <li>She was whinning the first day a couple of times, thne</li>
            <li>You have to apply it pretty consistently ever 2-3 days because it does wash</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say, unless you&#x27;re really ready for them to stop sucking their thumb then don&#x27;t try it!</li>
            <li>He stopped biting his nails after the first time we used it.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product on line and thought we would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time she put her hands in her mouth</li>
            <li>first I was a bit hesitant bec.</li>
            <li>It really, really works!</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is Ethyl Acetate, and another ingredient is Isopropyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li>When I first tried Mavala Stop on her</li>
            <li>so she was aware of what I was doing.</li>
            <li>I made her aware of how it would taste.  </li>
            <li>of the next week she had figured out a way to suck her thumb without it touching her tongue.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I was skeptic at first, but with this it took just 1 week for my 5-year-old to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The first time we used Mavala Stop</li>
            <li>This product was inexpensive (compared to thumb guards) and seemed to work from the first application.  </li>
            <li>and I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks now since I first started putting this on, and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails</li>
            <li>I tried everything from garlic, to hot sauce, rubbing aloe vera plant on thumb, to the THUM nail polish (sold at drug stores)</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t want to quit and cried the first night with the Mavala on.</li>
            <li>If you need to take it off use nail polish remover but its pretty stubborn</li>
            <li>My husband and I both painted it on our thumbs first</li>
            <li>He said he didn&#x27;t think it would work and didn&#x27;t want to use it again because of the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; nail polish look ;)</li>
            <li>I thought it was really important that my 3 year old son stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is a useful tool when the child is ready.</li>
            <li>I tried Thum first</li>
            <li>At first, she didn&#x27;t want it, but then she said she wanted to stop sucking her thumb and wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the easiest night, but the next day and night things were so much better.  </li>
            <li>Finally, about a year ago, I bought this product, and I was finally able to stop.  </li>
            <li>Also, at the first sign of relapse, use the polish again.</li>
            <li>I was sometimes able to quit for a couple of weeks, but I always feel back into the habit.</li>
            <li>He has really opened up without that thumb in his mouth all the time!  </li>
            <li>He chats constantly and seems to enjoy his newfound thumb-freedom!  </li>
            <li>but the first time she put her thumb in her mouth she started to gag</li>
            <li>It actually made him suck his thumb more because it made him focused on it.</li>
            <li>He is actually doing better with this approach.</li>
            <li>Each of them got it in their mouth a couple of times the first day.</li>
            <li>After that first day she did not suck her thumb again.</li>
            <li>I do think you have to be consistent about putting it on their fingers.</li>
            <li>My five year old has stopped sucking his thumb completely and now we are working on all his nails and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>they are gonna start to taste funny.</li>
            <li>She would bite her nails and say mommy my nails taste funny and run to get her drink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the first time I applied the stuff to his thumb, he&#x27;s never sucked it again.</li>
            <li>effective to stop nail biting as it leaves bitter taste.</li>
            <li>Also for the first week we had a cup of kool-aid for her to drink if she did taste it.</li>
            <li>just make her aware of sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>This was the first remedy</li>
            <li>He isn&#x27;t aware of even doing it.</li>
            <li>Mavala has made him aware when he is sticking his tongue upward.</li>
            <li>Mavala has made him aware when he is sticking his tongue upward.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>My daughter wouldn&#x27;t dare to bite her nails again after the first application.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have counted over five kids whose parents have tried it with an absolute 100% success rate</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazingly, this stuff works and works exactly the way it is described.</li>
            <li>I would put my fingers to my mouth without thinking about it when I was stressed for the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li>It really work if you stick to it!</li>
            <li>i have nails for the first time and its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He may, probably, needs to be hypnotized to stop chewing his big headed fingers...  :)</li>
            <li>and we have tried many different methods to stop her habit.</li>
            <li>She stop sucking from the first day and until now.</li>
            <li>Well on the first day it worked wonders, she wouldn&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li>The whole painting your nails thing is worth it though.  </li>
            <li>I am applying it consistently for around 90 days because that is the amount of time I have heard that is required for breaking habits.</li>
            <li>It will surely be the last time they dine with YOU.</li>
            <li>at first they said no cuz nothing worked before but</li>
            <li>Thumb&amp;#34; thumb guard first</li>
            <li>Mavala was recommended by a friend and we were willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>We applied it for 2 weeks, but my child did not suck her thumb after the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 20 years and this product really helps!</li>
            <li>After the first couple of nights.  </li>
            <li>Put it on her thumb first thing in the morning and by bed time she was done and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb</li>
            <li>It worked with the first use.  </li>
            <li>I used this product to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb and after the first use, she has never sucked her thumb since.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to apply more liberally next time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and it worked the first night.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Mavala Stop on Amazon and the first time I applied it</li>
            <li>It was a challenge the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Pretty embarrassing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three-tenths of an ounce doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but it&#x27;s more than enough to cure everyone in your extended family, as well as everyone on your block for that matter.</li>
            <li>and we tried many different behavior modifications.  </li>
            <li>and HE decided he was ready to stop, the product cinched the deal!  </li>
            <li>I put it on Wednesday afternoon for the first time.</li>
            <li>Long-time Amazon buyer, first Amazon review!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For sure put it on daily or every 2 days.</li>
            <li>He whined the first 2 days about it</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really and truly works!</li>
            <li>Had this issue for many years starting from the age of three.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>After the first night she has not even attempted to stick her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li>On day 3 of my 2.5 year old being thumb sucking free.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the CVS product that looks similar.</li>
            <li>won the first bday gift from me.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: no need to apply, the liquid&#x27;s effect still continued.</li>
            <li>First four days she would wake up or start to go to sleep with the taste in her mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now consciously aware of when i put my fingers in my mouth</li>
            <li>My husband and I cannot believe how fast this product worked for our child!</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop was recommended by my sister-in-law and it worked the first night!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m optimistic that we can stop using it altogether pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I first did it in his sleep</li>
            <li>It was interesting to see him go to stick his fingers in his mouth out of habit, stop, look at them and say \\&quot;Gross</li>
            <li>I know first hand the difficulties</li>
            <li>I know first hand the difficulties</li>
            <li>Even the first night, the taste woke the girls up</li>
            <li>I put it on while she was sleeping and the first time she tried to put her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li>It worked for the first two weeks but after that she got used to the taste.</li>
            <li>Really like how it applies like a polish and stays on for a couple of days!</li>
            <li>really does stay on!).</li>
            <li>On first night she tried to suck her fingers</li>
            <li>The first time she</li>
            <li>I wish I had done this first, it would have saved alot of tears and money.  </li>
            <li>You have to stay consistent and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a taste first and it reminded me of what finger nail polish would taste like</li>
            <li>The first night, he stuck his fingers in his mouth and cried for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what we needed to jump start</li>
            <li>At first this product worked well</li>
            <li>so she went back to thumb-sucking and is now a more obsessive thumb-sucker then before we used the product.</li>
            <li>I tried the polish on my thumbnail first, just to test it.</li>
            <li>I would also paint my nails pretty colors, get acrylics, etc..</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>He attempted to put his thumb in his mouth a couple of times the first day we applied the product.</li>
            <li>Its been ten days, we will continue with the product for couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>This stuff absolutely works!</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to work.</li>
            <li>;-)ps from EATING anything at all that requires using your fingers to assemble or eat it</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Do make sure you don&#x27;t get any on your fingers while applying and use only the tiniest bit bc</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>first off, i had been biting my nails for 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li>First i wanted to see what it tasted like</li>
            <li>Before we got married we tried this product to see if he would stop and let his nails grow out for all the pictures and what not, it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am sure she will never go back to that habit.</li>
            <li>I grew my nails out for the first time I can remember.</li>
            <li>Our first attempt was the night shirt with the built in gloves.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t even acted like he wants to suck his thumb!</li>
            <li>First opinion of this product is...smells like nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>After the first week, my 7-year was still sucking his thumb and being stubborn.  </li>
            <li>The first day I put it on my daughter</li>
            <li>I prepared her for Mavala first.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I thought until she brought me the bottle an hour later and wanted more put on her fingers</li>
            <li>stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Our orthodontist told us to try this first before we had a habit device put in our daughters mouth.</li>
            <li>Stop a try first</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time he sucked his thumb with this product</li>
            <li>The first time we applied the \\&quot;solution\\&quot; it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>He is not complaining about the taste on his food, too much, and he is adjusting well!</li>
            <li>promising!</li>
            <li>The price is worth it as it works very well.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it as it works very well.</li>
            <li>To save money, we decided to try Mavala Stop first.  </li>
            <li>We tried many different ways and started to loss hope until we found this product.</li>
            <li>The first time we put it on her fingers, she did not even want to smell them, let alone sucking them.</li>
            <li>works pretty well.</li>
            <li>He objected and cried, and the first day he didn&#x27;t bite his fingernails.</li>
            <li>Part of the reason I&#x27;m finally able to tackle this is that I&#x27;m not only using this product to deter me</li>
            <li>I use it almost every day - and become rather aware when the taste is fading and make note to keep coating it on.</li>
            <li>I was at first going to purchase a product called \\&quot;thumb guard\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The first day I put the MAVALA stop on his thumbs and fingers.  </li>
            <li>cons to be aware of:&lt;br</li>
            <li>First day</li>
            <li>multiple times :)</li>
            <li>This product worked for the first week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this exactly 3 times since I first bit into my nails, and regretted it immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (call me weak-willed, but when I first bit them I needed to get rid of that taste</li>
            <li>It worked the first two days</li>
            <li>The first time she got a taste of it, she was like..\\&quot;its</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a life-long nail chewer, a nervous habit I&#x27;ve tried to stop many times over the last fifty years.  </li>
            <li>Within a day my son had stopped sucking his thumb; however, you should also be aware that it did make him vomit twice.  </li>
            <li>It worked the first day.</li>
            <li>Super-fast shipping too - thanks!</li>
            <li>But she really has no desire to suck her thumb!  </li>
            <li>To fix that make sure you regularly reapply.</li>
            <li>First time I applied it and she tasted it, she threw her thumb out</li>
            <li>I tried it myself first</li>
            <li>so first of all you must have the resolve to stop.</li>
            <li>try applying it earlier in the day, before you go to work/school/places where you tend to bite your nails the most.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, my mom tried it and was trying everything to get the taste out of her mouth.</li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review</li>
            <li>About four finger nails had been growing pretty well</li>
            <li>My daughter stopped sucking her thumb after the first application.</li>
            <li>I remember the first bottle I ever bought</li>
            <li>At first, we put mittens on him at night, but now he doesn&#x27;t even need that.</li>
            <li>she had to eat sandwiches with a fork ;)</li>
            <li>The first night that she wore it she woke me up and said every time she falls asleep, she puts her thumb in her mouth and the taste wakes her up.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff has me seeing the whites of my nails for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I try it myself first</li>
            <li>The first time my son used it, he did throw up, but it worked to stop his thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, I never saw her suck her thumb again!  </li>
            <li>I said &#x27;sure&#x27; without making a big deal of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as it says it does.  </li>
            <li>WORKED FAST!</li>
            <li>After the first application, she No longer sucked her thumb.</li>
            <li>The first Mavala we had gotten from the dentist</li>
            <li>It works in the first week.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product not quiet sure it would work.</li>
            <li>He did not like the taste at all but the first week I had caught him sucking his thumb at night (with the stuff).</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>My daughter started sucking her thumb in our first sonogram picture and has not stopped since</li>
            <li>We had been working on &amp;#34;reminding&amp;#34; (over and over and over again), but once he lost his first baby tooth, we knew it was time to step in to break the habit.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>works well and will make you aware of how often your fingers go in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I only paint more on about every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I consistently used it for about 2 months..</li>
            <li>we started using the product on February 10th in the first couple days</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t spicy hot</li>
            <li>The first time she picked her lips</li>
            <li>the taste did last more than a day on your skin.  </li>
            <li>We tried the finger guard first, I had the wrist wrap</li>
            <li>The most obvious tip I can offer is to eat finger foods with a fork.</li>
            <li>Really?!</li>
            <li>means you now fully realize when your doing it which was the first step of the battle.  </li>
            <li>I even got to paint them pretty for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>She likes my pretty nails.</li>
            <li>means you now fully realize when your doing it which was the first step of the battle.  </li>
            <li>I even got to paint them pretty for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>my son stopped sucking his thumb after first use after day one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 now and finally was able to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>Being the parent I am I tried it first on my nail</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mavala has done a stellar job of making me stop biting my nail.</li>
            <li>(For us it is more than enough to deter my daughter)     </li>
            <li>I wished that I would have read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb in two weeks since I first used the product</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend that parents give it a try because there is a 50/50 chance that it will work from my experience.:)</li>
            <li>I HAD a 17-month-old thumbsucker who was so attached to her thumb that her top teeth were starting to buck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Frustrated, I finally remembered we had an almost-full bottle of Mavala Stop and wondered if it would be safe to use on a cat.  </li>
            <li>I checked every ingredient first to ensure there was nothing that could be toxic to kitty (there wasn&#x27;t) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Within a week of using this I&#x27;m proud to say she no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li>The first night I put it on her nails was the end of her thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li>Looked like it worked during the first 2 days</li>
            <li>You have to be vigilant about applying it consistently</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few months and surprisingly, his baby teeth looks straight!</li>
            <li>The bottle was most likely sealed but not the box.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what he needed because nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>Now almost a month later I don&#x27;t even have to apply any more</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put it only on your nails and not on the tip of your fingers also or else</li>
            <li>/&gt;First we tried the generic &amp;#34;no more thumbs&amp;#34; type from CVS.</li>
            <li>So it does exactly what I&#x27;d hoped it would ....</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have virtually zero desire to bite, and haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since the first week of January.</li>
            <li>After the first shock when she put her thumb in her mouth, she only did it out of habit 2-3 more times.  </li>
            <li>kind of a bitter &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; taste.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells exactly like finger nail polish and it is applied just like finger nail polish.</li>
            <li>It worked the first day.  </li>
            <li>For the first time ever I get to trim my kids nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We put it on at night with a &amp;#34;thumb sucker&amp;#34; the first week</li>
            <li>I applied it and at first she didn&#x27;t like the taste.  </li>
            <li>We talked about the importance of stopping the thumb sucking and he was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I put the Mavala on his thumb and the first time he tried sucking his thumb he realized the consequences.  </li>
            <li>I did a 3rd application just to be sure</li>
            <li>and it tastes like battery acid, which is exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Four weeks ago I bought this stuff and applied the first coat.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>i no longer bite my nails its pretty SWAGGED OUT</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>Make sure you only put it on the nail or you food will taste like it.</li>
            <li>Worked almost the first night (after one night of him tasting it and waking up screaming when he realize he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb again).</li>
            <li>First week I put it on every night.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my nail first</li>
            <li>Works pretty well except whatever food you touch</li>
            <li>I will say it did cause her to gag and throw up the first 3-4 times she tried it.  </li>
            <li>It has a heinous chemical taste, which is exactly what it should have.</li>
            <li>and you had to buy additional straps to keep the covers on if you needed more than what was sent initially.  </li>
            <li>I covered just the top third of the nail.  </li>
            <li>Worked for about the first minute</li>
            <li>If you still want to try this product, test it out on yourself first.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 4 almost 5 and up until her first dentist appointment (about a month ago)</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and if it didn&#x27;t work, I was willing to take it as a loss.  </li>
            <li>Now for the first time I am growing nails.  </li>
            <li>First night we put it on</li>
            <li>Finally ordered this, and we are so glad.</li>
            <li>And yes, it can get on food that she touches, but she seems to cope with that pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been nail-biting since the first grade, and now I&#x27;m in college....</li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>Ok so I brought this for one of my 4 y-old twin boy who eats his finger and toes nail &#x27;till the skin is red and raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>got it 2 weeks now, the first time I painted his finger and toes nails with it (which he let me do with no wiggling) he smelled it and says &#x27;yakky&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Works for like first 2 try and after that it has no affects on the child.</li>
            <li>I was interested in some of the gadgets a child wears on the thumb, but thought I&#x27;d give this cheaper product a try first.  </li>
            <li>I put it on every night before bed for the first week and</li>
            <li>I first started using this product when my daughter was two and had a nail chewing problem.</li>
            <li>The first week I had to keep brushing my teeth to get the taste out</li>
            <li>Ever since the first day I put it on my nails</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on</li>
            <li>My daughter has tried many products to stop biting her nails in addition to various rewards systems.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>WIth Mavala she instantly was able to break the thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li>We put the product on for the first time and she put her thumb in her mouth a couple of times and that&#x27;s all it took.</li>
            <li>My daughter woke up couple times the first two nights and we gave her water to wash her mouth.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I put it on and the first time I started biting ny nails</li>
            <li>and I would immediately become aware of what I was doing and stop.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well in stopping my daughter&#x27;s thumbsucking!</li>
            <li>thanks I like it!)  </li>
            <li>Worked the first day, after that it washes off and finger sucking starts again.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>First night I painted his thumb nail, he attempted 3 times to suck..</li>
            <li>This product really WORKS!</li>
            <li>without getting a bit of that bitter taste, which is kind of unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked the first day.</li>
            <li>I once tried Tabasco on my first kid&#x27;s thumbs to get him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t reached that time period yet, but are hopeful that once they do the product will not be necessary any more.  </li>
            <li>, she made a face and continued sucking her fingers, but two days later I applied to finger nails and around the top of her finger tips</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>First day it was about every 20 minutes he ran for the bathroom to rinse out his mouth...</li>
            <li>Really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First thing we tried was \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; bought at drugstore...</li>
            <li>It might be a better product for a younger child who doesn&#x27;t think to rub it off.</li>
            <li>It really worked!  </li>
            <li>I kept applying it for 3-4 days just to make sure that the habit doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>She put her thumb in her mouth one time after the first application, and never again.</li>
            <li>Yup , he gagged first time he sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li>I lie to you not, after the first application, he immediately stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>When he first got it he put his thumb in his mouth and then immediately ran to the bathroom, started rinsing his mouth with water, then started brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first time she tasted it, she learned her lesson.</li>
            <li>It worked at first, and then he didn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>(most definitely the problem).</li>
            <li>We first tried Thum and he just sucked his fingers anyways.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even had to reapply it after the first week.</li>
            <li>My first order for this was in July 2014 and</li>
            <li>the first 2 months</li>
            <li>I have been a chronic meal butter for my entire life, and have managed stop many times for months at a time.</li>
            <li>We first applied before nap time, both thumbs.</li>
            <li>Same at night probably more complaining.  </li>
            <li>Next day was better with some complaining.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t blame the seller for us either losing it or, more likely, my daughter disposing of it.</li>
            <li>This works for me every time, but you have to be willing to quit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;3 hours after the first application, she was eating some Cheetos and stuck a finger in her mouth to get the cheese off.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>He plays more and is actually talking better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first night I tried it, I guess I stirred while I was sleeping and bit my thumbnail or something (that&#x27;s a thing,</li>
            <li>The product broke him of his habit of wanting to bite by making him aware of the times he put his fingers to his mouth.</li>
            <li>However it got me a couple times that first day when I licked my fingers while preparing dinner, so becareful and encourge the use of silverware while using.</li>
            <li>HAHA!</li>
            <li>It broke her of the habit so fast, one taste and that was it!</li>
            <li>In the first nights he was awaking every time he put the thumb in the mouth complaining the taste.</li>
            <li>After an hour or so, she came to me telling me her tongue felt funny.</li>
            <li>If she made it for one whole week, without sucking her thumb, she would get to pick out a toy!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>I have rated this a five star because it is my first day</li>
            <li>We tried this and within the first week, it had dramatically stopped.</li>
            <li>From the first night we put the product on her thumb</li>
            <li>(I knew people who had had success with each one), and Mavala was much cheaper</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it first.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this!!</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s stopped her somewhat, and she is aware that when I put it on she shouldn&#x27;t put her thumbs in her mouth</li>
            <li>She is a nail and skin biter and now after 3 weeks she is feeling great about her hands we apply at least 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>At first it did work at helping my daughter stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>Need to be consistent.</li>
            <li>I tried everything and when I finally came across this Mavala Stop, it was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I have tried every nail biting polish, hot sauce, etc on the market and STILL bit my nails.</li>
            <li>Now he&#x27;s losing his first tooth, the dentist told him he should stop too.</li>
            <li>This product is working very well!  </li>
            <li>And I think emotionally it was better for her.</li>
            <li>They both stopped their habits within 2-3 days and now, I&#x27;m applying it for a second week, just making sure it sticks.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop really works!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to use it on my daughter until I had tested/tasted it first.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well, the problem is you can&#x27;t eat ANYTHING with your hands.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have tried this first, but I thought it was too pricey.  </li>
            <li>, It worked in the first try.</li>
            <li>bought this for my son the first 3 weeks he was bitting his nail but after that the taste was nothing to him</li>
            <li>No matter how many times a day I paint her fingers now they are back to being in there all the time.  </li>
            <li>because my daughters stopped sucking their thumbs after the first application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over 2 months since we first used it</li>
            <li>It really worked!</li>
            <li>I put this on for the first time about 5 days ago</li>
            <li>She told me it tasted funny</li>
            <li>It worked the first time he tried to suck on them after the product was applied.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what we needed to get our kids over the hurdle.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different ways to stop, including hypnosis.  </li>
            <li>Worked for the first week but no longer works.  </li>
            <li>Overall I love it!&lt;br /&gt;-bree</li>
            <li>My husband and I were absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been married to my husband for over 20 years and he has always chewed his nails.  </li>
            <li>I may resort to tabasco sauce or something more drastic because my kid obviously doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>One thing you should be aware of is that after you apply this, if the child eats finger foods they could get some of the taste co-mingling with the food.  </li>
            <li>I gave some of it to a friend, and her daughter was also able to stop over a very short period of time.</li>
            <li>the first time we used Mavala and that was the end of it.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than braces!</li>
            <li>; as we called it worked so fast!  </li>
            <li>Helps with exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting off my fingernails for several decades now, and never been able to kick the habit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It traumatized him the first night.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this.  :)</li>
            <li>Better than alternative of future dental problems.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works!</li>
            <li>we first put it on, she seemed to accidentally get it on everything - her food, her face, her lips - and</li>
            <li>The first time he forgot it was on, and his thumb went in-</li>
            <li>My 2 year stopped sucking her thumbs after applying it the first time.  </li>
            <li>The first day I saw her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li>This helps minimize accidently mis-haps yet is still very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND CONTINUING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS TO GET A LASTING CESSATION.</li>
            <li>I was even able to clip his nails last night.  </li>
            <li>he never asked why his thumb had a funny taste.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I kept it was because I plan on having more kids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve caught several colds over the years because of all the germs I transferred to my mouth from my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used nail clippers on my fingernails for the first time ever today.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe it worked so well for our son, but I&#x27;m glad it was so simple.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s VERY shiny with mirror-like gloss!</li>
            <li>I ended up soaking in hot water, and that did the trick.</li>
            <li>But this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I eventually ordered another bottle and am trying to be consistent with it</li>
            <li>first tried the Thum brand liquid polish that tastes like hot peppers.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>We tried absolutely everything for my daughter&#x27;s thumb-sucking habit and nothing worked...until Mavala!  </li>
            <li>He vomited the first time he placed his thumb in his mouth, and didn&#x27;t try again until the morning when, out of habit, he did it again.</li>
            <li>fingers were in constant pain because I never let the nails grow to a healthy length.</li>
            <li>Now we are using band aids around top of her thumbs &amp; only at night.</li>
            <li>She stopped sucking her thumb on the first day and hasn&#x27;t done it for a month now.</li>
            <li>It worked the first time I applied, but he didn&#x27;t nap that day</li>
            <li>The next day we painted her nails all pretty again and used the Mavala Stop as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it would last more than two days, though.</li>
            <li>In my experience, we just need to be consistent and use it nightly.</li>
            <li>It worked first time we put it on.</li>
            <li>I tried everything OTC and even hot sauces</li>
            <li>Make sure you only put in on the nails.  </li>
            <li>he has stopped biting his nails after the first use.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, she woke up crying, saying her thumb didn&#x27;t taste good, almost threw up...</li>
            <li>The first night she was up a couple times to get a drink to take the taste away.  </li>
            <li>(Try it out on yourself first...</li>
            <li>The first time I put my fingernail in my mouth after I did this I immediately used another fingernail to try and scratch the taste off of my tongue.</li>
            <li>note of warning, if you like to lick your fingers after eating popcorn or chips, you will not be able to for the entire duration of this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>The first time she put her finger in her mouth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m biting my nails until I&#x27;ve already taken the first bite, then I can&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth for an hour.</li>
            <li>Only had to do it a couple more times.</li>
            <li>Its a great deterrent for my thumb sucker.</li>
            <li>The first time we used this on my daughter, it was 2 weeks of no thumb sucking before it started to wear off and had to be reapplied.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>her thumb nail the first night.  </li>
            <li>My daughter just went to her first dental appointment and the doctor advised she stop sucking hey thumb immediately.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son first off</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on his thumbs was before his nap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first thing we noticed about the product we received was that it looked and smelled like acetone or nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to do - keep thumbs and fingers out of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>but she willingly lets us put on her \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; every night after bath.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first Amazon review I have ever written as I would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>is to be aware with finger foods or what your nails brush up</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to.  </li>
            <li>I reapplied it 3 days later when he was sleeping so he wouldn&#x27;t know and might do it one more time</li>
            <li>The ingredients in Mavala are most likely harmful to children.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and it ended up being so simple!</li>
            <li>I actually thought it was the cutest thing to see, just adorable..</li>
            <li>first tried just putting a band aid on it-</li>
            <li>the first 3 applications-spaced putting it on every 2 days-</li>
            <li>first time I put it on, I told him why I put it on and that it tastes</li>
            <li>Since any taste of that flavor pretty much transfers if they are eating a finger food!</li>
            <li>She lapsed into putting the finger in her mouth a couple more times over the next couple of days.</li>
            <li>I couldnt believe she stop sucking her finger the first day of the application.</li>
            <li>I was heartened by the reviews, which hilariously ranged from 0 to 5 stars for the exact same reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Entire batches of meals were ruined by merely touching their component ingredients.</li>
            <li>The urge to rip them to shreds with my teeth has passed, though I am confident that if it should return, I can simply reapply this product and defeat this foul habit.</li>
            <li>Put it on again 2 nights after the first night.</li>
            <li>i tried so many different items off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re back for more.</li>
            <li>i paint her nails with this, lets say she doesn&#x27;t think it is as funny as I do.</li>
            <li>I did consider doing this with my six year old if she threw a fit during the re-appication process.  </li>
            <li>I did consider doing this with my six year old if she threw a fit during the re-appication process.  </li>
            <li>The product works better than what we found in our local stores.</li>
            <li>The key is to make sure that you do not reach that point.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I am giving this product five stars because it DEFINITELY works!</li>
            <li>After the first application she realized that there was no way to get it off.</li>
            <li>I am able to eat burgers and french fries without getting the taste in my mouth at all.</li>
            <li>We first bought the product, Thum, and that did nothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried painting my nails, thinking if they look pretty, I won&#x27;t bite them, and that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The last 6 months while sucking her thumb, she would pick at the top of her nose and face causing scarring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first week I would would bite but stop because of the taste reminding me not to.</li>
            <li>I did reapply every 2 days for the first 10 days.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen her put her thumb in her mouth since the first day</li>
            <li>So lets hope this last and the thumb sucking ends :)</li>
            <li>The first day I painted it on, my son tried to suck his thumb...</li>
            <li>The first night I put this on her thumbs</li>
            <li>I am still pretty amazed.</li>
            <li>I used Mavala Stop on her and the first couple times she tried sucking her thumb</li>
            <li>biting his nails from the first application.</li>
            <li>but it really it working!</li>
            <li>My purchase of this item was fulfilled by Safe Sellers and I received a completely different product.</li>
            <li>The first day we covered the thumb and fingers nails with the solution.</li>
            <li>We would put this in the day and remove it in the night for the first 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>I have chewed mine for 27 years and for the first time in my life, I have nails.</li>
            <li>I stopped biting my nails after a couple of days;)</li>
            <li>I tried it and it worked after the first application.</li>
            <li>I took the polish off first the first time in about 2 weeks yesterday</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would use it on kids without trying it on myself first.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it to my daughter&#x27;s nails she gagged a bit and spit rightaway when she tried to suck her thumbs,  </li>
            <li>I admit, when I first noticed him sucking it again, I licked his thumbnail and ICK</li>
            <li>This is not my first try with this sort of theory.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did go through a four-day period after my first week using the product where I didn&#x27;t apply it at all and promptly bit all my nails once the polish wore off.</li>
            <li>Once I put this on his nails for the first time, he about gagged when he bit his nails.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, without realizing it I had gotten some on my own hand and</li>
            <li>I applied this as directed and the first time my son put his fingers in his mouth he started to vomit.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I now have pretty nails, so thank you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li>I gave my son a choice between using this or soaking his fingers in hot sauce.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Even though we&#x27;ve continued putting it on her nails for about two weeks, after the first time she tasted it, she never again put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li>Remember the first day, the child may be aggravated for not doing the habit.</li>
            <li>Obviously this tactic prob won&#x27;t work for boys. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I have been nail biting for a decade and this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>she is now growing nails out for the first time.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give anything a try to get her to stop.  </li>
            <li>But from the first application I knew this stuff was the ticket.</li>
            <li>But when it is applied it absolutely does its purpose!  </li>
            <li>Verbal warnings, hot sauce, nothing else worked.</li>
            <li>He DID mind me putting hot sauce on his hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>applied it first day</li>
            <li>and really works!</li>
            <li>and I kissed the top of her head shortly thereafter- and got a dose of the bitterness!</li>
            <li>in hot water they wash off.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this on my son, it worked.</li>
            <li>I tested it on myself first.</li>
            <li>The first day I painted just the thumb he sucked</li>
            <li>After 55-yrs of nail biting, I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since the first application almost a month ago--</li>
            <li>The first night we were up all night getting drinks because she forgot to not put her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li>The second night was much better.</li>
            <li>She stopped sucking her fingers after the first coat.</li>
            <li>Worked for the first 3 to 4 applications...</li>
            <li>I did not think it would work this fast!</li>
            <li>It does come off with multiple hand washing, which more savvy kids will catch on to.  </li>
            <li>I figured after the first couple of times he put his fingers in his mouth, he would stop.</li>
            <li>He would grimace and start asking for water or juice at first.</li>
            <li>The first time we put it on</li>
            <li>you are an avid nail biter, you might just ignore the revolting taste and chew on your nails anyway.  </li>
            <li>I tried to stop on many occasions but would inevitably \\&quot;relapse\\&quot; within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work, but I also tried rubbing hot peppers on her nails and that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>We dipped her hand in hot sauce and vinegar in hopes she would stop sucking her thumb, not happening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My daughter was 2 when we used this product on her thumbs to avoid her avid thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>so I was worried it would not work, well it absolutely did!</li>
            <li>it really did for us!</li>
            <li>from first day i apply on her nails.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it smelled like nail polish.</li>
            <li>this stuff does exactly as it claims.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>and then took a lick, at first nothing at all</li>
            <li>Again not the products fault, its doing exactly what it should be doing, but just something to be aware of in advance because it will sneak up on you!ing</li>
            <li>He did throw up from the first time he tasted it after trying to bite his nail.</li>
            <li>honestly think he likes the bitter</li>
            <li>I put it on him in the mornings when he first woke up</li>
            <li>I think he was sucking out of habit at night the first night.</li>
            <li>My daughter who has been sucking her thumb since birth now has no desire whatsoever (after the first night I applied Mavala) to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li>I have bitten them once or twice because I forgot to apply the product, but when its on, you are immediately aware of what you are doing when a finger goes into your mouth.</li>
            <li>This product has absolutely un-trained my brain to bite my fingernails!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Mavala STOP!</li>
            <li>Enough for them to grow some and the edges to be rounded, keeping me from biting and picking some more.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok, still 5/5, because I was only looking for the effectiveness, and boy did it work well.</li>
            <li>Both of my kids stopped with the first application.</li>
            <li>This worked at first</li>
            <li>but you may have to apply it everyday for good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been helping me a lot, but it does bother me that finger foods are pretty much ruined for me right now.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>AND AS A BONUS, OUR 9 YEAR OLD STOPPED BITING HIS NAILS!!!!</li>
            <li>She was cranky for a few days, but I worked great,  after using so many other methods and failing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to end finger sucking right</li>
            <li>Right now I am going on about 2 weeks straight of nail growth.</li>
            <li>Right now I am trying willpower because I know that Mavala Stop will be too much of a problem when it comes to flossing.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews about various products and read many positive ones about this product.</li>
            <li>At that point, I dipped a medical grade swab into the Mavala Stop container, wiped off the excess on the bottle&#x27;s edge, and then very, very lightly and gently ROLLED the swab along the incision--</li>
            <li>Sure enough, in it went and a quick exit it made followed by a loud, &amp;#34;BLEEEEECCCHHHHHHHHH!</li>
            <li>After a year, her thumb is normal, the nail is normal, and the dentist said her teeth are fine now too.  </li>
            <li>If he accidently put his thumb in his mouth he would take a sip and put a tic tac in and go back to sleep :) The orange tic tac&#x27;s  actually made his bedime routine easy as he enjoyed counting out his 4 tiny mints each night</li>
            <li>and we have tried EVERYTHING to get her to stop sucking her finger from hot sauce to positive praise for not doing it</li>
            <li>I put some on my own finger nail because I didn&#x27;t want to expose her to something that I was not willing to do to myself.</li>
            <li>I originally used this product when my son just turned 3yrs old</li>
            <li>I had optomistic hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my daughter&#x27;s nailbiting problem.</li>
            <li>The other products you have to use 2-3 times a day for them to be effective, thus one just once a day.</li>
            <li>I was excited to start using it on my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>my brain has decided it&#x27;s a good idea to take my newly acquired nails and wage war on my other nails...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any one who wants to cure nail biting and or thumb sucking!!</li>
            <li>I tried the product on my own hand, it&#x27;s very bitter.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;d wake up the next morning and come running in so excited because the yucky taste meant her thumbs didn&#x27;t want to be sucked anymore!  </li>
            <li>It is so bad and stays on so good that if he touched my lips with his thumb, I could taste it for a good 15 min.  </li>
            <li>worked great for a few days on my 4 year old&#x27;s fingers - he claimed he was cured and would never suck them again.</li>
            <li>Either way, this is by far the most effective treatment I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re serious about quitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>The taste of Mavala Stop is beyond what I can describe - kind of a cross between sucking batteries and chewing old tin foil.  </li>
            <li>...their taste buds aren&#x27;t developed enough and it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to buy my own bottle until I knew that it was effective.  </li>
            <li>So I finally bought my own bottle of it for my 5 year old who is a nail biter.  </li>
            <li>FORGET about putting it on a \\&quot;few\\&quot; times a week though, if you really bite your nails often you have to put it on a minimum of once a day but more often if you wash your hands/take multiple showers.</li>
            <li>We could not get my three year old to stop sucking his thumb and it started getting more frequent.</li>
            <li>Finger sucking is ok when the kids are young, but for a 5 year old, it is detrimental to their tooth formation.</li>
            <li>This thing works exactly as advertised and within 4 days, I have pretty much stopped biting my nails.</li>
            <li>For the past three months I kept telling her that pretty soon her thumb will no longer taste good to her.  </li>
            <li>It really does work, you just have to be willing to see your child the first time or two gag for a minute when they get that taste in their mouth.  </li>
            <li>Her teeth are beginning to misalign and she gets colds more frequently because she is putting germs directly into her</li>
            <li>And I have learned how fast your nails actually grow!  :-)  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong and bitter chemical taste that stays with you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super Great product, but only needed a tiny dab and now have a full jar of it left.</li>
            <li>Works great for my nine year old, but didn&#x27;t phase my four year old at all, except for the first time when it leached onto her finger food and her meal tasted bitter.  </li>
            <li>No More Thumb Sucking! :-) :-)</li>
            <li>This product is a little better than the standard cyan pepper kind.</li>
            <li>maybe it is the human body getting used to it or something, but still there is a yuck feeling that it will keep u off but not as strong as the first day...</li>
            <li>It also usually wears off kind of quickly.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the taste first because it had such a strong chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>but otherwise strongly recommend it if you are willing to apply daily.</li>
            <li>But this will quickly make you aware how how often you put your fingers near your mouth</li>
            <li>After receiving rave reviews from friends that swear by this product and the positive feedback on Amazon I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I used it along with positive enforcement of the Berenstein bears book and letting him draw pictures on his fingernails with a nail art pen.</li>
            <li>somewhere I read about products like these, and picked this one off of Amazon based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>We explained to him what it was for, and tried to make it positive- \\&quot;soon</li>
            <li>We tried the product together with positive reinforcement, highlighting that the liquid in her finger is \\&quot;just to remind her not to suck her thumb\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You could count that as a positive though if you are picky about table</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so thankful for everyone who posted positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>We tried everything from thumb splints, bandaids, mittens, bribes of toys, positive reinforcement</li>
            <li>We tried the \\&quot;PC\\&quot; method of offering positive reinforcement and giving her all the benefits for not sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Took one day,&lt;br /&gt;(tried positive reinforcement/rewards for 6 months with no successs)&lt;br /&gt;Prepped our child for its arrival.  </li>
            <li>I see this as a positive because it will help me lose weight.  </li>
            <li>We tried band-aids, gauze tape as well as positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Of course, we used a lot of encouragement and positive feedback as well...</li>
            <li>I will keep using it until I am absolutely positive</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried thumb covers, positive encouragement, Thum (pepper)</li>
            <li>For those of you whose children have a problem that mainly just annoys you, then this should knock it right</li>
            <li>Maybe she needs to be older, but it is of no help right now when I need her to stop.</li>
            <li>product may be more suitable for little older kids but not for young toddlers.</li>
            <li>At its best this product helps keep you more conscious of your bad habit.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, my son is very taste sensitive, so he really did not want to suck w/ the Mavala on.</li>
            <li>I have been a nail biter for pretty much my whole 29 year life.  </li>
            <li>He had pretty much stopped during the day but still sucked to go to sleep and at night.</li>
            <li>has also motivated DS 6 to stop his thumb sucking, and he pretty much stopped after a couple of weeks and</li>
            <li>Well, maybe she was just ready for this, but after the first night, when we put it on after she was asleep, (she woke at 4am complaining about the taste)</li>
            <li>her nails grew long and I was finally able to cut her nails.</li>
            <li>His nails are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>and now i have healthy, long nails.</li>
            <li>He pretty much stopped chewing his nails within a day our two.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is 2 and has pretty much been sucking her thumb sice</li>
            <li>i love this polish and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>so we did not have to apply for too long :)</li>
            <li>I put the thumb in my mouth, and, at first, I didn&#x27;t really taste anything.  </li>
            <li>but this is probably the first time in 29 years that I have real nails.</li>
            <li>The first time you bite your nails (or whatever you want to use this for really), trust me you&#x27;ll never purposefully bite into them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to break my daughters thumb sucking for so long and tried so many things by now that I lost hope at one time.</li>
            <li>Our daughter was ready and willing to stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li>Then by the third or fourth day I would catch myself biting my nails again, but wouldn&#x27;t want to put more on because I enjoy my food tasting like food.</li>
            <li>Used it on my first son when he was bitting his nails and got over the habit real soon.</li>
            <li>This one is much stronger in flavor, and it really works!</li>
            <li>I let the girls keep water at their bedside for the first week or so because when they stuck their thumbs in they would want to run straight for a drink.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much immediately after tasting it once when</li>
            <li>Fast to apply, he puts it on willingly by himself.</li>
            <li>I tried so many other products with 0 success.  </li>
            <li>Note: needs to be reapplied every 4-5 days, pretty much just like nail polish.</li>
            <li>That pretty much sums it up.  </li>
            <li>I thought that because the nail polish was on my nails, I would still be able to floss as long as I didn&#x27;t put the floss around my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting the same enjoyment at all, and quickly becoming conditioned to equate nail biting with BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She would pretty much suck her thumb all day and night.</li>
            <li>I think as long as I keep using this stuff, I won&#x27;t have any more problems with my nail-biting.</li>
            <li>I was looking for this product for a long time, was really glad when I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>it pretty much stopped her.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mavala Stop, it really works!</li>
            <li>He was really upset when he first tasted it</li>
            <li>Presumably most people won&#x27;t even need to use it as long as I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>A word of warning, this stuff affect pretty much anything</li>
            <li>No crying, no anger.</li>
            <li>Eating something sweet (like soda) will get rid of the taste but some of it was still on my soft palate</li>
            <li>Because I had so much difficulty with his older brother (who didn&#x27;t stop sucking until he was in elementary school</li>
            <li>I file them down and make them look nice and put a coat of this on it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunatley, what I didn&#x27;t realize that my 13-hour-a-night sleeper who was super easy to put to bed (we just put on his pjs and closed the door) was that way because he sucked his fingers to fall asleep and again any time he woke up during the night.</li>
            <li>use careful when applying it, I used to much on my son this stuff is very strong...  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old has pretty nails for the first time since we can&#x27;t remember when!  </li>
            <li>He has the most sweet little hands again because of Mavala.</li>
            <li>My son stopped bitting from the first application and my daughter stopped sucking completely 2 days after the first application!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re pleased to say that within one week out 6 1/2 year old whom sucked her thumb a lot to the point she created a major overbite is no longer sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I saw other reviews that suggested more often, but I didn&#x27;t want to overdo right away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving them toothpicks and/or utensils for finger foods as once they get a taste of it, they will most likely not want their fingers in their mouth again (my son has not).</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe the product is good, so many reviews cant be wrong, I even tasted it and was bitter as hell.  </li>
            <li>I have enough control due to the substance that I have been able to use scissors most of the time now that I have relocated them, but I still bite my nails occasionally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We tried putting his thumbs in vinegar, but it washed away pretty quickly and he was right back to sucking again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m floored with how well and quickly this worked for my 3 year old within one week</li>
            <li>3 year old learned quickly to stop sticking her thumb in her mouth when we tried this.</li>
            <li>It arrived very, very quickly BUT it sat on my counter for over a week as it came in the same packaging as my medication and just assumed it was that.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not seem suitable for young children with developing brains!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked so quickly for the 6 year old.  </li>
            <li>It could easily be worn over nail polish and would probably work like an extra protective topcoat.</li>
            <li>It could easily be worn over nail polish and would probably work like an extra protective topcoat.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply while thumb is dry, otherwise it won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s more aware of what she is doing and trying harder to stop.</li>
            <li>Works but easily washes off after regular habd washing.</li>
            <li>My nails are now long, healthy, and they grow really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to keep her from touching it so it has time to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li>But make sure the neck of the bottle is dry before you close it.</li>
            <li>I put it on the very tip of her fingernail the first night but after that I painted her whole nail.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old bit his nails to the quick.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find Mavala Stop quickly at the beauty supply store near me, so I purchased Orly&#x27;s No Bite.  </li>
            <li>worked quickly to help my 4/5 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>Then he went back to sleep easily.</li>
            <li>could not believe how quickly my 3 year old stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>She stopped very quickly and it really only took 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>At bedtime I would lightly paint only her thumbs, and the first time she tried she immediately stopped putting it in her mouth.</li>
            <li>the only problem is that it spills easily.</li>
            <li>When you paint your fingernails with &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; any chance that you put your fingernails near or in your mouth will have you quickly removing them.  </li>
            <li>I do apply it daily as well to keep the taste strong.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of nail polish when applies, and should last two days.  </li>
            <li>The first few days my daughter would sometimes forget and put her thumb in, and you will want water handy to wash the taste away.</li>
            <li>I am planning on buying Mavalas product to make their nails strong next as I noticed they are growing too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it is a must to reapply like daily so that it continues to be strong to the taste.</li>
            <li>, you get that taste as well only not quite as strong.</li>
            <li>It definately isn&#x27;t strong enough for her habits.  </li>
            <li>flavor for Mavala Stop is strong and last for almost 2 days even if u washed your hands over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seemed as though the habit was too strong to break, having been in practice for those five years since birth (our only child that preferred his digits over a pacifier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also smelt the product and deemed the smell too strong and actually threw it away without even using it in on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was such a strong habit that he had his thumb in his mouth any time he wasn&#x27;t using it--</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to survive my vigorous hand scrubbing in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I told my daughter if you bite your nails below a certain point</li>
            <li>This includes during the day when certain events would trigger it.  </li>
            <li>The temptation of not putting it on or letting it wear off quickly is certainly there.</li>
            <li>The temptation of not putting it on or letting it wear off quickly is certainly there.</li>
            <li>this product is certainly helping to break the habit.  </li>
            <li>It certainly works too.</li>
            <li>She was beginning to get a large overbite, and her dentist recommended Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li>With all the news regarding hand washing and the need to keep your hands off your face and certainly out of your mouth, I suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Operations Manager for a large company</li>
            <li>But if you have a smart child, they will notice that it gleams on their fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>but it certainly did the trick for me.</li>
            <li>We continued using it for a week just to be certain.</li>
            <li>She would suck on her fingers during car rides, before meals, before bed, during her sleep, a large part of her day was her sucking her</li>
            <li>For certain things like even eating chips, or flossing, your nails may accidentally brush your lips or mouth, and you will get the undesirable taste.</li>
            <li>It certainly would motivate me.  </li>
            <li>not sure if it was the product that helped her stop, or her own decision...she did figure out very quickly that it peels off when it&#x27;s dry...probably works fine as a reminder for a kid that wants to stop, but it&#x27;s not much of a deterrent for a kid that wants to bite</li>
            <li>We are hoping that in a few more weeks, he will kick nail biting good-bye!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my son&#x27;s nailbiting problem.  </li>
            <li>This is great for me because it just reinforces the lesson even after, which means I am less likely to attempt to chew again.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that you can&#x27;t really eat finger foods that easily without getting some of the taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought, could it really be that easy and simple?  </li>
            <li>You have to really slosh it on or else it might not be strong enough.</li>
            <li>I gave this a shot and after painting my nails with this product for a week and a half I completely stopped biting in my nails for good.</li>
            <li>Tastes pretty strange, mostly like tonic water and chemicals but adds a new type of excitement every time you go for a chew.</li>
            <li>Suggestion if using on kids put it on when they are sleeping for the first week or two, make sure to reapply every other day.</li>
            <li>Like many other parents I tried everything; from the sock to tape to hot sauce, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>We got Mavala Stop 3 weeks ago and other than the first time he &amp;#34;tried it&amp;#34; and one more accidental taste he has not sucked them since.</li>
            <li>Many people who found this product ineffective had children under 3, although some were lucky enough that it worked despite the younger age of their children.  </li>
            <li>Any time she eats anything with her fingers and gets a tast of the Mavala Stop product, she decides that she no longer likes that particular food!</li>
            <li>I got on Amazon to find a book that was suggested and one of the reviews of that particular book mentioned this!</li>
            <li>only drawback is if you are eating something like chips or a donut and go to lick your fingers, you will quickly remember that Mavala Stop has been applied!</li>
            <li>It was very highly rated.  </li>
            <li>Not going to happen with Mavala Stop, this stuff is pure, absolute poison.  </li>
            <li>But know that kids are smart haha.</li>
            <li>put a little on my own finger before I subjected them to it.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb the first time she tried putting it in her mouth with the Mavala Stop on it!</li>
            <li>months later, my real nails were the same length as the acrylics on top of them!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this first.</li>
            <li>None of them seemed to be consistent or highly effect deterrents.</li>
            <li>She is old enough to realize &amp; wanted to stop but it just wasn&#x27;t easy as its right there with her all the time.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a good boy and had a hard time letting go of the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself and it was a very strong bitter taste it stayed on my thumb for two days without reapplying!!</li>
            <li>Put one coat on my child&#x27;s thumb and after trying to put their thumb in their mouth 5-6 times the first day the thumb sucking stopped completely!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products similar to this one but the others are tolerable or flake off easily.</li>
            <li>But after reading many reviews and seeing other people having positive results, I figured we had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>We tried positive reinforcement, and so many other approaches we read about online and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>My 11-year-old son just stopped biting his fingernails after we used this product for a few weeks, it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li>Taking away the finger sucking created a huge issue with him taking forever to fall asleep, getting out of bed in the middle of the night, etc.</li>
            <li>Absolutely gray product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really seemed to work.</li>
            <li>We noticed within a couple days that she really wasn&#x27;t sucking her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li>Really curbed her appetite .</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness</li>
            <li>and it broke habit fast.</li>
            <li>He no longer bites his nails and they are growing very well now.</li>
            <li>So, my husband ordered this product after much research.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>It really alters your teeth and face.</li>
            <li>Apply it to your whole nail if you want, or just the edges that you chew.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really stays on</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing this on and off my whole life, and really need to quit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied one coat (not just to her nail, but over the whole thumb).  </li>
            <li>I never even realized JUST how much I bit my nails and cuticles</li>
            <li>it was supposed to stop me from biting, but after a while the snapping action just ended up sexually exciting me.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be if I can condition myself to keep my fingers out of my mouth</li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be if I can condition myself to keep my fingers out of my mouth</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I used this with both of my boys to get ride of their pacifier and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll just close my eyes and go to town on my nails and and have like a shot of whiskey ready to get the taste out.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault, as much as it is my dd&#x27;s stubborn determination to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li>If this didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t have much hope for anything else.</li>
            <li>This is not a taste you get used to over time either; it will continue to be one of the most bitter tasting flavors you can</li>
            <li>Really, I tried it on myself</li>
            <li>it really work so well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Now I think the urge/habit is really out of his system.</li>
            <li>This worked because when she would use her fingers to eat, she would not put that much of her thumb in her mouth to taste the cuticle area.  </li>
            <li>Once in a while, he himelf will let us know that he wants to apply it.</li>
            <li>But, it may very well not work for your child.  </li>
            <li>They both did very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also learned to be careful about touching my lips with any part of my fingertips as it rubs off then too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is like nail polish.</li>
            <li>So she was ready to stop but couldn&#x27;t stop the habit.</li>
            <li>His dentists and doctors kept saying he&#x27;d quit &#x27;when he was ready&#x27;</li>
            <li>She was VERY into her thumb.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find you want to use silverware or eat a lot more carefully -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to ANYONE who wants to quit a habit.</li>
            <li>He tried but really struggled when he was distracted (like watching a movie) or when he was going to bed.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you use it with caution and not put on too much like I did.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I always thought, I could quit whenever I was ready but somehow could never stop.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s promising reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after doing plenty of research, I learned it is an absolute must</li>
            <li>to mention that I really didn&#x27;t want to send a kid off to kindergarten still sucking his thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>So again this product REALLY works...  </li>
            <li>Thanks Stacey Oakland,CA</li>
            <li>Of course I had to take a sample taste, just to see if it would really work.</li>
            <li>The best part is that she is SO proud of herself, the worst part is we have to buy her that trampoline now that we&#x27;ve been bribing her with for the last two years!</li>
            <li>but it was fast) and freaked out when he put his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li>From reviews we read we don&#x27;t put much on.</li>
            <li>This is important since the taste will last on the her thumb for a couple of days and every time she would eat a snack she could taste it.</li>
            <li>but the product really works.</li>
            <li>but the product really works.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>My daughter is now finished thumb sucking thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t paint my whole nails with it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is 3 and really wanted to stop sucking her thumb before she turned 4.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to stop my 3 y.o from sucking her thumb, but she would cry every time she tried to place food in her mouth and her thumb would hit her lips</li>
            <li>It works very well although it does come off</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really does work though.  </li>
            <li>It really does make you stop,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>Its much stronger that \\&quot;Bite</li>
            <li>and it really did go a lot smoother than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>so you stop biting your nails and they are very understanding.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Also, after months of use, my son has gotten used to the bitter/pungent taste of the polish and doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it as much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it works, but taking a star off because the effects are very temporary.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let your child eat w/ fingers to much try to use fork or spoon</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>This product really helped my son stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>She wanted to quit, but just too much of a habit.</li>
            <li>It makes it a much stronger taste</li>
            <li>and she has continued to go the whole night with not one attempt at sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>but I really believe she is over it now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also hoping this will prevent him from eating food with his fingers so much.</li>
            <li>I am suprised that it worked so fast.</li>
            <li>I have bitten my nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped with my nail biting.</li>
            <li>I reapplied inconsistently (it does wear off) - you could reapply twice a day or every couple days, depending on how much you need.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb in about 3 weeks, so I really believe that he has overcome this habit.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mavala because you saved me thousands of dollars for braces.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not each time, but very often.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>We were wondering why she wasn&#x27;t waking in the night, until we found her in the morning sucking on her thumb like it wasn&#x27;t covered in the most bitter foul tasting nail polish ever.</li>
            <li>She wants to stop, but as soon as the lights are out a robot takes over her arm and guides that thing straight to her mouth.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think it would stop so fast.  </li>
            <li>Product has really helped me.</li>
            <li>and it really didn&#x27;t have any affect on me whatsoever</li>
            <li>this has a real yucky taste, my daughter just kept spitting if she dare suck anytime.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My daughter has sucked her thumb her whole life, I even have a Ultrasound of her sucking in womb.</li>
            <li>But no matter how much I applied the product to my son&#x27;s trumb, it didn&#x27;t stop him from sucking.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Mavala.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>She really had been trying to quit for months.  </li>
            <li>One more suggestion:  pick your time carefully.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for adults!</li>
            <li>MORE THUMB at least so far :)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t care so much if he&#x27;d keep it in the privacy of home...  </li>
            <li>, really, spicy probably doesn&#x27;t phase him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize how much you inadvertantly stick your fingers in your mouth till there&#x27;s something like this on them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really, really nasty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been two months now, and she really is cured.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>We still put it on for a while afterward, because she would wake up with her thumb in her mouth and be very distressed.  </li>
            <li>but they should really state that is for children 3 and up because it didnt say on the site for what age.</li>
            <li>He was getting really discouraged that he kept failing with everything he tried.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>The product contains Methyl alcohol, which is highly toxic!</li>
            <li>Turns out he really likes to pick his nose, like a lot, like if we pumped his stomach it would look like that slime stuff Nickelodeon.</li>
            <li>He likes it so much that he bought some and gave to a person in our neighborhood.</li>
            <li>His fingernails are looking much nicer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to order a hypnosis CD to assist with breaking the habit, via Amazon, when I found a link to Mavala.  </li>
            <li>This product really works for toddlers.</li>
            <li>I wish I knew this product before, it really worked.</li>
            <li>Before applying it on her fingers I tasted it and it was really yuck.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recomend!</li>
            <li>so I rushed home and looked for something to help him stop fast.  </li>
            <li>this item really suited my need.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really have any effect on him.</li>
            <li>It really worked for me.</li>
            <li>She was very reluctant, but she knew I wasnt giving in.</li>
            <li>Then I found this product and it really worked.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>and it really works out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you expected that</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much this product means to me and my family.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely what we needed</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful not to eat too many finger foods because you will get a hint of the taste while eating.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and am so thankful to Dr. Jeannie Moody in Austin, Texas for the referral!</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>That was a real treat....  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really foul</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would work, or if it did, it would be a traumatic experience for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>For instance, you can&#x27;t really eat chips without tasting the bitterness in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It doesnt take much at all.  </li>
            <li>Too much of the product</li>
            <li>The taste is also very durable and lingering.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really find the taste all that offensive.</li>
            <li>I will stop biting my nails, even if I use the whole bottle breaking the habit.</li>
            <li>Haha just the SMELL did the job all by itself!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might work if your child wants to stop sucking their thumb, but if not, don&#x27;t count on it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it worked so fast.</li>
            <li>trust me on this one, this stuff really works and out son stop sucking his thumb in a week.  </li>
            <li>Read the bottles carefully, make sure you grab the one-a-day variety.</li>
            <li>Try to use forks and spoons for your food as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the bottles carefully, make sure you grab the one-a-day variety.</li>
            <li>Try to use forks and spoons for your food as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he must have spit for 3 hours straight, and the stuff would get on his food.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted to help give parents and informed decision.ste\\&quot; on their tongue.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted to help give parents and informed decision.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Mavala makes this whole process much easier.  </li>
            <li>company I bought it through though was very efficient.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the stuff seems to really attach itself to my lips, even though I haven&#x27;t bitten in that amount of time.</li>
            <li>My 3-yr son stopped sucking his thumb for 3 months and then re-started and was very stubborn about quitting.</li>
            <li>This is the nastiest, most bitter taste I&#x27;ve ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned, touching your lips leaves the bitter taste on your lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important kids get extra hugs and cuddle time to substitute the security their thumb provides.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter, I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>We were ready to have the dentist install a habit appliance in her mouth which was $600.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely suggest trying it.  </li>
            <li>The cost makes it a very inexpensive trial.  </li>
            <li>This product really relieved alot of stress for my husband and I.  </li>
            <li>We owe it all to Mavala, thanks it really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped me grow my nails out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this if you&#x27;re a nail biter!</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>and I believe it discourages her from eating as much.  </li>
            <li>I had so much anxiety about getting my son to stop sucking his finger</li>
            <li>and it was really a piece of cake.</li>
            <li>He was very agreeable to the process so that probably helped too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and have been biting my nails off and on my whole life.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to kick the habit</li>
            <li>I really want my nails to grow out</li>
            <li>This stuff was fantastic, though there were several nights I had to get up and get one of the kids</li>
            <li>Thanks to MAVALA</li>
            <li>/&gt;It tastes like absolute s</li>
            <li>though, the most bitter thing you&#x27;ve ever tasted.</li>
            <li>hahaha.  </li>
            <li>She has made comments that she wants to stop to.  </li>
            <li>Between breakfast and the ride to school, my son quit sucking his thumb thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>So it works perfectly, haha.</li>
            <li>fast forward a year,</li>
            <li>My husband has been biting his nails his whole life.</li>
            <li>I guess all I really have to say is that this product should do what you want it to do if you purchase it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all...</li>
            <li>I guess his thumb means that much to him.</li>
            <li>Something that really needs to be advertised.</li>
            <li>We tried everything: from gentle reminders to getting irritated; from distractions to a promised gift; he even bit his nails during soccer training while kicking the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>She bit her nails too, but not that much.</li>
            <li>She was sucking both at home and at school and it was really interfereing with her school work.</li>
            <li>absolutely turned me off.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think I am going to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>and he really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>But I would really recommend this for sucking.</li>
            <li>but it was too much of a habit without the help of MAVALA.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think we will need to use the whole bottle</li>
            <li>But he was never distressed or really even cared that he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb anymore.</li>
            <li>So I know he&#x27;s not quite ready to get off it</li>
            <li>It dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>He was ready to stop</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It wears away eventually, my child is very stubborn</li>
            <li>for the appearance of the stuff, it dries on very shiny</li>
            <li>My family and me were very worried that it would ruin her finger and the shape of her mouth.</li>
            <li>and it really tastes</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been complaining about it and saying he wants to stop because it hurts and it bugs him, but he can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It really helps&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use it much longer since I don&#x27;t really see her thumb going towards her mouth anymore.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re getting it for that purpose I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It never bothered me really until I realized it started affecting my work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I really needed</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, not for children under 3 or really</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will work unless the child is really ready to quit though.</li>
            <li>the Mavala on his nails and described it as \\&quot;really terrible\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>We paint the whole nail.  </li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>She confirmed it was gross.</li>
            <li>The taste really does not go away.</li>
            <li>Even then I really didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>Even then I really didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>Very sour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really was bothersome since the taste would get on the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>This product really helps you kick a nail biting habit.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mavala.</li>
            <li>It taste really</li>
            <li>really bad!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>For that- the product works very well and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it really works</li>
            <li>it really stops him from biting it.</li>
            <li>Really helped my daughter stopped sucking her thumb at night.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I can really tell this product is beginning to rewire my brain.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Mavala</li>
            <li>This product really helped&lt;</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to get her to stop, she has the desire to stop, and I was really hoping this would work</li>
            <li>soon they&#x27;ve grown so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks God and to someone who came out for this invention.</li>
            <li>and if you dare touch your mouth, the bitterness is really really</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn, it is just a really undesirable taste.</li>
            <li>Very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-Same</li>
            <li>After regularly applying after bath time he was completely free of thumb sucking in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I have been promising for 2 years that she could  have her ears pierced</li>
            <li>The thumb covers were very pricey</li>
            <li>decided to order the bitter nail polish as most of the ingredients looked like they were in nail products that I have used on them anyway.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really stop her thumb sucking though.</li>
            <li>It really helped me.</li>
            <li>People that know the twins have noticed they no longer suck on their fingers, too, which made me secretly jump for joy.</li>
            <li>works very well to keep my child from sucking her thumb but had to apply to all fingers as she would swap to another if it was just on thumb.</li>
            <li>shes very determined to do</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I knew I had to do something about it and FAST.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;ll still look at her much longer nails and say, &amp;#34;Wow</li>
            <li>, I just really want to bite them off.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>I wish it had hold up much longer</li>
            <li>She was the one to tell us she was ready to use it.</li>
            <li>but we really didn&#x27;t need too.</li>
            <li>This stuff&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>then you better be careful.  </li>
            <li>This really helps our grandson with thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes absolutely horrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just one whole day.</li>
            <li>...thank you so much mavala....</li>
            <li>It is the most vile, horroble bitter taste I have ever tasted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for 50 years and have never found any of the biting deterrents to really work.</li>
            <li>this has really helped my son a lot.</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that this product really worked.</li>
            <li>im thinking she needed something to do with her hands, so she just scratched and scratched her whole body..</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to really deter my child from putting fingers in mouth.</li>
            <li>I also did not have to apply very often</li>
            <li>Tape, socks, finger splints, THUMB, offering money, and threats to cut off the thumb (Not like I would really do that, but</li>
            <li>and this was to avoid too much bacteria on his thumb and to his mouth.</li>
            <li>I am really amazed my kid stop outmatically after</li>
            <li>once I paint it thanks to those who made it and distribute thank you</li>
            <li>She used to suck her thumb so much that she didn&#x27;t even take her thumb out to eat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t cover her whole nail because I didn&#x27;t want her to accidentally get it in her mouth while eating.</li>
            <li>I was very optimistic that it would work.  </li>
            <li>and he had a stomach ache for a whole week during school and at home because of it.</li>
            <li>This product has really changed my son&#x27;s feelings about biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>However, we have not found this product very helpful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Then the bitter taste becomes more tolerable, but by that point you longer desire to bite your nails.</li>
            <li>but really doesn&#x27;t cure the problem.</li>
            <li>The first 2 days we thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, he still put his finger in his mouth, however it wasn&#x27;t as much as he normally did.</li>
            <li>It really is foul tasting and she would suck her thumb to help her fall asleep.</li>
            <li>The stuff lasts days, especially on an adult</li>
            <li>Both of us really wanted her to stop biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>It really helped her stop and was much easier than either of us could imagine.</li>
            <li>I think the kid needs to want to stop, but if they do - this is absolutely the tool to do that.</li>
            <li>He stopped biting his nails immediately because he hates the taste so much.</li>
            <li>and I was really hoping this product worked.</li>
            <li>the dentist told me there was nothing I could do until my daughter was ready.  </li>
            <li>So this has not been a really quick-fix, like 3 days</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t bring too much effect on my kid.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>her suck her thumb and apply this polish, I coat her whole thumb.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>I made sure there&#x27;s water close by so that when she wakes up, she can get the bitter taste out of her mouth.  </li>
            <li>very bitter(which</li>
            <li>I realized for applying covered almost the whole thumb&#x27;s nail.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I never saw something that worked so fast because my daughter and her thumb were glued together night and day, practically inseparable .</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to keep your kids from biting their nails, this works really well.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>She was running around scraping her tongue with a napkin practically the whole day.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her she just couldn&#x27;t anymore, even though she wasn&#x27;t doing it very often.</li>
            <li>It had am immediate impact and both of my kids actually appreciated the aide in stopping their habits.</li>
            <li>I started using Mavala when my fingers started hurting of so much bitting, I had to stop some</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This was accomplished practically overnight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>well anyways I received it really fast and that night I applied it on his nails.</li>
            <li>My whole family applied it so we could experience what he&#x27;s going through together and</li>
            <li>You will not need the whole bottle</li>
            <li>very cautiously because &#x27;stop&#x27; is ment for 3 and up.  </li>
            <li>so every day till he was really done</li>
            <li>, I really thought this stuff worked wonders.  </li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t bitten since, and his nails now look so much nicer and healthier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Mavala Stop!  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to break this habit and have been trying for a year now.  </li>
            <li>and I think it was too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>It sounds like it really works</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop was an absolute miracle.</li>
            <li>and it is working very well.</li>
            <li>very often.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>I want to relate this to &amp;#34;cruel and unusual punishment&amp;#34;; however, it should do the job of keeping nails from being bitten.</li>
            <li>My son, not so much.  </li>
            <li>When we applied to the whole nail, that&#x27;s when it started to work.  </li>
            <li>Though we were more likely to put it on each night, as if we missed a days, he would be more likely to put his thumb back in.  </li>
            <li>I have discovered that also hates the taste (hahaha)</li>
            <li>but I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to need to use this for a while in order to really break that habit.</li>
            <li>but I can say that this stuff really works to help people stop biting.</li>
            <li>His dentist had mentioned twice that we really should get him to stop sucking his finger as it was moving his front tooth forward</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>Be careful eating anything with hands after applying because you can even taste it on your food from just touching it.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It has a bitter taste but is safe.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even have to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter who is 3 and the dentist stated she really needed to stop sucking her thumb because it was causing an overbite.</li>
            <li>but it was just too much to lick my lips or</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>this really worked.  </li>
            <li>he just really didn&#x27;t want to</li>
            <li>But he really wasn&#x27;t very upset.</li>
            <li>but I think a child must be ready to quit sucking.  </li>
            <li>He would bite so much and often and make is fingers bleed etc.</li>
            <li>then well it can be really</li>
            <li>This absolutely works.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This time it seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s important to note that just using the nail polish to kick the habit probably isn&#x27;t going to be enough.</li>
            <li>it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li>Thanks Malvala.</li>
            <li>She hates putting them in her mouth now, and it really does help her to remember to keep her fingers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes u think fast about putting ur fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was very cautious at how I put it on her fingers.</li>
            <li>Its way too intense.</li>
            <li>knows how much I wanted it too</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it with our daughter (5) and son (3.5) and it has really helped.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t use it for my boys because it leaves too much of a shine on their nails.</li>
            <li>He is so proud of himself now that he had broken that habit.</li>
            <li>I have a real need to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>I have struggled my whole life with nail biting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very absentminded habit.  </li>
            <li>He kept asking me when we were going to buy this product, so he was ready to stop sucking his thumb and just needed some help.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to help their child to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li>I really really recommend this for nail biters.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works real well.</li>
            <li>I talked to her about it as soon as I placed the order to get her ready for it</li>
            <li>Had to keep applying it until it really sank in.</li>
            <li>This really does help.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>i find this product really works.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized that he sucked his thumb so much in his sleep too.  </li>
            <li>He does it so much that he tears his skin.  </li>
            <li>His mother bought this for him and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li>We were both hesitant that it wouldn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>It did seem to work well for my son - not so much for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The finger sucking did not bother us, but after she turned 3 or so, she started to do it very aggressively where she would hurt her fingers with her teeth.</li>
            <li>I was VERY</li>
            <li>They are absolutely correct.</li>
            <li>I did put it on a few more times just to make sure, but it seems like the problem was stopped after only 2 applications!</li>
            <li>We put a band aid over the thumb as a reminder but if she takes off the band aid it will be very yucky.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>and he didn&#x27;t really respond.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my whole life</li>
            <li>The taste really make you regret life.</li>
            <li>Our daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it that much, but idf</li>
            <li>It does wear off fast though, so you had to apply just about every day, but it has been working.</li>
            <li>really bummed it didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li>Because really, it tastes aweful.</li>
            <li>It really helped my son to stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it and will continue to recommend it because it really works.  </li>
            <li>and she was very stubborn she keeps trying for 5 or 7 days</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap ($200) but it was the only thing that worked for us!</li>
            <li>so she may have straight teeth.</li>
            <li>I thought it would take much longer to break her habit.</li>
            <li>My son was the type to have his thumb or fingers in his mouth very often</li>
            <li>And they are more careful to not get their fingers in their mouthes when they eat too.</li>
            <li>That is really the purpose of this stuff.</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing for my nail biting toddler.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>but so far it has been worth it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I think the fact that it makes one gag really associates with the habit and helps break it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>So now his teeth are affected,his thumbs get really chapped and red,and sometimes he won&#x27;t even take his thumb out to talk.</li>
            <li>she didnt care much for.</li>
            <li>doesnt really work as well as shown.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>that also says not much had to be around the top for it to adhere itself.</li>
            <li>Plus much of their destruction occurs with finger to finger peeling,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two months and my nails are absolutely growing because I&#x27;ve stopped biting my nails.</li>
            <li>If you really want to stop, BUY THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>Greatly appreciated it really works used it for 2 days and stopped socking thumbs.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t force him, I told him when he was ready we&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>This product worked really well, I stopped biting my nails the day i put it on, however it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li>My daughter was ready to stop sucking her thumb (almost 3yo) and this stuff helped in a matter of 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I painted the whole nail a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, it tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They will &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; to apply it haha</li>
            <li>She cried because she really wanted to stop sucking her fingers but couldn&#x27;t control her finger sucking impulse.</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve ever done in my whole life.. .</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>Note that I followed the advice of one Mom who said don&#x27;t put too much on.</li>
            <li>your child doesn&#x27;t get used to the taste this could work very well, but it did not for us.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>He is 3 1/2 and has sucked his thumb his whole life.</li>
            <li>Now I say to use caution because you don&#x27;t need to apply that much, to the nail</li>
            <li>is he has stopped napping even though I really think he still needs the nap.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend my whole life sucking my thumb.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>He really dislikes the taste and stopped biting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>why I have not broken the habit yet</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;We began the process on a Saturday morning so we could monitor her and continuously apply the mavala stop for the whole weekend as she attends daycare during the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLECH.</li>
            <li>I am sure the product works great for others, but our daughter was so obsessed with thumb sucking and nail biting that she would sit and scrape her nails and thumbs to try to get off as much as possible, then would put up with the taste until she has bitten and sucked it off.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>We snuck it on her fingernails while she was sleeping, and it was absolutely miraculous.</li>
            <li>think it helps if your kid is emotionally ready to stop the finger-sucking because this really works.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t put her fingers in her mouth for three weeks straight ...</li>
            <li>This product really works like they say.  </li>
            <li>This really works so give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have been a nail bitter for most of my life and could not find anything to help me from stopping.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants to stop the nail biting habit.  </li>
            <li>But now, the taste doesn&#x27;t really bother him</li>
            <li>You get \\&quot;punished\\&quot; for really doing nothing</li>
            <li>If your rub the ends of your fingers together like I do even hours after putting it on then your whole finger will taste of it.</li>
            <li>She was ready to stop and even asked for help from her &amp;#34;special nail polish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This product really worked and it stopped me from biting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>mavala really works thanks mavala</li>
            <li>It really works, my daughter has not even attempted to stich her thumb in her mouth and its been over a month</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really think the products gets stuck in nose and throat causing me to want vomit and cough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they were almost gone thanks to this</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely nasty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes/flakes off much faster than some of the others I have used.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend, who wants to quit biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>It worked for a while with my son, not so much with my daughter.</li>
            <li>This worked really well.  </li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>I just had to be more careful and eventually it wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, but you need to re apply it every day to really kick the habbit.</li>
            <li>I would do this for a month to really stop biting you rnails.</li>
            <li>it  really  works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.....</li>
            <li>Haha)</li>
            <li>But it really is helping her to stop bitting her nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 and have been biting my nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Putting a nail in your mouth will ruin your whole morning.  </li>
            <li>I had a real addiction problem to it</li>
            <li>I figured for the price if it didnt work I wouldnt be out much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Like, really.</li>
            <li>Really want my daughter to stop sucking her thumb..</li>
            <li>I put it on &amp; was so ready to see her distaste for it.</li>
            <li>As the reviews said not to put too much on as it could get on her food &amp; she may not eat.</li>
            <li>I took them off and really tried to grow them out, but could not keep from biting them and the skin around my nail.  </li>
            <li>This really helped me stop biting my nails and helps my son keep his finger out of his mouth.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good for at least two or three days.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good for at least two or three days.  </li>
            <li>If your kid is some kind of mutant like mine, I guess it will be money wasted.</li>
            <li>We are on day 3 and we reapplied a coat to make sure we don&#x27;t lose any of the gains, but so far, this is working like a charm and, as a parent, have to say it has been relatively painless.  </li>
            <li>My six year old was willing to try and the first day she accidentally put her thumb in her mouth 3 times.</li>
            <li>The product smells exactly like nail polish remover which for the first application stopped our daughter from bringing her fingers any where near her nose, let alone her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a waste of money in that sense...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to quit on and off throughout my life but for the most part I&#x27;m extremely addicted to nail biting.</li>
            <li>She re-applies it as needed at bedtime, and surprisingly she hasn&#x27;t complained much at all.  </li>
            <li>It worked first time for my 2 year old the first time for finger sucking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to guarantee that this will work for your child, I can only tell you that my 3 year old is one of the most stubborn children I know</li>
            <li>On the second day he announced that he \\&quot;kind of likes the taste\\&quot; and has gone back to biting his nails anyway.</li>
            <li>so I will us it on and off for a few months, but we are so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>We actually painted over the clear polish with her favorite colors and</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and have tried many different ways to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied with this product despite the minor hassle of avoiding finger foods.  </li>
            <li>I rose, went to the bathroom, rinsed with water, brushed my teeth, brushed my tongue, all to no avail.</li>
            <li>She can not stand the taste and was nearly in tears the first time she tried to suck her thumb, now she would just make a funny face.</li>
            <li>you have to put it on everyday though, to be effective, just fyi....</li>
            <li>and I used it for my toddler who was getting more and more addicted to thumb sucking .</li>
            <li>I think perhaps because one of her good friends in preschool still sucks her thumb</li>
            <li>I think perhaps because one of her good friends in preschool still sucks her thumb</li>
            <li>However, she did none of the above - she licked it on her own, said it was gross, and then went about her business.  </li>
            <li>so well you only need a tiny bit on the end of your nail to be effective.</li>
            <li>I kept it on her thumb for a week, just to be sure the habit was broken, but it was more like 24 hours</li>
            <li>short, I have been exceptionally pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>short, I have been exceptionally pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>I tried many different tactics with getting my 4 year old daughter to stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li>After reading previous reviews, I was worried this product would be very strong</li>
            <li>, this product did not work at all, has hardly any taste, I quickly ordered Mavala Stop after reading many good reviews, tested it out my self, then tried with just a small dab on one of his fingers, he stopped finger sucking within a day.</li>
            <li>so I spit down onto my feet, which I&#x27;m pretty sure scared</li>
            <li>daughter has completely stopped sucking her thumbs and fairly quickly, and I now have a full bottle left</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, the bitter taste wasn&#x27;t really that strong.  </li>
            <li>I highly advice this product, along with so much needed positive feedback to help the baby break the habit.</li>
            <li>my daughter loves painting her new long nails :)</li>
            <li>since then I haven&#x27;t had to reapply or anything, she has completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 1/2 yr old to stop his thumb sucking habit and it worked like a charm!!!  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It took DAYS for the taste to completely go away from my fingers!!!</li>
            <li>After using this for 2 weeks they stopped completely!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>No, I mean a lot!  </li>
            <li>Our 3 yr old daughter stooped sucking her thumbs in 1 week!!!</li>
            <li>and he has completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li>3 year old likes it!!!</li>
            <li>my 3yr old son loves his thumbs !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first night was rough on my daughter (and on us), but she very quickly stopped the thumbsucking.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great for a week but my extremely determined 3 year old is now back to sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li>I do occasionally resort back to nail biting when life is particularly stressful, but then putting this stuff on for even just one day &#x27;cures&#x27; me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, this stuff tastes completely useful, so it can make eating finger foods a bit challenging, but</li>
            <li>My son (who turned 7 this year) has been sucking his right thumb since he was 6 months old.  </li>
            <li>My 6 1/2 year old daughter used to suck her two right hand fingers all night and also in the day time.</li>
            <li>Stopped my 6 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking at night almost right away.  </li>
            <li>A couple weeks later, I put this very, very lightly (like small drop) on top of the fingernail paint.</li>
            <li>and my nails are long and strong.  </li>
            <li>She really didn&#x27;t believe she could stop since we had tried so many other things.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the other reviews we knew to put it just on the top of her nail and thumb, so it would not affect the taste of her food.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very disconcerting to stick your finger into your mouth to do something innocent like pick your tooth and to have that unbearably bitter taste follow it!</li>
            <li>other thing I liked about the product is since its applied like a nail polish, I could put it directly on his thumbnails so it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on food if he were eating something by hand.</li>
            <li>There were 2 long nights of her coughing because the stuff was so strong, but it did the job.  </li>
            <li>I must be a good responder though as I have heard of other people still having problems after using similar deterrents.  </li>
            <li>Started using this product about 3 months ago and now my nails are long strong and never chip.</li>
            <li>I made a BIG deal of his nails and he was very proud to show me his little hands every day to see how long his nails were.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially for an older child.</li>
            <li>We applied that to both thumbs along with a lot of positive reinforcement and encouragement (never a negative comment).</li>
            <li>It was kind of funny the first day we applied it, I knew every time she tried to suck her thumb because she would run to the trash or toilet to spit out the bitter taste!  </li>
            <li>While this product helped for a little bit, I found that it was very easy for me to chip off my fingernails and start biting again....</li>
            <li>My only qualm is that the polish comes off very very easily after a day or two so applying over and over is necessary.</li>
            <li>Followed the instruction and applied every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been more than two weeks now</li>
            <li>I am still applying the solution at night while he sleeps (every other night) just to make sure he doesn&#x27;t start up again.  </li>
            <li>My husband DID catch her a week later (2 weeks after the original application) sucking at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>The other products we have used were OK but after a while she got used to the taste and continued to bite her nails.  </li>
            <li>I had tried many other technigues to stop the habit, but nothing worked until Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product will work for most, but not for the extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li>sure there are some kids where other thumb sucking remedies do work.</li>
            <li>This defintely helped my little nail biter be more aware of his habit.</li>
            <li>We originally had bought thum at a local pharmacy and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>and if I ever did, I&#x27;d have bigger problems than nail biting (laugh)!  </li>
            <li>After the first application it began its magic and after only a week of applying it (and that&#x27;s only been two applications because you paint it on once every two days)</li>
            <li>I am excited about finally having nails!</li>
            <li>I made a big deal about it and she became excited about trying it.  </li>
            <li>But if I&#x27;m able to help one other person out there</li>
            <li>But if I&#x27;m able to help one other person out there</li>
            <li>She has been so excited to be a big girl now, too.  </li>
            <li>So, if you plan to use this on a young child, you might want to start out applying a minimal amount to the tip of the thumbnail, and be aware that the effects may be more far-reaching than you intend.</li>
            <li>BUT this also means french fries and finger foods are no longer finger friendly.</li>
            <li>For a second I got excited that this just might work.</li>
            <li>Recommend to many other friends.</li>
            <li>Directions say to repeat coat every other day, so hoping it will go away soon :)</li>
            <li>have used so many other products and they never work.</li>
            <li>My guess is it would work better with other kids, but no luck with mine.</li>
            <li>reading the many glowing reviews of this product on this and other websites, we decided to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She had to learn to eat food with her other hand to avoid touching her thumb to her food or her face.  </li>
            <li>I think it is safe to say I am officially no longer a nail bitter!</li>
            <li>Just as many other reviewers I bought this from my child&#x27;s dentist to stop him from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>This product works so much better than any other product I tried for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>be sure to put it on all fingers every other day</li>
            <li>I am also happy to report that he now has enough new growth that I actually had to clip several nails.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re as eager as anyone to find a magic bullet to fix this problem, but we have concluded that using alcohol and solvents of unknown efficacy and safety is too high a risk.  </li>
            <li>My beautiful little 3 year old girl sucked on her thumb like an addict chased their next high.</li>
            <li>I read all of the great reviews but remained skeptical since my 5yo daughter was an avid thumbsucker.</li>
            <li>Our son was pretty much born with his thumb in his mouth, where it stayed until he was 3-1/2 years old</li>
            <li>oI was very hopeful in the beginning when I first used this product on my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li>BUT not nasty enough, apparently.  </li>
            <li>Point two is important because generally this is a sub-conscious habit that I believe I&#x27;ll need to consciously break.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to use it any more now and just clipped his nails for the first time in quite a while a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>At almost 4 she shouldn&#x27;t really remember the trauma of it when she is older.  </li>
            <li>and she is more active now , her speech is improving as well.</li>
            <li>Ok it works but the whole experience is probably not worth it.</li>
            <li>It knocks the taste of the product down a good bit, especially after getting a bath.</li>
            <li>you bite your nails, chew up the skins of your fingers or enjoy picking up change off the ground with ease due to healthy long fingernails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so grateful as she is a different child, more social and talkative, not to mention her bite is improving!</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly for anyone who wants to quit.</li>
            <li>Thanks, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any family whose child wants to stop.  </li>
            <li>I first bought it about 3 years ago, and held off submitting a review because I wanted to see if it really worked long term, since I&#x27;ve only ever been able to stop biting my nails temporarily.</li>
            <li>(Yesterday, I caught him in his sleep putting them in his mouth, but the he made a funny face and took them right back out and went on sleeping!)</li>
            <li>The first day he put his fingers in his mouth repeatedly and pulled them right back out.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, my daughter has also declared that she no longer needs her \\&quot;special white blanket\\&quot; which she used to rub on while she was sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I explained to my daughter that it was time for her to be a big girl and that this special polish was going to help her do that.</li>
            <li>this after reading the reviews; immediately following the first application he stuck his thumb in his mouth and spit it right out.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know why, I just do - take a quick swipe of them with my hand, swiping all 5 at the same time.</li>
            <li>The bitter taste it has is so incredibly intense that it outweighs even my strong urge to bite.</li>
            <li>I would suggest only making a quick swipe across the nail bed as it doesn&#x27;t take much on the finger to keep it out of the mouth.</li>
            <li>It goes away and is easily washed away, but it&#x27;s enough to keep you conscious of what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product worked for about a day and half until my daughter (2 years old) decided she liked it and proceeded to bite her nails anyway.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for people to be giving less stars if it didn&#x27;t work on their younger kids.</li>
            <li>In the past 4 weeks we have had amazing results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works exactly like a clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeping it around to actually use in future if he doesn&#x27;t naturally stop sucking his thumb at bed time, but for now I&#x27;d call it a huge success!</li>
            <li>Beware though, the first night, he was up all night spitting and needing water to clear the taste out of his mouth.</li>
            <li>This put a bitter taste in her mouth and worked from the very first time we used it, we&#x27;re on day 6 of no thumbsucking (day and night) and she is getting a party to celebrate her success.</li>
            <li>We first tried using this on our 2.5 yr old for thumb sucking and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My two year old stopped sucking her thumb the whole weekend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid nail and cuticle biter since I was 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>My two-year old sucked her thumb consistently while sleeping</li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumb immediately after the first application.  </li>
            <li>but we could not use it full fledged as the box says \\&quot;only for 3+ yrs\\</li>
            <li>It somewhat deterred him, mostly because of the idea of it I think, but I had to reapply it daily and two weeks into the whole process he is still biting his fingers and nails albeit not quite as often as prior to our using Mavala.</li>
            <li>What turned into a cool trick is now a gross problem.</li>
            <li>First we tried \\&quot;THUM,\\&quot; which my 3 1/2 year old just sucked off.  </li>
            <li>We painted it on our 3 year old thumbs the first night and it has been 3 weeks</li>
            <li>the thumb sucking came back full force.  </li>
            <li>We tried this on our 3-year old and the first 2 days he did not like it at all and stopped sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li>This has worked pretty well for my 5 yr old son, although I think pool water (chlorine or something) makes it come</li>
            <li>and it only took about 2 full days for her to stop completly.</li>
            <li>My three year old at first didn&#x27;t like the taste but</li>
            <li>My son stopped completely after first use.</li>
            <li>The first time we applied it to our 2-year old daughter&#x27;s thumbs, she stopped.  </li>
            <li>I first tried Thums on my 2 year old daughter when she started biting her nails.</li>
            <li>It might be useful for a very taste sensitive child or an adult that just want&#x27;s a reminder.</li>
            <li>At bedtime, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and got a full taste which caused her to gag and throw up several times.</li>
            <li>It did make my 2 yr old throw up the first time I put it on his thumb</li>
            <li>I have a full bottle left and don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my niece, who was three years old when she first tried it.</li>
            <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 33 years old and my nails are &amp;#34;human sized&amp;#34; for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>He would not put his fingers near his mouth after the first application.</li>
            <li>My four year old stopped sucking his thumb from the first night</li>
            <li>thumb guards are the only true solution.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm;) It helps with stopping my three year old from sucking her thumb, she hates the taste, therefor she stops and restrains herself from putting her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li>I made my peace by realizing she eats her boogers (from time to time) and occasionally indulges in a mouth full of dirt for and afternoon snack.</li>
            <li>First let me say, do not let the rating of 2 sway you completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mavala Stop since I received it and although it hasn&#x27;t completely prevented my granddaughter from sucking her two fingers, she is aware that she will receive the &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; on her fingers if she places them in her mouth.</li>
            <li>My 2.5yr old son stuck his thumb in his mouth on the first day that he was born.</li>
            <li>Within the first week I completely stopped biting.</li>
            <li>It definitely lasted a full day or two.  </li>
            <li>7 yr old missed lots of sleep first night since started sucking as fell asleep then ended up trying to wash out the taste.</li>
            <li>Just after the first time I used it it made me quit biting completely for over 3 years....</li>
            <li>The first time she sucked her thumb, she gagged and almost puked,i kept a trash can near her</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t solve the problem as my child was sucking her thumb a week later with 2 full coats of polish on each thumb.</li>
            <li>I found her sucking her thumb in the middle of the night with a full coat on thumb nail.  </li>
            <li>After the first application wore off, he did reverto to old ways</li>
            <li>The thumbsucking completely stopped about one month after applying the first application.</li>
            <li>was exactly what we were looking for to get our 4 year old to stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and the bottle still looks as full as it did the day it arrived.  </li>
            <li>3.5 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumbs in the first day.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s highly sensitive to tastes, and so when we first put it on, he cried and howled and swore he&#x27;d never let us do it again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Advice for nail-biters (unrelated to the product) : I got acrylic nails on top of my severely bitten nails (down to the cuticles).</li>
            <li>I noticed one of her nails had been bitten down, so I used it one more time.  </li>
            <li>and they were both amazed and were sure to write down the name of the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how conditioning works even when you&#x27;re older than a child - when this is on my nails, my hands are NOT going near my mouth.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I used Mavala instead of a thumb guard because in hindsight, if I&#x27;d gotten a thumb guard, she would&#x27;ve just sucked her other fingers!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to many other moms!</li>
            <li>It felt dry to me before I&#x27;d went to bed, but I found that about an hour to an hour and a half were the best times for it to be totally dry!</li>
            <li>I had little faith, thinking it similar to another \\&quot;paint on\\&quot; product that had no effect, but the reviews were good, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>The clear coat is a little shiny and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>It is so strong that even eating a sandwich, crackers, etc would allow enough contact to get a full taste of the bitter flavor.  </li>
            <li>I went out and bought brand new nail polish to celebrate!  </li>
            <li>We also gave her an incentive to stop sucking her thumb ( a new bike!)  </li>
            <li>So as we laid him down, we quickly turned on the video monitor because we knew that thumb would quickly go in.</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes that this product would work since my destist recommended it to me, however, this did not work for my 3 year old son, he have a very sirious thumb sucking habbit.</li>
            <li>This did not work for my 3.5 year old daughter, but I think it&#x27;s due more to the fact that she is very stubborn.</li>
            <li>I need to get a new bottle, as he is sucking his thumb again since it broke (though not as much).  </li>
            <li>When probed, she just said, &amp;#34;Yeah, it tastes kind of bad, but I kind of like it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Heard it many times and each time, we tried to change the subject.  </li>
            <li>I had previously bought some thumbsucking gloves, but he was able to take them off.</li>
            <li>At the end of a week it will be duller and more matte, but also less effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the end of a week it will be duller and more matte, but also less effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We literally applied this TWICE, just to the top half of his thumb nail, over the course of 4 days.  </li>
            <li>We were able to stop using mavala after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>he was playing with toys more, and sucked his finger less.</li>
            <li>It takes about a day in a half before he&#x27;s able to start putting his thumb in his mouth</li>
            <li>and he has tried once more in the week and a half of using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Mavala Stop is so bitter, and so easily transferable from fingers to food, that after one application and one ruined meal my son tearfully promised not to bite his nails again, and for a month now has not.  </li>
            <li>This has surely help to curve the habit of my daughter sucking her finger in less than a week</li>
            <li>He used about half the bottle and it took about two weeks to reduce and two more to quit.</li>
            <li>Beware though - initially you will be ruining finger foods and the like - as others have attested to - however, you quickly learn how to work around this.</li>
            <li>It has such mild unnoticeable taste FOR ME that I had to test it on two friends.</li>
            <li>I was able to get my 8-year-old son to stop nail-biting entirely after only three applications.</li>
            <li>biting - 0.2 Oz / Pack, 3 Packs]], which wore off quickly and had to be constantly reapplied.  </li>
            <li>(we&#x27;d recently taken away her pacifier and she&#x27;d quickly replaced it with her thumb...</li>
            <li>They learned really quickly though and now, one week later, they have both stopped.</li>
            <li>My older one got scared watching her and has stopped biting her nails.</li>
            <li>It also was still on his nails several days later - even after washing his hands many times.  </li>
            <li>By Monday afternoon, I could see decent nail growth on both children.</li>
            <li>I would recommend some sort of &amp;#34;special shirt&amp;#34; (closed off hands) or thumb guard for night time, and then mavala during the day, when it is more of a battle of wills or a conscious decision to suck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li>I think it was easier when she was older and had the will to do it.</li>
            <li>Super simple to apply it is just like nail polish.</li>
            <li>She wouldn&#x27;t go back to sucking that thumb even after several days when I was sure it had worn off</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with an older child.</li>
            <li>My son mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime, and during the night.</li>
            <li>In the end, it had reduced the sucking tremendously and I only catch her every now</li>
            <li>You only have to put it on every 3 days or so, and it dries quickly when</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting I&#x27;ll have nice long nails before too long.</li>
            <li>My main concern with both Hoof and Malvala is that the lingering bitterness will desensitize my daughter too it.</li>
            <li>Overall these challenges are avoidable if careful, and its a really effective product.  </li>
            <li>So ending your nail-biting habit if anxiety related might take more than a simple paint on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle has more than enough in it to last for what we need and the product does work for us.  </li>
            <li>We tried many different things to get her to stop, reward charts, painting nails with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>She likes to suck on two of her fingers on a particular hand</li>
            <li>The next day, we applied more but this time on a larger surface area of his thumb.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, he did not put it back in.</li>
            <li>few years ago, I had several I thought to be good bouts of non-biting after reading this book</li>
            <li>I had tried a different product called Thumb that worked for about zero seconds, the taste was really mild and was probably meant for toddlers.</li>
            <li>however, this clever girls knows when I forget to put no the Mavala</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work, my son was waaaaay tooooooo clever for this item.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the texture.  </li>
            <li>Works decently.</li>
            <li>appears to last a good few months&lt;</li>
            <li>I also make sure to keep her nails as short as possible.</li>
            <li>My older daughter did have a gagging episode, but just once.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and keeps parent from being the constant enforcer.</li>
            <li>The next time, I put on more and also tested it on her older sister, just to see if it was actually working.  </li>
            <li>but as she was getting older it became a habit.</li>
            <li>My main problem with this product is that it made my daughter gag and cry.  </li>
            <li>The box does state that toddlers may find the bitter taste appealing because of under developed taste buds.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied several times a day and works instantly.</li>
            <li>I have daughters who are much older and knew if she didn&#x27;t stop now, she never would.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work, try it again when they&#x27;re older.  </li>
            <li>The older one just powered through it and sucked it all off ...</li>
            <li>Later that night I caught myself biting my nail and quickly tasted the Mavala and removed my finger.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe now that he&#x27;s older</li>
            <li>Probably works well for adults and older motivated kids.  </li>
            <li>Couple of days later he actually started asking for more solution as he managed to develop a taste for it.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I think if the child is older they would figure out how to scratch the coating off or otherwise remove it.  </li>
            <li>I always believe the more expensive the better the product.</li>
            <li>The official who responded to our inquiry seemed concerned about the solvents and alcohol that form the main ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>but I would say not till shes older.</li>
            <li>During that time I have tried many many products along with willpower to stop - all failed.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY different methods to stop nail biting and this is the ONLY product that has worked for me!</li>
            <li>Children are clever and can put two and two together.  </li>
            <li>then quickly so I applied it again next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Your nails will definitely grow quickly and it also works as a hardener.  </li>
            <li>When she gets older, if she has problems, i will give it a try.</li>
            <li>I would  never last more than a couple days without starting up the habit once again</li>
            <li>This product stays on your nails, even after washing your hands, and has a strong bitter taste that lingers.  </li>
            <li>(made it kind of like a fun game</li>
            <li>The bitter taste was so strong that she could not stand to put her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>She was reluctant to put her fingers in her mouth because of the strong bitter taste.</li>
            <li>Well, the very first day I put that stuff on I (again, absentmindedly) took a quick double swipe of my left hand...</li>
            <li>This was (very little) money well spent for such great results!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy my kids really want to get rid of this bad habit themselves, they like that their nails are longer now and not ugly and all chewed up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really quite surprised at how well this product works!</li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t taste much so it was already wearing off pretty well, but it was enough to stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying my second bottle right now, it really works.</li>
            <li>Only word of caution for this product - its really strong, and you will taste it if you are not careful while eating with your hands.  </li>
            <li>While I think emotional and mental readiness certainly played a role, I was surprised at how well Mavala Stop put her over the top on the first night.</li>
            <li>Washing your hands seems to dull it out more quickly, and removes some of the taste, but not all, by far.</li>
            <li>Washing your hands seems to dull it out more quickly, and removes some of the taste, but not all, by far.</li>

            <li>: Ethyl acetate is a respiratory tract irritant and, at high concentrations, it causes narcosis and depression of heart function [Hathaway et al. 1991].</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The first two days I didn&#x27;t get a taste of it at all as I was very conscious about putting my hands anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li>high price to pay for a habit that will wear off eventually.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>I do think that it is important though to make sure you only apply the mavala on the nail bed only try not to touch the skin, my theory is that this will help not to have the bitter taste while she eats and touches the skin.</li>
            <li>Well, we tried it because of the high, high rating.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and I NEVER write reviews.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on his thumb he must have forgot it was on and threw up a little, but after that he was fine.  </li>
            <li>I tried many other polishes with my 5 year old that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my one-year old and did not realize this is for older kids... much older!</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews for this product, I was so excited that I finally found something that would get my 3 year old son to stop sucking his finger.</li>
            <li>After trying some other creative ways of breaking the habit, I decided to purchase Mavala Stop to see if it would deter me from putting my fingers near my mouth.</li>
            <li>and I honestly thought that it would not work since this is for 3yr+ due to to smaller kids</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t something I will intentional put anywhere near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We were almost certain nothing would help our 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Before I begin my review, a little bit of background of who was using it: I&#x27;m 23 years old now, but when I was very young I noticed my mother biting her own nails, and in my toddler mind, I thought I was supposed to mimic her, which resulted in a very fierce nail biting habit from my early childhood.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and would recommend it for those kids who can understand a little better and are a little older.</li>
            <li>you read that correct, one time of putting \\&quot;clear nail polish\\&quot; to have her stop sucking her thumb!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;Oh, that tastes a little funky.\\</li>
            <li>and when she got her first taste of it she had a major fall out.  </li>
            <li>And that little bit of encouragement made the tears stop and made her hold her thumb out and say, \\&quot;OK, Mommy</li>
            <li>It is a little shiny, but it looks a lot better than having mangled nails from biting.</li>
            <li>That night I applied a little more on both thumbs.</li>
            <li>I finally ordered this and after the first time i put it on her thumb, she hasn&#x27;t sucked it since!</li>
            <li>recommend this product completely!!  </li>
            <li>Sure, this little bottle or putrid stuff is like $14.</li>
            <li>Our eighteen month old has been sucking her thumb with gusto since she was born!!</li>
            <li>Okay, I have been biting my nails since I was a little kid.</li>
            <li>so it looks okay, just a little shine.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never put your hands near your mouth again!!</li>
            <li>Any time there is even a little bit of &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; at the top of my nail, its gone within the day.</li>
            <li>Of course every child is different and results will vary but if you are consistent it does work!</li>
            <li>The taste is more like a little zap-</li>
            <li>My 8-yr-old son has white at the tips of his fingernails for the first time since he was 2!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a battle, so what actually transpired was not how I was imagining this whole thing would go, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier, that&#x27;s for certain!</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year old suddenly started biting her nails right down until they were sore and bright red.  </li>
            <li>Just in time for her adult teeth to grow in and most importantly, she won&#x27;t get sick as much!!!!</li>
            <li>This most certainly has.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small bottle</li>
            <li>other than that its been way easy.</li>
            <li>However, the taste of the nail polish is easily transferred to other things like finger foods (chips etc.).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use (like applying nail polish) and we&#x27;ve not yet noticed any change in her diet (due to transfer of the taste to her food).</li>
            <li>My son has no idea that he even puts his thumb in his mouth, so it&#x27;s hard for him to stop on his own.</li>
            <li>I had been encouraging her to stop, but it was too hard for her to break the habit on her own.</li>
            <li>Nit worth 1 cent let alone the actual high price.</li>
            <li>The first night was hard, as he woke up every time he put his thumb in his mostly asleep mouth...</li>
            <li>Sure beats having to get braces somewhere down the road because of thumbsucking!</li>
            <li>Make sure to put only a little bit on top of her fingernails because that stuff stays on for a long time and it will get on anything she touches.</li>
            <li>It came super fast and worked so well on my one daughter the other one, not so much.......</li>
            <li>We sat down with her and offered to put on &#x27;special nail polish&#x27;, but in return would also paint the rest of her nails for the first time.</li>
            <li>was not as impressed as I thought I would be with this product it does not taste as bad as it should taste, it is shiny</li>
            <li>Really, though, I&#x27;d rather have the attention to pitted, cracked, and short nails, than I would to a swollen, red finger filled with some sort of infectious goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, though, I&#x27;d rather have the attention to pitted, cracked, and short nails, than I would to a swollen, red finger filled with some sort of infectious goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far, I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this really works, so far i haven&#x27;t seen my son put his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with Tourette&#x27;s/OCD and have struggled with nail biting my whole life.  </li>
            <li>yr old dad who has also been biting his nails his whole life stopped after using Mavala.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to break this habit before she started getting her adult teeth in.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old sucked her thumb so much</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in over a week, and they have grown longer than they&#x27;ve ever been (which isn&#x27;t all that far, haha).  </li>
            <li>However, didn&#x27;t work very well for my 6 yr old to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>six year old daughter sucked her thumb very often.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 17 year old daughter who has bitten her nails her whole life.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was skeptical, but this product is inexpensive and works great for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you want to keep reapplying, but that can get tiresome.</li>
            <li>Great concept but useless when a child gets to a point where he/</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to prevent my 6 yrs old daughter from sucking her thumb,and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li>While the incision looks normal, I&#x27;m pretty sure she managed to pull out at least some of her surface stitches.  </li>
            <li>old daughter get ready for braces.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely amazed how fast it worked.</li>
            <li>My 5-year old twin daughters absolutely refused to stop sucking their thumbs.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that he won&#x27;t put his hands near his mouth.</li>
            <li>Great bitter, bitter taste which definitely stops my nervous nail nibbling habit.  </li>
            <li>My 6 1/2 yr old daughter has sucked her thumb her whole life.  </li>
            <li>But with a young child, it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how fast my 13 year old stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>Also used it on our 5 year old niece and it worked very well for her.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for my 10 year old son.  </li>
            <li>This worked really well to help my 3 year old stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter really wanted to stop sucking her fingers, but she said she didn&#x27;t know how to stop.</li>
            <li>It must really stay on there, because my 6.5 year old says he can taste it for a day or two after I paint it on--even after washing his hands.  </li>
            <li>He was sucking on the fingers so much that he has sores on both of those fingers and the nails are extremely soft and brittle.</li>
            <li>my 20 month old  son would suck his thumb so much that he got marks on his thumb from it...</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to be very regular in applying it during the crucial early phase when they need the most help.</li>
            <li>We kept on using it for a few more weeks, but now we do not even need to do that.</li>
            <li>But it wouldn&#x27;t be cute when in a few years her teeth would be all misaligned and we would be paying substantial orthodontic bills.  </li>
            <li>He was unaware he was using his tongue &amp; if an another kid saw it they would laugh.</li>
            <li>Overall I can&#x27;t stop singing this products success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price to not just grow out your nails but break the entire habit..</li>
            <li>I feel like one bottle is going to last me a long time even though I use it every so many days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Click buy, have your children be responsible for applying it, and move on to the next challenge as a parent ;).</li>
            <li>For a normal nail biter who doesn&#x27;t mind the glossy look</li>
            <li>you the same success--</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to use all of the contents in the jar because it was dried shut.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been chewing his fingernails for at least 20 years by his own account.  </li>
            <li>some crying in the night (need some compromise on your sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: tried to thumbsuck one time, just to be sure I applied again.</li>
            <li>first few hrs were filled with tears and mommy giving him OJ to wash away the taste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loaned it out to several friends, who&#x27;ve also had success with it.</li>
            <li>A few tantrums occurred which we assist her through by distracting her with book reading, a bubble bath and lots of love and encouragement.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>But that is not a negative thing...</li>
            <li>We applied for a few weeks just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Overall for the price of this product it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Assuming I would need to reapply in two nights, as instructed, I figured it would be a week or two before success would be achieved, but it WORKED with only ONE use!</li>
            <li>Finally, our ped dentist nicely told us he was destroying his mouth and gently insisted we stop listening to mommy bloggers and use this product.</li>
            <li>He stated that it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;tasty\\&quot; and pretty much kept it out of his mouth the entire time for that day.</li>
            <li>if she used it everyday, I&#x27;m sure that it would keep her from biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>Today I actually had to trim most of my nails (before this photo was taken) because they were getting too long.</li>
            <li>Their tastebuds are definitely not developed enough to be able to dislike this and stop finger sucking.</li>
            <li>the nail beds are beginning to take the shape of normal beds which may occur in another 6 months or so from what I read.  </li>
            <li>Not their fault, but if you are going to get this product, make sure that you are going to stick with it and not eat finger foods for a few weeks/months.</li>
            <li>Is been 11/2 month since she stop sucking her tomb that even her tomb looks like normal.  </li>
            <li>My thumb-sucking daughter \\&quot;tasted\\&quot; this product only about 3 or 4 times before deciding it wasn&#x27;t worth \\&quot;tasting\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li>never expected it to work that fast or that well!</li>
            <li>I have to reapply it at least twice a week for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>went to a local salon and started with a fresh manicure.</li>
            <li>I have tried eating normal food (e.g. cut fruits or chips).with my fingers as well.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it stays on the nails for a long time, so if you give your kid finger foods to eat they will still be able to taste the bitterness and might not like that food</li>
            <li>We never discussed it, she never complained and let me reapply without a fight,&lt;br /&gt;Done</li>
            <li>A few days to a week and things should be much better at night.  </li>
            <li>Dream come true solution for our almost 5 year old son who was sucking his thumb still at bedtime or for comfort occasionally on couch.</li>
            <li>My son will be 3 in a few more months and has sucked 2 of his fingers forever.</li>
            <li>but now they are a normal mens length</li>
            <li>the reviews said and now I&#x27;m left with about $9.75 out of $10 worth of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>So once again it has to be applied at least twice  a week in order to be effective.</li>
            <li>I did apply the Mavala stop every few days for almost 3 weeks just to make sure we didn&#x27;t have a relapse.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend starting this on a weekend, though - she didn&#x27;t get much sleep the first night because she kept sticking her thumb in her mouth inadvertently</li>
            <li>If there is one negative thing it is that it makes your nails looks kind of glossy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but in this I will because the reviews that I read did help me decide to make this purchase</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t normally be an issue, but I have found this stuff to give me a sore throat akin to strep in severity.  </li>
            <li>We bought her a book, showed her pictures of crooked teeth from thumb sucking, and tried to put colorful band aids on her thumbs.</li>
            <li>so be sure to be consistant and re-apply few times.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, she only threw a minor fit during her second application.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, she only threw a minor fit during her second application.  </li>
            <li>This definitely worked for us and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Within a few days he stopped biting them for the most part and then within a week he was done biting them altogether.  </li>
            <li>and they taste pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>Now a month later, we&#x27;re just about ready to cut his nails for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>I red the reviews and thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>No negative effects.</li>
            <li>When I read the negative reviews about it being too strong, I thought, this is exactly what I need!</li>
            <li>Great product but starts to dry out a little after a bit but still worked well!!</li>
            <li>Applied the first night while asleep-- she coughed and gagged mildly a couple of times, but that was it; has barely put her thumb in her mouth since then (5 days later), and she was a frequent thumb-sucker.  </li>
            <li>And of course the first thing she did was put her fingers in her mouth to only find the strong bitter taste to be so displeasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first we thought maybe we didn&#x27;t make the right decision by telling her it was bitter nail polish and what it was going to do.  </li>
            <li>Our 5 year old son has been biting his nails since he was old enough to bring his fingers to his mouth and no amount of reminding, begging, rewards, removal of favorite toys or other creative solutions would stop him from biting his nails past the quick.... and he would even gnaw his cuticles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes your nails are a bit shiny after applying Mavala Stop, which more or less equates to a clear coat of nail polish that tastes horrendous....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing it for 25+ years and have half hazardously tried to stop several times to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure to put on nails only and let it dry.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for children under 3 because their taste buds are not fully developed and can easily adapt to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li>The second day it might not be strong enough to keep them from sucking or nail bitting.</li>
            <li>Finally a product was strong enough to break the will of a stubborn 7 year-old with a 5 year habit of biting nails!!!!  </li>
            <li>I found that even after washing my hands several times a day and even taking a shower the taste still will linger for a second day though it is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>I found that even after washing my hands several times a day and even taking a shower the taste still will linger for a second day though it is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>reviews for Mavala were so great and cost was minimal compared to the other options, I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been explaining to her that she is a big girl and needs to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I think alternatives like this that will require much attention and consideration to use properly don&#x27;t get suggested by the docs because they presume that most people are not willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li>It does begin to wash off within a couple days and needs to be reapplied but even so the single bottle has been more than enough.  </li>
            <li>This product, though applied properly, transferred to any food my son touched and he tried to quit eating for days because nothing tasted right.</li>
            <li>But after a day, she went right back to sucking her thumb even with nightly applications.</li>
            <li>then he was right back to sucking.</li>
            <li>My daughter stopped sucking her thumb right away, especially at night when we had the hardest time with it.  </li>
            <li>simce he was about 14 months, right after i had my 2nd son and took his binki away!!</li>
            <li>Only works while she is awake, but as soon as she falls asleep her thumb goes right in her mouth and does not seem to bother her</li>
            <li>It worked for maybe a week and he was right back to it.</li>
            <li>(it lasts for about a day) and she&#x27;ll go right back to sucking.</li>
            <li>I applied it on my son&#x27;s right thumbnail the same day we got it just before his bed time.</li>
            <li>She then commented that it &amp;#34;tasted funny&amp;#34; and put it right back in her mouth.</li>
            <li>Put the finger right back in.</li>
            <li>He is right back to biting and no amount of polish is working.</li>
            <li>Anytime we washed his hands, for instance after he used the bathroom or came in from playing outside, it seemed to wash right off</li>
            <li>We just jumped right back on it when we got home.</li>
            <li>My kids ignored it or washed their hands to get it off then went right back to nail biting.</li>
            <li>and he would have his thumb right back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>so I put it right back on.</li>
            <li>but then she just gets over it and goes right back to it.  </li>
            <li>it was only his right hand</li>
            <li>so she pulls it right back out.  </li>
            <li>but she&#x27;d go right back to sucking her thumbs as soon as we stopped applying it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;7 mths later my son is 4 yrs old &amp; occasionally we will find him sucking his thumb in his sleep or find evidence of it because his thumb is cracked &amp; dry, but during the day he is free of thumb sucking which is perfectly fine with us.</li>
            <li>This stuff works unbelievably well, the bitter taste is so strong you definitely will not be able to bite through it!</li>
            <li>At her last dentist appointment the dentist said she was going to loose her top and bottom front teeth because of the pressure she was putting on the teeth while sucking.  </li>
            <li>the taste that this leaves in your mouths really reminds you (very abruptly) not to do it.</li>
            <li>I was afraid he would cry or not be able to put himself to sleep with out his fingers, but he did fine!</li>
            <li>The following night pretty much the exact same thing happened.  </li>
            <li>bottle recommends putting it on every other day, which I will say is accurate.  </li>
            <li>and my pinky was becoming a shriveled mess.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son constantly bit his nails, and this worked well as long as he had it, but he kept fussing about not being able to eat, and refused application all together.</li>
            <li>The real dark magic happens when you try to bit a nail coated in this transparent horror</li>
            <li>because the first day, after lots of talk about being such a big girl, a fun reward if she stopped, etc.</li>
            <li>This seems to work great and the small size will still last quite a while, even with regular applications.  </li>
            <li>(my habit is extremely stubborn, and even when I stopped using this product because I thought I had defeated the habit I found myself making mistakes unconsciously time and again), but the longevity of the product means it&#x27;s always available when I start to slip up and need it&#x27;s not-so-gentle reminder again.</li>
            <li>5 (almost 6) year old girl is a little more stubborn.  </li>
            <li>It worked like a miracle :) i got this product, had the same old long talk with her and applied it on her finger before entering a movie theater to keep her mind off of it</li>
            <li>It definitely kept me from biting my nails, but was a little TOO effective.  </li>
            <li>On their website they say that there is going to be a new kit for nail biting.  </li>
            <li>and that she has now found a new confidence in herself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gotten fed up with my 5 year olds new \\&quot;finger chewing\\&quot; habit and ordered this.  </li>
            <li>I tried New Years resolutions, hypnosis, and \\&quot;No</li>
            <li>For fellow guys, you will want acetone to remove layers before applying new ones.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We will keep the new bottle on hand for a lot longer this time.</li>
            <li>I have found a new method in which I chew gum a lot</li>
            <li>Tried everything - sewing socks on her pjs at nite, dipping her fingers in vinegar, putting tape/bandaids on her fingers at nite, distracting her, helping her to develop new habits, taping gloves on her hands at nite, telling her that if she stopped sucking her fingers she could go to Disneyland.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>The new problem now is she doesn&#x27;t want to break or file her nails....</li>
            <li>So my lil man who is newly minted five year didn&#x27;t argue or stay put for the polish job</li>
            <li>Now I am on the hook for a new bicycle and a trip to the aquarium...</li>
            <li>My son just started a new school</li>
            <li>He stopped within 24 hours of application and now he reminds me when it is time to put on a new application.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely live on without finer biting habits, but I cannot live a day without any non-bitter chip/cookie.</li>
            <li>It is my new year resolution.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her new pediatric dentist recommended Mavala.  </li>
            <li>from  New York, USA</li>
            <li>he goes around tapping his newly grown nails on every surface in the house...</li>
            <li>I put a new coat on one a week.</li>
            <li>Out of nowhere one night I decided to look up new treatments for nail biters, thinking maybe some new miracle cure has came out.  </li>
            <li>It is still new to us but seems to be working.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been doing this a couple of years and really wants to stop, but has had a hard time and hasn&#x27;t been able to.  </li>
            <li>She used so little of the product that she was able to give it to someone else who had a similar positive experience with it.  </li>
            <li>effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN\\&quot; has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can&#x27;t be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!!  </li>
            <li>But touching your lips is also a bad habit, so that&#x27;s kind of a plus.</li>
            <li>One slight drawback I have noticed about this product is that it comes off easily during showering, so</li>
            <li>latter when she&#x27;s older and, hopefully, more sensitive to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li>We only had success with one child, the 6.5 year old nail biter.  </li>
            <li>maybe if she was older like 3 years old i would try it again, hopefully she wont need it.</li>
            <li>It really is a bitter taste that lasts a good few minutes.</li>
            <li>Even my own Mom had applied a few products to my thumb as a child, but I simply washed it off.  </li>
            <li>As far as negative reinforcement is concerned, this product is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old took a while to get used to and kept on trying to put it back in his mouth, but the taste kept on reminding him that well, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>One slip and your entire mouth and lips are filled with a gross taste that you never want to experience again.</li>
            <li>I will try that with my 2 year old IF it doesn&#x27;t work &#x27;as is&#x27; when he&#x27;s older.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use this product for a few months and now have basically stopped chewing completely.</li>
            <li>However, by the third day, I didn&#x27;t really think that much about it.</li>
            <li>Our son is almost 4 years old and mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime or for comfort when he was upset.</li>
            <li>of course at some point in time, my fingers were in my mouth and my taste buds were instantly assaulted by the most foul, bitter taste ever.  </li>
            <li>I am a compulsive nail biter and before this product I have tried numerous products available at local pharmacies to try to help me stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for my 4 years old son.</li>
            <li>I finally have normal looking, not gnarly nails, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>has been a little harder, and we have found we do have to be more consistent with reapplying the polish with him; however, with the polish on, he does avoid sucking his fingers much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the stuff i tried before was very thick and almost fun to bite off, i was pretty sure that this would be the same.  </li>
            <li>As long as you put this on about every three days till they dont have the desire it really really works!!</li>
            <li>It may seem a little extreme, but I think with the right approach and lots of communication, you can handle the situation the best way possible to cure the habit without traumatizing your little one.  </li>
            <li>It may seem a little extreme, but I think with the right approach and lots of communication, you can handle the situation the best way possible to cure the habit without traumatizing your little one.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re an adult and dedicated to breaking the habit, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter is nearly 5 and with kindergarten imminent, and flu season in high swing we decided</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes of breaking my daughter (6yrs old) of sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>But I have to speak up for this product; I believe it could work if your child has a very sensitive palette.</li>
            <li>I never thou my litter will leave this habiat in only 1 week, thak you very much for  selling this product.</li>
            <li>In my case to help remember not to put the thumb in his mouth, I wrapped a very soft tape below the nails to remind him not to put the thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li>It will definitely deter anyone from biting as the taste is very very strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worked right away to deter my 3 year old from sucking.</li>
            <li>We checked on her, and there she was fast asleep, thumb in mouth, so before nap the next day I applied a little more.</li>
            <li>It needs to be reapplied every few days as it tends to wear off pretty quick.</li>
            <li>My five year old started kindergarten this year!</li>
            <li>wow this stuff does!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t taste it at first but 5 seconds later you can&#x27;t get the taste out of your mouth for anything, can&#x27;t describe it....</li>
            <li>The product did only work during the first night, but my daughter hasn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb thereafter...</li>
            <li>, because i only needed that first week to break my habit, after that u should be in control.</li>
            <li>The only problem is I can see her teeth are slowly starting to turn, I can only imagine what a year more of this habit may incur - thank goodness</li>
            <li>My son is an avid thumb-sucker, so this was our last resort.  </li>
            <li>Last night I had to cut his nails for the very fist time since he was 3!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It has been 3 weeks, and he essentially stopped sucking after the first application.</li>
            <li>I do have to say she didn&#x27;t like the taste on that first night and even made herself throw up, but that was the only night she did that.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>old stopped sucking their thumbs!</li>
            <li>and she seems to have completely forgotten the habit!</li>
            <li>Also, please note, the package insert says that it likely WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN 3 AND UNDER as their taste buds don&#x27;t have the same sensitivity to the bitter taste.  </li>
            <li>I asked my nephew if it burned and said it only did once because my sister didn&#x27;t put the lotion first.</li>
            <li>I asked my nephew if it burned and said it only did once because my sister didn&#x27;t put the lotion first.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time last week and not bitten my nails since.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical at first, but when I finally saw nails of my son after one week of applying Mavala, my scepticism disappeared.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first night of using it, I noticed she kept her finger out of her mouth the following day</li>
            <li>Just needed 3 applications over 6 days and it stopped my 3 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking habit!  </li>
            <li>Its been almost 3 weeks and for the first time in my life, I can actually see the \\&quot;whites\\&quot; of my nails growing.</li>
            <li>I apply it every other day on top of my regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Mavala Stop for a month and my nails are growing, I am seeing white nail for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>First time in recent memory that I have quit \\&quot;chewen\\&quot; my nails for over a month.  </li>
            <li>She was so used to sucking her thumb to go to sleep we had to give her lots of extra TLC to help her go to sleep the first night.</li>
            <li>First I purchased Thum, which she had her fingers back in her mouth that evening.</li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks, they both had completely stopped sucking their thumbs!</li>
            <li>After rave reviews online and watching the success with another child (5yr) at school, we had plans to stop our daughter&#x27;s (3.5yr) thumb sucking in one long weekend.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>she never puts her hands near her mouth anymore!.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks he had completely stopped biting his nails!</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using Mavala Stop, she stopped completely!  </li>
            <li>but after the first used and only used I did on him it work</li>
            <li>My 3 1/2 yr old daughter would eat her fingers and toes!</li>
            <li>This was a last resort after trying hot sauce, gloves at night, tape on his thumb, etc.  </li>
            <li>He has completely stopped sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s enough to make him aware of what he is doing without me having to say a word.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t be such a surprise when i first bit my nails.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I havent put my fingers near my mouth in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>But after 5 just days, he had stopped sucking his thumb completely!</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop works pretty well but tends to wear off rather quickly, especially if you wash your hands often.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter would not keep her hands out of her mouth and nose!  </li>
            <li>Her finger wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near her lips!  </li>
            <li>Its not worth , dont buy, its not working for mydaughter, she still bites nail , will update review if sound any change</li>
            <li>my 5 year old daughter stopped after a week of this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mainly, I had to become aware of what I was physically doing so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a problem, since the directions are pretty much obvious (Shake.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a problem, since the directions are pretty much obvious (Shake.</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm to get my 3 year old to stop sucking her 2 fingers!</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes gross, I have tried other stop biting nail in the past, but I was able to &amp;#34;get used to them, this product I do not think I will be able to.</li>
            <li>This was a boy who had his first two fingers in his mouth almost 24/7, and his teeth were already crooked because of it.  </li>
            <li>Of course, this is our last resort, as we&#x27;ve tried MANY other remedies to no avail.  </li>
            <li>she is so used to this nail paint, she almost know when exactly to put her thumb back for sucking after the nail paint is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter has been sucking her thumb since she was born!  </li>
            <li>After a recent visit to the dentist and his suggestion that she really really needed to stop, I bought Mavala Stop!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>The first time I put it on her thumbs, I painted the entire nail.</li>
            <li>First week she cried every night because she didn&#x27;t get her soothing, but a week later she even stopped trying to put her thumb in mouth.</li>
            <li>Helped my 5 year old to stop thumb sucking at night!</li>
            <li>At first I just did the middle of the nail fearing it would ruin his food</li>
            <li>After our first application, she stopped instantly!!!  </li>
            <li>I put it on yesterday, only once, for the first time</li>
            <li>He put them in his mouth for the first time moments later and started coughing.  </li>
            <li>The next day, however, she discovered her OTHER (non-treated) thumb, so I applied more Mavala.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li>Unless he tried again when i wasn&#x27;t looking, that first suck with the Mavala was also the last.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a stubborn 6 year old on my hands!</li>
            <li>My son has gotten used to it but says it&#x27;s still pretty gross.</li>
            <li>Now I have grown pretty solid nails after 35 years, and from time to time keep appreciating my fingers (my co-workers watch me suspiciously..</li>
            <li>Worked for my 6year old son!</li>
            <li>Same with hot sauce.</li>
            <li>Within 5 days she had COMPLETELY stopped sucking her thumb!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>, it was complete torture for her!</li>
            <li>So unbelievably surprised and grateful!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Mavala worked the first day, but by the 2nd day she was sucking her thumbs again.</li>
            <li>and she is terrified to put her hand near her face!</li>
            <li>Worked in a day to get my 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li>but it was only that first night</li>
            <li>Cured my 6 year old&#x27;s nail biting habit in 3 days!  </li>
            <li>Also, the first night be prepared with some orange juice to help get rid of the taste so they will go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>I must say the first day, I only applied to the nails</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks on our 8 yr old daughter and she has not even attempted to suck her thumb again!</li>
            <li>I put it on my two year old daughter and after a week she stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li>but the next evening, peaceful sleeping..</li>
            <li>We painted it on only her thumb nail, covering it the first night with two thorough coats of &#x27;polish&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>At first we tried to keep him busy/distracted during the day and it seemed to help however in the last 3 months</li>
            <li>Tried this on my 2 years old and  it works!  </li>
            <li>The results were instant from the first application.  </li>
            <li>, all it took was the first two times and she has not even looked at her thumbs the same way since!  </li>
            <li>However it got me a couple times that first day when I licked my fingers while preparing dinner, so becareful and encourge the use of silverware while using.my son since he sucked his middle and ring finger, which he doesnt use to eat.</li>
            <li>Day 1 - applied the nail polish (just a small dot on the top of the fingernail)&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>Intially we were so excited when we got the nail polish, because of all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>So far I think this will do the trick!</li>
            <li>and I have completely stopped biting my nails!  </li>
            <li>my almost 4 year old has sucked his thumb since before he knew he had fingers!  </li>
            <li>I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter who literally has been sucking her thumb since she was in the whomb!  </li>
            <li>I put the product on the first and 3rd day.  </li>
            <li>researched only the first ingredient, \\&quot;Ethyl Acetate,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve nearly completely kicked the habit!</li>
            <li>Apparently without that, picking their nose isn&#x27;t quite as much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first put it on only his nail.</li>
            <li>We originally bought it to get my then-two-year-old son to stop sucking his thumb as our kids were giving each other strep over and over.  </li>
            <li>One person told to put a tiny drop of hot sauce.</li>
            <li>So I first removed the blanket from the picture (probably a week prior to using Mavala)</li>
            <li>This product has helped me to completely stop biting my nails!</li>
            <li>She did have several relapses within the first 1-2 weeks, so I kept applying it at night.</li>
            <li>The first night I put it on, he had to keep a bottle of water next to his bed because he would start to suck his thumb in his sleep.  </li>
            <li>not sure how to describe the taste, but I would say more like a chemical taste.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I can still recall vividly the situation, months</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is only the first step in stopping to bite your fingernails.</li>
            <li>but this one was the only product that really helped her!</li>
            <li>Within 5 days I must say she stopped completely sucking her thumb - and it has been 4 years since!</li>
            <li>Both kids have quit putting their fingers anywhere near their mouths!  </li>
            <li>Not to criticise anyone who does, but my children are tiny and making sure they got enough daily nutrition was of concern to me at that age.  </li>
            <li>It is highly likely that the first 3-4 days will be the roughest</li>
            <li>Not to criticise anyone who does, but my children are tiny and making sure they got enough daily nutrition was of concern to me at that age.  </li>
            <li>It is highly likely that the first 3-4 days will be the roughest</li>
            <li>I definitely see this ultimately working as it has significantly curtailed the habit.</li>
            <li>Should it ever come back, though, I&#x27;ll have this stuff ready!</li>
            <li>yet?\\&quot;  He adamantly refused!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I now have actual fingernails that have to be filed and shaped.</li>
            <li>It did not seem to work on my 3 y/o with the first application, but after the second application the finger sucking behavior went away and did not return!  </li>
            <li>definitely worth it in the long run :D.</li>
            <li>This got me and my 4 year old son to stop biting our nails!</li>
            <li>I have been a life time nail biter, but with this stuff i do not want my fingers near my mouth!</li>
            <li>It took 4 days and she stopped completely!</li>
            <li>It works on my 5 yr old grandgirl!</li>
            <li>After the first taste my daughters thumb never went back in her mouth.</li>
            <li>That was the first and the last time she has sucked her thumb since.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>We tried painting her nails more and she would just tear past the paint with not a worry in the world.</li>
            <li>Not sure if its an anxiety thing or a boredom thing, but most of the time I don&#x27;t even realize that I&#x27;m doing it until someone&#x27;s like \\&quot;stop biting!!!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Used this on my 3 year old to stop her thumb sucking and literally worked overnight!</li>
            <li>We tried this on my now 4 year old who has officially stopped sucking her thumbs with the help of Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li>At first he fought me about putting it on, but after the second night, he would just hold out his hand and let me put it on.  </li>
            <li>Our only mistake was not covering his hand that first night.</li>
            <li>so far It has!</li>
            <li>I had tried a similar product as a kid (thanks for trying, mom!)</li>
            <li>I put a lot on her whole nail on all her fingers and made sure it dried, 10 minutes later she was biting her nails!</li>
            <li>It tastes very bitter and it lasts through many hand washings for several days.</li>
            <li>My little one stopped sucking her thumb very quickly using this product.</li>
            <li>If it was this easy to stop thumb sucking and nail biting and cost so little...</li>
            <li>But it is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>20 seconds later his lunch from earlier that day was on the floor (this is the clean version).  </li>
            <li>Maybe wait to use on a kid who can at least articulate themselves decently, because this stuff lingers and they need to be able to understand instructions from you to ensure they don&#x27;t keep getting it in their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t long enough to leave a taste in my mouth, but it shows how quickly it works!  </li>
            <li>My nearly 5 year old daughter has been sucking her middle and ring fingers of her right hand since she was born.  </li>
            <li>My three year old was a prolific thumb sucker, and very strong willed.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my own thumb to try, and a little will go a long way.  </li>
            <li>Both girls cried the first week, but I had to practice tough love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 2 months since I purchased this product and let me first say that I have been a nail biter for the last 20 years, since I was VERY young, about 4, but now I have stopped completely and the urge to even put my fingers CLOSE to my mouth is 100% gone.</li>
            <li>For many years and many different and expensive techniques tried, my 9 year old daughter would not stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>She has completely stopped thumb sucking for almost a week now, and I only had to apply it one more time after the initial application (2 days after the initial one).</li>
            <li>It took a few nights for him to not put them in his mouth in the middle of the night and woke up to get a drink to wash his mouth out but the falling asleep habit went away right away!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for most, although the contents (ingredients)are a little scary, by the second day my two year old learned to have an aquired tatse for the product.  </li>
            <li>BUT, its so worth it in the end if you kick a life long habit!</li>
            <li>She is now 6 years old and her new teeth is coming.</li>
            <li>My son woke up in the middle of the night once for the first few nights, but after that he was fine.</li>
            <li>The taste lingers over a few days and doesn&#x27;t just wash off easily.</li>
            <li>I tried several more times, but no success.</li>
            <li>because you expected it to change you, instead of thinking that this is a quick fix, think of it as a post-it on every 1 of your fingers.</li>
            <li>The bottle gets stuck, but don&#x27;t make the mistake and leave it partially screwed because it dries out quick.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product with initial hopes of using it on her to stop this from becoming a lifelong habit.</li>
            <li>However, I was furious at our dentist for recommending this product as a first line remedy for such a young child.</li>
            <li>My girls were old enough that I explained exactly what we were going to try.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my adult life, I am actually getting compliments on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worked on the first try with my 6 year old who constantly had her fingers in her mouth and bit her nails.</li>
            <li>It was really difficult to use at first, but I&#x27;ve learned to put small dots of the stuff where most effective, and to be cautious about putting my fingers near things that may go in my mouth.</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different things with no success.</li>
            <li>However, when she half-woke up during the middle of the night she subconsciously started sucking her thumb (full force) and immediately started sticking her tongue out and fussing.  </li>
            <li>It is helpful but the bitter fading away just so quick</li>
            <li>He sucked his thumb from birth and after no more than 2 weeks he was completely thumb free!</li>
            <li>but then he liked the taste and instead of every other day I have to put it on every other hour.</li>
            <li>This was the first and ONLY stuff we tried for our almost five year old.  </li>
            <li>Another unconsidered advantage is that I am constantly aware of putting my hands to my face, which is a good thing to avoid in cold and flu season.</li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I gotta say, as a long time nail bitter</li>
            <li>My 23 month old did not approve of the taste at first, but became accustomed to it by the second day and continued to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li>She said it tasted gross, but not bad enough for her to keep her fingers out of his mouth.</li>
            <li>However, my son grimaced for the first little while, then went right on sucking.  </li>
            <li>I was hesistant to use this product on my 20 month old daugther who was sucking her thumb very frequently.</li>
            <li>So I explained to her that now that she was three years old, she was big enough to use a \\&quot;special polish\\&quot; on her nails.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every single penny to me.</li>
            <li>However, due to the problems I had had with my older son, I thought it would be worth trying Mavala.</li>
            <li>very rarely write reviews on Amazon because I don&#x27;t usually have much to say.</li>
            <li>This along with the Bouncing Blue Large thumb sucking glove and a reward program ended our 6 year old thumb sucking in under a month!</li>
            <li>It was pretty bad, we called it bitter, but the best way to describe it was it reminded me of licking envelopes.  </li>
            <li>I applied sparkly nail polish first to make if fun and then a coat of the &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; on just her thumb (obviously you&#x27;ll want to apply to all nails if you have a nail bitter).  </li>
            <li>A great deal of other languages were represented in the instruction pamphlet, including German, Portugese, Spanish, French, and a number of Asian languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My daughter is 3 years old and has been sucking her two fingers since TWO DAYS OLD!</li>
            <li>There is more than enough in the bottle to last as long time.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old (26 month old) to be exact has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 5 months.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it for my 5 year old who was still sucking his thumb after intermittently starting and stopping on his own over the past year.  </li>
            <li>My 6-year old had his first two teeth come out as his adult teeth were fighting to come out at the same time.  </li>
            <li>He was perfectly willing to let me paint it on every night, and every morning I saw that the polish was missing from his right thumbnail.</li>
            <li>application seemed to last me about 4-5 days, more or less dependent on how often I washed my hands.</li>
            <li>People do not really notice that your nails are more shiny, and also I let the coating dry till its sticky then I touch my finger to it</li>
            <li>We thought this would be fabulous based on all the reviews, but after two coats of it that were allowed to dry, he stuck his thumb back in his mouth and looked at us like \\&quot;WHAT??\\</li>
            <li>and I could hear the same thumb sucking sound he always makes when he is sucking his thumb dry.</li>
            <li>still have more than half of the bottler left, and probably would use it on her sister!</li>
            <li>in less than 1 wk (only 4 applications) on my 3.5yr olds thumb nail he was done, we are 2 months thumb sucking free now!</li>
            <li>Finally, after two or three months, I went more than a day and a half without reapplying, and I never caught him again with his fingers in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>the other reviews were correct in indicating you only need a tiny drop for it to work as it is very strong.</li>
            <li>After a life long habit of nail biting this product has deterred me more than any other.</li>
            <li>I will say, one kid was smart enough that he figured out he could scratch it</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s just working for a short time, and seems to not be strong enough after the initial application.  </li>
            <li>Like one of those teeny little cheap nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products for nail biting and they would work for the first few days</li>
            <li>As a male user of this polish, I certainly did not want everyone around me to think I wear clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>I did further research and found that certain taste buds do not fully develop until a child is over 3 years old</li>
            <li>This product is very strong, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Subtle shine, easy to apply (even on a sleeping kid!).</li>
            <li>They suggested a cone, but our area only sells the plastic ones and the cat wouldn&#x27;t be able to eat, drink, sleep, or even get into her little house bed with it on, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
            <li>could she that she wanted to stop and most likely just needed a little help.  </li>
            <li>and I just applied a little bit to the top of his thumbnail, and we went outside to play -</li>
            <li>I tasted and it tasted moderately sharp and then went away quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried some other anti-nail biting creams that would come off too quickly</li>
            <li>We were really excited to hear about this product because our almost 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs for about a year and a half now.  </li>
            <li>It tastes really nasty and quickly and very successfully stopped him from nail biting.</li>
            <li>Our son agreed that it was hard to stop on his own, and agreed to \\&quot;extra</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly to help my 13 year old teen stop biting her nails, I applied it every 2-3 days, now she&#x27;s loosing the bad habit</li>
            <li>Anyway, to summarize I told my daughter that the Tooth Fairy knows how important good teeth are and that she makes kids&#x27; thumbs taste bad when she feels they&#x27;re a big girl/boy to help them stop sucking their thumbs.  </li>
            <li>it kept his thumb out of his mouth which was great since he likes to play in the garden and then will suck on a dirty thumb - reminders for 3 year olds</li>
            <li>Worked great for a few hours till it was dinner time, she was so disgusted with the taste on her fingers (not so great with her fork,</li>
            <li>I have had this product for a few days and have already seen a huge improvement in my daughter&#x27;s nail biting.</li>
            <li>two or three times before touching the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;list of the good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;Really bad bitter taste that makes your want to gag</li>
            <li>It looks like clear polish.  </li>
            <li>The Mavala Stop arrived and I painted his whole thumb nail early the following morning while he was still asleep.</li>
            <li>This product does the trick however it goes on looking like clear nail polish and stays shiny which sort of bothered him.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly clear and shiny.</li>
            <li>Everyone told me that my 3 year old son would stop sucking his thumb when he was ready and that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li>My three year old is autistic and she has a huge problem biting her nails</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has finally stopped sucking her thumb thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Mavala Stop has a shine comparable to clear nail polish, but not as shiny as premium or ultra-shine clear nail polish.</li>

            <li>I let my son watch me put clear polish on my nails</li>

            <li>To the guys: This stuff is like clear nail polish and does leave a shine.</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase a great tasting kids mouthwash too because when he put his thumb in his mouth while he was sleeping he screamed and cried about the awful taste and mouthwash did the trick.</li>
            <li>It looks like clear coat nail polish and lasts for a couple days.  </li>
            <li>She really didn&#x27;t want to stop sucking her thumb but was old enough to realize she had no choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear color</li>
            <li>Clear so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li>It is actually a clear nail polish that you can not see.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and it STAYS on my nail, even if I pick at my nails.</li>
            <li>For me, the taste sticks around well after a few days primarily because I have been making a conscious effort not to bite.</li>

            <li>I bit my nails for nearly 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I came to amazon.com and searched for thumb sucking remedies and saw the terrific reviews for Mavala Stop, saw the reasonable price, and thought what the heck...  </li>
            <li>I kept my fingers FAR away from my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Working well with my 6 year old nail biter.  </li>
            <li>I am 17 years old, and I&#x27;ve been biting my nails since before I can remember.</li>
            <li>But so far with Mavala, I haven&#x27;t even nibbled my nails!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>After trying the THUMB nail solution, band-aids, gloves on hands and everything else I had heard of, I had almost given up on finding a solution that would work for my 23 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li>and our doctor recommended we try to get her to stop sucking even though she was so young.</li>
            <li>my 6 year old needed to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>old daughter started biting her nails.</li>
            <li>My five year old son was biting his nails until they bled.  </li>
            <li>Our 2 1/2 year old has been sucking his thumb since birth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my three year old son who did not want to stop sucking his fingers.  </li>
            <li>I bought Mavala Stop for my three year old that was sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Since my now 4-year-old son was three months old, he&#x27;s sucked his thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My two year old son stopped sucking his thumb immediately, I just put it on in the morning and before he went to bed.</li>
            <li>This is going to take time, but with this stuff I think i can get him to break the habit young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old and have been chewing my nails since before I can remember.</li>
            <li>This worked for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>We still apply it occasionally but she really doesn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 6 year old daughter who was still sucking her thumb as well as biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>My 4 yo son has sucked his thumb since he was 3 mos old.</li>
            <li>There was no battle, no fighting, no crying...</li>
            <li>I have a 5 year old son who had quite a thumb sucking addiction.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, was skeptical about the product initially as I didn&#x27;t want my kid to be tasting the chemical stuff ,but they don&#x27;t after 1 or 2 trials, yep that bitter..</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my daughter who was still sucking her thumb at 3 1/2 years old.  </li>
            <li>My 5 1/2 year old has sucked her finger for years.  </li>
            <li>I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old that suck their thumb.</li>
            <li>As I said, I really believed there was nothing out there that could help me to break this habit...and finally this seems to be working wonders.</li>
            <li>My son is 16 years old and he ALWAYS chews his nails.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I was hoping to break my 2-1/2 year old of her finger sucking habit.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping this would keep my 4 yr old from bitting his fingers.  </li>
            <li>only issue I have with this product is that you can&#x27;t really eat with your fingers without tasting it (forget trying to pick something out of your teeth...gag).  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using it for almost five weeks and has completely stopped sucking her thumb (and twirling her hair).  </li>
            <li>This stuff does work and I tried it on my 4 year old but until he wanted to quit sucking his thumb nothing worked.</li>
            <li>If you are an adult who bites their nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week so far</li>
            <li>After about 1 week, my 6 year old daughter quit sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>She was a hardcore thumbsucker and has quit completely.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would work for my 2 1/2 year old son.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my almost 5 yr old daughter who&#x27;s been sucking her thumb since she was in utero.</li>
            <li>her hands no way near her mouth</li>
            <li>My 3 year old (for whom this was purchased), climbed to get the mavala stop on a shelf in the kitchen and then painted ALL of her baby sisters&#x27; fingers (baby sister was 9 months and a finger-sucker).  </li>
            <li>Within one week he had completely forgotten about sucking his fingers all together.  </li>
            <li>I started biting my nails when I was young, probably around 5.  </li>
            <li>We tried threats, rewards, everything we could think of to get my 3.5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I loaned this to my friend, who was trying to break her 2.5 year old of the habit.</li>
            <li>My 11 years old daughter suck her thumb since birth, tried everything even the dentist cage instrument was inserted in her mouth for one year to help her stop sucking her thumb but did not work.</li>
            <li>We have been trying to get our 3 year old to stop sucking his thumb..</li>
            <li>It really does, but only when it&#x27;s applied every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 3months, and completely stopped biting.</li>
            <li>We could not get our three year old to give up the thumb.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my almost four year old son, who has been a thumbsucker since he was 6 months old.  </li>
            <li>If his thumsucking habits were different (not during sleep), I would absolutely use this.  </li>
            <li>At first he kept sucking his finger then while sucking he was making a strange cringe with his eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old won&#x27;t stop sucking on her index finger..</li>
            <li>My 4 year old was having issues with nail biting.</li>
            <li>I have a five year old who has sucked his thumb since infancy.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old picked up the habit of sticking his fingers in his mouth as we went to sleep and at times he would make himself gag.  </li>
            <li>She was about 3 1/2 years old when we used it</li>
            <li>Mavala stop worked for my six year old to stop sucking her thumb at bed time.</li>
            <li>She is a tenacious five year old who sucked her fingers everywhere.</li>
            <li>My daughters (3 yrs old and 7 yrs old) bit on their nails for years</li>
            <li>They are both close to five years old.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter bites her nails</li>
            <li>Our 4 year old daughter couldn&#x27;t stop sucking her</li>
            <li>My 5 1/2 year old sucked his thumb form birth</li>
            <li>My 5 year old preschooler had always sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li>I ordered Mavala to stop my four year old from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>old twin boys that both suck their thumbs.</li>
            <li>My son is now 4 yrs old and loves to suck on his fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for close to 20 yrs, and this product has allowed me to almost completely break the habit in about a week.  </li>
            <li>Worked like a charm, my 5 year old has been struggling with this</li>
            <li>However, my 4 year old did not mind the taste and continues to bite his nails.</li>
            <li>she was a month old</li>
            <li>Our 3-year old bites her fingernails and toenails until they bleed</li>
            <li>Completely ruined finger</li>
            <li>We have held off re-applying it in hopes he will dislike the taste the next time i apply it, which will be very soon.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has stop sucking too</li>
            <li>and I did not put my finger near my mouth for days.</li>
            <li>My daughter is almost 3 years old and had sucked her thumb since 4 months.</li>
            <li>I just received this yesterday with the hope that I could use it to stop my 2.5 year old&#x27;s pacifier use.  </li>
            <li>3 1/2 yr old sucked her thumb a lot.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old and cant remember a time when I had nails.</li>
            <li>I have 6 year old twins who has sucked their thumbs since infancy.  </li>
            <li>The product works, even for my 3-year old.</li>
            <li>We had a 4 year old that would not quit sucking her fingers - no mater</li>
            <li>especially you don&#x27;t even need the whole bottle!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, I can&#x27;t put this shiny nail-polish-looking thing on her knuckle or her whole back of her hand, can I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much and could even come in a smaller size!</li>
            <li>We started treatment the night before last, and yesterday while driving home from a play date, I looked at her in the mirror of my car and she was fast asleep WITHOUT her thumb in her mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>We used this on our 2 1/2 year old for thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We had to do this because her one front tooth was starting to look funny, and it&#x27;s already looking almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crossing my fingers - so far I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter is 4 1/2 and has been sucking her thumb and index fingers including their knuckles since she was 3 months old.</li>
            <li>However, she completely stopped sucking her fingers in one day.</li>
            <li>But, I couldn&#x27;t find it in a store near me.</li>
            <li>We thought we had tried everything to help my five year old to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>far it has worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what can I say.  </li>
            <li>She even started asking me to put bandaids on them frequently.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old son&#x27;s dentist recommended this product to get him to quit sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I tried and probably wouldnt recommend this  for young kids because i almost gag.</li>
            <li>my 4  year old daughter , even my 6 year old son stopped sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li>but as the product description says it will not work till the kid reaches ~3yrs old.</li>

            <li>We bought for our 5 year old son to help him to stop sucking his thumb and biting his nails...</li>

            <li>I have had a problem stress-biting my fingernails ever since college and continue into my professional career.  </li>
            <li>We tried this on our 3 year old -- it worked practically over night.</li>
            <li>what stopped my son from biting his nails completely.</li>
            <li>No gagging, no crying, no fussing, just asking for a drink of water when she accidently forgot.</li>
            <li>adult put this on his thumb just to see what it would taste like.</li>
            <li>But, by accident I found this product on amazon and in just two days my daughter stopped sucking her thumb completely.</li>
            <li>Each application lasts for about four days, the taste gradually fades but doesn&#x27;t go away completely by day</li>
            <li>1 sucked her thumb (4 years old) and 1 sucked her fingers (2 years old).</li>
            <li>My soon to be 7 year old</li>
            <li>Within days, she completely stopped sucking her fingers.  </li>
            <li>Used for my 2 yr old daughter&#x27;s finger sucking...</li>
            <li>So far Mavala is working to help my just turned</li>
            <li>My almost 5 year old daughter had sucked her thumbs from birth and nothing we did would make her stop.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was 7 years old and could not break the thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li>daughter was 5 years old and had sucked her thumb since birth.</li>
            <li>she just really needed an occasional reminder for zone out times like when watching t.v. or falling asleep.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop biting their nails.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old daughter that started to bite her nails</li>
            <li>I applied mavala stop on my three year old daughter&#x27;s thumb</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 24 and have been biting my nails since I was 6) and my 18 year old habit was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nearly 8-year old son was a habitual thumb-sucker before I found Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li>I have decided to get one for my 6 year old niece and 4 old nephew that suck their thumbs.</li>
            <li>and once I tasted this I removed it off of my two year old daughters fingers.  </li>
            <li>We had tried everything to get our 6 year old to quit sucking here thumb.  </li>
            <li>We bought this product for my four year old.  </li>
            <li>It may work on an adult though.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son who is now 2 years old.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son stopped sucking his thumb in 2 days.</li>
            <li>I am 14 years old and still have problems sucking my thumb along with biting my nails.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you have to really do with this product is apply it one a week because the taste fades away after about 5 days.</li>
            <li>, she would completely zone out and not hear a thing the teacher was saying.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 3 year old daughter who was biting her nails.</li>
            <li>Our daughter is nearly 5</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend, who wanted a product that would help his 3 year old son stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>He says that his 3 year old is kicking the habit and that the taste of the product is preventing his son from wanting to put his thumb in his mouth at all.  </li>
            <li>If your habit really stems from an underlying issue like OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), then you may find it doesn&#x27;t cure the obsessing about irregularities in your nails, but it very likely will cure the biting itself.</li>
            <li>6 year old daughter asked to get it as well.</li>
            <li>I had two of three children who sucked their thumb (a 6yr old boy and 4 yr old girl) and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li>Well, for my 4 yr old it was effortless.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product with my six year old daughter.</li>
            <li>and she hasn&#x27;t put her fingers even near her mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried everything to get my 3 year old to quit sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>His teeth were already starting to protrude and had a callus on his thumb from the pressure and how much he did it.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old sucked her thumb while pulling her hair.</li>
            <li>We purchased this to stop thumb sucking for our 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>This product works for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>stopped my 3 year old in one day from sucking her thumbs</li>
            <li>that way you keep your hands busy</li>
            <li>I tried this with my 12 year old son to get him to stop nail biting.  </li>
            <li>Her thumb does not even go near her mouth anymore.</li>
            <li>So we gave it a shot with our four year old who was bitting her nails.</li>
            <li>We had tried everything to get our 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>It broke the habit completely within one week of putting it on her thumbs.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need frequent reapplicaitons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My two year old stopped biting her nails because of it.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>We were just months away from paying hundreds of dollars for an appliance to help my 6 year old stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>We have a seven year old that was still thumb sucking, mavala stopped the thumb sucking immediately.</li>
            <li>meanwhile when I read the review on the item it also mentioned that it will help to deter thumb sucking which is something my daughter started doing when she was 2 years old</li>
            <li>Neither myself nor my 4 year old have bitten our fingernails since it&#x27;s use.</li>

            <li>My son has completely stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>have 7yr old boy/girl twins and both</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using it under 4yrs old</li>
            <li>I think my daughter has secretly developed a taste for this stuff, as we have been using it for some time now, and still have not cut her finger nails with a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Was for a 10 year old with a packed lunch for school.</li>
            <li>I put this on my 3 1/2 yr old.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll probably re-apply today, but she won&#x27;t even go near her thumb</li>

            <li>I put the Mavala on and he stopped completely.</li>

            <li>I have been applying a nail growth supplement, then the Mavala Stop, every 3-4 days for nearly a month now.  </li>
            <li>So far its been 3 months and counting.</li>
            <li>My daughter, who is 3, has sucked her two fingers since she was 4 months old.  </li>
            <li>It never bothered me too much until I signed her up for some classes at our local Y.  </li>
            <li>I was completely amazed.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Mevala Stop off of amazon, and my six year old daughter hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since it arrived.  </li>
            <li>He asked us to reorder the STOP because he wants to quit sucking his thumb (now that hes a \\&quot;big</li>

            <li>We used this product to help our 3.5 year old son get over the habit of sucking his fingers.  </li>
            <li>and he is completely over sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old stopped thumb sucking completely after only three applications, he was ready.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old and 11 year old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on 3 months without even putting my hands near my mouth.</li>
            <li>but since I have tried EVERYTHING on my 3 year old daughter</li>
            <li>Her nails are so soft and moist that not even nail clippers will trim them sometimes.</li>
            <li>I put it on my 3-year old&#x27;s thumb twice (over a 6 day period) and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  </li>
            <li>I reapplied 2 days later, just in case, but she really didn&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li>That has worked wonders so far.</li>

            <li>he can&#x27;t stand to have them anywhere near his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work at all for my 3 year old.</li>

            <li>I used it on my 4 year and 18 month old children.</li>

            <li>We had been tryng for 3 years to get our 5 year old to quit sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>My three year old was also sucking her thumb, but I just didn&#x27;t have it in me to try to work on both of them.</li>
            <li>My one year old son, didn&#x27;t suck his thumb, but he was chewing all the skin off the ends of his fingers..to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li>5 year old son bites his nails.</li>
            <li>My husband and two young daughters have been using this product.</li>
            <li>We have to put it on frequently</li>
            <li>Within two days my son completely stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s unusual enough to grab your attention, so you can then realize what you were about to do and stop.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter (6 years old) and is still sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old and 2 year old twins could not stop sucking their thumbs.  </li>

            <li>My 4 year old son was biting all his nails.  </li>
            <li>Did not work for my 6 yr old son.</li>

            <li>My daughter is 19 months old been sucking her thumb since 3 months.</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, this stuff is epic.  </li>

            <li>and he complete stop putting his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really work I tried only for two weeks</li>
            <li>and I think it took nearly 6 months for her daughter to stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li>She has a 7 year old who was still sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old agreed for me to put this on and wanted to stop biting his nails.  </li>

            <li>5 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>I have a problem with biting my nails whenever I am busy thinking or stressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not try to use it for kids under 3 years old.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants their child to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li>4 Days in and no thumb sucking from my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for naturally looking matte finish</li>
            <li>My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb (which she was doing since she was about 6 months old) after a week of using this product.</li>
            <li>Keeps your fingers and hands far away from your mouth.</li>
            <li>I would never use it on young children</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 3yr old son who had been biting his nails since 18 months.</li>
            <li>I am 33 years old</li>
            <li>wow-</li>
            <li>Worked in a week to stop my five year old from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old had somehow developed a severe nail biting habit, seemingly overnight.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old understands this is helping him to avoid nail biting.</li>
            <li>Helped my 5 year old stop sucking her finger in 3 days.</li>
            <li>Our 2 1/2 year old daughter was sucking her thumb all the time</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s completely stopped trying to suck his thumbs.  </li>
            <li>so far it seems to help.  </li>
            <li>We tried to use this on our 3 year old when she turned 3 after the advice of our pediatric dentist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to stop my 3 year old from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my 3 year old son who kept sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li>my three year old stopped sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>She did not like the taste and so far it&#x27;s been about a week and no thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 3yrs old son.</li>
            <li>I could see this product working for an adult, but not someone so young.</li>
            <li>Stopped my 3 year old from bitting his figure nails</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my 10 yr old thumb ducking lord</li>
            <li>to help break my nine year old of thumb sucking...</li>
            <li>I know they say that the young children may not have their taste buds fully developed</li>
            <li>Helped my nearing 3yr old to stop sucking his thumb in just a week or two.  </li>
            <li>My kid is 11 years old and has had this habit since birth, it was getting to the point where it was affecting his speech and the shape of his mouth.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this product on our 3 year old son since December 8, 2012.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product to me for my 6 year old daughter who loves her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I still apply it in case he reverses, but so far no sucking.</li>
            <li>The dentist was putting pressure on us to help our 3 year old stop sucking his fingers.  </li>
            <li>My two year old daughter immediately stopped sucking her thumb after using this.</li>
            <li>Truly, it should not be used with young children if you don&#x27;t want to chance them not liking any food they eat and accidentally touch their fingernails to their mouth.</li>
            <li>I completely stopped messing with my nails.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand to put my fingers anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have an eight year old and a six year old who have sucked their thumbs since they were newborns.</li>
            <li>One application is all it took for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li>my 4 year old wont stop, tried everything</li>
            <li>My 17 year old son has chewed his nails for 10+ years.</li>
            <li>We had to apply it about 3 times before she completely stopped (it would wear off in about 2-3 days or so and she would start sucking her fingers again).</li>
            <li>coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Her speech has markedly improved, as well as her attitude.</li>
            <li>We purchased Mavala Stop to help both our almost 3 yr old daughter quit sucking her thumb and our 4 yr old son to stop biting his nails and fingers.</li>
            <li>I think it would work with adult but not kid.</li>
            <li>bought it for my 8 year old girl too as she started doing that when the school started this year...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything to stop that directly, but decided to try Mavala since I figured he would get his nails in his mouth as well while chewing on his fingers.</li>
            <li>Worked within a week for my 10 year old for a thumb sucking kid.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for  my six year old.</li>
            <li>it also stop my seventeen year old from chewing his finger nailing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my 7 year old to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked for my 10 year old until he discovered that he could soak his fingers and scrape it off the nails.</li>
            <li>We decided to try this product because we couldn&#x27;t get our 13 year old son to stop biting his fingers and our 5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>We are very concerned about this and have tried various methods to get him to stop.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>My 6 year old has sucked her thumb for years and nothing has stopped her from sucking her thumb until we tried this.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old sucked his thumb and bit his nails until they bled.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old understood</li>
            <li>and she would be able to just rub it off or at least wash her hands</li>
            <li>how well it worked because he was VERY dependent on sucking his fingers throughout the entire night.  </li>
            <li>Daughter has sucked fingers since a child to 4 years old, we tried a lot of stuff</li>
            <li>I still have about 95% of the bottle left, so if there ever is a reoccurance then I&#x27;ll be ready.</li>

            <li>I surprised her with glitter nail polish</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 year old sucked her thumb quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I was about to see a dentist to have an appliance placed in our 5 year old&#x27;s mouth to break the thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has been sucking her finger since she was in the belly.</li>
            <li>My almost-7-year old who had ZERO desire to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>My six year old was sucking his fingers virtually all day and night.</li>
            <li>No crying, no whining-</li>
            <li>My 8 year old son stopped biting his nails and hasn&#x27;t bitten them since we started this product 12/23.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want your hands anywhere near your mouth with this stuff on it.</li>
            <li>Though she is completely correct, we still were seeking options to resolve this issue.  </li>
            <li>A six year old should be working toward eliminating the habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A six year old should be working toward eliminating the habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t even bother putting my fingers near my mouth anymore.</li>
            <li>Our son is 2 3/4 years old and would not stop sucking his thumb no matter what.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for my 3 year old who would not stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>We used this on our 3 year old which has sucked her thumb since birth.  </li>
            <li>Stopped my 8 year old...</li>

            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my 3 year old daughter at all.  </li>
            <li>Simply stated, this product really worked for me.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any issues with her eating, although I can see how it might cause some concern with young children, since almost everything is finger food.</li>
            <li>really wish i could return it.. or get my money back.</li>

            <li>My 4 year old daughter also bites her nails and she didn&#x27;t seem to be bothered by the taste.</li>
            <li>Tastes like an old wallet.</li>
            <li>he no longer chews his nails or sticks his hands near his mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product with my 4 years old pay for two days now</li>
            <li>After using for 2 days, my 3 year old stopped sucking his thumb and never tried to again.</li>
            <li>This helped my son stop biting, he always bit my arm near my elbow when he was upset with me.</li>
            <li>This did not work for my 4 year old despite the recommendation from our pediatrician.</li>

            <li>I had a non stop chronic nail biting 4 year old.</li>

            <li>We now have gone a week without applying it and she appears to have forgotten about her old habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow....</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to stop my 12 year old from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>and she started when she was about 9-12 months old.</li>
            <li>I put it on my 3 year old twice</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the effect it had on my friends 6 year old son.</li>
            <li>i used this on my 9 year old because he has a habit of using his fingers while eating.  </li>
            <li>However, the reason why I bought this in 1st place was for my 4 year old who started to bite her nails when she went to preschool.  </li>
            <li>Fixed two children of thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with my 9 years old daughter</li>
            <li>This product does not work well on my 2 year old thumb sucking daughter.  </li>
            <li>I believe she was a bit too young for this product at the time because she didn&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li>old stopped sucking thumb within days and husband now uses it to keep from biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>old nose picker as well.</li>
            <li>My son was still sucking his thumb at 2 1/2 years old.  </li>
            <li>and she was just too young.  </li>
            <li>Still sucking her thumb at 4 years old, we decided to buy this again and it worked in one day.  </li>
            <li>so  far I have  applied it 3  times  </li>
            <li>I have a seven year old that bit her nails and a four year old that sucked her fingers.</li>
            <li>help cured my friend&#x27;s decade old nail biting habit.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m now 20 years old).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 yr old</li>
            <li>I am using it on my 20 month old daughter who was always sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3.5years old.</li>
            <li>her be a big girl&amp;#34; and she was ready to prove it.</li>
            <li>Child has sucked her thumb nearly since birth.  </li>
            <li>I put this on my 6 year old and he can&#x27;t stand to bite his nails now.  </li>
            <li>My eight year old stopped sucking his thumb the moment we put it on.</li>
            <li>Our 6 yr old has struggled years to stop sucking her thumb at bed time.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, manicures helped, but stress could still set me off.  </li>
            <li>Stopped my four year old from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>This was completely ineffective in trying to stop my toddler from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>We had tried EVERYTHING in an attempt to get my 7yr old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Somehow in the busyness of having two young kids, I didn&#x27;t notice he&#x27;d picked up the habit of chewing them as a toddler.</li>
            <li>It is one of the worsts tastes I have ever came across, and it was not just a wow</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s 7th birthday was fast approaching, he had permanent teeth coming in</li>
            <li>My son is 7 years old and was sucking the life out of his thumb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 yrs old.</li>
            <li>But like i said, it has been working for me so far.</li>
            <li>So far it is working well.</li>
            <li>4 year old has not sucked his thumb in over a week now....</li>
            <li>Took him I would say maybe 3 days to stop completely.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old son has been sucking his 2 fingers practically since birth, and we never thought we could get him to stop.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old sucked her thumb at night and we figured what the heck and used it on her too</li>
            <li>Used it on my 4 year old daughter who has been sucking her fingers ever since she grew some in the womb.</li>
            <li>We tried everything to get our 3 1/2 year old to stop sucking his thumb without any luck.</li>
            <li>We had tried almost everything to get our 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb including the $80 thumb guards and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I tried crocheting to keep my hands busy</li>
            <li>Took les than a week for 5 year old to stop sucking fingers.</li>
            <li>The dentist recommended it for my almost 4 year old, who won&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>Tried this on our 3 1/2 year old and she didn&#x27;t mind the taste and continued to suck her thumb with no problem.</li>
            <li>One application really does last two days.</li>
            <li>old girl that has the nervous habit of chewing her fingernails...</li>
            <li>Completely cured my 6 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking within one week.  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old has bitten his nails for years.  </li>
            <li>and I had nails to clip for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>The junk you get at the local pharmacy is just lemon juice and cayanne pepper and is only useful for babies.</li>
            <li>I will admit that she did cry a few days later when I wanted to put more on.</li>
            <li>Made me laugh harder.</li>
            <li>fun bandaids and a bitter herb product hadn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>She cried for the first few days, but when we explained to her that Dr. B (her dentist) said this would help her to stop sucking her thumb and give her pretty teeth</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost, even though I only had to use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>A few days later she started sucking again, so we applied it one more time.  </li>
            <li>The last time I covered the whole top of my finger-sucker&#x27;s finger, including the skin part on the \\&quot;palm\\&quot; side of the finger, and still she sucks them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried applying the product a few more times under different conditions (just out of the shower, etc.)</li>
            <li>She desperately wants to stop biting, but is unable to on her own, as she does it without thinking.  </li>
            <li>Since most young children do not floss, they will probably not have the flossing complaint I have.</li>
            <li>This product has already helped me a lot in the last few days, and is more jarring than when my mom and boyfriend smack me for doing it.</li>
            <li>She finds the whole thing fun, and asks me everyday to put the nail polish on her</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things over the last few years to quit biting my nails.</li>
            <li>she has not quit her habit (because if I don&#x27;t put it on for a few days she goes back to the habit), but I think she will once I do this for more than a month.</li>
            <li>For some reason my whole fingertips tasted bitter too (maybe from touching my nails after they dried or rubbing them together during hand washing?</li>
            <li>After a few days she would ask for more on her fingernails because the temptation came back</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about trying this product but tried it after reading lots of good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I hate to say it, but I am SO happy it is!  </li>
            <li>we only applied it a few days, which was rough for him, but it was for the good.  </li>
            <li>It was a rough few days because it was that effective.</li>
            <li>May be good for some just want for us, sorry.</li>
            <li>fail to work if good habits aren&#x27;t put in place</li>
            <li>she wakes up, it will be completely dried which is good as it may be sticky before it get dried.</li>
            <li>My bottle was barely used!!!</li>
            <li>The next things we noticed were that the product seemed to wear off rather quickly with our son and that he was willing to put up with the residual taste at prime thumb-sucking time (such as when he was tired).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned about the frequency of application required, we then contacted the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to see if they had any information about the product.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old just goes right back to chewing his nails as soon as it wears off enough.</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t use the time to build up good habits of cutting them, you will go right back to biting them as soon as you stop.</li>
            <li>This worked well for a few weeks, but then our daughter simply ended up sucking off the polish pretty quickly &amp; continuing her thumb sucking routine.</li>
            <li>but the liquid got around the bottle top a little as normal but mine adhered together and when finally loosened to open it actually broke the top and the liquid all dried up</li>
            <li>After the second day, however, he went right back to sucking like there was nothing on his fingers.</li>
            <li>I know he accidentally puts them in his mouth out of habit, especially when he sleeps, but he always takes them right back out.  </li>
            <li>[my right hand] then you&#x27;ll see how short my middle finger nail is.</li>
            <li>But, as soon as he fell asleep after about 20 mins later, his right thumb instinctively went back in to his mouth</li>
            <li>I brushed it on the finger nails and the next time he tried to put them in his mouth those fingers came right out.</li>
            <li>By the  next day I guess it wears off because he is right back sucking again.  </li>
            <li>My  newly 4 year old daughter sucked her thumb to sleep and calm down.  </li>
            <li>It goes in mild but after a second it is repulsive and depending on how long the finger was in your mouth it tends to stay with you.</li>
            <li>We have all been healthy for the past 2 months!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as a parent I love this product, no more nail biting!  </li>
            <li>My son was a little nervous but also excited to try it.</li>
            <li>This worked for a while, but soon DD just bit right through the bitter taste.</li>
            <li>We applied the polish and its bitter taste, made her stop right away.</li>
            <li>I am at a loss right now and really do not know what else I can do.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter started biting her nails down to the quick and then would hide her hands.</li>
            <li>it is pretty bitter so make sure its completely dry before your kid runs off or else he will get it on his other fingers</li>
            <li>6 months of positive reinforcement and constant reminders along the the incentive of a new big boy bike didn&#x27;t make a dent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been so effective that I have been using it less and less, and still managing to be deterred from the thought of bringing my hands to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I will use it with my son, who is only 1 year old and is a finger-sucker, when he is older (it says ages 3 and up).</li>
            <li>My 6 year old son bites the skin off of the back of his fingers, mainly his pointer finger.</li>
            <li>The only down fall of this product is that you really have to make sure to be careful when you are eating finger foods and stuff</li>
            <li>I am also a germaphobe and figure that, if I can control myself enough to wait until after I wash my hands to bite my nails, I should be able to stop with a little discouragement from this product!  </li>
            <li>Only bad thing is that it will get onto finger foods and make whatever you are eating taste funny; otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;We have tried other products without success</li>
            <li>When some other kindergarteners made fun of her I knew we had to somehow end the habit.  </li>
            <li>and she wasn&#x27;t having much success with other methods and reminders.  </li>
            <li>and she will not mess with her nails now.</li>
            <li>Then we put it on every few days, under polish when I had time to make it fun!</li>
            <li>The wet wipes that we use for dirty hands at the dinner table actually remove the layer of Mavala on the nail, so it seems best to apply a new layer after dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with such a quick and positive results I have recommended it to other friends who are experiencing similar problem with their child.</li>
            <li>I seriously thought I would never be able to break the habit since it was so ingrained in my mind.</li>
            <li>This stuff tastes so awful, if you even touch your lips with your fingertips you will taste that strong bitter taste, which is great for diehard nail biters like me!</li>
            <li>We had used this product in the past to stop thumb sucking and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>(I was slightly), and you occasionally get the taste in your mouth simply from touching your mouth/food during eating or trying to get food out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>To begin, I typically never write reviews, but for this I have to.  </li>
            <li>My older girl had a habit of biting her nails, and my younger one, age 3, sucked her thumb from infancy.</li>
            <li>The taste is sooo gross and it stays in your mouth for an extra minute, so you really get punished and learn your lesson!</li>
            <li>Imagine my excitement when I did finally open it.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter is a dual thumbsucker, me, a lifelong nail biter and a sweet boy who likes to snack on (dare I say it)</li>
            <li>It worked only on the first day and then started swolling this from the next day..</li>
            <li>Put it on her fingers 4 days ago and she tried sucking it twice the first day and gagged, following that only tried 2 or 3 times and stopped immediately.  </li>
            <li>I only had to apply it twice the first week and once a week later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We ended up wrapping his hand in socks, mittens, and first aid wraps for the next two months (taking it off only for eating) while the fingers healed.</li>
            <li>I find that I know exactly when the recent Mavala Stop application has worn off, as his thumb is back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>The first day she was a bit upset that her thumb tastes different but from next day onwards, it does not bother her at all.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing, is simple things like typing this review are different because I have nails.</li>
            <li>Funny thing, is simple things like typing this review are different because I have nails.</li>
            <li>She woke up 3 times the first night because she accidentally sucked her thumb, only once the 2nd night, and that was it.  </li>
            <li>After days of shower and frequent hand washing, it&#x27;s still as bitter as the first day I put it on.</li>
            <li>daughter was quiet upset the first time we tried this on her thumbs only.</li>
            <li>This was simpler and I didn&#x27;t have to nag and stay on top of it, other than applying it every other day.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for my older daughter, but trying it again with my younger one.  </li>
            <li>I bought Mavala Stop for my eight-year-old after trying the local pharmacies&#x27; cayenne pepper product, which stung his tongue at first, but not enough to prevent him from licking it off.  </li>
            <li>The first time my daughter sucked on her thumb (after I applied Mavala) she was crying and spitting the whole night.</li>
            <li>even though this is the first day we&#x27;ve used it, the taste is just gross enough for him to keep his fingers out of his mouth!!</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny bit - the first night I covered his nail</li>
            <li>My wife and I tried several &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; such as bandages, soap, hot sauce, and caster oil.</li>
            <li>I read the disclaimer to only use it on kids 3 years or older.</li>
            <li>After 10-12 times of putting her thumb in her mouth the first day she stopped entirely by the next day.</li>
            <li>Might work for older kids but not for younger ones who don&#x27;t want to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li>Supposely on little kids is less effective.</li>
            <li>The taste of the stuff isn&#x27;t as bad as I have read on other reports, so I was happy, but it was strong enough to cause him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>Product comes with instructions in English and pretty much every other language</li>
            <li>I bought this for a 6 year old in our family with a major thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old sucked his thumb constantly, no other trick had worked.</li>
            <li>that was gross and then the taste went away, this disgusting taste lingered for a good 5 minutes or more!  </li>
            <li>I thought it would take a full month of using Mavala to get my three year old to give up his habit, but it took less than two weeks!</li>
            <li>After being an extreme nail biter for 60 years and learning to hide my nails to where it became an art form, I tried using Mavala Stop and it worked right away.</li>
            <li>We tried other methods before this one and he would just suck right through them.  </li>
            <li>so much, I highly recommend to a lot of mommies, who are going through the same situation as I am.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I would highly discourage using this on smaller children; thus, I have yet to use this.</li>
            <li>To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers.</li>
            <li>I think he was highly motivated to stop and just needed the extra boost which this did.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone with a similar problem!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and am planning to send my bottle around to friends as I only used probably 10% of the bottle on both kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and am planning to send my bottle around to friends as I only used probably 10% of the bottle on both kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is that if you are eating food with you hands, you will most likely taste the product which is extremely bitter and gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this high because I received on a Saturday and we are only almost one week into this product and</li>
            <li>Well now that same child is in high school with the pressures of essays and test and sports</li>
            <li>I will add that I was highly motivated to succeed this time and that is always a key step in any transformation process.</li>
            <li>I started biting my nails in high school, and seemingly nothing could get me to stop, despite my multiple attempts over the years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially people who believe they have tried it all!</li>
            <li>He is currently 5 years old and his new permanent teeth are moving because of his thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li>I felt I put very little on the 1st time when I lightly coat thumb nail</li>
            <li>He was very motivated to stop biting fingers because he was starting to notice the social stigma</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also economical -- applied over dry or polished nails and cuticles, it will last days.</li>
            <li>Only buy this product if you will follow through and re-apply it every few days because it fades away easily.</li>
            <li>Every week or so, I would not reapply the polish, and sure enough, when he got tired or upset, he would stick his fingers right back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li>In short, if you are considering this product even for someone as young as two and a half, as long as he or she can somewhat understand what is going on, then this product could not be more recommended.</li>
            <li>Since then she tries her best to not absent mindedly put her hands near her mouth because the taste is so bad and it lingers.</li>
            <li>but i guess my daughter didn&#x27;t really care for the taste as long as she could suck her thumb.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for us, our 4 year old daughter sucked her finger at bed time only but even that is enough to cause damage to teeth.</li>
            <li>The day I got the polish in the mail, I put it on my 5 year old daughter who constantly has her hands in her mouth, my four year old son who was a thumb-sucker, and my three year old daughter who bites her finger (and toe!!)nails....</li>
            <li>and I have been nail biting free for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li>people who can tolerate this taste probably will have a higher rate of getting a&lt;br /&gt;negative result in tasting bitter on the genetic factor test as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Although the first couple of nights were rough on her, the Mavala did work.  </li>
            <li>For the first night, it was rough.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST WEEK WAS VERRRYYY ROUGH</li>
            <li>and they are back to normal.</li>
            <li>Now her finger nail start growing back like normal.  </li>
            <li>The first night was rough since she put her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li>The first day, he had to brush his teeth 5 times because he bit his fingers forgetfully.  </li>
            <li>worked exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li>The first night was rough as she did put her thumb in her mouth and then gagged and spit and couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of her mouth.</li>
            <li>This morning I made some pretty bitter sandwiches.</li>
            <li>FIRST try on an empty stomach the 1st time (just in case)  </li>
            <li>Now 2 months later, my nails are normal lengths and</li>
            <li>I recommend it and need to go get a manicure because my nails are looking like a normal human again!</li>
            <li>Of course, it does need to be reapplied to maintain its usefulness, but with a pretty pink underneath it, she doesn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li>(she would peel off the tape), hot sauce and Bitter Apple spray.  </li>
            <li>I will admit when you first put it on and your child tries to suck his thumb</li>
            <li>We ended up finding a pink fabric thumb guard that works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This product helped me become aware of when I was biting and deterred me with the bitter taste.</li>
            <li>It does taste bitter, but my kid used to the taste after first try.</li>
            <li>The first night was rough-</li>
            <li>This, coupled with the Mavala, is finally making my nails look normal.</li>
            <li>The first couple of weeks were rough with her going through withdrawal.</li>
            <li>Warning:  the first night, she did suck her thumb and the taste was so bitter, she threw up.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t suck his thumb again until after a few days when it began to wear off and we just reapplied, It was so cool to see him understand what it was for and that it was to help him.</li>
            <li>We apply a coat every night and will continue to do so for the next several weeks until we know the habit is broken for good.</li>
            <li>is a good product my son liked thumbsucking but after this what you are thinking, this tastes awful is durable and also definitely think I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li>My bigger issue is I&#x27;m not very happy with the chemical ingredients in this; if this is something there putting in their mouth, I would hope for more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product that stands behind what it says!!!</li>
            <li>She thought she was going to be smart and wash her hands with soap and water, only to find out later that it was still on her thumbs.</li>
            <li>Only problem was, he was smart enough to hide it.</li>
            <li>However, it does only last a certain amount of time, and even though he promised not to bite his nails, he has forgotten so on with the Mavala again.</li>
            <li>I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter.</li>
            <li>Product is really helping my 4yr old son stop his habit of bitting his nails which are like half of normal nails length</li>
            <li>This scent seems to have been a bit more offensive than the last one we tried, but it&#x27;s not strong enough for a dedicated nail biter.</li>
            <li>We found the product very useful in preventing thumb succking for our 3 y old.&lt;br /&gt;We applied a small amount (one touch) on her thumbs</li>
            <li>He complained that food tested bitter the first couple of days, but after that he was ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t believe it was that simple.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried band-aids, tape and other brush-on things to make her finger less appealing.  </li>
            <li>It has been hard for her, but after only 3 applications and two weeks she is thumb sucking free!</li>
            <li>biting is definitely still a habit that&#x27;s hard to shake but this product helps way more than what it costs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back 2 years later buying some for my older son who has taken up a nail biting habit!  </li>
            <li>The other bad thing is if you hand wash dishes like I do the soap and warm water will wash off most of the taste of it</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want all the details of the hour long ordeal!)</li>
            <li>It also applies much like a clear coat nail polish, not like a thin liquid, as I originally thought it would.</li>
            <li>I placed a very small dab on the tip of his thumb nail (not the whole nail just a small dot on the very top) after breakfast, he tried to suck his thumb but each time he got close to his mouth he pulled it away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to quit many times, and used other \\&quot;bitter tasting\\&quot; products on my nails that never worked because the taste was just not enough to override my compulsion to chew my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not know how much of this was internal motivation, and how much was due to the Mavala Stop, but it has worked.  </li>
            <li>The first couple days are a little tough, but it was amazing to me</li>
            <li>We had tried everything, taping fingers with medical tape, taping on a mitten, paying money, offering to go to Sea World, offering to go to Target to buy a new toy, etc.  </li>
            <li>Her new teeth were starting to come out with a gap.</li>
            <li>The coat will last for 4-5 days and if I get the urge to bite my nails again, I just apply a new coat.  </li>
            <li>2 weeks later I haven&#x27;t applied a new coat, I&#x27;ve washed my hands over and over and over again</li>
            <li>As soon as I put some on her thumb, she popped it right in her mouth and decided it was no fun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to stop if your kid knows wha&#x27;s good and bad and ready to accept.</li>
            <li>I never really thought about it much until I became an adult, and since that point I&#x27;ve always wanted to stop.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have painted the entire nail and you wish to remove it, acetone will remove Mavala Stop--you just might have to work at it with several cotton balls and then wash hands VERY WELL to remove the acetone taste.  </li>
            <li>We bought Mavala stop last week for my 2 years 3 months old daughter who has been sucking her thumb since she was 3 months old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but I doubt you&#x27;d use the whole bottle, or you have a more stubborn child than I do.</li>
            <li>and I was starting to get really concerned about the constant thumb sucking and hair twirling.  </li>
            <li>Plenty more for my 2nd thumb sucker in a year or so!&lt;br</li>
            <li>He never really complained about the taste, but the look on his face with the first few attempts were all telling.</li>
            <li>It lasts a couple days, and like someone else mentioned, I only put a tiny bit on his thumb - not the whole nail.</li>
            <li>I just got this in last night and already used it on my 5 year old for thumb sucking, and it is so far working just as described.</li>
            <li>Even if it seems easier just to bite or peel away an uneven bit of nail, you&#x27;ll spare most of it by just clipping off those rough edges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One small note: pretty much a finger food killer.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was not sure if this would really work</li>
            <li>And for less than $10 it&#x27;s worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much in fact that my daughter threw up all over the place even though I only put a tiny spot on the problem thumb.</li>
            <li>We used it with our 2 1/2 yr-old because he keeps biting his fingernails, and we only put a tiny bit, and after about 30 minutes he threw up so much ...</li>
            <li>He still sucks his thumb at night on ocassion, but even that is starting to get better over time.  </li>
            <li>Now he just wants to suck his fingers and go to sleep, but he keeps forgetting and putting them back into his mouth only to start heaving again!  </li>
            <li>Literally after 2 applications my 3 1/2 year old stopped putting his hands even NEAR his mouth - and this was a constant nail biter and bleeder before this!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually use this product, because we bought the book &amp;#34;David Decides&amp;#34; for my 5 year old girl, and to my complete surprise, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had tried everything and were ready to actually have the doctor put a cast on our son&#x27;s arm to physically stop him from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>and he didn&#x27;t bit the his finger or toe nail the whole day, nor the next day, nor the next...</li>
            <li>/&gt;She is now in fourth grade and has long pretty nails</li>
            <li>It took only 4 applications and about one week to completely stop my 7 year old from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>I have an 8 year old and a 3 year old who bite their nails constantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to apply it a couple of times just for precaution, but really it wasn&#x27;t even necessary.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter has sucked her 2 middle fingers since she was 2 months old.</li>
            <li>I agree that it works but only for the period of time it stayed on, I guess it is because I&#x27;m an adult and old habits</li>
            <li>During her speech evaluation, she recommended Mavala Stop to me as her son was a thumb sucker and had many orthodontic problems and facial asymmetry as a result of it.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 6 months old (she is 3 1/2 years old now).  </li>
            <li>My ten year old had developed a nervous habit of biting his nails.</li>
            <li>I have a 5 year old who has been sucking her index and middle fingers since she was 2 months old.</li>
            <li>I make her nails few times per week to keep them smooth and short</li>
            <li>my grand daughter finally stopped sucker her thumb once I started using this product</li>
            <li>Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were a few instances where finger foods led to an accidental taste, but that also was quickly self correcting.  </li>
            <li>The taste is a very odd taste, sort of sweet and then like acetone...</li>
            <li>Tip for use:  only apply one swipe of the brush onto nail and make sure it is a very little amount!  </li>
            <li>We only have to reapply every couple days even with very frequent handwashing habits.</li>
            <li>The first few nights were hard as she kept getting up to tell us her mouth taste like soap and no being able to comfort herself....</li>
            <li>I purchased it based on reviews from other parents, and it does exactly what was indicated.  </li>
            <li>and just today i had my first nail trim to take off the sharp edges.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but I was actually able to stop biting my nails and have not bitten them in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>the reviews from other parents were instrumental in my purchase decision so I am writing my first ever product</li>
            <li>We put it on every day for the first week, and now we just put it on every other day.  </li>
            <li>product definitely helped while I was using it to stop biting my nails, I actually purchased a second bottle once the first was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only had to apply 1 time and my 2 1/2 year old stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li>24 day later, my 5 yr old son has stopped sucking his thumb!  </li>
            <li>It did make her gag a few times the very first day but after that she wouldn&#x27;t even put her thumb close to her mouth.  </li>
            <li>We went to a tea room with little sandwiches and other finger foods, and just barely touching her bottom lip with her thumbnail</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d ever get my daughters (especially my 5 year old) to quit sucking her finger!</li>
            <li>Going into first grade, it seemed imperative that he stop soon to avoid an onslaught on taunts from other children.  </li>
            <li>now i think there is no other thing which could stop them from thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>She still occasionally sucks her thumb, but never when actually asleep and much more rarely in general than she used to.</li>
            <li>(they told me that any time they had it on and accidentally tasted it, that they immediately had to spit it out), but only if you use it frequently!</li>
            <li>I hesitated doing it to my son, worrying it would majorly upset him.</li>
            <li>We got this product last year because our 8 year old was still sucking his thumb-almost ALL the time!  </li>
            <li>the hot stuff, bitter stuff, even a device that was like wearing a thumb-only glove!</li>
            <li>But like other reviewers, at first he did not care for the taste, but after a day, the taste did not bother him.</li>
            <li>Our 4-year-old was a MAJOR thumb-sucker, she did it all throughout the day as well as at night.</li>
            <li>And now a month or so later, I&#x27;m completely cured!</li>
            <li>apparently this is what my mom used on her for her thumb sucking!  </li>
            <li>No other problems that night.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old is an avid thumb sucker and the dentist said we really needed to nib it in the bud.  </li>
            <li>My nails are weak and on top of that</li>
            <li>include being unable to floss and not being able to touch my hands to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Upside &#x3D; MY HANDS DON&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on real shiny and clear and really does last for two days as advertised, but it does start losing a little of its potency</li>
            <li>He was upset once or twice the first day when he would forget it was on his fingers and put them in his mouth, but other than that it worked without a problem.</li>
            <li>But it totally made me stop biting my nails or even putting them near my mouth!  </li>
            <li>I tried other products for my 5 year olds nail biting problem and this worked on the FIRST DAY.</li>
            <li>It was a major issue for me because I eat with my hands(finger foods)</li>
            <li>I applied same amount on her nails as I did to my 9 year old, and it didn&#x27;t bother her a one bit!  </li>
            <li>After about three weeks I would forget to put it on and they still didn&#x27;t revert back to old habits!</li>
            <li>Trust me, this will be a major disturbance.</li>
            <li>Worked the first time I put it in my 5 year old finger nails - roughly 5 weeks ago and never looked back!  </li>
            <li>Using a small amount (nail only) with a 5 year old only had a minor affect and was sucked off fairly easily without much effect (</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself first to see how it tasted, it was very bitter.  </li>
            <li>I did try this product out first before I used it on him and it just leaves a very bitter taste in the your mouth.</li>
            <li>He is a chronic nail biter who always gnaws his claws down to the quick, and so he&#x27;s never had the white show on his fingernails before.</li>
            <li>My daughter was biting her nails down to the quick and actually hurting herself.  </li>
            <li>and I quickly put my hand back down haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I quickly put my hand back down haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked, though he has developed lot of taste due to that.</li>
            <li>Although the instructions say paint every other day, sometimes he needs a fresh coat the next day.</li>
            <li>There are other posts for lack of success with Mavala for younger children.</li>
            <li>Given that she hasn&#x27;t reacted as strongly as other reviewers&#x27; children, I&#x27;m wondering if it will be as useful for curbing her thumb-sucking habit, which is the next hurdle on our list.  </li>
            <li>taste lasts for a few days, which can be problematic as you have to plan ahead to make sure there are no activities that the taste could interfere with.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very careful eating any sort of finger food with this on, as even the lightest touch on your lips will give you the taste and require some manner to remove it from your taste buds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as a fun little story for you guys, I do this thing where I lick my nails as well.</li>
            <li>Sure, some urges from a habit are still there, but they&#x27;re getting less and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>no getting up in the middle of the night to put back in her pacifier ... but became a problem as she got older.</li>
            <li>The older child had to do it again a couple of weeks later when he fell back into the habit but</li>
            <li>My 2 yr old was a constant finger sucker since an infant, impeding speech, fine motor and basically everything since he always had his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li>It dries on clear (a little shiny at first) and it lingers for days.  </li>
            <li>The taste of the nail polish is excellent for stopping the nail biting habit, but the product tended to rub off on finger-foods even hours after it dried and the taste is hard to miss, and somewhat hard to get off the palate once it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of polish and with one of them I actually grew used to the taste and bit right through it.  </li>
            <li>Seems to working, but only if you coat often enough and a large enough area to cause gagging (may be some vomit too).  </li>
            <li>Be careful to only paint the very very tips of your nails...</li>
            <li>It was funny watching her the first time she tried to suck and hard not to pretend something was different.</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t take the nail polish off (except for the brave daughter of another reviewer that sucked up the bad taste and washed it away with water).</li>
            <li>It was a great reminder for her and the taste was really bad.</li>
            <li>My advice to parents with thumb suckers is to use the free methods before jumping into buying something.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;m still amazed that how easily she stopped.</li>
            <li>You can spoil your meal while eating with your hands if you accidentally lick your fingers or just by eating with your hands in general.</li>
            <li>First off, let me give my complaint - there is way too much of this stuff.</li>
            <li>My daughter cried inconsolably for over 4 hours, refused to drink, would not swallow her saliva because of the discomfort, would not speak clearly because of the discomfort, and finally threw up.</li>
            <li>My 3 yr old calls it the &amp;#34;yucky nail polish&amp;#34; and hates it so much that she tries to wash her hands off multiple times in the day to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop works as long as you are responsible enough to keep applying it every 4 or 5 days.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that has helped me quit biting my nails is keeping them painted with a color and clear coat</li>
            <li>it looks like regular clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The stuff goes on clear, dries totally and lasts about 3 days, so you reapply every three days.  </li>
            <li>You should apply it daily, but it&#x27;s clear and you can&#x27;t see it.  </li>
            <li>She is now six years old and she has not gone back to sucking her</li>
            <li>I used it for myself and my 7 year old and it totally works.</li>
            <li>I found it because my 3 yr old daughter was starting to put her hands in her mouth</li>
            <li>The first night was no fun, we had to brush his teeth every time he tasted it</li>
            <li>The bitter taste really conditions you to not bite your nails.</li>
            <li>My 6 yr old was so grossed out with this that it only took two applications</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of making guacamole with my bare hands...gross.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when my 2nd son (5-1/2 years old) stopped sucking his 2 middle fingers in 2 DAYS!!</li>
            <li>Our 3 year old only sucked her thumb when going to sleep, but our dentist insisted she stop.</li>
            <li>We got it for our 9 year old son who has had a constant habit of putting his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li>I have used everything possible to help my 4 year old stop biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>It all had started the summer before my 7 year old son went into second grade.  </li>
            <li>I believe she naturally put her thumb in her mouth while sleeping and left it there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely even used the contents in the bottles.  </li>
            <li>Apparently he put his thumb in his mouth as he was falling asleep and the taste got him up out of the bed.</li>
            <li>My (recently turned) four year old had been sucking his thumb</li>
            <li>I am 36 years old and have bitten my fingernails my entire life.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think ANYTHING was going to get my six year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, but this worked in only 1 application.  </li>
            <li>We joke that he does not have taste buds, but apparently he does.  </li>
            <li>It only worked for 1 day, then my 3yr old got used to it and started thumb sucking again.</li>
            <li>My daughter was five years old and still sucking her thumb constantly.  </li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have been a nail biter my entire life.</li>
            <li>the second you start to move your hand near your mouth your brain starts screaming to stop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter is 7 years old and has sucked her thumb constantly for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>used this only once: my 3 yr old had a belly ache, threw up 2 times, and has not put her thumb in her mouth again</li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply too much however...</li>
            <li>Apparently the taste grew on her as it hasn&#x27;t deterred her since.</li>
            <li>She is now 3 years old and still hasn&#x27;t gone back to sucking her fingers!!!</li>
            <li>So I just don&#x27;t screw it back on completely.</li>
            <li>But, my 3 year old went ahead in the middle of the night and sucked his thumb even with Mavala on it.</li>
            <li>It really does taste bitter.</li>
            <li>It Is recommended by mavala stop not to use it earlier than 3yrs because taste buds are not fully developed.</li>
            <li>They woke up the next morning complaining of a yucky taste in their mouths and from then on one of them stopped completely.  </li>
            <li>purchased this product as a last resort for our three year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old son bit all 10 of his finger nails to the point of bleeding for the last 7 years.  </li>
            <li>He said that the bitter taste of the product was too much for him to handle.</li>
            <li>Apparently she was \\&quot;ready\\&quot; to give up the thumb,</li>
            <li>We purchased multiple items hoping to rid our 4 year old of her thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li>my 3 1/2 year old stopped sucking her thumb/fingers and hasn&#x27;t gone back.</li>
            <li>It has been the only thing that has stopped my three year old daughter from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>We saw the reviews and we weren&#x27;t getting anywhere trying to persuade our four year old daughter from sucking her middle two fingers (and causing her teeth to grow outwards), so we went ahead and ordered some!</li>
            <li>We purchased this after months and months of trying to get our 8 year old son to stop sucking his middle fingers.</li>
            <li>Tastes gross so my daughter wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near her mouth.</li>
            <li>This product has made it possible to break my 6 year old from sucking on his thumb.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about his teeth obviously, but I was also concerned that he was just picking up germs and putting them directly into his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We used it for 2-3 weeks on our 3 year old son to kick the thumb sucking habit since it was starting to affect his teeth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this is a last ditch effort to get my then 13mth old son to stop sucking his two fingers.  </li>
            <li>and it has definitely helped me so far.  </li>
            <li>The orthodontist recommended this product for my ten year old son, who has an oral device to keep him from thumb-sucking but he is still trying.  </li>
            <li>The effects didn&#x27;t last on me or my 10 year old son (nail biting, not thumb sucking) for even a day.</li>
            <li>This is such a help so that she don&#x27;t need braces when she gets old....</li>
            <li>So after reading several reviews, one review said that this product, Marvala Stop, worked wonders on their under 3 year old.</li>
            <li>I only noticed that his product is not recommended for children under 3 since their taste buds are not fully developed and might have no effect on them.  </li>
            <li>I barely put any on her finger nails but trust me</li>
            <li>My four year old was starting to but his nails and always had his fingers in his mouth and was still sucking his thumb at night</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter stopped chewing her nails almost instantly.</li>
            <li>It is not peppery-</li>
            <li>My wife and I were extremely surprised at the instant effect this had on her.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t in nearly a week, and they are already healing and growing back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We re-aplied the drops every month for the next 5-6 months to wean her off completely.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my 3 year old niece, but she simply continued biting her nails.</li>
            <li>Whatever, this stuff has done the job for us, and our thanks to the Swiss for their chocolate, army knives, furtive banking and now this.</li>
            <li>My daughter had reverted to an old habit of sucking her index and middle finger.  </li>
            <li>the bottle somewhere visible and where you frequently have your line of vision (but obviously away from children).</li>
            <li>But anyone with an OCD habit for nail-biting understands what this refers to and how much of a &#x27;trigger&#x27; those rough nail edges are.</li>
            <li>this refers to and how much of a &#x27;trigger&#x27; those rough nail edges are.</li>
            <li>Put hand lotion (sensitive skin type, nonscented) on ALL THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, leaving your nails alone is a psychological thing.  </li>
            <li>you want to stop biting/picking, bitter polish is absolutely the way to go.  </li>
            <li>We even prepared for middle of the night awakenings (some parents recommended having juice near the bed with which to rinse out the taste)</li>
            <li>three yr old stop sucking her middle two fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I completely and totally recommend this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely has helped my three year old break the thumb sucking habit, but it should be used cautiously.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a 21 yr old male that has bitten his nails all his life, i just haev to say that this product realy worked wonders.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well, has a uniquely bitter, and lingering taste.  </li>
            <li>It has been the only thing that has helped my 10 year old to stop sucking his thumb or fingers.</li>
            <li>works for trying to get 4 year old to stop sucking her fingers - but need constant reapplication</li>
            <li>My eleven year old finally stopped biting her nails because of this product.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, my son&#x27;s taste buds wasn&#x27;t too altered from this product because he sucked his thumb anyway inspite of a heavier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We kept it up an extra week just so old habbits would not set in.  </li>
            <li>our 3.5 year old stopped sucking her thumb and never went back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have been chewing my fingers as far back as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>After ONLY one application she STOPPED COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>Bitter taste is very unsatisfying and stays on your tongue for a while.</li>
            <li>When my 4 year old daughter began biting her nails, I realized I couldn&#x27;t tell her to not bite them when she saw her mom doing the same thing.</li>
            <li>and it had actually fallen off completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is possible that she is too young for</li>
            <li>, IDK I was such a young child</li>
            <li>I like the constant busy work of it, the way the nails and cuticle feel when i chew them, the way feeling afterward</li>
            <li>for the cat, our 5 month old kitty was recently spayed.  </li>
            <li>My son is 3 years old and is constantly sucking his thumb day and night</li>
            <li>I have bitten my nails since I can remember and now at 30 years old, I&#x27;ve had enough.</li>
            <li>Now my second son has developed the habit  (both around age 7) and we hope he&#x27;ll get over it soon.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old male.</li>
            <li>My three year old stopped sucking his fingers after only ONE application.</li>
            <li>My son is 5 years old and was still sucking his thumb regularly.  </li>
            <li>This took only one day of applications to completly stop my 4 year old son from sucking his thumb during the day.  </li>
            <li>My niece is 3 years old, only used one time, he stopped suck his thumb.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it may rub off to food if you using bare hands-</li>
            <li>And definitely helps, but it doesn&#x27;t completely solve the problem.</li>
            <li>I thought if I tried something like this early into the phase that we might stop it instead of him possibly doing it for the rest of his life.</li>
            <li>He stopped by third week and completely probably by 5th or 6th week.</li>
            <li>It only took 2 days with my 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>The bitter taste really helped me control my nail bitting</li>
            <li>MY 3 year old daughter totally forgot this product was ever on her nail.</li>
            <li>level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest switching to a fork for eating while using this product, as the taste does interfere with eating foods with your bare fingers.  </li>
            <li>After the second application he was completely done sucking.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has been biting his nails out of the blue</li>
            <li>Only reason I give the item 3 stars is it did not cure my 5 year old daughters</li>
            <li>My kids were old enough to deal with the yuck and the gagging.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my 2 year old and he stopped sucking his thumb the same day!!!</li>
            <li>We had tried several things to try to get our 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb that did not work.  </li>
            <li>I have only applied twice so far.</li>
            <li>If it can help someone who has bit their nails for the last 33 years plus then it will help you, too.duct works on children, but I can speak for an adult and this product does work.</li>
            <li>My six-year-old has sucked her middle and ring finger since she was three months old.</li>
            <li>My 3 1/2 year old used to suck her thumb constantly.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old not only bite her nails but sucked on  her thumb since before she was born ( I have an ultrasound that shows it!)it</li>
            <li>Finally got my two year old to stop sucking on her hand.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked and at 3 years old, she was starting to affect her bite.</li>
            <li>She will be 3 in the winter, so perhaps she isn&#x27;t old enough for the product yet.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my almost 3 year old daughter to finally stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>We did try it one when she was younger (2yrs old)</li>
            <li>Not only did it stop me immediately from biting my nails, but my two year old also stopped his thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li>I got this product for my 3 year old niece who has suddenly started sucking her thumb out of nowhere.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for children old enough to express themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product and literally will NOT put my fingers in my mouth or near it.</li>
            <li>Similarly, my 8 year old tried to eat carrots and some chips --both times, her fingers touched her mouth and she couldn&#x27;t handle eating anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and have been biting my nails since I was in middle school.</li>
            <li>The bitter taste stays on the skin for two days and it really deters the user.  </li>
            <li>As she was going to bed she attempted to suck her thumb and was completely taken back by the taste.</li>
            <li>Maybe using it on a younger child would work, I dont know, but my 5 year old outsmarted the stuff almost immediately.</li>
            <li>This did the trick for my 5 year old who bites her nails daily.  </li>
            <li>realized the biggest problem I had was not the willpower, per se, but simply that when I got busy I would start biting out of habbit without even realizing it.  </li>
            <li>I only had to use this once for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old stopped sucking his thumb the same day I applied the Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li>My four year old son finally stopped chewing on his nails!</li>
            <li>After reading even adult reviews of this product and how psychologically they thought before putting it into their mouth and it changed their behavior I knew it would work.  </li>
            <li>The answers in Q/A section saying this nail polish had some shine but barely noticeable were the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>The child needs to be old enough to understand what is going on.</li>
            <li>think there is a note about younger kids not minding the taste on the instructions, but I think some kids may fall into that category well after 3 years old depending on their motivation.</li>
            <li>tried again in vain to get him to stop, even going so far as to show him pictures of the medieval torture device they call a palate spacer.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t necessary, he had completely given up the thumb</li>
            <li>I say: thumb sucking is subconscious and what this product does is bring the process of thumb sucking to the conscious level.  </li>
            <li>Our 4 year old sucked her thumb constantly and was developing quite an overbite.  </li>
            <li>and we barely used any.  </li>
            <li>and I am determined to stop because I noticed my 2yr old starting to bite hers.</li>
            <li>My 6-year old continues to bite his nails even with multiple coats of this on.</li>
            <li>soon as the nail polish comes off my fingernails, I go back to my old habit of chewing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>We only had to use this twice before my 11 year old daughter quit sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li>I am a 20 year old male who is trying to stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li>I used this on my child when he was about 4 years old because he would occasional suck his thumb</li>
            <li>I have a 7-year old boy who HAD been biting his fingernails constantly!</li>
            <li>My boy actually cried when he realized that he would have to taste the Mavala every time he got his fingers near his mouth...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason that I only gave it 4 stars was because I tried it with my 2 year old twins who suck their fingers.  </li>
            <li>Within an hour of trying it out my 2 year old was back at sucking his thumb like there was no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>only go so far.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old who is constantly biting her nails.  </li>
            <li>8 yr old finally quit!</li>
            <li>I would agree that for a younger child who cannot fully understand what it is this may not be the correct course of action.  </li>
            <li>I tried a similar product when she was around 3 yrs old but didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old and have been biting my fingernails my entire life.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 2 year old who constantly bites her nails.</li>
            <li>I usually only need to apply about two coats per day since I wash my hands a lot and use hand sanitizer frequently.</li>
            <li>She was starting to get self conscious about her habit</li>
            <li>My 19 month old daughter had a severe addiction to sucking on her 1st 2 fingers of her left hand.  </li>
            <li>Instantly helped our 4 year old stop ducking her thumb at night.</li>
            <li>I have to mention that she somewhat mentally was ready for stopping though.</li>
            <li>My just turned 4 year old sucked two of her fingers at once, on a daily basis, from the time she was an infant.</li>
            <li>She sucked her fingers while watching tv, while falling asleep, and to help her fall back asleep when she woke early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until she was asleep for the night and her fingers had fallen out of her mouth.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Mavala Stop because my 3yr old has recently started biting her nails.</li>
            <li>It is enough to keep me from even placing my hand near my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that made my 6-year old stop sucking his thumb, I can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it stop my 7 year old daughter from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>By the time his third birthday arrived, I had already researched and purchased Mavala Stop for fear of having a 9 year old thumb-sucker (I&#x27;ve seen plenty).</li>
            <li>I used what was left in the bottle (about 2 ml) and by the end of the week, he completely stopped thumb-sucking.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son sucked his thumb constantly, day and night.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it, my THIRTEEN year old daughter has finally kicked the sucking thumb habit,</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 19 month old son who was sucking his thumb to the point that we were concerned about the possible loss of his nail (yuck).</li>
            <li>Stopped my three year old from biting his nails almost instantly.</li>
            <li>we have applied it only two times for my five years old..</li>
            <li>Has worked so far on GF only thing is you have to stay on the ball with reminding whoever is using it.</li>
            <li>My son has had a habit of sucking on his pointer and middle finger together at once since he was 4 months old.</li>
            <li>I initially reviewed this and gave it 5 stars after about a week as my 3 year old son had virtually stopped sucking his thumb about 90% of the time.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old finally stopped putting her thumb into her mouth!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>The recipient (a 6 year old former nail-biter) doesn&#x27;t mind it being applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old male.  </li>
            <li>This worked instantly with my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Only had to put this on my 3 year old daughters thumb nail once and</li>
            <li>Since we&#x27;ve been using this, he has stopped biting his nails totally and completely.</li>
            <li>Stopped my 5 year old from sucking her thumb instantly.</li>
            <li>works really well is really bitter</li>
            <li>This was the ONLY product that worked for my 5 year old son...</li>
            <li>/&gt;We turned to this as a last resort because he&#x27;s going to need early orthodontia, but his orthodontist told us that she wouldn&#x27;t put anything on his teeth until he stopped biting his nails because that could undermine the quality of the braces.</li>
            <li>awful!&amp;#34; I continue to apply Mavala Stop every day if I can (every other day at least), but after a week I have finally been able to trim her nails!</li>
            <li>My 7 year old had a rather gross habit of picking her nose and eating her...</li>
            <li>the product did warn that kids may get used to the taste/smell and go back to their old habits.  </li>
            <li>My six year old would not stop sucking on his fore and middle fingers.</li>
            <li>Fingernails on 7-year old child are starting to grow within a week.</li>
            <li>The product is extremely bitter (I tested on my fingers first) and an instant deterrent, however, a bit after a week my daughter got used to the taste</li>
            <li>My son struggled to get to sleep the first night, upset with the bitter taste each time he attempted to suck his thumb, however by the next night, it was no longer an issue.</li>
            <li>Even more she the one asked me to apply when she find out no more bitter taste on her thumbs when by coincidence she bite them.</li>
            <li>This product never worked on our kid, first day she felt bitter taste but later got adjusted to taste.</li>
            <li>Everything was back to normal for us on the third day.</li>
            <li>It is a bitter chemical taste that stays in your mouth for several minutes after you first taste it, no wonder</li>
            <li>I am thinking the poor reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work might be by their genetic&lt;br /&gt;factor of not being able to taste bitterness?</li>
            <li>We still apply it every few nights to keep the success going.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it for awhile to make sure the habit is broken</li>
            <li>I used the stuff for about two weeks until I was confident that I had broken the habit.  </li>
            <li>She even sucked on her fingers, just a few minutes after a fresh coat of the product was applied.  </li>
            <li>We will keep using it until we are sure that the habit is broken.  </li>
            <li>We continued to use the Mavala every night for about 6-8 weeks just to be sure the habit was broken.  </li>
            <li>This product worked much much better, lasted longer, and tasted much worse.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t sucked her finger in almost a year, so I&#x27;m sure the habit has been broken by now.</li>
            <li>Time to step up the game from bandaids on his thumb to something more.</li>
            <li>She seems completely healthy and isn&#x27;t any worse for wear.  </li>
            <li>after reading this, I&#x27;m really glad that I didn&#x27;t let this touch my child&#x27;s thumb, and I&#x27;m annoyed that I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>So many people told me that this habit would fall away, but in our experience it just got worse.  </li>
            <li>I have found a worse tasting product that works better for me.  </li>
            <li>I am still using this product until I am sure that the habit broken.</li>
            <li>She promptly asked me if she could suck her thumb as soon as the Mavala had dried, and I obliged with a smile on my face.</li>
            <li>Believe me, it is totally worth the money now, then having to pay for braces further down the road.</li>
            <li>After the first taste of it he wanted to have something to drink to wash it down for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Looking down at my nails right now, any minor issues are completely excusable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve eaten my share of gross things over the years, and generally a quick rinse and a few spits</li>
            <li>The longest I&#x27;ve ever gone without biting my nails is a few months and it was only because I was pregnant and for some reason didn&#x27;t have the urge.  </li>
            <li>Even if you remove the product (such as if a child deliberately strips the stuff off as soon as you&#x27;re out of sight), you will still taste it strongly for at least a day or two.  </li>
            <li>Overall we were shocked at how quickly and easily it has put a stop to the thumbsucking!</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t stop using it right away because she started sucking again after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After having had no fewer than dozens of serious infections, two of which prompted my physician to emphasize the urgency of this matter - and after having removed the white part of my middle finger nail on my dominant hand (while leaving the remainder in tact) on two separate occasions, I thought I would give it one more</li>
            <li>I started to see him sucking his thumb less in the first week</li>
            <li>Whenever I bite my nails, I don&#x27;t even realize it at first, and by the time I realize it, half of my nails are already ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-----&gt;Now to the product, after applying it less then 24 hours ago for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My only recommendation is to use it in small quantities on the offending digit, as we originally put excess amounts on all of her fingers</li>
            <li>Be consistent about applying the product daily or every other day.</li>
            <li>She was hesitant at first but finally agreed when I explained to her how it looks like to other people seeing her that way.</li>
            <li>Actually this is my second time to use mavala stop,first with my older daughter and now with the second one</li>
            <li>I applied while she was sleeping and used it twice and noticed right from the first week that she was biting her nail less and less, after the 2nd used she quit biting them all together just yesterday</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li>We tried discouraging the thumb sucking since he was about 2.5 years old with very little success (that was when he went from sucking his thumb all the time to only at night and when upset).</li>
            <li>I originally bought Thum brand polish to stop my nail biting, but it wasn&#x27;t the least bit</li>
            <li>I realized he started sucking on the other hand after two days, not as intensely but still.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t think it would work since I had tried other products like Thum.  </li>
            <li>We tried other methods for months without much luck.  </li>
            <li>In just two applications (just a dab based on other reviewers saying not to use too much) he quit.</li>
            <li>The direction call for coating nail every other day, but it may require coating once or twice a day depending on how much they have sucked.  </li>
            <li>I Bought this product for my son who was still sucking his thumb at 10 years old,I tried other products which really did not help, after just 2 application</li>
            <li>I really thought I would never break him of this habit, if he was not eating one of his thumbs were almost always in his mouth while the other was playing with his toy or whatever he was doing.  </li>
            <li>I just put a dab on (thanks to other comments on here).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for other kids who are ready to get help breaking &amp;#34;hand in mouth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried three different products from drug and beauty supply stores with little success.  </li>
            <li>and we are just finally getting back to normal although he&#x27;s still only doing 9 hours instead of 13.</li>
            <li>Maybe my children just don&#x27;t have sensitive taste buds (they&#x27;re generally not picky eaters like some I&#x27;ve seen), but this did not help us at all.  </li>
            <li>After 2 bottles worth it may have been wasted money, as it did not help in the long run of breaking my old habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does taste terrible and it was a pretty good deterrent for daytime, but we really needed something to get her through the night without sucking her thumb and this did not work.  </li>
            <li>It also has an annoying numbing effect on your tongue which in this case is a good thing!</li>
            <li>stop the bite\\&quot; is very bitter and the taste comes on much quicker than Malvala.</li>
            <li>This tastes very bitter, as advertised, but that didn&#x27;t seem to stop my daughter too much.  </li>
            <li>It was to much , she threw up, and everything tasted very bitter for 2 days.</li>
            <li>Had been trying all sorts of tactics for the last year (including vinegar and other &amp;#34;bitter&amp;#34; tasting products, positive reinforcement charts, games of &amp;#34;hiding the thumb&amp;#34;, etc.)</li>
            <li>I tried Mavala Stop after seeing other positive reviews, and it has definitely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>This one does, but at least for us and our incredibly oral child, it still is not a perfect solution to end thumbsucking</li>
            <li>I thought this would be the perfect solution to my 3yr old&#x27;s disgusting habit of&lt;br /&gt;nail biting</li>
            <li>When asked if she was ready to stop sucking her fingers, she would reply in the negative, so I didn&#x27;t think she was ready for the product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pleasant, sure, but it&#x27;s certainly not much of a deterrent  for an adult chronic nail biter.</li>
            <li>It actually does coat your nails in a clear coat so that if you are a male, it does not look like you have polish on your nails.</li>
            <li>We tried several different things to help our 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>Since she is only 2 years old, initially we were concerned about the safety of Mavala</li>
            <li>after doing everything possible for over 5 years to get my 11 yr old to stop biting her nails, this finally worked.  </li>
            <li>I am a 27 year old female who has been biting my nails since 2nd grade</li>
            <li>My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth.</li>
            <li>The only downside comes when eating, especially with my 4 year old because her fingers sometimes go into her mouth by accident.</li>
            <li>We also plan on using it with my younger daughter in the near future.  </li>
            <li>This is the only polish that actually works for my 9 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter finally stopped sucking her 2 fingers (index and middle)!  </li>
            <li>We have tried everything to help our 3½ year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, and this is the only product that actually worked.  </li>
            <li>Applied as directed on my 3 year old son and 20 minutes later he&#x27;s sucking his thumb without so much as a second thought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using the product on my 3 year old daughter who constantly bites her nails.</li>
            <li>We next tried to rig up a homemade soft collar to stop her injuring herself, but that didn&#x27;t work well either and only lasted</li>
            <li>We had to apply this once every other day on our 5yr old to stop biting his nails and it took 2 months for him to completely stop!</li>
            <li>We tried to be gentle, we tried to be firm, we tried to keep her hands busy but nothing was working.</li>
            <li>Our 3 1/2 year old sucked his thumb on a regular basis, and we have tried multiple products to get him to stop.  </li>
            <li>Around the second week, she figured out that it was bitter and didn&#x27;t want to let us use it, but we reassured her that it is nontoxic and would really help her stop sucking her</li>
            <li>We tried different methods for making my four year old stop sucking her thumb, this is the only product that is stopping her.</li>
            <li>I will be using it on my younger son when he is old enough per the package directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This weapons-grade liquid evil goes on nice and clear, and only with a close inspection would anyone be able to tell that your fingernails are especially shiny.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how often I put my fingers in my mouth, not only to bite my nails, but to dislodge food that was stuck in the back of my mouth or when I was eating a finger food like potato chips.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 2 1/2 yr old who has a habit of sucking on his 2 middle fingers, but also is constantly is sticking all of his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li>Our 2 yr old daughter would constantly suck her two fingers (middle and ring) until we used this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this back in 2012 for my then 18 month old who was sucking index and middle finger.</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old is back at it again sucking on her index and middle finger.</li>
            <li>Finally found something that worked for my nine year old son, didn&#x27;t think it was possible at this point.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 year old female, and have been biting my nails my entire life.</li>
            <li>I am a 32yr old male and have been bitten my nails since middle school.</li>
            <li>My 3 1/2 yr old daughter sucked her thumb mostly when she slept or got bored</li>
            <li>The main problem I have with it is it&#x27;s not immediately bitter</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to know those germs are not constantly being transmitted to her mouth and through the broken skin on her fingertips.  </li>
            <li>make sure u apply only a thin layer on the nail because if it is on skin and if u touch anthing u eat, you will feel a taste change</li>
            <li>It is somewhat irritating, but I can definitely see that soon I won&#x27;t have to have the reminder to keep my nails healthy anymore.</li>
            <li>It tastes nasty, but you have to keep applying every 2 days at the most for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I was excited at the idea of using this on my 4year old thumb sucker who had pushed his teeth out of position, thinking that yes the end is in sight!</li>
            <li>I thought its gonna be too hard for her, specially she was used to suck it so she can sleep.</li>
            <li>Very strong and difficult to get the taste out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>At this point I would most rather get my money back, but I realize that its pointless (due to the price and the fact that I have opened it and used it).</li>
            <li>minutes after applying the first coat, I saw a streak of little person running to the refrigerator to grab some water.</li>
            <li>This product works for us, my little girl hates the taste of it but is willing to put it on if I give her a piece of gum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first application I put on my sons nail stomps, but also a little beyond on his finger tips, so he wouldn&#x27;t move his biting attention.</li>
            <li>After feeling like we had no other options, we finally tried this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my nail biting was getting to be a big enough problem that this small inconvenience was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>i went days with out putting it on at first and my stubborn little guy was hiding sucking his thumb....</li>
            <li>First thing this morning, without even thinking about it, I went to bite of the smallest little piece of nail.</li>
            <li>From start to finish, the process only took one week with the major part being 2</li>
            <li>He has not bitten his nails since using it, and we just clipped his nails for the first time since he was a little baby.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy his poor chewed up finger nails can finally grow normally, while keeping unnecessary germs out of his mouth</li>
            <li>When I got this stuff in the mail I put it on right away, a few hours later when I went to bite my nails</li>
            <li>Her thumb went in her mouth, came right back out, and she started crying for a drink to get the taste out.</li>
            <li>It worked for a few nights, then, she went right back to sucking.  </li>
            <li>My son no longer sucks his thumb and it worked right away!  </li>
            <li>We put pretty pink nail polish (speed dry) on her toe</li>
            <li>It was not easy, but totally and completely worth it.</li>
            <li>- we just put a couple of small dabs since it is quite strong and bitter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-you can&#x27;t remove the taste from your nails right away, it&#x27;ll slowly fade (usually gone by day 2 or 3, but you can reapply a fresh coat!), so if you&#x27;re going to have any lady friends nibbling on your hands, you should probably warn them...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used another product that was more of a salve for your nails and it healed my hands much more quickly, but was not so nasty and it dried out in my pocket and required reapplication.  </li>
            <li>My 9 month old will get his thumb painted when he gets a little older.</li>
            <li>but I guess our daughter will stop this bad habbit on her own terms!</li>
            <li>Generally deters my child, who is a rabid nail biter, but only if we use it intermittently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving this product 4 stars as we have tried several other products that really don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I am a 33 year old woman who has been biting her nails for as long as she can remember.</li>
            <li>She was four years old and been sucking her thumb as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>As a nail biter all my life so far this stuff works (as long as you put it on).</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son has been sucking his thumb for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>Apparently the breaks in the skin from his teeth combined with getting dirt or whatever on his hands was enough to cause the infection.</li>
            <li>but my two year old was not put off for long using this product.</li>
            <li>I put in on my son&#x27;s fingernails every other day the first week, every 3 days the second week, once a week the third week and up to present.  </li>
            <li>My son has gone from sucking his thumb all day long to completely stopping.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Orly nail biting product and you can barely taste that stuff, even shortly after applying.</li>
            <li>As a side note, my 19 month old was still pestering me to nurse her before bedtime, long after my milk supply had vanished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t taste it myself, but it wasn&#x27;t apparently THAT gross.</li>
            <li>After another application, the problem was mitigated for a considerable while, only happening during sleep several weeks later.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been sucking her fingers so long that she has tooth marked scars on two of her fingers where her teeth meet the flesh of her finger.  </li>
            <li>It did not take long for this to work on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and have been a nail biter for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>Of course he was very cranky for a while trying to adjust to such a big change, but that&#x27;s like any habit someone tries to quit.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the rim of the jar had gotten sticky and I cleaned it myself earlier this week and apparently got some on my fingers.</li>
            <li>The first day she tried to switch to her other thumb, but she didnt like that and didnt try it for long.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 4 products similar to this one and this is by far the most useless one for me.</li>
            <li>After this first night, he never woke crying again.</li>
            <li>For the first day, I put it on her, she try to nibble before it dried, and she vomited.  </li>
            <li>The first night we tried Mavala he was up a lot during the night, crying because he needed his thumb to fall asleep (he said).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I applied it after the first few days.  </li>
            <li>We have a block full of recovering thumb suckers now..</li>
            <li>Our son got hooked on sucking his thumb when he was born at 35 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be held for the first few weeks of life.  </li>
            <li>My son (9) who chews his fingernails doesn&#x27;t touch them when the Mavala is freshly applied (usually lasts 1 to 2 days).  </li>
            <li>Not sure it was worth it...</li>
            <li>Just be aware because this has ruined my appetite quite a few times.</li>
            <li>well the first few times I have used it.</li>
            <li>I applied a heavy coat on both kids&#x27; fingernails the first night I received Mavala in the mail.</li>
            <li>The first couple of nights she was whining all night &amp; crying at times</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks she asked me every night if her thumb was still yucking and</li>
            <li>The first day she put her thumb in her mouth a few times and gagged.  </li>
            <li>This product worked well the first few times.</li>
            <li>First time he forgot it was on, he spit for a few seconds, and now he learned a lesson.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It worked well for the first few days</li>
            <li>2 minutes later her thumb is right back in her mouth, should would frown a little bit</li>
            <li>It took us a long time to calm them down and they kept putting their fingers back in their mouth and it started all over again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>However, applying a larger glob to cover some skin area too had a more dramatic effect when the thumb was sucked;  There was coughing for about 5 minutes,</li>
            <li>and we really didn&#x27;t want to go down</li>
            <li>It has slowed him down a bit, but if he really wants to suck his thumb it doesn&#x27;t stop him.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it fabulous for discouraging nail-biting, but it also helps if your little one tends to eat their noodles (or other fork-worthy foods) with their fingers.  </li>
            <li>Our dd was addicted to her thumbs, and after trying many other things (including rewards, transferring to a different lovey, pep talks from dentist and pediatrician), we got the book &#x27;Thumb Love&#x27;, and after reading it a few times, applied just a dot to her thumbs every other day for maybe three applications.</li>
            <li>so I only put a little bit on at first.  </li>
            <li>The first day she put her thumb in her mouth without thinking over a dozen times, each time ripping it back out and spluttering a little.  </li>
            <li>it was like a miracle,with my second i put for her twice,at the first time coz she kept trying to suck she throw out a little</li>
            <li>It works, but does wear off towards the end of the day due mainly to hand washing.  </li>
            <li>biting nails is super hard to break.</li>
            <li>When they got too old we just told them that their thumb would start tasting bad when it was ready to be left alone :)  </li>
            <li>after few weeks i noticed that i don&#x27;t get the same first YUCK feeling that i got the first few days..</li>
            <li>tip - be very careful getting the lid on tight &amp; periodically clean the threads on the cap.</li>
            <li>This one seems to have been a little more offensive than the last one we tried, but it&#x27;s not strong enough for a compulsive nail biter.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and as expected, tastes extremely bitter when you get it in your mouth which is a great way to make you stop biting your nails however it does make eating finger foods a little difficult.</li>
            <li>I thought I just had my hands near my mouth when biting my nails, but I realized I put them near my mouth other times as well, such as when eating foods with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>He did vomit once that first night due to him sucking on his thumb just long enough while falling asleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered it here on Amazon and was really hoping it would work since it was so much more expensive than the other stuff.</li>
            <li>Product was effective for only approximately one week with an every other a day application.</li>
            <li>my child would just keep right on sucking that thumb without missing a beat!</li>
            <li>she would suck right past the taste.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviewers, I would bite my nails down the quick.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is five years old and comes from a very long line of thumb-suckers (three generations that I know of).  </li>
            <li>That was the main reason I stopped wearing it on my own nails, it basically made me sick when I tried to eat anything</li>
            <li>It is funny because most people don&#x27;t believe it could be that bad</li>
            <li>It sure does taste bad, and it makes me aware of what I&#x27;m doing with my hands.</li>
            <li>The bad flavor lasts for 2 full days with a less effective 3rd day.  </li>
            <li>It does say should be used on ages 3 and up, and shes only 2 1/2, but at such a young age, I feel like its easier to break the habit now, And watching her bite her nails, to where they are bright red, and just look painful, I can&#x27;t let it continue.</li>
            <li>For he knows that we still have a full bottle ready to use if carelessly bites his nails again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We applied the Mavala on his thumbs, and the smell was less than appetizing.  </li>
            <li>For myself, if I ever needed to buy another bottle (hopefully not) I might look for something that provides a less intense reminder to not bite my nails.</li>
            <li>I used about half the bottle and then didn&#x27;t really need it anymore, every once in a while</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3 1/2 years old and sucks her first two fingers.  </li>
            <li>I have a 5 year old who sucks his first two fingers</li>
            <li>For a 3 year old, coating only the nail was plenty to cause gagging and some minor throw up, and the child hasn&#x27;t sucked thumb since.  </li>
            <li>We have so far not had any problem of her contaminating her food, but have been careful to only apply the tiniest amount of product as far back as possible on the fingernail.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s obviously too young and a long ways off from this type of thing.</li>
            <li>I am currently 30 years old and I have bitten my nails for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>He woke up once the first night crying, and I went in and explained that he must be getting to be a bigger boy and congratulations!</li>
            <li>My four year old was an avid thumb sucker.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, he didn&#x27;t like the taste, but within a few hours the thumb was back in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>If your child has the same night time habit, try this for the first few times during the day to prevent the meltdown at bedtime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 2.8 year old was an avid thumb sucker:  while playing, watching TV, traveling, before and during sleep.  </li>
            <li>It wears off relatively quickly and has to be reapplied at least once a day.</li>
            <li>My niece just turned 3 years old and was an avid thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li>Now my little guy did throw up only once when he took this first big suck on the thumb.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway we use it all the time and it single handedly stopped our 3 year old form sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>I gave him a bath, and he figured it out (the little smart alex)  </li>
            <li>We really wanted to cut the habbit before her 3rd birthday because as a former finger sucker myself, I know the older</li>
            <li>Please note that the bottle recommends not giving this to any child under 3, but my wife and I were desperate :) The product works!</li>
            <li>and it was really begining to mess up his teeth.</li>
            <li>the whole bottle was a gummy mess.</li>
            <li>I actually tried it first and was shocked on how potent it was..</li>
            <li>Avoid eating finger foods and touching your lips (or at least be very careful)!</li>
            <li>Avoid eating finger foods and touching your lips (or at least be very careful)!</li>
            <li>I have continued to apply the product regularly for the past few weeks just to be sure she does not relapse but have not seen her thumb in her mouth once since we started using it.  </li>
            <li>To alleviate this problem, I began to paint only a small part of her nail, right over the cuticle and onto the finger itself.  </li>
            <li>that being said, I cannot testify to any of its other uses (such as to deter thumb sucking), but I do highly recommend it to anyone with a nail-biting problem.</li>
            <li>that being said, I cannot testify to any of its other uses (such as to deter thumb sucking), but I do highly recommend it to anyone with a nail-biting problem.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the second bottle was not nearly as strong a taste as the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I used this for my two and half year old daughter who has been sucking thumb ever since she was a week old and had started to use her thumb sucking as a weapon because she knew it irritated us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My 2 and half year old kid get used to suck her thumb since she was 2 months old and was still suck it just before I use Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li>But with this product I have been able to slow it down, and actually recognize when I&#x27;m doing it.  </li>
            <li>Soon after applying a thick coat of this to my 3-year-old&#x27;s entire thumb nail, she stuck it in her mouth, quickly pulled it out and looked at her thumb.</li>
            <li>I quickly explained &amp;#34;I know it doesn&#x27;t taste good, and every time you put your thumb in your mouth it&#x27;s going to be nasty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43 years old and have been a chronic nail biter and after using this product I have Long Nails!!</li>
            <li>only negative is that I wish is came in a smaller size because we have almost a full bottle left over!</li>
            <li>I used it on my 4 year old daughter who thumb sucks and am getting positive results already.</li>
            <li>We tried a few approaches (reward charts, positive encouragement, constant reminders, etc).  </li>
            <li>It is definitely bitter enough to deter carefree finger sucking, but so far hasn&#x27;t really slowed my child down.</li>
            <li>We had to make sure we don&#x27;t forget painting it every night, gently reminding son of his bad habbit by reading a social story and a lot of support and encouragements throughout the process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, but slightly glossy (not as glossy as regular clear nail polish, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was clearly disturbed by the taste of the product and within a few days, she had completely stopped sucking or trying to suck her fingers!</li>
            <li>Since she was older than the average kid that uses it for thumb-sucking, I didn&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li>Then two of her milk teeth became loose and fell out in which I realized that this habitual hand sucking habit could potentially alter the locations of her emerging adult teeth.</li>
            <li>or I would need to pay out large amounts of money for an appliance for his mouth now, and braces in a few years.</li>
            <li>It does go on easy like nail polish and dries fast, The taste is bad enough to stop anyone from putting their fingers anywhere near their mouth however if you eat anything with your fingers the taste rubs off on the food and makes the food inedible.</li>
            <li>the first night was rough, very rough.</li>
            <li>i have a very stubborn little boy.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned when I read the horror stories about this product, but it worked absolutely as advertised for us.</li>
            <li>After a hug and a kiss and a little time sitting together talking about it she was ready to sleep again.  </li>
            <li>While she was fast asleep, I put just BARELY a little on.</li>
            <li>As far as her diet she has been doing well she has not refused to eat any of her normal food due to the bitter taste of her thumb.</li>
            <li>We have not applied Mavala Stop more than that one time and, as I stated, only used a very, very light amount--just so a bit of the nasty taste would be there to stop her licking and chewing.  </li>
            <li>I think she was ready to quit and just needed a little help since it was such an ingrained habit for her.  </li>
            <li>i was biting my nails all the time since i was a little girl, now that I used this my nails are long and pretty.</li>
            <li>this product is such a life saver, my daughter has been sucking her thumb for a while, she has callous on her thumb due to her sucking habit, i&#x27;ve tried putting betadine, ginger, onion, garlic, cinnamon, band-aid but still no luck with it until her new dentist recommended this product, she stopped sucking her thumb for just 2 days,she said she don&#x27;t want to suck her thumb</li>
            <li>You heard me right - 10 year old thumb sucker, we tried EVERYTHING even a myotherapist and NOTHING worked until this!  </li>
            <li>So I recommended that you use very little and try it first</li>
            <li>was impressed, but skeptical, at the large number of glowing reviews on Amazon about this product, and the bad reviews were a result of improper use or not following the directions.</li>
            <li>So excited when I got the package and washed his hands and put a small little drop on his thumb nail (I read other reviews that said doing the whole nail made for a exorcism type experience</li>
            <li>Money very well spent!!!</li>
            <li>My 2 year old twin girls used to suck their thumb almost all day long!!!</li>
            <li>just not that good ( or bad ..  </li>
            <li>He said it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it didn&#x27;t taste good by any means.</li>
            <li>Bad Habit&amp;#34; helped him stop biting his nails for good.  </li>
            <li>The taste is bad and it lingers in your mouth for a good 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>my kid loved it, the smell was bad</li>
            <li>Which is a good and bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is a nice clear coat of nail polish, so it doesn&#x27;t look bad on your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good and bad at the same time.</li>
            <li>This is good and bad since it is a constant reminder you are breaking your habit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was bad enough for her to stop for good.</li>
            <li>So I ordered it and got it pretty fast and the first time she stuck her thumb in her mouth after I applied it she started screaming and said her thumb tasted bad.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 3 year old chronic thumb sucker and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>My 3.5 year old daughter sucks her thumb so much -- including while asleep -- that the dentist said she had begun to deform her mouth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she sucks on her thumbs sooo much.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old son sucks his thumb so much</li>
            <li>We used this product simultaneously on 3 children: an 8.5 year old that puts his thumb in his mouth (not actually sucking) when he reads,  a 6.5 year old who bit her nails until the white was all gone with occasional bleeding, and a 2.5 year old who sucks both thumbs when sleepy/bored.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing that worked and I will be using it with my 3 year old thumb sucker when I think he is ready.</li>
            <li>the more subtle it becomes until you&#x27;re back to biting your nails even with the slight taste of the product.  </li>
            <li>so I was initially hesitant to try this, however the polish is clear and not very noticeable</li>

            <li> So glad I found this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> awesome! :)</li>
            <li> When she ahd a fully successful day ( no thumb sucking at all)</li>
            <li> and they both have successfully stopped thumbsucking.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t use it per instructions because he got used to the taste and actually liked it!  </li>
            <li> Now I have nice manicured fingernails!</li>
            <li> Successfully helped me to stop bite my nails.</li>
            <li> we thought this would be the best and most</li>
            <li> Effective results!</li>
            <li> and more importantly, he is so proud of himself!!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has stopped biting her nails and they are growing out nicely!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been successful.</li>
            <li> your nail clippers handy!</li>
            <li> So... with that kind of feedback, I&#x27;ve never dared to put this on my fingernails and taste it!</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this product is that it works while they&#x27;re sleeping too!</li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> Regardless not as successful as i had hoped for her.</li>
            <li> And somewhat successful for me.</li>
            <li> Makes a great gift! :)</li>
            <li> Forget that, I slathered some on her thumbnails once a night before bedtime for about 3 weeks (called it \\&quot;magic fingernail polish\\&quot;) and it worked great!  </li>
            <li> We have been using it for a couple weeks a noticed remarkable results.</li>
            <li> Remarkable product.  </li>
            <li> Truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and wanted to share it with moms who are looking for a product to get rid of Thumb sucking hassle free way!</li>
            <li> so it looks nice!</li>
            <li> but it is not 100 percent successful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it would this successful.</li>
            <li> We have tried all sorts of home remedies and none have been successful, but this product did the trick.</li>
            <li> but that is what makes it effective!</li>
            <li> This is great product although I do recommend reading some reviews so you can get a good idea of what to expect or so...</li>
            <li> Effective!</li>
            <li> It was successful in that.</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m glad that my child has beautiful nails now!!!</li>
            <li> BUT they will have nice nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27; have that kind of time!</li>
            <li> and it worked great as I started right away!!!!</li>
            <li> This will be a pleasant surprise for Granny and Poppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very glad that we got it, seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews unless a product really is impressive and this stuff is awesome!!</li>
            <li> One of this products best features is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li> It is very very strong!</li>
            <li> but with this stuff it was a very easy transition!</li>
            <li> It is very strong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful feeling to look at healthy nails that are your own!</li>
            <li> oh so brightly colored world</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results and her progress, this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I would put bright nail polish on to discourage my nail bitting</li>
            <li> My twins teeth aleady don&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> ( a good thing)</li>
            <li> so I would draw in a star for good effort and honesty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked online for some products, and i saw this product, it had really good reviews from hundreds of people.</li>
            <li> By the 5th days she was good.</li>
            <li> The pepper nail polish flavor tasted good and</li>
            <li> Good idea to keep lozengers on hand to get rid of the taste if you should accidently taste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff ..  </li>
            <li> We set my daughter up by telling her someday her thumbs wouldn&#x27;t taste good.  </li>
            <li> We continued the nightly application for a week just for good measure.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter is 2 and-a-half and loved to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li> The thumb did not taste good anymore.</li>
            <li> We tried Thumb, which may as well have been candy for as good as it worked.  </li>
            <li> loved it.</li>
            <li> Helps, but no product is the answer for the underlying issue - good supplemental.</li>
            <li> Product worked soo good</li>
            <li> you need to stop biting your nails for good, THIS IS YOUR STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> but probably good we didn&#x27;t because it says ages three and up.</li>
            <li> I regretted that decision with a good 15 minutes of bitterness in my mouth and throat.</li>
            <li> and it had good reviews</li>
            <li> I loved this product it worked with in 4 days</li>
            <li> Good luck to others</li>
            <li> Also good for practical joke.</li>
            <li> The taste is a good deterrent from nail biting.</li>
            <li> It took a good week or two</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good, but</li>
            <li> Good:</li>
            <li> Good God.  </li>
            <li> We reward him for each time we clip all 10 of his finger nails to reinforce the good habit of not biting fingers.  </li>
            <li> We gave her fair warning that this product was coming, and when it arrived (about 6 weeks ago)</li>
            <li> She kept saying that her thumbs didn&#x27;t taste good anymore.</li>
            <li> i saw this had really good reviews on amazon</li>
            <li> So I asked him to lick his painted thumbnail and tell me how it tasted, and he did and repeated that it tasted good, like food.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this product a try after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good everyone who bites there nails should use this</li>
            <li> Lot of good that did.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> and she stopped sticking her thumb in her mouth for a good month.</li>
            <li> Best to try the cheap alternatives first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to put it again and again I just tell him that if he put it again I will use Mavala on his finger and the good boy will listen.</li>
            <li> In reflecting on my habit, I realized that biting and picking at my nails was a sort of compulsion to make things perfect, even, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were so good...</li>
            <li> Good luck to you all-</li>
            <li> Good luck to you</li>
            <li> Truly the miraculous cure you&#x27;ve been needing for you or your loved one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and they look good now.</li>
            <li> At works good but you need to do it every week</li>
            <li> helped me quit, then i started getting used to the taste, not as effective now, great for starters</li>
            <li> Product is good , go for it</li>
            <li> and he said he didn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li> Mommy and Daddy don&#x27;t suck our fingers because they don&#x27;t taste good anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is a good idea, but my son didn&#x27;t stop sucking his finger after I applied it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works,so it is good</li>
            <li> My nails look good.  </li>
            <li> It started off good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the ease and effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li> If it tasted good it wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> She loved helping with the nightly application.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Good Luck</li>
            <li> and this product will get in your mouth a surprising amount of times per day</li>
            <li> Taking it everywhere with us to ensure he had it on for a good amount of time to hopefully break the habit.  </li>
            <li> I had to write the review for this as it worked so good.</li>
            <li> good thing</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Yuck, which is actually a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li> when she&#x27;s reading a good book and gets to a stressful scene there she goes on auto-pilot.  </li>
            <li> This product is a good prevention for thumb sucking and nail biting.</li>
            <li> So if you reapply this after getting a bath, you should be good.</li>
            <li> this product is a really good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is a really good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , he put it in his mouth and he cried himself to sleep for a good 10 minutes</li>
            <li> After years of trying to get our son to stop sucking his thumb with no avail, we decided to give this a try after reading all the good reviews here.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t do any good for a toddler who is adicted to his thumb.</li>
            <li> it works good.</li>
            <li> I told him it didn&#x27;t taste good so he should try to keep his fingers out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> Bite\\&quot; which is as good, but can&#x27;t find anymore and started biting again.</li>
            <li> This was a good way to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb while awake.  </li>
            <li> On Friday, before my daughter went for her nap, I told her that once she wakes up, her thumb will no longer taste good.  </li>
            <li> The night went surprisingly well</li>
            <li> works good.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased THUM from the drug store and she said her fingers tasted good, so I went searching online and found Mavala.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but maybe it is good for others.</li>
            <li> I Googled to find solutions and found Mavala a Thumb Guard as options with good results.  </li>
            <li> However, not so good with my son.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an aid in the finger sucking battle this is a good one.</li>
            <li> and I think you will have good results.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory</li>
            <li> I would estimate it took him a good 2 months to be done and not need it on his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> It was effective and a great aid in helping him break a habit.</li>
            <li> Product is a good quality nail polish that prevents nail bitting or thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> product had good reviews</li>
            <li> Good idea, but my daughter figured out that you can peel the polish off after it dries.</li>
            <li> This is a good deterrant for my son is who trying to stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I came on Amazon and stumbled across Mavala and decided to order it because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried Thum, which was about as good as putting water on this thumb for all the good it did.</li>
            <li> It has bn a good start.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews not lying when saying Vomit inducing.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get the taste out for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The taste stays in your mouth, and coats you lips, which is good if you truly want to break the habit.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> My daughter said it does not taste good</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> and if she did good not biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to all the parents out there that are in our situation.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to all the parents out there that are in our situation.  </li>
            <li> The polish DOES NOT taste good at ALL</li>
            <li> It gets under the nail and onto the skin around the nail, so I also think its good for finger chewers.  </li>
            <li> but that is a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li> serum.good good good</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps the change of scenery along with the Mavala Stop would be a good combination.  </li>
            <li> I tried socks,and tape,putting tape on his fingers and all that good stuff,and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Good Luck to you.</li>
            <li> I told her, honey, your thumb doesn&#x27;t taste good at this age and it&#x27;s time to stop.  </li>
            <li> and I seem to be good to go.</li>
            <li> Good news:</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> because if their lip accidentally even touches your finger nail they will be gagging and hating you for a good 5</li>
            <li> part is good.  </li>
            <li> , none were as good as Mavala Stop which is why I purchased a replacement bottle.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but just might not work for stubborn toddler like mine...</li>
            <li> Foods didn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good product, and does what you will expect.</li>
            <li> This product received a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> which probably attributed to the lack of good results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mavala is a good deterrent.</li>
            <li> She admitted these products didn&#x27;t taste good, but they didn&#x27;t stop her from biting.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t taste good.</li>
            <li> And I stopped licking the BBQ sauce off my fingers because it no longer tasted good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep putting it on her until I&#x27;m sure the habit is kicked for good!</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest it for children struggling with giving up thumb sucking!!</li>
            <li> My nails are beautiful now. :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy it was easy!</li>
            <li> That itself - just seeing them there is so awesome that it&#x27;s a super motivator for</li>
            <li> But, I didn&#x27;t purchase this for a delicious taste so this product quickly breaks the habit.</li>
            <li> unless you are soaking htem in water like in a pool, it will fade faster) but for best results if you apply it every 2 days that would be best, but it could last for 3 days.</li>
            <li> It works perfect but be aware of eating any finger foods!</li>
            <li> son&#x27;s face was priceless the first time he tasted it!  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and we are so happy not be repeating \\&quot;Get your thumb out of your mouth!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The taste will remain very potent on your nails for about three days.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the result.thing that might touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Great Product - sure it would also&lt;br /&gt;work</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product I also apply it every day rather than ever two day</li>
            <li> The stuff is very potent and doesn&#x27;t come off for days.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that it worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li> am very, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Me and her are both happy with it :)</li>
            <li> We both are very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> With all the 5-star reviews and great comments, I thought for sure this would be our answer.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re done, it&#x27;s an ongoing process, but I have been very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> on the very top of the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My son is very proud of his success.  </li>
            <li> She is doing great now :-)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the outcome because I have nails now...</li>
            <li> but he is now so proud of himself that he was able to get this habit under control.</li>
            <li> This works great when I am able to put it on my daughters fingernails.</li>
            <li> and she was very excited and happy.  </li>
            <li> I got this awesome 5 star pizza, and right before eating..</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 weeks ago and am getting nails - beautiful strong nails.  </li>
            <li> very effective, but it didnt occur to me that i might want to be able to stick my fingers in my mouth on occasion when NOT biting at them, which proved to be an issue.</li>
            <li> It recommends use for children over 3, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a good product for anyone!</li>
            <li> So glad we purchased it!</li>
            <li> My nails do look better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks since I started using it, and I&#x27;m enjoying watching my nails grow!</li>
            <li> And my son is pretty proud of that too!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> If it could stop my daughter&#x27;s thumbsucking, it can stop most anybody&#x27;s thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> Again, magic!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> So team up and share with someone else or another mom who might be able to use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> After all, he bit his fingers for most of his life!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I told him not to worry, I&#x27;d be ordering more, TODAY!</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I got Mavala!</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding!</li>
            <li> every once in a while to make sure to keep the habit gone!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> The taste is the most horrendous taste ever!</li>
            <li> But after that...no more thumbsucking!  </li>
            <li> Even in some of the most stressful times!</li>
            <li> Interestingly, if it wears off and he finds himself at the finger tip snack bar, he asks us for a re-application!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more!</li>
            <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding!, April 26, 2009&lt;</li>
            <li> and my nails look way better!</li>
            <li> I have to say that it has been pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many things, but nothing has worked as well as this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> :)IT!  </li>
            <li> When I did I was satisfied with the product since I couldn&#x27;t taste food for 2 days!</li>
            <li> Worked like magic!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Now I have no worries about more mouth damage from continued sucking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to see the whites of my nails!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> We love this product!</li>
            <li> He has not put his thumb in his mouth one more time since!</li>
            <li> and it was a winning combination!  </li>
            <li> I applied Mavala Stop for three days and like magic the habit was GONE!</li>
            <li> it isnt as potent!</li>
            <li> We bought more just to give to fellow struggling parents!</li>
            <li> Dear God why... My boyfriend told me about some of the reviews so the first day I was REAL good about not biting them, which incidentally makes me not want to pick at them either because of the temptation that brings to bite them.</li>
            <li> Was able to break out of it in 2 weeks time!</li>
            <li> and he still doesn&#x27;t bite his nails :) this was a win-win product!</li>
            <li> After 10 days, I removed the Mavala with fantastic results!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this stuff worked!</li>
            <li> Some say their child gagged, and or threw up, stopped eating favorite foods etc!</li>
            <li> Now she is very happy &amp; proud of herself that she stopped sucking &amp; ready to start her school with confidence :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I bought the Mavala Stop and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> and I love choosing nail varnish and painting my nails - something I have never done until now!</li>
            <li> What was more amazing was, even while he slept, he didn&#x27;t dare put his finger in his mouth!</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome</li>
            <li> and the tast lingers in your mouth so you are sure to keep your fingers out!..</li>
            <li> Now for me to get some more for my daughter!</li>
            <li> and since I work in the food service industry, I had to make sure to get nail polish remover!</li>
            <li> Would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> and she is thumb sucking free!!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work for this too!</li>
            <li> MAGICAL!</li>
            <li> Her teeth are looking much better also!</li>
            <li> This product deserves 5 stars and more!</li>
            <li> and thanks to this product, within a week, I have stopped this habit!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yesterday I trimmed my finger nails with a nail clipper for the first time in fifty years or so!!!!  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have used this first!!!!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap, arrived very quickly, I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> To our great surprise, the very first application effectively negated the problem for a good three weeks to a month.</li>
            <li> The best analogy I can think of would be if you really liked a certain restaurant.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing, and the taste is just horrendous.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing to jolt me from a nice afternoon gnawing at my nails quite as well as the flavor of a bottle of nail polish concentrated on one fingernail.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing to jolt me from a nice afternoon gnawing at my nails quite as well as the flavor of a bottle of nail polish concentrated on one fingernail.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I put it on our own fingers to support her</li>
            <li> Mavala does quite effectively.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does taste horrid, being the kind of Mom</li>
            <li> she now applies STOP on her own.  </li>
            <li> and he actually liked the flavor...</li>
            <li> We even used it on a friends kiddo who was about to have the dentist do some kind of \\&quot;cure</li>
            <li> Downsides are ruining any kind of finger food, and if you inadvertently lick your fingers after a chip or something, you&#x27;re in for a ruined snack.</li>
            <li> She did try to stop on her own and agreed to bandaids on her thumb</li>
            <li> it would be kind of a unsconcious act, so</li>
            <li> cost effective attempt at \\&quot;quitting.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d turn somewhere else to find a truely effective product to stop these habits.</li>
            <li> When I caught him doing it, he told me he liked the taste of it.</li>
            <li> I am THRILLED and her dentist will be, too.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I kind of stopped when I thought he was over the nail biting, but we had a couple \\&quot;relapses\\&quot; where he would bite one of them</li>
            <li> I have come to realize my son loves to suck his thumb and will have to stop on his own terms.  </li>
            <li> She really wanted to stop, and was proud of herself!  </li>
            <li> we let her apply it onto her own thumb.  </li>
            <li> I now have nice nails and when I catch myself with my hands in my mouth I stop.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how effective this product was.  </li>
            <li> advice is to go ahead and get this polish if your own kids need help with nail biting or thumb sucking and are at an age to appreciate the help.</li>
            <li> Well, this product was effective on our 4-year-old son.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it wears away on its own.</li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t believe it</li>
            <li> I was very happy that it worked so fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t nearly so effective on my son.</li>
            <li> I tried it on one of my own thumb nails, just to know what it tastes like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chemical-ish kind of taste.  </li>
            <li> but I can honestly say this product worked for me to quit biting my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it has worked wonders for others.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my own nails</li>
            <li> LMAO  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t notice any flavor at all, just liked that her nails were shiny.</li>
            <li> But I must say, it&#x27;s nice having nails!&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can get it from any kind of drug store or Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
            <li> you can get it from any kind of drug store or Wal-Mart, etc.</li>
            <li> I say it - nice.  </li>
            <li> but in this case it was not as effective, she would put the thumb in her mouth, make a \\&quot;this is so yucky \\&quot;</li>
            <li> Always keep it handy.</li>
            <li> I had hoped she would stop on her own</li>
            <li> Our boy liked to bite his shirt collar.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic, but it worked very well, and I am so happy it did!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even more pleased at how proud he is that he&#x27;s quit.</li>
            <li> After that it was not so effective.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my 5 year who liked  to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li> He always has his fingers in his mouth, catching a ton of germs and colds.  </li>
            <li> after that, he would just scrape it off with his teeth and proclaim that he liked the taste.</li>
            <li> and I thought it looked nice.</li>
            <li> She tried to stop on her own, but couldn&#x27;t break the habit.</li>
            <li> :) It does not taste good.</li>
            <li> My son liked the stuff, so it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> After attempting to remove the product, I put her thumb in my own mouth</li>
            <li> So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> My 3 oldest have all stopped sucking their fingers thanks to this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Recommended to many friends they loved it.  </li>
            <li> It tastes like you&#x27;ve just liked 10 envelopes all at once....</li>
            <li> within a day it&#x27;s gone.......not to mention my children still sucked their thumb and said they liked the flavor.</li>
            <li> We keep buying more with the hopes that he will kick the habit for good.</li>
            <li> Aside from that it gives my nails a nice gloss</li>
            <li> I suggest anyone try it if they just can&#x27;t stop biting on their own.  </li>
            <li> I tried to get him to stop on his own, but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> ; For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> but just didn&#x27;t have the will power to do it on her own.</li>
            <li> ( to be completely honest I have painted it on her nails every two days since purchasing just in case she gets the desire</li>
            <li> I log onto amazon and because it is a \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li> Worked very well, in fact PERFECT for us.</li>
            <li> Best if the child wants to make the change, as this is meant to be a reminder when the child unconsciously puts his/her fingers in his/her mouth.  </li>
            <li> The best - a gentle reminder that hands do not belong in mouth.</li>
            <li> I love to look at my hands and see my gorgeous nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too effective.</li>
            <li> Plus she liked getting her fingernail&#x27;s painted by her loving father</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li> (I think baths vs. showers shorten the effective life in children).</li>
            <li> But, during the day the Mavala is 100% effective.</li>
            <li> I told him that its a good weight loss plan for people too then. :)</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s loving it ,,,</li>
            <li> This product was effective and efficient.</li>
            <li> did not expect the product to be this effective .&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li> and yes, it is effective.</li>
            <li> , I liked the reviews and decided to give it a try, and I got to say,</li>
            <li> I keep it handy in case I need it again.</li>
            <li> I put it on my own thumb to see.  </li>
            <li> Disgustingly effective...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thoroughly thrilled</li>
            <li> how effective this product has been.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think he actually liked the taste.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I would never get her to stop.  </li>
            <li> The one time that I can use it is effective in preventing my son from sucking his thumb though.</li>
            <li> The oral LD(50) for acute exposure to ethyl acetate is 4,935 mg/kg for rabbits and 5,620 mg/kg for rats; and the 8-hour rat inhalation LC(50) is 1600 ppm [Sax and Lewis 1989].\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend and painted my own thumb and stuck it in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I put one coat on her fingernails and she didn&#x27;t bite them for a week or so and her nails healed nicely.  </li>
            <li> So it never looks nice, but you won&#x27;t bite your nails.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much this stuff is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear to look at my own hands,</li>
            <li> It kind of gets over everything you touch and then put in your mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter liked it because it&#x27;s nail polish.</li>
            <li> The instructions say don&#x27;t apply to skin, but I applied it to my cuticles and fingertips and it is effective.</li>
            <li> It kind of burns for about 30 seconds, but not like an acid burn.</li>
            <li> Amazed at how effective this product is.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best anti-nail biting product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I put some on my own fingernail in solidarity, and when I licked my finger after eating a snack I got to see how vile this stuff is, as I had to try rubbing my tongue on my sleeve to get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li> We just gave her the option that she can try not to do it on her own, but if she does it again, we have to apply it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> She liked the bandaid but eventually would pull them off and suck.</li>
            <li> I might have liked this product</li>
            <li> :) Good Luck</li>
            <li> I think that is what makes it so effective</li>
            <li> so I tasted it on my own nail</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not think this stuff would work.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say how thrilled we are that we are to this point in kicking this dependent habit.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus it leaves a nice gloss on your nails.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe it worked so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told &amp;  it really works great!</li>
            <li> THANKFULLY HE HAS STOPPED ON HIS OWN ACCORD.</li>
            <li> It is effective.</li>
            <li> but is highly effective.</li>
            <li> I even let him paint his own nail...</li>
            <li> I am now working on kicking the habit on my own, it&#x27;s been almost a week of no nail bitting, longest I have gone.</li>
            <li> coat looks shinny and nice.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say I don&#x27;t know how the kids from these reviews muscled through the taste of this product all in the name of thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like Antabuse</li>
            <li> we thought that it was kind of-</li>
            <li> But I am thrilled with the results of this.</li>
            <li> He started remembering to stop all on his own.</li>
            <li> His speech therapist AND dentist are thrilled.  </li>
            <li> worked perfect in my 4year old kid!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found what works best for me is to paint them a pretty color with a good quality nail polish (one that won&#x27;t chip easily) and then continue to paint the Mavala on every morning during the week.</li>
            <li> Great product it really works!!!</li>
            <li> Great, he is even excited to put it on now</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Another good thing is that his appetite has increased significantly!  </li>
            <li> It works wonders even for older kids, it is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> We are very happy with the results and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is way too good to be true!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the best way to stop a child from sucking his or her finger is to stop them while they are new borns by wearing mittens.  </li>
            <li> , i&#x27;d like to find something nice to say about it (okay, it came nicely packaged) but</li>
            <li> But with this product, a nail biter for many years, I was able to get gorgeous and groomed and manicured nails.</li>
            <li> - maybe to effective, powerful, and long-lasting, lol</li>
            <li> I advise you to re-apply after 2-3 days just to keep the taste very strong.</li>
            <li> She is very strong willed and did not want to stop because &amp;#34;it still tastes good&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off very easily, so it will still be there at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> VERY strong stuff.</li>
            <li> This was so very easy to put on my daughter&#x27;s thumb to get her to stop sucking it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but this stuff isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> Be warned it is very strong.</li>
            <li> taste is very strong and it lingers.</li>
            <li> it is very very strong.</li>
            <li> Stop stays very strong.</li>
            <li> She is definately speaking more and much better enunciation!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> You will have healthy nails in no time! :)</li>
            <li> You will have healthy nails in no time! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> must use a fork and knife especially at first, which is better for eating mindfully too!  </li>
            <li> I had heard great things about Mavala STOP from many people and was so excited to try it to get our son to stop sucking his finger.  </li>
            <li> Very good, really taste baaad.</li>
            <li> Maybe the most effective product invented ever.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, this one stood out as the most effective.</li>
            <li> Wow this has to be the best money</li>
            <li> The best part was, despite nearly 20 years of biting, after using this stuff for 2 or 3 weeks, I stopped using it, and I didn&#x27;t start biting again.</li>
            <li> Great product and well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully to get my 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve heard great stories of success from others.  </li>
            <li> We have seen great success.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to get my 2 year old to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> If you are busy doing alot of cleaning (washing clothes, dishes, etc) it will NOT stay on very good!!!</li>
            <li> The problem is that it&#x27;s so effective that I sometimes don&#x27;t reapply it because I know how potent it is.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! , just used twice and my 4 years old stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best thing we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best product we have used so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 4 yr old son who was bitting his nails and it worked great!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was anything that would so effectively and safely discourage thumb-sucking, but this product did.  </li>
            <li> This product is an amazing deterrent and cheap!  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to help my seven year daughter stop sucking her thumb, which she has done since she was 4 months old.</li>
            <li> All I can say is anything that could stop my thumb-suck-a-holic from even wanting to get her thumbs near her lips, awesome!</li>
            <li> (I made sure to try it on my own nails 1st and to taste it 1st</li>
            <li> working marvelously, my will not put his fingers anywhere near his mouth</li>
            <li> So far best money I ever spend for thumb sucking product.</li>
            <li> We let our child paint it on his own thumbs to have more ownership of his choices about sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best product I have ever used to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for my 3 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My daughter was able to stop on her own with the help of this product and no one had to nag or push her to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I painted her thumbs and painted my own to be sympathetic.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 3-year old because our dentist said it was best to break her thumb-sucking before turning 4.  </li>
            <li> The problem is sometimes I have literally damaged my hands to the point where a bandaid is more effective and to apply this would be salt on a wound.</li>
            <li> We used this on my orally fixated, thumb sucking 4 year old and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> So far very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, this product is great at making a yucky taste on your thumb/fingers, and the yuck lasts for days, even after washing hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay so I purchased this to stop my own nail bitting.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth your $$$&lt;</li>
            <li> So far, So good!!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the reaction of my son to the first time he put his fingers in his mouth after applying Mavala- YUCK!!!</li>
            <li> NAil biting has been a habit on my children, that I want to stop right away, Both of my kids started biting their nails at the age of 2, with my son I ordered the omega cream, which worked great on him....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 9/10 nails looking great right now</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was and that it works!  </li>
            <li> Of course, this product is not designed to come off easily (the instructions say to apply every TWO DAYS!)</li>
            <li> It was that easy!</li>
            <li> but once you apply it its easily transferable to EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> This stuff works and very quickly!  </li>
            <li> This product is super amazing!</li>
            <li> Quick and effective!</li>
            <li> the taste is strong!</li>
            <li> Really strong!</li>
            <li> Thanks and good luck!</li>
            <li> I originally got this product for my son thinking that it will curb his nail biting habit for good.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and consider it a good price!</li>
            <li> but then the top started to get all sticky and the lid won&#x27;t screw on/off very easily and also the contents in the bottle have started to solidify.</li>
            <li> So if you use it after a bath or are washing your hands all day at work or home, make sure you reapply since it is very easy to get rid of the product on your nails.</li>
            <li> First bottle worked great for me for not biting my fingernails.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first day.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked great at first.  </li>
            <li> It works great the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> It works my daughter nails look great for the first time in 10 years</li>
            <li> great product .. for a kid trying and willing to quit.</li>
            <li> He made one or two comments that he didn&#x27;t want it but ever since the first day he is happy to have it put on his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I talked to him about it at first and explained he would feel proud accomplishing this</li>
            <li> He was upset the first night or two (of course), but he adjusted and is doing great.  </li>
            <li> Even after a full day of washing hands and working out then showering it was still on there good.</li>
            <li> but it was fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying Mavala Stop very lightly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for stopping any kind of finger to mouth habits, it works great.  </li>
            <li> I looked up the best nail biting solutions that worked the most effectively, and this product instantly came up on top.</li>
            <li> She quickly understood that this did not taste good and no longer has a desire to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> very quick and effective.</li>
            <li> Strong and effective.</li>
            <li> The first three weren&#x27;t very effective as I&#x27;d just bite through the taste.</li>
            <li> In fact, I envied people who chewed on their nails because their fingers looked light years better than mine did!</li>
            <li> Now I have nice, long, ladylike nails that I love!!!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing to see how quickly this product worked without any frustration or heartache for us and our son!</li>
            <li> i think this is a great product, but as others have said- if your kid is smart or stubborn, they&#x27;ll find a way around it.</li>
            <li> Soooooo glad it worked.</li>
            <li> Great product it really works</li>
            <li> I sure won&#x27;t do that again.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried so many things and when I saw everyone singing the praises of this product I thought, \\&quot;A ha.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Because this is the most horrible&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things to stop and nothing has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> This was my experience, maybe you will have better luck with this product but keep in mind if your child has</li>
            <li> I do use it more often.</li>
            <li> also bought a book called \\&quot;Thumbuddy to Love - Ballerina Sue\\&quot; here on Amazon as well</li>
            <li> product[[ASIN:0615273645 Thumbuddy to Love</li>
            <li> So I put one more coat on, and she never did it again.  </li>
            <li> 3 weeks she was done :-)  </li>
            <li> To the best of my knowledge I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my entire life.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it lingers like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li> I doubt that your desire to chew your nails will overcome the thought of another dose of this touching your lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we could put some more on.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this awesome product.</li>
            <li> No child has been able to withstand</li>
            <li> I found it and saw how cheap it was!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is proud of this as much as we are</li>
            <li> just having it on made me stop for the most part</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic nail biter for most of my life.</li>
            <li> His fingers look so much better</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how great this produce is!</li>
            <li> I think for our son he just needed to break the habit for 1-2 days, he has never looked back and is so proud of himself!</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I DID MORE RESEARCH</li>
            <li> (We had to try it too :-) )</li>
            <li> After trying many things, I bought a kit at [...]  </li>
            <li> I have been reapplying every 2 days just to make sure there is no relapse.</li>
            <li> (Mostly it was at night just out of habit)  </li>
            <li> This went on for about 2 more weeks until she broke the habit of putting it in her mouth while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well for those that bite their nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> THEREFORE, I MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Better to have a restless night sleep during the summer than on a school night.  </li>
            <li> I continued to re-apply for 2 weeks just to be sure my child knew the taste was still there.</li>
            <li> But it is so potent</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad we gave it a try - it does not work for everyone -</li>
            <li> The product indicates that children under 3 can&#x27;t use this (or won&#x27;t be able to taste the undesirable taste)...</li>
            <li> Helped my daughter stop her thumb sucking habit better than the retainer that was put in her mouth by the orthodontist.</li>
            <li> It is the PERFECT amount of discouragement, especially for those of us who bite unconsciously.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Sure, it was cute when her thumb was in her mouth</li>
            <li> &quot;... need to wait for 2 more years and give a try if my daughter continues her thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail chewer for most of my life and haven&#x27;t bitten them since using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that this will speed up the end of her finger sucking.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re doing such a great job with not sucking your thumb!</li>
            <li> stuff is grand</li>
            <li> P.S. make sure your baby does not associate it with a punishment or threat.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> We all really love this product, my husband even started using it on his nails.</li>
            <li> Your child needs to be able to TASTE this for it to work.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d be able to fall asleep without it.</li>
            <li> and he is finger sucking free!</li>
            <li> I applied it to the kids favorite fingers as soon as the Mavala Stop came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I love this and have already got two more friends using it too.</li>
            <li> We did another light application after that and again, he did not bite them!  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t altogether work for us like it did for so many of the reviews that I read before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Although the smell and taste is horrendous, it is non-toxic and safe for consumption.</li>
            <li> We are so proud of her because she did this as much as the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the interesting part.</li>
            <li> I am sure the manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t indorse this.</li>
            <li> totally.aim the happiest mom, feeling proud to have found this product that works for real.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a battle to just get the Mavala on her thumbnails because she&#x27;d say, \\&quot;I love to suck my thumb.\\&quot;  However, she accepted it, and almost immediately stopped.  </li>
            <li> We are so pleased with the results and are kicking ourselves because we didn&#x27;t try this sooner.</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure your nails stay</li>
            <li> Love this product:)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> :) If you&#x27;re like me though, and habitually just touch your face a lot and eat many foods with your hands.. you may be making a lot of bitter-mouthed faces during meal times.</li>
            <li> just pay attention to what you eat :)</li>
            <li> This was such an awesome find and</li>
            <li> I would have never guessed I would be able to break the habit of biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> He kept saying I have so many parents say it works.</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t stand the taste of it and it has curbed his biting for sure.  </li>
            <li> (if i wanted),then applied Mavala Stop as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and would have paid more for this product.</li>
            <li> I try many things with my child to stop sucking her thumb but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> the act of auto-cannibalism, which I am sure is surely a sin in most of the world.</li>
            <li> ; but mommy doesn&#x27;t know how to take it off :).</li>
            <li> I caught her with her thumb one more time after that and painted it once more.</li>
            <li> I even took to painting it on more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I know I will have to use this product probably for the rest of my life, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> I put the product on his finger morning and nigt for the next 3 days and he did GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> and I was able to reduce my use</li>
            <li> We were all confident (my son included)</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> For me, the nailbiter, I do need a bit more assistance with the Mavala Stop, which I will continue using.</li>
            <li> As for my boogie snacker, he still needs it as he&#x27;s been able to manuever around the Mavala Stop a bit.</li>
            <li> my 5-year-old sucked her finger mostly at night -</li>
            <li> We tried several off the shelf products as well as devices but this worked the best.  </li>
            <li> My son did try to bite (more than my daughter) - and would then go get a drink to wash the taste out.</li>
            <li> realized, in the end, that it ended up being more of a \\&quot;realization\\&quot; for my son rather than the taste when he put his nails in his mouth.</li>
            <li> But fractured his knee and became more depended at six.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but after 3 days of putting it on his thumbnail.</li>
            <li> And my friend has lovely teeth.  </li>
            <li> anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala for making such a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be able to stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop.</li>
            <li> , I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...</li>
            <li> Defiinitely recommend this product for nailbiters of all ages :)</li>
            <li> Maybe if she is 5 and still sucking her thumb :)</li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t like the taste of it.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product, it really helped my brother stop biting his nails which was a great accomplishment!</li>
            <li> and I figured I better try it on myself before I give it to her to see what I should expect,</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this will work and will gladly post an update in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems my child must love the taste as he will ask me to put it on his thumb.  </li>
            <li> so I was confident that it would work for us.  </li>
            <li> I re-applied a couple more times to be sure,</li>
            <li> She did so mostly when she was trying to relax, ie.</li>
            <li> it will stop him then 8).</li>
            <li> Mavala works like a magic.</li>
            <li> Okay the day that i got it</li>
            <li> (She knows better than to do so at school).  </li>
            <li> how many times your hands touch your mouth, or touch something that goes in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve told mine that the polish is there to help make their nails all better and they love getting their \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; to make their nails shiny.</li>
            <li> We had considered having a retainer-like instrument put in her mouth that blocks the thumb from fitting in, though my dentist even described it as \\&quot;cruel\\&quot; and \\&quot;a</li>
            <li> Needing to remember to apply nightly is challenging.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  </li>
            <li> My son (8) chews his cuticles and it has stopped him from ruining his skin.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t be pleased.</li>
            <li> stop on top it.</li>
            <li> Its been more then 2 weeks and looks like she gave up on sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> One day she said, ok, put it on.  </li>
            <li> (just turned 5)because her speach was starting to be affected and her teeth were becoming bucked!!!!</li>
            <li> I am amazed that more people don&#x27;t know about this.</li>
            <li> She knew she wasn&#x27;t supposed to suck her fingers and was ok with us putting this on her fingers</li>
            <li> I am sure this product would work for some people just not for me or my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the stuff in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> the taste bc its so potent.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, we decided that we needed something more potent - the thumb guard.  </li>
            <li> or so before you upgrade to a more costly option like the thumb guard.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many things to stop my daughter from sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> but they cost a lot more and seem quite cumbersome.</li>
            <li> do think the polish helped prevent him from most of the daytime thumbsucking, and for that I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many times to stop.  </li>
            <li> I also have plenty more in the bottle jusssst in case</li>
            <li> but this is the only that worked the best</li>
            <li> That made him more cooperative.</li>
            <li> Thus, I can say with some certainty that it ought to stop most grownups from EATING anything at all that requires using your fingers to assemble or eat it</li>
            <li> #34;for sure my kiddo won&#x27;t suck her thumb when this stuff is painted on.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> how many times you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than THUM.  </li>
            <li> Second time using the product, and it&#x27;s great!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product, but gave it a try</li>
            <li> ...You do need to be sure to reapply the product every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> sure she&#x27;s done..  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and then the Mavala just to make sure she wasn&#x27;t biting her nails.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize I had!  :)</li>
            <li> and Mavala worked like magic.</li>
            <li> I have tried many product named like \\&quot;Doctor Thumb\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This worked incredibly well for our almost-four year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> But after 2 or 3 applications I guess she must have grown used to the taste, because it sure doesn&#x27;t stop her now.  </li>
            <li> Not 100% sure if it was this product but the 1st day she used it she puked.</li>
            <li> It has only been a month and her nails are BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> I just reapplied every 2-3 days to make sure it didn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li> My daughters have been able to eat off everything we&#x27;ve purchased before this.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s way more putrid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that using this over a period of time will help break that habit.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for more than 15 years</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you put it on and touch it up.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you put it on and touch it up.</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything.</li>
            <li> Works great if you are really trying to stop biting your nails.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have to do that twice at $300 a pop, so I ordered Malava stop, couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product</li>
            <li> Let me tell you it was like magic.  </li>
            <li> It more serves as a reminder.  </li>
            <li> * Being vegetarian, I had to email the company to make sure that it is a vegetarian formula, given all the flavor reviews made me doubt it,  but it is safe for vegetarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At night, to pass time until she fell asleep, she figured out she could watch the clock to get her mind off of not being able to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I made sure we applied this to her nail every 2 days, just to be sure it was on there.  </li>
            <li> However she discovered that if she kept drinking water it would be better.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidence. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product after buying or trying many products/tricks to stop may son from biting his nail.</li>
            <li> as many nail-biters do, consider visiting your doctor, a therapist, even a psychologist.</li>
            <li> and many chronic nail biters</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala Stop has definitely been the best product I&#x27;ve found for deterring my nail biting.</li>
            <li> and many chronic nail biters</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala Stop has definitely been the best product I&#x27;ve found for deterring my nail biting.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> There is one more thing I should tell you, though.</li>
            <li> in all, a winning product after I thought nothing would work.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the thumb that I&#x27;ve been sucking for the last 2 years and have grown to love as a best friend!\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I was glad that she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb again.</li>
            <li> and it linguers, but not a cruel taste.</li>
            <li> I kept telling her to keep her fingers out, and she would be OK.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many more times it would have happened</li>
            <li> when my daughter broke her thumb-sucking arm seven months ago, we thought surely having to wear a cast for four weeks would effortlessly break the habit for us.  </li>
            <li> and I got scared, but thought of applying it one more time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to apply it more than 5 times.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re much better off with this stuff to help you stop chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ool/places where you tend to bite your nails the most.</li>
            <li> I have tried it for 4 nights and applied more each night, but it did not help.  </li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my hands :)</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to apply it every couple of days though because it will come off and biting could start again.  </li>
            <li> we all love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taste, and is now more focused on not sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect such great result!</li>
            <li> a couple of weeks with the product I was able to stop using it, and haven&#x27;t bitten my nails for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I still put in on her fingers once week night to be  on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll love it : )</li>
            <li> I pay more attention to when i am biting my nails now.</li>
            <li> I catch myself more and more.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t want to suck my thumb any more.</li>
            <li> It will work, but like quitting anything, you must make an effort because even the most stubborn nail biter could work through a coat of fermented death.</li>
            <li> This works immediately and I can tell when it&#x27;s time to put more Mavala on because my daughter starts sucking her thumb again.</li>
            <li> I tried thum and it did not work, mostly because it comes off.</li>
            <li> also, I have to brush my teeth more often because if I do stick my fingers in my mouth</li>
            <li> sons nails grew back, and in 2-3 weeks his nails looked perfectly healthy...and required clipping!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I got creative and put the Glad Press n Seal</li>
            <li> No terrible taste, nothing.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> All of a sudden he was like, &amp;#34;THAT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE DORITO!!!&amp;#34; And proceeded to rinse his mouth out in the sink) LOL!!!!  </li>
            <li> We give it 2 thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love mavala.</li>
            <li> If I have more kids I won&#x27;t ever hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li> Read all the great reviews and compared to the price of some finger contraption that cost $70, there wasn&#x27;t much options for finger sucking.  </li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb for six years and was able to stop all together in four weeks.  </li>
            <li> I then came up with a trick that helped much more</li>
            <li> think this stuff works for the most part</li>
            <li> it applied, your nails are safe.</li>
            <li> I tried removing the product and reapplying to make sure I was getting JUST the nail and not any of the skin around the nail.  </li>
            <li> I probably didn&#x27;t need to buy two bottles, but I&#x27;m painting it on his thumbs every day and night until I know for sure</li>
            <li> I love my mother, but she had instilled within me with something of a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic non-toxic deterrent for nail biting, this is the stuff!</li>
            <li> I ENJOY IT!</li>
            <li> So the deeper or more</li>
            <li> So the deeper or more</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> At dinner there was an added bonus of him not eating anything with his fingers (something we&#x27;re always getting on him for! :)).  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it</li>
            <li> for a couple days after application to be safe.</li>
            <li> Maybe for most cases this works well, but still searching for a way to break my son&#x27;s habit.</li>
            <li> I know it was more out of habit as a way for her to comfort herself before falling asleep, but I started to notice a visible change in her front teeth as a result.</li>
            <li> it was pricey that did not work, she was able to pull it off.  </li>
            <li> but then she stopped worrying about the taste and started sucking her fingers more.</li>
            <li> and so started doing it more.</li>
            <li> have applied it 2 more times after that day and it has had no effect, his thumb sucking continues as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top paper lid/cover had been opened and a crumpled piece of paper was stuffed inside on top of the bottle as if to protect the bottle during shipping, that is after having three layers in the packaging alredy</li>
            <li> Chronic nail biter, I have tried many things.</li>
            <li> Great product... Works very well for nail biting and thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> But as for nail biting and thumb/finger sucking, I&#x27;m sure it would work quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m love this product and will recommend it for anyone that has had problems with breaking the habit of sucking of the thumb/finger or nail biting.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied and reapplied, but it no longer deters him for more than a day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because he can paint it on while he sleeps</li>
            <li> Things have gotten better though.</li>
            <li> We were getting more and more concerned as her permanent teeth started coming in.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another just to make sure I have one for my handbag</li>
            <li> Better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It was your favorite restaurant and you ate there all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 and she is been biting her nails for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better than Bite It.</li>
            <li> then would bite the cuticles - so I made sure and put this polish on the nails and cuticle</li>
            <li> I painted it on my son’s thumb and it lasted for about 5 days before HE asked me to put more on.</li>
            <li> will continue to use the product until I finish the bottle just to be on the safe side of no relapses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I figured all I had to do was keep my fingers out of my mouth, but the problem is there are so many situations where putting your fingers in your mouth is unavoidable.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for better results by now.</li>
            <li> As a guy it makes my nails look all shiny, but even still it&#x27;s better than the alternative.  </li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Another week or two, and we&#x27;ll be sure this habit is over with.</li>
            <li> We use silverware and toothpicks a lot more now , it helps :)</li>
            <li> Thanks, cannot express how great</li>
            <li> This stuff is hilarious.</li>
            <li> The faces he made when he absently put his fingers in his mouth was hilarious (for me, anyways).</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how well this product worked for us.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but my pediatrician said it was okay.  </li>
            <li> I think it would work on most kids,</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re using this on your kids to stop them from nail biting, they won&#x27;t be able to remove the product to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I applied one more dose.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> He gagged a bit I washed his finger and put more on</li>
            <li> BUT, I used it for about 2 more days and then quit thinking I was done.  </li>
            <li> (One too many bugs this year)</li>
            <li> Great product and really fast shipping..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t have to find</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to return this...</li>
            <li> I tried many things.</li>
            <li> This product works great and fast.</li>
            <li> and we are so glad we did.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with results and purchase.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my nails to avoid chewing skin on sides and it ruined the taste for many minutes and reminded me not to do it.&lt;br /&gt;One of the tricks we used was that my wife will start putting nail polish in front of him and out of curiosity he will also want some on his nails</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> he kept squirting more and more in the water and playing with the bath soap, mark you I taste it</li>
            <li> My 9 and 7-year-old daughters had this thumb-sucking habit for so many years.  </li>
            <li> It is still amazing to me to look in the car&#x27;s rear-view mirror and see them free of thumb-sucking!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put any more on my cuticles just because it was too much, but it was a great shock factor to teach me not to do it any more.</li>
            <li> Be creative and give this product a try, you won&#x27;t disappointed!teach</li>
            <li> me not to do it any more.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> It sure helped me avoid chewing my nails though.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product in hopes of stopping and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> it was us that was applying the \\&quot;magic</li>
            <li> We told him the tooth fairy must have sprinkled magic dust on his thumbs to help him stop sucking his thumbs...</li>
            <li> but it sure did make a believer out of me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I bought it and for the most part I have stopped.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, I was able to stop painting them and not have the urge to bite them.</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> I chose the bit on the tip of the nail as the better choice.  </li>
            <li> She was actually HAPPY about it too, because by the time I got up the nerve to put the stuff on her, she was really hurting and looking for a better solution to help her quit than lansinoh and bandaids and socks, you name</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter most of my life</li>
            <li> I have been a nail-biting for many years</li>
            <li> When I run out I&#x27;m and buying more.</li>
            <li> she understood it was for her to stop sucking her thumb and called it medicine :)</li>
            <li> This is probably not a problem for most people</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am glad that my dentist recommended this.</li>
            <li> so i am sure if it doesn&#x27;t work for you on day 1,</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s still free of her thumb sucking habit!</li>
            <li> to be absolutely sure-</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure, BUT</li>
            <li> As for nail bitting she will often break one but as Im on top of it she will tell me</li>
            <li> I think better is trying to encourage your child out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I never thought I was going to be able to stop him from his thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bite my nails, and the skin/cuticle area around my nails, so I ended up having to basically paint the top parts of my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After some more searching on the web I came across Mavala Stop and read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> He was sucking his fingers when laying on the couch watching a movie, so I put more on.  </li>
            <li> I believe that after another year of applying this, she will be able to stop.  </li>
            <li> Did not make her stop but trying it one more week</li>
            <li> So glad we tried again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 100% sure this will help you stop biting your nails or sucking your thumb or putting your fingers in your mouth while you eat or whatever it is</li>
            <li> Keeps me from doing it even more.</li>
            <li> daughter now asks for the medicine for her boo-boo on her thumb, but avoids tasting her thumb even if there happens to be chocolate on it :-)</li>
            <li> We are extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I put it over my nail polish (it didn&#x27;t affect the look at all) and then a top coat.</li>
            <li> After using this product for just one week, I have stopped biting and my daughter has mostly stopped (without putting on the solution).</li>
            <li> sucking appliance&amp;#34; in the top of her mouth (to the tune of $300).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say he has stop the thumb sucking,</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I did</li>
            <li> I put it on her favorite thumb....</li>
            <li> awesome product my daughters nails are finally growing out</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this when I did.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product my two toddlers ages 2 and 3 have been sucking their thumbs since birth NOTHING has worked until i found this product.</li>
            <li> I applied a smudge on the top of my thumb on Tuesday.  </li>
            <li> She tried sucking her thumb about two more times that day.  </li>
            <li> One day after she turned 3 it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> For the most part it works, but I need to put it on every day.  </li>
            <li> and I just kept going until I got into this interesting habit of improving my looks.</li>
            <li> I have figured that its better to eat fries with a fork any way.</li>
            <li> So be it, just more reason to quit.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best product on the market for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Love it when I am consistence on applying.</li>
            <li> does it ever end?  :-)</li>
            <li> Three stars: because it worked with one application for my son, but gagged him and induced vomiting from the taste even though he wasn&#x27;t chewing his nails, just touching his mouth to get a piece of hair.</li>
            <li> I tried many others that did not stop my daughter from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> ok.... Parents-</li>
            <li> I successfully quit nursing without much effort and pain for both of us!</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> After many pediatricians told us that my almost 6 yo daughter would \\&quot;grow</li>
            <li> I tried it again twice more.</li>
            <li> I used this product some time last year and it has worked marvelously well.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.</li>
            <li> My fingers don&#x27;t hurt, I can finally scratch an itch, and best of all I can see a resemblance to what fingernails should look like.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been biting my nails for 30 years.</li>
            <li> If it were spicy for example the result would have been more immediate.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m off to research more products.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> taste for our child was not horrible just annoyong and letting her apply it empowered her to be able to stop sucking her thumb by herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I refresh it every two days while she is sleeping just to make sure she won&#x27;t start again.</li>
            <li> I found an article about Thum and foud that many people said it didn&#x27;t work and that their children started to like the taste</li>
            <li> and I thought then it couldn&#x27;t be any better than the tobasco sauce</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.  </li>
            <li> I even used it on myself and was able to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Interestingly I didn&#x27;t see reviews that questioning the safety of this</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I hope you have a better experience, did not work for us at all</li>
            <li> I guess we&#x27;ll have to resort to something more before she causes permanent damage.</li>
            <li> once she realized she didn&#x27;t need her thumb any more.  </li>
            <li> Important!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it wasn&#x27;t challenging for her, but now she doesn&#x27;t even think about it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was worried before I tried it because she used her thumb so much for comfort, but she did great, and your kid will too.  </li>
            <li> This is way better than the drug store version.  </li>
            <li> and my nails already look better than they ever have.  </li>
            <li> I put on again each morning just to be safe.</li>
            <li> I still put it on every once in a while to make sure he doesn&#x27;t suck his finder anymore.</li>
            <li> Withing two more weeks, she stopped sucking at night as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> and he said for most kids it either works immediately, like it did with my son, or it won&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I am glad we gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that there would be a better product out there to help someone stop sucking their thumb or biting fingernails.  </li>
            <li> But I put some more on her thumb and now once again she is not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> But I put some more on her thumb and now once again she is not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> and then we had to put more on.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is that it&#x27;s so potent, if you find yourself accidentally touching your lips to it you will taste it for hours.  </li>
            <li> One thing is for sure though, it does the trick.</li>
            <li> One more time</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be glad to have to trim someone elses nails.  </li>
            <li> Did that, he ask if he could have some more.</li>
            <li> and my daughter  does not suck her fingers more.</li>
            <li> if I told him I was going to put this product on it would have been a fight, but doing it while he was asleep (made sure I monitored him for 2 min after I put it on</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and after being used on two children the bottle is still completely filled.</li>
            <li> no biting :)</li>
            <li> lol great product for nail bitter like meeee</li>
            <li> However, my daughter does not bite her nails when she wears it, and she likes to wear it because it&#x27;s shiny :)</li>
            <li> By the way, it does not matter who many times u wash your hands to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> but it surely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m OK with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this polish..</li>
            <li> She asked me to buy some more.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been tempted to use any more of the product...</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference within a week of using Mavala and I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> more potent.&lt;br /&gt;Also&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend, might help with dieting too!:-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure it would be best to break your kid of the habit before they ruin dinner at a later age....</li>
            <li> and i lost most of the polish.  </li>
            <li> and she was OK.</li>
            <li> We love this product since it does the job its supposetoo</li>
            <li> if you are using this for a toddler, make sure you have a bib or towl close by, my daughter is drooling all over the place.  </li>
            <li> We stopped using it and decided to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and it sure would keep me from biting/sucking.  </li>
            <li> well mostly.</li>
            <li> (pay it forward concept:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a taste that stays in your mouth for an hour most, to remind your brain chewing your nails</li>
            <li> ; Let&#x27;s just say she doesn&#x27;t do that any more.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for this I would love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad that this product has worked for so many children and adults, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t do it more than a couple of times if you put this on your fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope once my nails grow out the taste will eventually go away because I can&#x27;t take much more of this.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is just ok.</li>
            <li> But you need to reapply it more often</li>
            <li> It helps me be more polite all around.</li>
            <li> As many others have said, it DOES make finger food taste terrrible.</li>
            <li> It is designed more of a REMINDER for those kids who know they shouldn&#x27;t be sucking.</li>
            <li> However, we still applied more to ensure there wasn&#x27;t a relapse.</li>
            <li> My daughter just won&#x27;t stop picking her nose, and I&#x27;ve tried so many incentives and threats.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m glad we got it done as soon as we did.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to apply Mavala every 1-2 days to for a while to make sure they don&#x27;t start again.</li>
            <li> The product leaves more of an after taste.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Thum stuff at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> You sure won&#x27;t wanna taste it ever again.</li>
            <li> A sure recommend from a pediatrician</li>
            <li> But you must apply every 2 days to make sure it hasn&#x27;t chipped off.</li>
            <li> BUT it works like magic and now he doesn&#x27;t wear it anymore</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Our son is doing a lot better with biting his fingers and they are healing.</li>
            <li> He even asks us now to paint his nail because he likes how healthy his hands are looking.</li>
            <li> So it helped with table manners too :)</li>
            <li> She stopped in 3 days.:-)</li>
            <li> and it seemed to work much better.  </li>
            <li> BUT when the dentist said that he needed to break the habit and stop sucking his thumb, because of interference with his top jaw and teeth growth..</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I read about this on Amazon and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I did a coat of Mavala stop on top of that.</li>
            <li> Touching my mustache and swimming would result in foul-tasting water leaking into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use it anymore as she doesn&#x27;t even remember to suck :)</li>
            <li> Ok so it started well</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t they just love me the way I am?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> You can always add more...</li>
            <li> Not awful as some say.</li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t even lick food off of her fingers. :)</li>
            <li> You have to make sure that you keep applying it every day or so till you kick the habit.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I decided to use a treatment so she will feel better.</li>
            <li> but she was totally OK and get used not to suck it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> We call it his thumb medicine and he always tells us how his thumb is &#x27;getting better&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Our daughter had sucked her thumb (mostly at night/with lovey) for over 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I apply it every day just to be sure it works.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep putting it on.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for a while just to be sure, but he has not had any problems even though I have accidentally gone three nights in between applications 2 or 3 times.  </li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb any more.</li>
            <li> (I am now 4 months free of nail biting!)</li>
            <li> so okay</li>
            <li> Her fingers and nails look 100% better now.  </li>
            <li> after reading review and at our child&#x27;s dentists recommendation I&#x27;m so glad we tried it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wear it for one more week just to be sure, but I haven&#x27;t even tried to bite my nails in days.</li>
            <li> if thumbsucking is an issue for you, make sure you get this</li>
            <li> I even tasted her nail to be sure it was still there.</li>
            <li> I would theorize that the sooner you use it, the better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it is working wonderfully for our dog whose paw is currently bandaged for two weeks while his surgery heals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to stop many times, but I&#x27;m the type that bites them when I&#x27;m sitting idle (at a movie, watching tv, etc).</li>
            <li> He was so proud of himself, thanks to his dentist and Mavala, he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about being embarrassed in front of his friends.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t be)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these products and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> The best surprise with this product is that it actually strengthens the nails!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you re-apply a coat or two every three days.</li>
            <li> I will update after his nails have grown more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> She mostly did it at stressful or sleepy times.  </li>
            <li> If I put it on my child&#x27;s fingers to condition him to keep his fingers out of his mouth, I make sure to wash his hands thoroughly before he eats anything because he will taste it on his fingers and stop eating.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for the better part of 25+ years.</li>
            <li> , I was biting my nails non-stop to the point of pain most of the time.  </li>
            <li> They started growing and look healthy again.  </li>
            <li> No side effects and completely safe.</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than any of the others.  </li>
            <li> He also twirls his hair simultaneously and was developing a bald spot on the top of his head.  </li>
            <li> Hubby is none too pleased with me at the moment.</li>
            <li> I needed something safe and harmless but did the job</li>
            <li> Anyway, he has stopped and if we have the problem again, I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Astonishingly, she stopped sucking her thumb immediatly.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for about 15 years now and have never been able to stop.  </li>
            <li> You had to reapply more than was recommended.</li>
            <li> but I stopped using it on her because she eats many finger foods and although she continued to bite her nails</li>
            <li> I saw that he was able to afford and suck his thumb from now and</li>
            <li> she was more cranky because she wasn&#x27;t able to self soothe</li>
            <li> It may be better for adults or order children.  </li>
            <li> She was actually glad that her tongue &amp;#34;felt spicy&amp;#34; whenever she put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Her nails look much, much better than 2 years ago:-)))</li>
            <li> worked perfectly -- just a tiny dab and in a week or so, she stopped.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product worked for the most part, although it seemed to lose most of it&#x27;s strength after a couple of hand washings.  </li>
            <li> nails have never looked better and I even go in for a manicure now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s changed my life for the better</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you bought</li>
            <li> itYou&#x27;ll be glad you bought it</li>
            <li> Acoording to some reviews i put 2 layers of mavala on her thumb ( and all nails), then she asked for one more layer.</li>
            <li> i researched many products online before making a decision.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After you put this on your nails, you will slip up at most one or two times before you will begin to think twice about biting your nails.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ok with this, go for it.  </li>
            <li> so you will end up having to put more on or hope you dont</li>
            <li> but sure makes me think again about biting.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to start off by saying that I had many talks with my daughter about stopping sucking her thumb before I tried Mavala.</li>
            <li> I used this as the top coat and didn&#x27;t mention a thing about it to her.</li>
            <li> it became more of a &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> We are now about 4 weeks from when we started and we still apply every morning just to be safe another habit doesn&#x27;t start.  </li>
            <li> it worked ok.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> So I guess you can say that it workedlike a magic.  </li>
            <li> but it was OK.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it works for someone just not us.</li>
            <li> Thank you my son stopped sucking his fingers overnight :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> I applied a coat to all of my nails once every two days for two weeks and still have most of the bottle remaining.</li>
            <li> so u can be sure that you will notice if your nail go to your mouth</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Ordering and shipping were fast and great.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that played into it</li>
            <li> , i.e. she likes spicy food, and more grown up flavors that most kids do not like.  </li>
            <li> The reviews weren&#x27;t TOO helpful because most of them were about kids sucking their thumb</li>
            <li> recommend applying it once a day, you can use it as a top coat, but its not as shiny as a top coat...</li>
            <li> He learned real quick not to put his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I would just say that you have to make sure to paint every 2 days.  </li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s safe to say this product works</li>
            <li> I use it on top of nailpolish and it doesn&#x27;t affect my manicure.</li>
            <li> I was always able to stop by myself by just getting my nails done and painting them.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to break the habit soon and not need it anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I looked over the many reviews and ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is disguising for sure.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I are very excited :)</li>
            <li> what do I do with a nearly full bottle of Mavala Stop that I don&#x27;t need any more?!  :-)</li>
            <li> Three weeks later I have beautiful nails that are getting better every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure at some point, I&#x27;ll have to re-use it again, but it worked quick, and easy, and my daughter loved having me paint her nails with it.</li>
            <li> It was also a little exasperating to see my beautiful daughter at her ballet class doing lovely dance moves with great posture, pointed toes</li>
            <li> This Stuff REALLY works!!!!  </li>
            <li> so I ended up putting a spill proof cup of water by his bed AND 4 tic tac&#x27;s which REALLY helped!!!!</li>
            <li> This really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, this stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I put some on my friends&#x27; daughters&#x27; thumb &amp; she quit after the first application as well!!!</li>
            <li> it really does!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried everything for my toddler and STOP did exactly what it says STOP!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product for my 5 year-old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and was very excited.  </li>
            <li> and she was very excited.</li>
            <li> and we were very excited about it.</li>
            <li> He liked that and was actually excited about using it.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Highly effective, and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It has almost been a month now, and I love to see her so excited about not sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> and it was worth every cent!! :)</li>
            <li> I suppose if you think the vomiting is a good enough deterrent for the child it would be a successful product for you to use.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have experienced is that I work in a job where I have to wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> My youngest will have this on her fingers too when she is older, so she can happily suck her fingers now.</li>
            <li> but I am an Indian, so there is a lot of bread or rice that we eat with our bare hands, so if this thing accidentally touches your food, well you can say good bye to good taste.</li>
            <li> but the fact that it was consistent for a good period is what helped the most.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, it&#x27;s really great when you take a chance on something like this</li>
            <li> I came across Mavala and saw the great reviews and high star rating.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This worked great to help my 6 yr old stop sucking his thumb!!</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 8 yr old son!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy we were able to tackle this habit while he is young!  </li>
            <li> So, it may be a great product for successful results with other customers, but Mavala Stop is not for us.</li>
            <li> They pretty much laughed at me.  </li>
            <li> Parents must be persistent in using it, consistent in reapplying it, and  don&#x27;t give up even if they cry because you are doing a good thing.</li>
            <li> I bought it again because it did great achievements with my 3y daughter regarding her the thumb sucking habit, BUT  we had a kind of relapse which is my fault that didn&#x27;t use it regularly, SO here we are again with more commandment.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heartbreaking to watch him struggle, but I think in the long run it is for the best.  </li>
            <li> She loved it on first day because it looked like nail polish and made her nail shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have used it now for well over 8 months and WHEN it is on her thumb it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is a good idea to try it during the day first.</li>
            <li> so it must be pretty good, it just did not work for us</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful clear coat ...</li>
            <li> It really works and effective!</li>
            <li> It also worked awesome for our friend who&#x27;s been a LONG time nail biter.  </li>
            <li> I was becoming more and more concerned as he was becoming more and more comfortable sucking his fingers at home and even in the presence of some friends, but not at school.  </li>
            <li> We have been thumb sucking free for two months and going strong!  </li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is strong, in a good way!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> so excited!</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m very pleased with this polish.</li>
            <li> Great product, did a better job than a braking habit braces which cost us $500 placed by the dentist on our 4 years old kid to stop thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> After all of the great reviews I thought for sure this would help my 9 year old son stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li> It also seems to wash off much more easily than I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> It was amazingly how quickly my brain connected nail biting to unpleasantness.</li>
            <li> And for adults, slather it on every 2 days with someone else to watch you, since it would be easy to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to put it on without a support system to make sure you follow through.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> be SURE the mavala stop is out of reach of even the most crafty toddler.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is very proud of herself since her thumb is no longer constantly wet, and she feels that her \\&quot;boo boo thumb\\&quot; is getting better</li>
            <li> We were amazed by all the products available and probably more so by the price tags on many of these products.</li>
            <li> I love this product, we just started it yesterday with my 4 year old and she is doing great</li>
            <li> I was very surprised and happy to see her take her fingers out, spit, and yell &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; after she put her fingers in her mouth with the Mavala Stop on them.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly in great packaging, bought it for my mom who ha been bitting here nails for over 20 years and in 2 weeks she had completely stopped!</li>
            <li> but it honestly worked from the very first minute we put it on.  </li>
            <li> Great for my adult chewers!  </li>
            <li> for a couple weeks I had my husband do most of the chopping and that worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is wonderful and well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my fingernails for over 20 years and this is honestly the first product that has worked for me!</li>
            <li> Star rating is more accurate.  </li>
            <li> The first time it was applied we had great success.  </li>
            <li> And to top it all off, it is light on the pocket.  </li>
            <li> and we are thumb free and don&#x27;t even twirl her hair any more.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son was not to happy</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> We are three weeks free of finger sucking and she is suprisingly much more vocal with her needs.</li>
            <li> stuff worked GREAT on my just-turned 4 year old boy who was biting his nails.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old stop sucking her thumb in 2 weeks and is now proud of herself.</li>
            <li> She is a happy young girl who does not suck her thumb</li>
            <li> This worked great on my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of frustration about dissuading our 3.5 yrs old from thumb sucking, we are so happy to found this product.</li>
            <li> It saved my sanity, but more importantly, it saved my daughter&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li> I have not grown to enjoy the flavor nor have I been able to ignore</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews, so I tried it for my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> the immediate elimination of it resulted in him acting out in uncharacteristic ways - queue Bruce Banner&#x27;s change into the Incredible Hulk.  </li>
            <li> I have to say these are the best $10 I ever spent.</li>
            <li> , my nails are the longest they&#x27;ve EVER been, and I&#x27;m thoroughly happy even if the taste of this stuff is completely rancid.</li>
            <li> Works great the stop eating there nails my 6 and 11 years old boys.</li>
            <li> Did a great job of curing my 7 year old from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> If you are an adult with a nail biting problem then this product might be great for you.  </li>
            <li> This worked great on my 4 year old to stop him from sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> Works great for my three year old</li>
            <li> So far this is working great to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> He bought the whole thing and was proud of his body helping him and was proud to have stopped sucking his thumb &amp;#34;all by himself.&amp;#34; Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At 3.5 years old, I was done with this habit although I knew it brought her great comfort</li>
            <li> Would work great for adult nail-biters, too.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> She was becoming mal-nutraioned because of her thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> Product worked great for stopping my 2 year old from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I am now giving my bottle of Mavala to my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s best friend, who also wants to quit thumbsucking!  </li>
            <li> So far, the most successful method we&#x27;ve used to defeat thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Works great so far...</li>
            <li> This was the best $12 we ever spent.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my 6 year old daughter...</li>
            <li> Working great so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to report I have been free of nail biting for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, the stuff seems to be working great.  </li>
            <li> Best 12 bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the people who did not have a good experience were perhaps doing it before their children were ready.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful, but this product got good reviews</li>
            <li> The stuff taste absolutely horrid, and stays in your mouth for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Telling her how much she&#x27;s growing....and that one day a her thumb is not going to taste good anymore....</li>
            <li> I took matters in to my own hands, went out the garden and picked a chilli and painted his nail with fresh chilli juice.</li>
            <li> - effective, powerful, and long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> he bit right through it and liked it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy for this product as it helped to quickly and easily stop a 1-2 year old from sucking thumb at night (which is the hardest!!!)  </li>
            <li> Very effective because as soon as that taste hits you realize you put your hands near your mouth.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this one!</li>
            <li> I still have a bunch left, so this is a good deal!</li>
            <li> Other then that WORKS GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Its made with Cayenne pepper and actually tastes good!</li>
            <li> , so just wanted to keep this updated and let you all know it has been a full week with NO THUMB SUCKING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been successful for us so far!</li>
            <li> people with a nail biting problem, I find it best to first paint my nails with Mavala and then with a regular nail polish over top.</li>
            <li> the bottle is still full!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one or two other thumb sucking deterrents but this is the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure she was not giving her thumbs up for anything but needed that comfort of thumb sucking a bit longer!</li>
            <li> we had tried other products but this works the best.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it, I am more than excited to write this review.</li>
            <li> and she told me in was not bad!</li>
            <li> I must say I was hoping for the best, but not expecting much due to the strong attachment my daughter had with her thumb.</li>
            <li> : THE TASTE GOES AWAY VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> We would even let him put the product on his thumb to encourage active participation in this endeavor - he was very proud to use it</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d never get him to quit, let alone so easily.  </li>
            <li> (the organic cayenne pepper one didn&#x27;t work, too easy to suck it off)</li>
            <li> I agree to a degree, but my child was easy to reason with and I told him to use a fork and the issue was gone.</li>
            <li> , it does easily get on food if she eats with it on her fingers.</li>
            <li> Its really easy to transfer to food.</li>
            <li> You will notice its really easy to take off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should transfer so easily.  </li>
            <li> After that, it was easy.</li>
            <li> Also it seems to wear off rather easily.</li>
            <li> Not too happy about the shippng charges - costs more than the actual product.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been easy for him.  </li>
            <li> Now if only we were able to keep her from spitting when she puts her fingers in her mouth out of habit lol.</li>
            <li> It was easy to pull it out of the hand brace to suck.  </li>
            <li> It worked very quickly for her.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> In so pleased it worked so great, especially when nothing else would.</li>
            <li> Easy choice.</li>
            <li> However, make sure you clean off the bottle and cap before resealing it..  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be so easy.  </li>
            <li> It was SO EASY.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> The tastes transfers way to easy</li>
            <li> The plus side is that you don&#x27;t bite your nails...and also a great way to lose weight since you aren&#x27;t able to physically touch food for days!</li>
            <li> We never thought it would be this easy.  </li>
            <li> I never thought about trying something like this because it seemed like a gimmick and was just too easy.</li>
            <li> Just as described, shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> Make sure the cup or sippy they drink from to clean their mouth out is also cleaned or change after drinking.  </li>
            <li> I applied it when she was sleeping, so that it would be easy</li>
            <li> the Easy Way to Stop Nail Biting]]</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t appear like women nails.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s easy to take off.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t easy to take it off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4)Though we didn&#x27;t need to do this, I think a person could easily re-apply on a child who is sleeping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4)Though we didn&#x27;t need to do this, I think a person could easily re-apply on a child who is sleeping.</li>
            <li> It seems to get off easily when they bath or wash their hands</li>
            <li> The polish chips off easily</li>
            <li> can see great improvement as we tried many ways before such as covering his thumb and even talking with him</li>
            <li> so it was easy to talk to her about it</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the taste doesn&#x27;t go away easily once you have it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> If your child has a strong will to keep sucking, this product will probably not work either.</li>
            <li> He is now almost 3 years and still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, if it was me, I would stop, but my daughter is strong willed and would rather put up with the aweful taste</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong and I imagine it will cause a gag</li>
            <li> the closest I can describe it as is a really strong dandelion stem taste.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, my nails are growing strong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong nail polish smell so it doesn&#x27;t bother people around me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> the desire I know, is strong.  </li>
            <li> the desire I know, is strong.  </li>
            <li> have never written a review before, but I feel this strongly about this product</li>
            <li> (This is a child who loves strong olives, spicy food, and pickles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s why I felt so strongly about posting this review.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned this was too strong and bordered on \\&quot;child abuse\\&quot; as one reviewer put it.</li>
            <li> Almost instantaneously, my daughter had a strong aversion to</li>
            <li> recommend this stuff over the cayenne pepper stuff, that didn&#x27;t work at all, wasn&#x27;t strong and wouldn&#x27;t have stopped me either.</li>
            <li> we received Mavala Stop, I explained him that this will help him stop biting his nails and makes them strong again.</li>
            <li> Her palate can tolerate the strong taste.  </li>
            <li> the foul taste is so strong that you just have to use a fork for everything while you&#x27;re using the product.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> this was a strong reaction</li>
            <li> but now I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, this product is really strong.</li>
            <li> equals strong incentive not to put your thumb in there.</li>
            <li> I even tried it myself to see how strong it was</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong as I remember products like this when I was a kid, this one is must be deluded</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Based on our experience, I strongly recommend this product to end nail biting and thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> He has a strong gag reflex and he would gag and throw up from the taste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that the taste is so strong she feels the need to spit in the sink after putting her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Definitely strong stuff</li>
            <li> The taste is strong, and lasts for up to a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning, this is incredibly strong.</li>
            <li> the Mavala Stop was still on as strong as ever...</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work, because it was too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I can&#x27;t see the whites of my nails growing longer, then the temptation to bite them is not as strong.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing and they are growing strong, therefore I do not expect them to break and tear.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is strong yet bearable.</li>
            <li> So strong that it makes you want to gag if you put your fingers in your mouth</li>
            <li> One caution is it has a strong odor while painting.</li>
            <li> My daughter was sucking her finger in the womb and at the age of 8 was still going strong.  </li>
            <li> He never complained too loudly, but he was really good about eating with a fork that&#x27;s for sure!!  </li>
            <li> I told him the mavala was a special magic potion.  </li>
            <li> She continued to allow me to put it on her because she felt so special being able to use this polish</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use this right before feeding your child finger foods or anything that will give them reason to lick their fingers... unless you want them to stop liking that food.  :)</li>
            <li> I used this and within three weeks I saw pretty amazing progress.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing omg this product helped me so much!</li>
            <li> the end of the day, if you are consistent in applying Mavala Stop to your finger nails, and you make an honest effort</li>
            <li> the end of the day, if you are consistent in applying Mavala Stop to your finger nails, and you make an honest effort</li>
            <li> I have tried to eliminate the habit only because she simultaneously pulls her hair out - creating pitiful bald spots on her beautiful head.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (4 years old) successfully quit nail biting in one week.</li>
            <li> i have been a nail-biter all my life and now my nails look so beautiful after only a week of using this \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; product!</li>
            <li> asked our daughter if she would like to have some help to stop sucking her thumb, and she said yes, so we introduced her to this product and allowed her to hold the box and instruction pamphlet while I first painted some on my own thumbnail and then hers.</li>
            <li> He kind of likes it, which isn&#x27;t exactly the reaction we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Mavala is still 3/4 full, so no need to buy more than 1 \\&quot;serving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Mavala is still 3/4 full, so no need to buy more than 1 \\&quot;serving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have grown several sets of beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li> I have grown several sets of beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li> At first it did, she would kind of gag when she put her finger in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I have so far been successful in not biting my nails since I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit uncertain at first about it because it smelled kind of like fingernail polish?  </li>
            <li> The first time it was completely effective, but after about 2 weeks he noticed that the taste wore off and he started sucking again.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for a full 4-5 weeks just to make sure she has kicked this habit.  </li>
            <li> and we have been successful thus far.</li>
            <li> Two coats work better than one and it lasts about 3-4 days with full \\&quot;flavor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s first applied, it is effective.</li>
            <li> This product has successful stopped both completely.</li>
            <li> I continued to put in on her fingers for 3 weeks, but she honestly quit in the first day.</li>
            <li> It successfully got my 7 year old to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li> No one can believe my pretty nails are actually my own.</li>
            <li> I now have a beautiful french manicure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way more effective than anything else we have tried, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I immediately took off the product with nail polish remover and he was fine for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with that though.</li>
            <li> but she did eat snacks with her hands and was fine.</li>
            <li> Every night after that, he slept just fine.  </li>
            <li> In most cases he would bite his nails without even realizing he was doing so,this product helped him become more aware.</li>
            <li> Once we stopped using it, the fingertips healed up just fine.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, she does not have an easy gag reflex, so we never had to deal with vomit like others on here.</li>
            <li> I reapplied it and she is doing fine and not sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but she is fine with it.  </li>
            <li> I applied this stuff at night and was fine.</li>
            <li> The one time I did use it it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that she will eventually be more aware of Mavala Stop and discontinue this habit.</li>
            <li> She just rinses with water and is fine.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes she was fine.</li>
            <li> And sometimes she asks me if she can do it herself, and that is totally fine with me.</li>
            <li> I am proud to say, my nails are long and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Might be its good for older people biting finger nails but not so good for 2 year old kids.</li>
            <li> Add a bit on each nail and you will quickly realize that you put your hands in your mouth more often you think.</li>
            <li> Maybe the flavor gets more mild after awhile?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li> and it helped our children break the habit quickly!</li>
            <li> She still puts her thumb to her mouth out of habit, but removes it quickly!  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with how quickly the nail biting was cured.</li>
            <li> Its wayy to strong for little children, but perfect for adults.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes that it would work after reading so many excellent reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Nacala stop really worked fast and we were so impressed, we should have started here first</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works very well for even the most stubborn thumb sucking child (I can testify!)</li>
            <li> We found it had to be applied a lot more often than it said, and very consistently, along with reminders to the child.</li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to use</li>
            <li> The flavor is very powerful and it is easy to taste if you are eating something with your hands.</li>
            <li> stop+nail+biting.&lt;br /&gt;I would still suggest this book as a great read on the insight of biting, made me realize its not as cut and dry as biting it&#x27;s more of a OCD.&lt;br /&gt;People who don&#x27;t understand call it a nervous habit asking; \\&quot;what are you nervous about?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but it quickly passed and we are home free now :)</li>
            <li> From the reviews we were warned that this was very strong for my son however after the first 2 days my son was fine and could bear the taste and continue sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I am proud to say that my cuticles are healing up wonderfully and I am less likely now to try to put my fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Very strong - the first time my daughter put her fingers in her mouth</li>
            <li> While making those delicious apple-cider pancakes, a little batter got onto my finger.  </li>
            <li> While making those delicious apple-cider pancakes, a little batter got onto my finger.  </li>
            <li> i use it on my little toddler woow great product!</li>
            <li> My son was more willing to do it when he saw I would too!  </li>
            <li> If you eat hot wings wear gloves! :)</li>
            <li> It worked from the very first night!  </li>
            <li> This is the best deterant that i&#x27;ve found for my little boy, but he still finds a way to suck his thumb even with this on.  </li>
            <li> Her little hands look great!</li>
            <li> While I certainly can&#x27;t advocate for it having a very pleasant flavor, that&#x27;s pretty much the point.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to get the after taste out of your mouth and is a HUGE reminder not to bite.</li>
            <li> He had to drink 2 huge cups of juice to get rid of the taste in his mouth, and has tried a couple times to put his thumb in again, but I haven&#x27;t seen him sucking it at all...</li>
            <li> We licked her fingernail and determined her description was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> The reason my husband was so insistant on getting her to stop is because she keeps scratching huge gashes on the bridge of her nose and then picking the scabs</li>
            <li> After just two weeks of using this product, I already notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this product is wonderful for my 6 year old and my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> We are not applying it anymore and have been about 3 weeks bite free.</li>
            <li> some which served just as a reminder as the light reflected off my nails and into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Because it was so important to her, we just let her go and didn&#x27;t force her to stop...</li>
            <li> My baby girl is almost three, she had a fit when i 1st put it on but</li>
            <li> It does work, but you have to stay attentive.</li>
            <li> One important thing we had to do was, when he slept we put his mitts on.</li>
            <li> , I tried it and still felt comfortable using it on my boys</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still filled to the brim, so it&#x27;s a lifetime supply if I ever need it again, which I doubt.</li>
            <li> We let him to do it, so that he is comfortable with</li>
            <li> Now, two week later, she&#x27;s so proud of herself and even asks me to reapply the Mavala every couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I don&#x27;t have to constantly nag her anymore</li>
            <li> this is a great product and so simple to use!</li>
            <li> The side effects for my child greatly outweighed the possible benefits.</li>
            <li> This item worked great, I only had to reapply it once and the thumb-sucking habit was kicked in a week.</li>
            <li> *Important to know**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product worked fast and was immediately effective in stopping my daughter from sucking her finger.</li>
            <li> She has used the paci for over 3 years and is now paci free for 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> We gave him a lot of encouragement about being a big boy and we were so proud of him</li>
            <li> she had a fit again but still asked for it when it started wearing off.  </li>
            <li> He was ready to stop sucking his thumb, but admitted he couldn&#x27;t do it on his own.  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t expect him to not suck his thumb when he is sound asleep</li>
            <li> wHich is great as it will last thru 2 - 3 days of handwashing.</li>
            <li> Her teeth are messed up and she can&#x27;t pronounce the &#x27;k&#x27; sound.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I just have to have the will power to keep applying Mavala until my urges stop.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I would not try it before a vacation or an important family event.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the use of Mavala Stop to be an emotional battle that might take a week or so to win.  </li>
            <li> They are now proud to show off their shiny nails and that is worth much more to me than any price this polish could possibly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy the thumb sucking is finally over.</li>
            <li> and my daughter is doing fantastic.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter is doing fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> She is now thumb-sucking free for 7 months.</li>
            <li> my experience was much more enlightening.  </li>
            <li> and now she is free of nail biting and</li>
            <li> so it was a fast and effective product.</li>
            <li> She was so proud of herself, it&#x27;s now been 8 months since she sucked her fingers, and she hasn&#x27;t gone back at all.  </li>
            <li> In addition to having this painted on his thumbnails, I had a reward system for every week that he didn&#x27;t suck his thumb, ending in the eventual earning of a big-boy two wheeler bike when he was thumb-sucking free for two months.  </li>
            <li> It took me a month or two to get brave enough to put it on her nails.  </li>
            <li> Sure, his nails would avoid being bitten, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth it if it makes your kid throw up.</li>
            <li> and I am soo happy to say he has stopped after only 10 application from august till now...</li>
            <li> She has been free of the habbit for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Happy to say, that we are almost 3 weeks no thumb sucking and it hasn&#x27;t gone back in his mouth.</li>
            <li> If I had started when she was 3 and not so skillful, it would most likely have been more effective.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on lots of different ones before opting for this one and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am now about 10 weeks bite free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say, I&#x27;m a former nail biter</li>
            <li> and im happy to say i have not bitten my nails not even once..... i used to bite my nails until there was literally nothing left now</li>
            <li> We have been thumb sucking free for almost a year now with no relapse.  </li>
            <li> Children should enjoy the food they ingest.</li>
            <li> Then she puts light pair of mittens over her hands to keep her from involuntarily sucking in her sleep.  </li>
            <li> It would be interesting to know why there was success with our son but not our daughter.</li>
            <li> I tried something cheap from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally have nails.</li>
            <li> She is happy, adjusted and hasn&#x27;t relapsed and I only used this product 2 times.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s proud of her hands again, instant confidence boost.</li>
            <li> Its really important to keep reapplying the solution to curb the habit.</li>
            <li> and she is free of her thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for nail biting.</li>
            <li> This stuff deterred me from biting and now I get to enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li> it looks like I&#x27;m home free.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;s home free.</li>
            <li> Just within a couple of days not she was thumb sucking free.</li>
            <li> so she was about ready to drop this habit, but just couldn&#x27;t do it on her own.  </li>
            <li> Its a fantastic deterrent for nail biting.</li>
            <li> That every 2 days is important.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note that she does want to stop, so I think that helps some.</li>
            <li> This item was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> We had tears on day 1, but smooth sailing after that.  </li>
            <li> Some people have had the fortunate &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve wanted to stop many times but have not had success.</li>
            <li> personal experience was great</li>
            <li> but i feel this is important.</li>
            <li> It is amazing really help because the test herbal 😷😷😷</li>
            <li> The cheap drug-store nail biting/thumb sucking products</li>
            <li> For me this is why I stopped using it, coupled with the fact that I enjoy cooking and was concerned about it rubbing off on my food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then he came to show me the white growth, and he is SO proud that he now lets us put it on without a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He went to bed and the next day when I came home from work he proudly announced that he put his finger in his mouth once during the day but it tasted yucky.  </li>
            <li> Up until my daughter was four years old, she loved sucking her finger.</li>
            <li> A couple days later she informed me that she kind of liked the taste though.  </li>
            <li> This was for a 5 year old who really loved his thumb.  </li>
            <li> put it on my daughter (4 1/2 yr old) who loved the taste of Thum and chewed off the Orly No Bite.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> While my use of napkins has gone up considerably while eating, I see it as a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 11 year old son who just Loved to suck his thumb when he was&lt;br /&gt;feeling</li>
            <li> Only problem is it isn&#x27;t as glossy a most topcoats, so a mani doesn&#x27;t look as good with this painted over.</li>
            <li> I will be returning it and definitely not suggesting to anyone else despite the many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Wish the pediatrician/dentist/orthodontist had not been so nonchalant about the thumb sucking in the first place, as he pushed the roof of his mouth up pretty good.  </li>
            <li> We told him he may be getting too old for his fingers  to taste good.  </li>
            <li> It has been three weeks, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t use it as consistently as we should have, but it still did a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> So far so good been using it a week and my 4yr has gone to bed every night , not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> But so far so good.</li>
            <li> When I asked my 4 yr old if she wanted to stop sucking her thumb she told me she loved her thumb and did not want to stop.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t in good conscious give this to my child.</li>
            <li> But that is a good thing, because it has completely cured my husband&#x27;s habit.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Fortunately she was able to laugh about it, and our shared disgust with the taste had us both in stitches.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this nail polish and it has been doing good so far.</li>
            <li> Thanks great product, fast transaction and shipping</li>
            <li> Now I have long beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.</li>
            <li> This worked really good for my 5 year old grandchild.  </li>
            <li> The good news her teeth went back to the right position and she feels much more confident too.</li>
            <li> Whenever she noticed the taste was not as strong as it is when first applied, she asked to have more applied to keep her from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> After all these years of biting I now how beautiful long nails!</li>
            <li> I wanted to be sure I bought the right thing.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to work so easily and quickly, nor did I expect such a jump in his expressive language.</li>
            <li> She is really proud of herself, and we are no longer grossed out of her wet thumb! :-)</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!</li>

            <li> Mavala, worked from the first night we put it on her thumb!!</li>
            <li> Nor did trying to talk very calmly with her about stopping, and how she can come talk to me if she ever feels like she needs to bite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare that she puts her fingers in her mouth and when I do, I put Mavala on her nails.  </li>
            <li> This is a very useful tool for people have years of chewing nails habit.</li>
            <li> We will try again when he&#x27;s older and be able to understand better.  </li>
            <li> The Good: This product does as advertised, it leave a very strong bitter taste in your mouth if you bit your nails or cuticles.</li>
            <li> the first time make sure you are in area that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This worked great for the first couple of weeks until my 3 year old figured out that if he peeled if off he could continue chewing his fingernails.</li>
            <li> Ok so yea what the reviews are saying are pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> After getting a good taste of this stuff, my daughter pretty much stopped sucking her finger.  </li>
            <li> So I turned to Mavala Stop, mostly because I&#x27;m cheap and its really not expensive.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly and easily it worked.  </li>
            <li> I then decided to put a light color nail polish first then marvala stop on top.</li>
            <li> At the risk of sounding corny: One bottle of Mavala Stop- eight dollars; Having my daughter feel proud of herself for breaking a very difficult and embarrassing habit, PRICELESS.</li>
            <li> At the risk of sounding corny: One bottle of Mavala Stop- eight dollars; Having my daughter feel proud of herself for breaking a very difficult and embarrassing habit, PRICELESS.</li>
            <li> Bought the Orly and do not bother with that stuff, way too mild and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with it is that it wears off too easily and too quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good first step rather than going straight to the thumb guard contraptions.</li>
            <li> However, two days later she proudly announced that she hadn&#x27;t chewed on her nails in a full day.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever to stop your little one from sucking their thumb!</li>
            <li> Make sure the top is on good and tight.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> She adjusted very well to the new place and made great friends but would not quit biting her nails.</li>
            <li> I grew beautiful nails, but as soon as I stopped using it, I went right back to biting.</li>
            <li> A quick drink of water and he was out light a light.</li>
            <li> We continue to try to use this - but probably could be more consistent.</li>
            <li> Thum makes the thumb have a hot taste which my daughter enjoyed.</li>
            <li> , that is so exciting!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop has been the only thing that I&#x27;ve tried that has successfully gotten me to stop putting my fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Worth it though!</li>
            <li> We encouraged him to apply it, so he was excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was excited to put it on because it is nailpolish</li>
            <li> I polished her nail with a color first and put Mavala on as a top coat.</li>
            <li> My son hiding this away proves that it works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Of course, that first day they both put their fingers in their mouth of out habit and were not AT ALL pleased with the flavor.</li>
            <li> Being a nail biter for pretty much most of my life I was excited to find out you can add flavoring to spice up a lifetime habit.</li>
            <li> Originally I was given this product by a friend of mine.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy so this product was not too appealing to me at first.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it, I am more aware than ever when I bite my nail.  </li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to work.  </li>
            <li> The first day it seemed like it might be the magic charm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like putting on nailpolish where you put on a normal amount of liquid and spread nicely.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself first to make sure.  </li>
            <li> After eight years and a month ago found this on amazon, read reviews and bough - and first time for many years</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure, today, that he knocked it off the kitchen counter on purpose.  </li>
            <li> A drink of water and washing the lips gets rid of the taste though, but I have to admit, it is a powerful deterrent--and no amount of hand washing gets rid of it on the fingers!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Now she is excited that she is not sucking her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> But it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> She was resistant at first, but we told her it was magic and would help her to remember not to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> Initially I thought it was successful.</li>
            <li> I think if I can get more consistent it&#x27;ll do the trick for this guy.</li>
            <li> Guess my first boy was just more tolerant/stubborn, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li> I think if I can get more consistent it&#x27;ll do the trick for this guy.</li>
            <li> Guess my first boy was just more tolerant/stubborn, depending on how you look at it.</li>
            <li> We only had to use it one more time, and she was magically done with thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> We had tears the first two nights that they would not be able to sleep without their thumbs but somehow they did</li>
            <li> Well worth it !</li>
            <li> I even made sure to apply nail polish first</li>
            <li> and that it was coming in the mail (exciting for her!)</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> It took a while to ship, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> It worked like magic the first 2 days, but then I guess he got used to it, because it works for about 10 minutes after application</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but was willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product and read all the reviews about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it  for the past 3 weeks and found it is an excellent aide in reminding me to get my fingers out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Way worth it!</li>
            <li> Beginning in the dental field, having pretty and healthy teeth is a must.</li>
            <li> She likes my pretty nails. :)</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because of my son.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> besides flossing, I&#x27;m wondering what other situations might cause me to put my fingers in my mouth, and hopefully I&#x27;ll have the good sense to avoid it before it happens!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure her front teeth changed within days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is exactly why I love it.  </li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say I did read many reviews BEFORE trying this product.  </li>
            <li> I explained this product after purchasing it and she was of course excited and nervous.</li>
            <li> : The first day I used this product, I put a lot of it on and all over my cuticles just for safe measure.</li>
            <li> well worth it!</li>
            <li> For the price, it was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It stays pretty prominent even after hand washing, showering, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about the number of 5s this product received.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the outcome so far with using Mavala on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have used so many products over the years and this is the first time it worked.  </li>
            <li> so it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Now if I could just find that bottle, I&#x27;m pretty sure she hid it from me.</li>
            <li> It worked the first day (and that may have been more of a placebo).</li>
            <li> I put nail hardener on first then apply this to the top of that every 2 days.</li>
            <li> She let me put it on and was really excited.</li>
            <li> She was excited about it happening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 15 years and this is the first time I&#x27;v been able to stop.</li>
            <li> My child didn&#x27;t like the taste, but had not wild/far out reactions, it seemed to be the perfect level of motivation to stop sucking without going overboard.</li>
            <li> I Bought this product for my 4 year old granddaughter and we were very pleased...</li>
            <li> but if you touch your finger on a nail and eat, you better be ready for that treat!</li>
            <li> Worth the price even for just one use!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> We sill keep using until we achieve success!</li>
            <li> Well worth your money!</li>
            <li> Her first application was hilarious are putting it on my daughters thumb as she didn&#x27;t even suck her thumb but somehow got a taste of it in her mouth not knowing what it from was spitting all over the floor.  </li>
            <li> First time in my life that I can paint my nails and feel confident about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited, after years of nail biting</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> She was so excited.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was cute.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore I originally bought this product when she was 18 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d find myself doing it at the most inopportune moments and people would look at me funny.  </li>
            <li> I put it on every 2 days for the first week just to make sure she was done.</li>
            <li> from my original post-</li>
            <li> This is powerful stuff and works!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid nail biter for most of my 29 years.  </li>
            <li> I still tried to use it for my 1 yr old daughter, looks like she is having a real strong intent of \\&quot;thumb sucking\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I waited - it appears it is most effective on kids 3 and older as their taste buds are not fully developed before then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You probably shouldn&#x27;t try this with real little kids, and it will probably be more successful if the child is motivated to top sucking.  </li>
            <li> my 2.5 year old daughter actually LIKED the taste and requested it be put on her finger so she could enjoy</li>
            <li> I think the best thing is just to ignote it until he gets old enough to want to stop.</li>
            <li> I will say that she no longer sleeps thru the night in her own bed since no longer sucking her thumb, but that&#x27;s a different problem. :)</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands clean though, so</li>
            <li> The vet also suggested a premie &amp;#34;onesie.&amp;#34;  We went with that option, but it&#x27;s been less than ideal as it rides up unless it&#x27;s snapped shut at the butt</li>
            <li> For the first couple of days Mavala Stop seemed pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> Their doctor told me buying products like this one would be a waste of money, but I was confident about this product because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I am also much more conscious of biting them and you start to see how much better</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had to continue using Mavala, applying every three to four days, as she &#x27;taste tests&#x27; her thumbs to see if they are yet &#x27;clean&#x27;, in her words.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different products to stop nail biting and this stuff is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Now he has nails that I have to actually clean and trim.</li>
            <li> This got such great reviews, even a friend of mine had success with this when nothing else worked.  </li>
            <li> She liked putting the polish on and even asks for more but we only put it on her thumbs because the taste does come off on food</li>
            <li> (We had tried another product called Thum earlier, but she liked it and would ask for applying more on her fingers).</li>
            <li> Before too long, my beautiful, healthy and much longer nails were being nibbled to the quick.  </li>
            <li> My five year old took great pride each night in putting her sticker on the little enclosed chart when she got through the day successfully.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will take before he stops wishing he could suck his thumb, but I have to say this is a very effective product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything, positive reinforcement and rewards, hugs and one over the counter pharmacy product (containing cayenne pepper which he enjoyed) but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith on this product because of the overwhelming positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews about it on here, but was still leary about it woking for my daughter because of the severity.  </li>
            <li> This amazing product got my four year old to stop sucking her thumb in one day!</li>
            <li> It was more about becoming aware of my nail biting habit and that is exactly what this does.</li>
            <li> you cook frequently, make sure to wear gloves at all times when using Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li> We tried everything, the sour stuff (she loved the taste!)</li>
            <li> So he was quite happy to just suck it right off, even though it&#x27;d only been an hour since I&#x27;d reapplied it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it wears off of skin pretty quickly as opposed to nails, but it is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that with lots of hand-washing, you may need to apply it more often (maybe each night) because it washes off more easily.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to finally have good nails!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> stuff is really strong and can sometimes &amp;#34;bite you&amp;#34; even when you are not actually biting at your nails; I tend to even keep my hands away from my face more when using this which has the added bonus of not getting as many germs in your mouth from your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We gave her one of her baby sisters pacifiers to use and a special  stuffed bunny to squeeze if she needed to suck her thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He went seven days without sucking his thumb and he got a special toy.</li>
            <li> I had some special nail gloss.  </li>
            <li> The special polish was Mavala.  </li>
            <li> Our dentist even wanted to put a special appliance in his mouth to make him break the habit.  </li>
            <li> , it will certainly take more than one try to break it.  </li>
            <li> If they could make this something more of a combo it would be 5 stars, but it certainly does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I told her it was special nail polish just for her.  </li>
            <li> He thinks its something special.</li>
            <li> yeah, right!  </li>
            <li> stop right away!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> She would suck it right off!</li>
            <li> Worked right away!  </li>
            <li> It has a very bitter taste and is absolutely the best anti-biting I ever used.</li>
            <li> We are definitely satisfied customers and proud parents of two little girls that no longer suck their fingers! :</li>
            <li> Better to do this than to spend thousands on orthodontists fees when your child is older!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Mavala Stop-there were so many HELPFUL  reviews,TIPS and high ratings from lots of consumers which is important to</li>
            <li> I was NOT expecting such a strong overwhelming, lingering taste!</li>
            <li> the first day it worked great and after that it was over just simply hopeless</li>
            <li> Amazing my 3 years old daughter stop biting her nails within A WEEK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff and at for under $20 bucks, it was money well spent to me.</li>
            <li> She hates the bitter taste and happily keeps her fingers out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> so happy no more thumb sucking :)</li>
            <li> I now have long nails and it is so wonderful to write a check at a store or unpeel some old tape without being embarressed.</li>
            <li> My son can&#x27;t stand the taste and has greatly reduced how much he tries to put his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> she is not so happy at night, but in the long run, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s working amazingly well so far.</li>
            <li> The taste, I&#x27;m told, is vile and it does last 2 days at a stretch, even with good hand-washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her dentist said it was okay to let it go until age 4, but now that I&#x27;ve gone through this, I would encourage fellow parents to stop their children with finger sucking MUCH sooner.  </li>
            <li> Another thing, about people who are saying that their kids got used to the taste, thats actually true..</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> I gave my 7 and 10 year old (yes, 10) sons the chance to quit their thumb sucking on their own with the threat of ordering this stuff if they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It really truely worked.</li>
            <li> I tested it out on my pinky finger to make sure it wasnt too much for him.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t reapplied the polish in a good week and the habit has not come back, not even at night.</li>
            <li> But thanks to this stuff I was able too.  </li>
            <li> before I got a full blast.</li>
            <li> 4 yr  old apparently liked the taste.  </li>
            <li> Longevity seems good, although I got in the habit of painting daily just to do it.</li>
            <li> and I really just wanted to go get mani&#x27;s:)</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be able to eat much with your fingers, so use utensils while you have it on your nails.</li>
            <li> We have found that to be true because we tried a nail biting inhibitor when he was around three and sucked his thumb anyway.</li>
            <li> It really works, plus it&#x27;s made in Switzerland and is safe for kids.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my 2 year old who liked to suck two fingers.</li>
            <li> Well it has come true.</li>
            <li> My own son was a nailbiter and from the moment I put it on he would not go near his mouth.</li>
            <li> Effective while on the nails, I found myself reapplying to my 4 year old&#x27;s fingers nightly.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it actually taste bad,the concept is good</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s full of chemicals, and that means she&#x27;s ingesting those chemicals.</li>
            <li> &quot; but the dentist stated she was starting to see some changes in her palate from the thumbsucking and her teeth, which were in good health, looked obvisouly like she sucked her thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go for 2 full weeks 14 days, but I&#x27;m 100%</li>
            <li> We did put it on his thumb a second time, but just for good measure.</li>
            <li> It can help to freshen it up during the week to keep the taste at full unpleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your nails will probably not look natural, but if that&#x27;s a concern, you could probably lie and say it&#x27;s just a nice, buffed manicure.</li>
            <li> Your nails will probably not look natural, but if that&#x27;s a concern, you could probably lie and say it&#x27;s just a nice, buffed manicure.</li>
            <li> myself, the absent-minded nail biting is my real problem, been doing it for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails my whole life, and I never thought I would be able to stop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful, and cheap.</li>
            <li> She was 8 years old and had no intention of stopping on her own.  </li>
            <li> but it kind of got used and old.</li>
            <li> BUT - the next night was easier and by the 3-4 he was good to go!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was VERY nervous about trying this product because so many reviews said that it made their child vomit.  </li>
            <li> only fair.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it works well as a clear nail polish, although it is kind of pricey for just that.</li>
            <li> 2 days later I re-applied for good measure.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve been thrilled to see that the habit is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> We kept some juice handy to wash the taste away when she accidentally did it in the early morning hours.  </li>
            <li> He was ready and we tried many things, but this did the trick</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old been-biting-my-nails-forever kind of guy.  </li>
            <li> I think $6-$8 is a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Now spends a lot more time coloring and getting into real trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My almost five year old son has been wanting to stop sucking his thumb and could not do it on his own.</li>
            <li> Well it definitely doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve collected my fair share of nervous habits over the years and finally I got fed up with my inability to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things....</li>
            <li> He licked his fingers and true to form</li>
            <li> The next day at nap he asked if there was still medicine on his hand, I said there was, and it didn&#x27;t taste good, so he should try not to put them in his mouth.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even mind that 98% of the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li> after about 2 weeks of applying twice per week my four year old daughter got use to it its no linger effective</li>
            <li> It says it may not be effective on kids under 3 years old, but it still worked for us.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I still have the bottle almost full.</li>
            <li> It really works, I feel so much better about my hands now.</li>
            <li> I hesitated, because I thought it would be too traumatizing, but it actually helped him and he feels good about himself now that he&#x27;s kicked the habit.</li>
            <li> I have really liked the results to far.</li>
            <li> and my nails finally looked good.</li>
            <li> This woke her up immediately in full tears.</li>
            <li> I love this item so much.</li>
            <li> We will start leaving it on full time after 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using it without the true desire to stop will probably not be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on and it went on nice and clear.</li>
            <li> That really motivated her; the M.S. was more of a reminder not to do it (like when asleep).</li>
            <li> Loved this product, my youngest daughter sucked her index and middle finger</li>
            <li> Biting my nails has been a habit my whole life, and it did not make me magically stop.</li>
            <li> Especially something he loved</li>
            <li> So, for $10.99 + free shipping we figured that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I still have a FULL bottle and will us this for my daughter as well.  </li>
            <li> Impressive, to say the least.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> so it was full and waisted..</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;---This is the best honestly no chemicals or nothing.</li>
            <li> and she stopped completely on her own, just because she did not want another application of the Mavala on her nails.</li>
            <li> It is true what others say about transfer onto food</li>
            <li> Whenever it&#x27;s applied, we&#x27;re usually good for several days before it wears off.</li>
            <li> He still does it occasionally but we found this to be good deterrent.</li>
            <li> I personally find that to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all for his own wellness and the dentist told that sucking the thumb near to 5 or 6 years can affect his permeation</li>
            <li> We still have a full bottle leftover.</li>
            <li> Once I started working dating my boyfriend he has helped me to not bite as much, but i still bite my nails and most of the time</li>
            <li> You have to reapply it if they take a bath and make sure not to put too much on their nail or it will affect their food.</li>
            <li> What they say about tastebud development is true bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only fair that you know what they&#x27;re going through.</li>
            <li> If you use this product and continue to bite your nails with it on, you have my respect because you are truely dedicated to your habit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but it is there.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but has a lot of shine</li>
            <li> just went away with no tears, no bad taste, and no trauma.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old loved her thumb and her teeth/bite were pretty messed up because of it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST $9 I&#x27;ve EVER spent!!!!!</li>
            <li> But I can honestly say, after about 20 years of nail biting it actually is becoming rapidly less appealing to me.</li>
            <li> I am truly convinced that I have kicked the habit and am so excited to start getting manicures for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> Pretty cool, eh!?  </li>
            <li> I surely does taste bitter, and yes I have stopped biting my nails for the most part, but the taste gets on anything I put my hands in!</li>
            <li> This product does not smell or look funny, so it&#x27;s very easy to just put on top of nail polish or on bare nails.</li>
            <li> However, it would be wonderful if it was made of natural ingredients such as aloe vera which is bitter ang good for one&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this worked great.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> I think we could have used this and other techniques to greatly shorten the sucking period, in a caring way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great to encourage and tease each other along the way.</li>
            <li> None of them work - if anyone has other ideas, that would be great.</li>
            <li> It is a very very bitter taste and makes for a great deterrent for biting nails.</li>
            <li> (we are continuing the use till we are certain the habit is gone)!!</li>
            <li> but it dries quickly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any irritation to my eyes, luckily.  </li>
            <li> A last note, her teeth moved back into correct position in about 6 weeks and her bite is perfect.  </li>
            <li> They had to take a quick drink of water or juice to get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li> I can see how it is better on older children.</li>
            <li> Three days later I checked his nails and they were all growing back wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the last part was more than people wanted to know</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the last part was more than people wanted to know</li>
            <li> So far so good no thumb sucking for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Our 3 year-old quickly figured out how to take a suck at her thumb and then take a drink repeatedly until the mavala was sucked off and she had rinsed the taste from her mouth.  </li>
            <li> It dries quick</li>
            <li> It lingers and conditions you quickly to avoid biting your nails.</li>
            <li> Overall i was very impressed with the initial results.</li>
            <li> Two days later we applied it once more just to be safe, but I don&#x27;t think she ever tried again.  </li>
            <li> but with all the Thai food I ate when I was pregnant with my him</li>
            <li> It is incredibly mild and had no impact on breaking my childs habit.  </li>
            <li> She could wash it off (and did so at school) and it faded quickly so the spicy cayenne pepper taste would lessen</li>
            <li> It comes with more than enough to hopefully cure even the most relentless of nail</li>
            <li> i tried about 3 times, and learned quickly.  </li>
            <li> After that I put on two coats of Mavala Stop and it didn&#x27;t wear off so quickly.</li>
            <li> We did need to apply it to her fingers as well, because she tried to bypass it, but quickly realized that would not work.  </li>
            <li> It comes off so quickly that you will gradually get conditioned to the taste</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s the point, but it would be more effective if it was immediately bitter.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything to get him to stop, from telling him that his nail would fall of from bugs and worms growing out of it, to chili powder mixed with hot sauce (he liked it!).</li>
            <li> I received the order quickly and would recommend this product if you need help to end a thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> Luckily, she stopped it before the bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 3 year old and her 7 year old cousin.</li>
            <li> Luckily, we had a blanket, as I will spare the details and cleanup.  </li>
            <li> Super.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, he still has his baby teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that with his particular habit, he was able to avoid tasting the Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> Did keep my husband from biting his nails for awhile but would wear off way to quickly.</li>
            <li> She made the connection quickly and has basically stopped thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, my daughter was not deterred and it wears off quickly</li>
            <li> so I had to do something quick.</li>
            <li> She actually started sucking her thumb more and more - bed time, watching TV, in the car...</li>
            <li> Being older, I think it had a better impact on her</li>
            <li> I never thought it would work so quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it worked that quickly.  </li>
            <li> He learned to stop quickly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> My child quickly learned from it</li>
            <li> The hardest part for him was learning to fall asleep but he quickly adjusted.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very proud of herself and talks about being such a big girl now that she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> If I could do it over I would have waited till he was older, for sure, if at all.</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly on the naila nd even finger area underneath the nail.  </li>
            <li> fixed the issue of finder nail bitting fast and works good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s safe fir 3 and older</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> her nails did grow fairly quick too.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this product worked for just that.  </li>
            <li> In trying several similar products, this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping by the seller.</li>
            <li> but he figured out quickly</li>
            <li> I love that it stays on for more than a day and doesn&#x27;t require constant reapplication.</li>
            <li> advice for the first day or days depending on your child age: the first time you apply make sure you have time to stay with your child to monitor him or her as the need to suck is already a habit for him or her.</li>
            <li> This shipped out and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> He ended up just biting anyway and the stuff seemed to wear off quickly once that started.</li>
            <li> But, he quickly learned how to suck through the smell/taste and now does it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was quick drying.</li>
            <li> Our three-year-old just started sucking his thumb out of nowhere, and it quickly became an all-day, all-night habit.</li>
            <li> You do learn to use utensils really quick with this product too.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s mainly a nervous thing because I notice I do it more when I am stressed</li>
            <li> It goes on very easily, just like clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> like - 80&#x27;s high hair made sure everyone knows how a mouthful of that tastes.)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old stopped biting her nails!! :))</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely potent and will easily taint food if prepared with bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THANKS MALAVA STOP for such a fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li> I would very highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It works the very first night.</li>
            <li> The nail biting somehow faded over the course of few month, mostly under a threat of Mavala:), so credit goes to them anyway:)</li>
            <li> I ordered Malva stop and from the very first day we put it on his thumb</li>
            <li> I found this product on amazon and ordered without any second thought and I am very glad that I found this product because my daughter stopped her thumb sucking habit from the very first application.</li>
            <li> This product made my 4 year-old son stop sucking his fingers on the very first day.  </li>
            <li> The very first night I used it, she was sucking her thumb within 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> He was very willing to not suck his thumb while awake, but while sleeping it would just happen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wears off in 3 days or so, and while you can still taste bitterness, it&#x27;s bearable, so this product is most effective for me if I put it on every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Be very aware when u use this product ...</li>
            <li> It worked the very first time we applied it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product (she will be three in 2 months) and one the very first day of using this</li>
            <li> At the first stop light I got to-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that most dentists believe it is a good idea to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs as early as possible.</li>
            <li> The very first time she tasted it, she cried but I gave her some water</li>
            <li> This helped very much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very potent, the only downside is you&#x27;ll have to eat finger foods with forks.</li>
            <li> Made me very aware of when my hands made it to my mouth.  </li>
            <li> He was a very willing participant and was grateful for something that would help him break the habit.</li>
            <li> She cried (and drooled) for three hours and fidgeted all night long, so she did not get a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as we keep reapplying every 2 days, she should be good.  </li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s strong and smart and could pull them off no matter</li>
            <li> (insert jumping up and down - HAPPY).  </li>
            <li> I have a pair of 3 year-olds and this worked great for one but not the other (she was just determined to suck her thumb no matter what!).</li>
            <li> My  3 yeard dauther leave the thum sucking since the first day, I put Mavala each 2 dya for 10 days, this really work!!!</li>
            <li> not only got better about not biting my nails, but I also was more conscious of licking my fingers, touching my face, and eating food with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Specially when its a huge mood changed haha.</li>
            <li> No matter how many deals we made to get them a new toy or throw them a party they couldn&#x27;t kick the habit.  </li>
            <li> Just to be sure the habit was gone, we applied a new coat every two or three days for about a month.  </li>
            <li> You need to make sure to add a new coat every 2 days thought because it does fade with soap.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product because, for any normal person, it will be a great deterrent to putting fingers in the mouth.</li>
            <li> applied, the first day it works great and tastes horribly bitter.</li>
            <li> It was really that easy.  </li>
            <li> Fast &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I painted her nails before putting it on, and she was excited about that since I&#x27;d never let her paint them before because I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea due to her thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> My two elementary school kids who we could not get to stop sucking their thumbs quickly stopped after we started painting their thumbs with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Be ready for gagging and some throw up if your child throws up easily.</li>
            <li> I finally have long, beautiful nails after biting mine to the nub for over 40 years!</li>
            <li> it tastes pretty gross, but a good teeth scrubbing and</li>
            <li> The taste from these two products wears off fast and is too easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Perfect product, last for a long time on nail.</li>
            <li> This worked very well, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I made sure they were ready and wanted to try it, I tried it first.</li>
            <li> When I tasted it, it was almost like fish oil (very salty and strong).</li>
            <li> I love my new nails and can&#x27;t wait to go for my first manicure!</li>
            <li> your child is very young make sure you remaind him or her from</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the fact that they look so good that I haven&#x27;t had a single bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the product on the first day and that was it, THUMBSUCKING HAS STOPPED!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 2 weeks and for the first time in my life I have nails!</li>
            <li> Well Mavala Stop worked the first time!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works, but prepare yourself for the traumatic first steps!</li>
            <li> The first night, success!  </li>
            <li> It worked the first day!</li>
            <li> oh boy - this should have been our first choice!  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> It felt like it was the first time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the fast results!!</li>
            <li> and she evidently disagreed!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny because it makes you very aware of what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember exactly, but we did it for about 2 weeks and his nails started growing!</li>
            <li> The first day she stopped!</li>
            <li> She learned fast not to do that anymore!!</li>
            <li> First nite I used it, it worked!  </li>
            <li> I asked our dentist what he would recommend, and he said Mavala Stop is the only thing he&#x27;s been able to find that works!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Other then that,  I&#x27;m loving the results!</li>
            <li> This is for real!!</li>
            <li> Worked the first time we used it!</li>
            <li> A week after that, I clipped her nails for the first time in 18 months!</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this it truly works!!!</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to say my son no longer sucks his thumb!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many methods to get our stubborn 5 year old twins to stop sucking their thumbs and this product worked on day one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect negative reinforcement!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for this age, at least!</li>
            <li> She stopped that first day, and hasn&#x27;t done it since!</li>
            <li> That night she got up several times to get a drink because of the taste in her mouth, but after that we have not had any more thumb sucking!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> works very well!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have never been able to shake biting my nails--32 years old but cannot stop it!</li>
            <li> This product stopped it the first day!</li>
            <li> He still says he can&#x27;t wait to stop using it so he can suck his thumb again, but I told him I&#x27;d put it on him till he was married if I had to!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Mavala!!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have nails!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> My son is, scratch that, WAS an avid thumbsucker after 1 application before nap time and one at bed he was done!</li>
            <li> Within a WEEK of our first application his nails were growing and he was no longer putting his fingers in his mouth!</li>
            <li> I just painted my nails for the first time at 25!</li>
            <li> But now, they stopped since first week of using Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li> We talked to him about it before using it and he was resistant but within the first week he stopped sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> I should have bought it when he first told me, it would have saved thousands in orthodontist bills and braces!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb yet!:)</li>
            <li> She has not sucked her thumbs day or night since the first 2 weeks of this!</li>
            <li> I stayed strong (but compassionate and comforting) and the next morning, like magic</li>
            <li> but i stayed strong with what i wanted for my daughter, and just kept explaining that shes a big girl now, and it ll be better tomorrow</li>
            <li> Many similar products can easily be sucked off, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> Always envious of guys/gals with nice long nails and spent many nights contemplating growing my own (nails..</li>
            <li> on the plus side, it&#x27;s pretty fun to shove your fingers into significant others&#x27; mouths and ruin their night.</li>
            <li> I think my son&#x27;s going to grow up being a hot sauce junky because he just sucked it clean off his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she stopped sucking at her thumb right away, I used it for a month since I heard that it takes 21 days to stop or to get a new habit so,just to make sure..</li>
            <li> and she wanted to stop wanted to stop but needed a little help and this product worked great for her.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, painting little stubs is NOT that attractive to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my little one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it that offensive, but our little guy holds it in great disdain.</li>
            <li> I think if it came in a spray, one little poof on donuts or ice cream would make this a great weight-loss product as well.  </li>
            <li> This is probably not something you want to put on really little kids fingers, but it works great for our 4 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We discussed why it wasn&#x27;t good to suck her thumb or bite her nails (germs under her nails and on her hands, not being able to wear polish, hurt to bite too much, would mess up her grown up teeth coming in,</li>
            <li> There should be enough in there to share with someone else once we&#x27;re certain that we&#x27;re finished with it for good.</li>
            <li> I wanted something safe, yet effective and did a little research.</li>
            <li> is coming from helping them not to taste it all the time specially in the first hours because as time passes by they understand then you don&#x27;t have to remaind that often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> me and my husband were excited to get this product because of the wild reviews saying how strong it was.</li>
            <li> I was ignorant to the fact that such a wonderful product existed!&lt;br /&gt;So for a little background my daughter was more than ready to stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> We started him off with a seven day period that he had to stop and then we would give him a cheap toy that he really wanted.</li>
            <li> you only see fingers w a huge head :)  </li>
            <li> He got a couple tastes of it and of course needed to drink water and wipe his mouth but really didn&#x27;t throw much of a fit.</li>
            <li> She seemed to enjoy it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that it worked for her because it&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> (the top teeth or sticking farther out) and the huge callous on her middle finger.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product for those kids who want to stop, but just need some extra help.</li>
            <li> I will be searching for another alternative despite having such amazing success years ago.</li>
            <li> Amazing results, stopped thumb sucking instantly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up because all kids are different, but it did work for me truly amazing.</li>
            <li> short, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> worked amazingly well, We only had to apply maybe 3 days in a row and he stopped biting his nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that the nail biter WANTS to quit.</li>
            <li> It worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> product is amazing, it&#x27;s finally allowing me to let go of my 25 year habit.</li>
            <li> At school, he fidgeted a lot since he couldn&#x27;t calm himself by sucking his fingers.  </li>
            <li> His thumb was what he used to calm and soothe himself.  </li>
            <li> What I liked the most was that the polish stayed on for a few days.  </li>
            <li> nice product and definitely gets</li>
            <li> It does not have a matte finish and is not a liquid which is simply absorbed into the nail...</li>
            <li> It does not have a matte finish and is not a liquid which is simply absorbed into the nail...</li>
            <li> in the end it worth it.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to have</li>
            <li> I want to be sure we completely break the habit.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> For those who said they couldn&#x27;t eat finger food, or the taste made them want to vomit, I honestly wonder if they received the same product I did.</li>
            <li> Husband did it with her to make it fun.  </li>
            <li> think this is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> My son has also had success, with a couple of setbacks.</li>
            <li> 36 years worth of nail biting</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Someone recommended this product so I thought it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, success depends on the child.  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> the results are worth the effort and cost of the product.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money for us.  </li>
            <li> It does wear off after a day or two, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li> into consideration that my now 13-year-old sucked his two middle fingers until he was three (stopping on his own), we even tried waiting it</li>
            <li> It is worth the money to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> so worth the money</li>
            <li> Her teeth took about 2-3 months and her smile is out of control beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> My 4 month old is already a thumbsucker, so we&#x27;ll be pulling out the bottle again in a couple of years. :)</li>
            <li> Worth It</li>
            <li> but im glad to say it has worked so far</li>
            <li> There may be vomitting when tasted but its worth it.</li>
            <li> We also purchased to keep our 6 year old from putting her hands in her mouth so much in hopes of reducing the number of viruses she&#x27;s constantly catching from school.</li>
            <li> and it ended up getting kind of short.</li>
            <li> Sure, it leaves a \\&quot;polish\\&quot; on your nails (like clear nail polish).  </li>
            <li> Unless you use this for kids, then it might be useful.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it for the money</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not afraid of the taste, he even asked me to put on \\&quot;yikie\\&quot; for him.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting though that my friend tried it and the taste did not deter him from biting his nails, so this may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Also helped make sure that thumb sucking was DONE in my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> We had to apply it just twice to break the thumb sucking habit of our two year old (but we continued to apply it for a week to be sure).</li>
            <li> My daughter has been sucking her thumb since before she was born (sonogram picture proves it).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It worked like magic, one taste and the fingers never went near her mouth again, and we didn&#x27;t even get any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> and I thought I was on the road to success.  </li>
            <li> I was so worried he would be made fun of</li>
            <li> When it was time to reapply, which was 2 days later the product was not as effective.</li>
            <li> so when she went to kindergarten they wouldn&#x27;t make fun of her.  </li>
            <li> However, it may be worth the $10</li>
            <li> I love not being self conscious about my nails.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so exciting</li>
            <li> it is worth me taking the time to write a review to let people know that this product worked for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> it is worth me taking the time to write a review to let people know that this product worked for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I became extremely confident that this would be the solution for my 4 year old daughter to stop biting her nails and fingers.</li>
            <li> It will take probably 4-6 more weeks for my nails to completely grow out</li>
            <li> She was even honest enough to tell me when the product was wearing off.  </li>
            <li> Try some thing else for kids, it migth be useful for adults.</li>
            <li> It was totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This worked to stop my son from putting his thumb in his mouth, but I think it is worth sharing our experience with it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely ever write an on-line review</li>
            <li> I simply smile and ask her if she remembers me doing so.</li>
            <li> I tried thumb guards and didn&#x27;t have any success with those.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> It is powerful stuff, but if you have stubborn kids, it is just what you need.</li>
            <li> My daughter quit eating my wife&#x27;s freshly baked sugar cookies the moment her fingers touched her mouth.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve found this product useful to us as a family...</li>
            <li> Also worth noting</li>
            <li> is that my friend says that the product, once painted on the fingernails, works for several days even with frequent hand washing, which he is happy about (since he doesn&#x27;t have to re-apply as often).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every day I asked him to show his nails, and complimented him with not biting them and how they were growing back so nicely.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many ways to get our almost 3 year old son to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> My son went to feed him a Dorito and my hubby over bites so he gets our sons fingers to make him laugh.</li>
            <li> She said it had a 100% success rate.  </li>
            <li> Used this for my 6 year old son who was sucking his thumb, mostly at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> He seemed to think this was pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, I&#x27;ve tried many solutions.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> We also did NOT use it when her incision was fresh, but waited until day 5 when the wound was crusting over (and probably itching) and the cat was obsessively attending to it.  </li>
            <li> just enough so that if she licked that area again, she&#x27;d get a light taste that might stop her from wanting to lick there any more.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s manageable and well worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again, this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> They were kind enough to arrange a brown-uniformed guy to drive my Mavala to my home in a brown van.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as useful for guys.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 3 year old son, after he started biting his nails, but only for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have a three years old girl that had a problem of sucking her tomb and we tried to many things  before and nothing didn&#x27;t work until now.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to apply it, my 5 year will not put his hands near his mouth just to avoid having to have it put on.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost</li>
            <li> We had tried everything else without success.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands throughout the day and find I need to use the product more frequently.  </li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> it has been well worth the effort</li>
            <li> well worth whatever they charge as it does the job.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is worth it for a baby to experience this in order to stop the habit.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a shot....</li>
            <li> This worked great for my 4 year old daughter who constantly sucked her figures.  </li>
            <li> I actually tested it on my own nail before putting it on either of them.</li>
            <li> warning, it gives me headaches so the initial couple weeks of use kind of sucked</li>
            <li> so it was actually quite amusing.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad it did work for my daughter as early as 2.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product worked great both for helping my 4 year old stop sucking her thumb as well as helping my husband cut back on his nail biting.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I rarely review anything.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at him...</li>
            <li> totally worth the money</li>
            <li> it was worth a shot).  </li>
            <li> We tried a thumb guard without sustainable success.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything for three years without success.</li>
            <li> I have been a professional nail biter since before I can remember, with more cuticle infections then I can count.</li>
            <li> She was rarely putting her fingers in her mouth anymore</li>
            <li> and she would just smile, look at me, and suck those fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it on the cuticle of my almost 3 yr old&#x27;s thumb who had been sucking his thumb more than ever.</li>
            <li> She reports almost immediate success.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The desire to bite my nails is completely gone :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some people have success with this</li>
            <li> The only thing that was effective was an appliance by the dentist.</li>
            <li> Be careful as children that love to eat finger food will not be so pleased.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
            <li> That is obviously why it is so effective.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, and haven&#x27;t been able to stop biting my nails since before I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Success for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I can say, is this product is worth</li>
            <li> But it was worth kicking the habit.</li>
            <li> so I had a towel ready and could quickly cover her mouth and keep things clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product now for several years and found it quite effective although it remains a maintenence issue</li>
            <li> I do find that you have to use it more frequently for it to truly work.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now only if they had something this effective with potty training.</li>
            <li> While I still have months to go for my nails to regrow, I am taking one picture a day to document my success story with Mavala.</li>
            <li> especially not Thanksgiving Day biscuits everyone else would (have liked to) eat.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter hates the taste, but asks me to apply it daily since it does a great job of reminding her to stop biting.  </li>
            <li> Wow, way over the top.  </li>
            <li> Good Lord, this stuff is bitter, I don&#x27;t doubt this will work to quit nail biting.</li>
            <li> not be able to put fingers near mouth for any reason</li>
            <li> Mavala is a miracle worker and I am amazed at it success.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> However, as an elementary school teacher, I would NOT put this stuff on a child.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price of the bottle</li>
            <li> I will continue to apply for another week to make sure she&#x27;s weaned completely.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought we were never going to get this habit under control and in a short time it has stopped altogether!</li>
            <li> That said, it is worth it and for me it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to jeopardize calorie intake in a smile child.</li>
            <li> We will continue using this product for a while longer to ensure her success.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to jeopardize calorie intake in a smile child.</li>
            <li> We will continue using this product for a while longer to ensure her success.</li>
            <li> Nice to finally have some fingernails!!!</li>
            <li> But, again, worth it to stop the habit.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice size bottle and tastes gross, but doesn&#x27;t make her gag or throw up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found a solution early on.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheaper option to get my son to stop sucking his thumb, figuring it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> It was worth a try</li>
            <li> Figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> But after reapplying, I&#x27;m back to letting them start to look nice</li>
            <li> Decided that they like the taste of the stuff, when it actually tastes I bit hazardous and toxic in my opinion (</li>
            <li> this stuff is really powerful.  </li>
            <li> A week worth of using this, we haven&#x27;t had any problems with her biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful to correct the nail-biting.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> but we use this as an effective threat when he comes back from school with bitten nails.</li>
            <li> It is worth the try though and lasts through hand washings.</li>
            <li> Being 30 years old now, having a habit most people broke when they were 12 has always been a source of shame and Mavala Stop ridded me of it.  </li>
            <li> She was blow drying the Mavala with the biggest smile on her face not knowing what was to follow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, in our case.</li>
            <li> One bottle was more than enough to coat my nails through the whole process and was more than effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered it, thinking it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter was a bit more of a challenge.</li>
            <li> I had to convince her that as a big girl, she should try to stop on her own and the &amp;#34;nasty polish&amp;#34; was just to remind her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a 13 year old who has been a nail biter most of her life.  </li>
            <li> So, six weeks in, I would say it is worth every dime</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I cannot emphasis enough how effective this polish is at stopping thumb-sucking or nail biting.  </li>
            <li> &quot; - funny, we let her keep her thumb for another year but just ordered a new bottle :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But really this is the thing to get when you&#x27;re ready!!!</li>
            <li> is still so young, what does it matter right now&amp;#34; until he started getting sores, calluses and cracking skin - then we knew it was a problem we better solve now.  </li>
            <li> It is so strong, you pretty much have to give up finger foods.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 20 month old and she stopped sucking her thumb the first day!!!</li>
            <li> you plan to use this for a very young child, I suggest scanning these reviews first for more opinions.  </li>
            <li> Would look great plain or over nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For her, she needs a fresh application right before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we had a glimmer of hope, until he consecutively tore right through his nails even with this stuff freshly applied.  </li>
            <li> Best ten dollars spent ever!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s me completely honest, dumping slime of someone was just an opportunity for show producers to have a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; friendly wet t-shirt contest, but that&#x27;s not my point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very proud of myself, and wish other people cared to pat me on the back for something which seems so inconsequential to them.  </li>
            <li> Easily saves $300-$400 that one would normally pay for a habit appliance from the dentist or orthodontist.</li>
            <li> We are now at day 40 and no relapse, only had to put in on every other day and IT WORKED PERFECTLY!!!</li>
            <li> We have tried other similar pruducts but this one has worked best.</li>
            <li> first night she was super upset and after putting her thumb in her mouth she said her tummy hurt and spit in a bowl for quite a while.</li>
            <li> it washed off with water and my son figured that out pretty darn quick.</li>
            <li> He might forget and put his thumbs close to his mouth, but he remembered pretty quick that he didn&#x27;t want them in his mouth.</li>
            <li> The first night she forgot and put her thumb in her mouth quickly removing it.  </li>
            <li> I knew things were serious, when I caught him biting his TOENAILS because he really couldn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;good gnaw\\&quot; going on his fingers anymore!!  </li>
            <li> Another positive is that one application stays on for a full day</li>
            <li> My son wants to stop, so he was actually excited about putting it on.  </li>
            <li> With this stuff I have been averaging 8-9 good and 1 sacrificial, but  i think in due time i will get to 10,</li>
            <li> After 7 long years of trying to break my son this stuff sure worked!</li>
            <li> It is an awesome product that is small enough to fit until your purse and go anywhere, is always there when you need it.</li>
            <li> cause my daughter tried to move to other fingers so its good to paint all fingers.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product that I was hearing so much about.</li>
            <li> Ok, my daughter has been sucking her thumb steadily and she is 5 years old!!!</li>
            <li> Convenient and work fine - for my son 8 yrs old!!</li>
            <li> (My son also sucked his thumb but was able to quit on his own, and had already really cut down on the amount of thumb sucking he did by the time he was her age.)  </li>
            <li> Well, I guess that&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> Now, here&#x27;s hoping the Dentist is right, and her teeth will correct on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She accidentally put her thumb in her mouth twice that day but took it out right away.</li>
            <li> I bit right through it.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I applied it to her fingers right away.</li>
            <li> and she would break the habit of finger nail chewing right away.</li>
            <li> meaning right before eating.  </li>
            <li> Right after that, he started sucking it again.  </li>
            <li> I bought Mavala, put it on her fingers and toes, and she goes right on biting, even 2 minutes after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> It works right from the get go.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am looking for a nail-biting-deterrent polish.  </li>
            <li> yeah, it works, and maybe if purchased for children who need a stronger deterrent, it&#x27;s the right product.</li>
            <li> and she stopped sucking them right</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m bound to notice it being right there.</li>
            <li> her eyebrows furrowed and the thumb popped right out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> I checked and he was right.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;- you&#x27;re reading that right.</li>
            <li> It did not work right away</li>
            <li> Washed right off hours after application but didn&#x27;t detour my son at all from nail biting or nose</li>
            <li> Yes, you guessed right.</li>
            <li> If you look at the photo on the right</li>
            <li> (my son sucked right over it)</li>
            <li> I ordered it, it was shipped out right away.  </li>
            <li> My husband put it on him right before dinner time.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was the right time for me, but this product must receive some of the credit for my nails growing out and me stopping my entrenched habit.</li>
            <li> They are right</li>
            <li> (right when she turned 3).  </li>
            <li> I purchased it on Amazon right there in his office.  </li>
            <li> There were times I thought she was bound to suck the thumb print right off her skin.  </li>
            <li> yes that&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop was recommended to us by friends for their thumb-sucker and they were right.  </li>
            <li> got this product on Monday, right after Easter, and applied this product.</li>
            <li> Yes you read that right.</li>
            <li> This worked right away.</li>
            <li> right?).</li>
            <li> My daughter continued sucking her thumb, right through the appliance placed on the roof of</li>
            <li> and she stops right away.</li>
            <li> n spit and try it right away again.  </li>
            <li> I received it right on time.</li>
            <li> When he was 3 we tried it and he would just cry and lick right through it.  </li>
            <li> Right into their mouth.</li>
            <li> I applied it right to her thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> considering I ordered it right before a weekend</li>
            <li> I put it on her thumb right away.</li>
            <li> This worked right from the start.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t start off right away or after one hand washing.</li>
            <li> Yes, you read that right...</li>
            <li> But, after that she would just chew right through like it wasn&#x27;t even there.</li>
            <li> I got it right on time and started using it.</li>
            <li> and now she can suck right through it.</li>
            <li> I was too scared to continue because they just suck it right off, and Keep right on sucking their fingers.</li>
            <li> I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away.</li>
            <li> and he took his fingers out right away.  </li>
            <li> But then she should pull them out right away and cry.  </li>
            <li> Son stopped RIGHT away sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> This product tastes very bitter (which is a good thing) but the taste doesn&#x27;t go away for hours.</li>
            <li> Both now have normal nails and were clear on how effective this was.  </li>
            <li> I actually am starting to have nice nails for the first time that I can remember.</li>
            <li> Santa brought this product to my son as an early gift with the promise of a big reward on christmas morning if he was successful and committed to changing this behavior.</li>
            <li> Two coats of polish will last for more than one full week before rubbing off.</li>
            <li> Also, since she is 4 and not younger, I think the Mavala was nice because no one else was aware of it</li>
            <li> I was exceptionally surprised and pleased to find that this works exactly as it claims to.</li>
            <li> I was content and completely ignored the fact that I need to re-apply another coat in two days until she started sucking her thumb again, so just make sure to be consistent just like the label states otherwise</li>
            <li> As someone who has been biting his nails for more than 33 years, this product has provided me with more success than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously.  </li>
            <li> We thought for sure this would work when we put it on the first night, because neither one wanted their fingers anywhere near their mouth.  </li>
            <li> This works great for my two little nail biters in the house!</li>
            <li> I still have a full bottle and am certain I will not need it.</li>
            <li> , the taste remained *very* strong for several hours.</li>
            <li> It wasnt a very easy task, daily things like cooking, cleaning, showers, you had to take them off and remember to put them on again.</li>
            <li> Again not the products fault, its doing exactly what it should be doing, but just something to be aware of in advance because it will sneak up on you!</li>
            <li> Started applying this right away, it works great for my 5 year old, as long as I apply it every day!</li>
            <li> it really worked right away!</li>
            <li> I ordered on amazon got in 2 days thanks to my special arrangement with amazon called prime membership.</li>
            <li> This item came highly recommended to me by other experienced parents.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product to get 4 year old to stop sucking her finger!!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly gorgeous since there was so little to work with, but they filed everything smooth, got rid of the ragged cuticles, and applied a very neutral polish.</li>
            <li> This product is really bitter tasting, and is super effective for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s teeth quickly looked noticeably better and moved back in quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Find a pleasant game  or activity the child likes the most to occupy him or her to pass this time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is SUPER strong, and if not carefully used can be transferred to food when eating!</li>
            <li> He has not bitten them once since then, and even he is proud and gets a big smile when I show him he has white on his nails now.  </li>
            <li> I am so proud of her, and I am a firm believer in Mavala Stop!  </li>
            <li> At 2.5 years old the roof of his mouth was becoming deformed and two of his teeth were not coming in.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t really say if the accident he claims was true or he bit his nails at school, but either way I can&#x27;t continue to give this to him if it&#x27;s going to upset his stomach each time.</li>
            <li> I could never mentally make myself stop for more than a couple of days...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how long it stays on my nails.</li>
            <li> Doctors always dismissed my concerns, but the habit only became more and more fixed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week and after that first day, I have rarely put my fingers to my mouth as I don&#x27;t want to taste that taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week and after that first day, I have rarely put my fingers to my mouth as I don&#x27;t want to taste that taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> We tried hot salsa, jalapeno juice, rubbing a fresh garlic clove on her thumb, and another OTC product called THUM.  </li>
            <li> This worked great for us on our 4 year old son, who sucks his thumb mostly at night.  </li>
            <li> cuz my nails are long and nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I bought Mavala thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve had my nail biting habit as long as I can remember (30+ years).</li>
            <li> At first I tried to have my boyfriend and other friends just stop me when they saw me, but they can&#x27;t watch me all the time, and I just got really good at waiting for them to stop looking.</li>
            <li> After the first day we noticed our son trying to suck other fingers when the thumbs didn&#x27;t taste good. ...  </li>
            <li> Working on breaking this life long habit on my own.</li>
            <li> My wife is gorgeous but has chewed her nails down to nubs since we&#x27;ve dated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly makes me a lot more conscious of how often I bite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, we did have to use more on the knuckle of his thumb as well as his nail because he would still suck his thumb occasionally, but the added mavala stop put an end to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> In fact, to see my nails for the first time in 15 years and actually growing and actually looking healthy like I can do something is amazing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind hard to stay on top of.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for another two weeks to where my nails will be nice and LONG!  </li>
            <li> This product is the best I have come accross, although I had to apply it daily, not every other day!!  </li>
            <li> Reapplying first thing in the morning, and possibly right before bed, should be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pure motivation to break the habit!</li>
            <li> This certainly does it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very bitter and lasts a couple of days before needing re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re simply amazed how effective Mavala Stop is and give it an enthusiastic \\&quot;thumbs up!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter finally has good looking nails again.</li>
            <li> An easy move, just paint the thumbnail once a week with the clear polish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala Stop is easy to use: paint on thumb as you would nail polish, dries clear within seconds.</li>
            <li> Luckily she didn&#x27;t eat much finger foods because it does linger.  </li>
            <li> , it sounded far too easy.</li>
            <li> After few more reminders and encouragements, she was able to forget about thumb sucking within a week.</li>
            <li> Be careful of eating finger foods,  the bitter and will ruin the best foods.  </li>
            <li> This has made me far more capable in terms of trying to take these OCD habits by the horns and work them out.</li>
            <li> My dentist strongly recommended this to me for my daughter at about 4-5 years old-</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, my 6 year old son has been sucking his thumb since he was 3 months old.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve had more success than she has but only because I know when it needs to be reapplied.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son is doing much better with biting his nails and it&#x27;s all thanks to Mavala..</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been reapplying every few days just to be sure she doesn&#x27;t start up again, but our results have been fantastic!</li>
            <li> A quick swipe on the whole nail for these two kids did the trick.  </li>
            <li> So far a huge success.</li>
            <li> It might be a tad bit strong for young children.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old  grandson had a fair amount of upheaval in his short life.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well, and it dries in minutes and is clear, so men (like me) can use it and not be worried :p</li>
            <li> My 3 year old stopped thumb sucking very quickly.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is effective, however it was unexpected to find it looks like glossy, clear fingernail polish when applied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were a few downsides to applying polish to my nails, the most notable being the shine and smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  and read great things about this product and have tried many others, which have failed.</li>
            <li> My daughter did not love this option but it worked very effectively.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this product is that the taste of it is so overwhelming, even if you consciously want to bite your nails, the effects of the product are not worth the satisfaction of biting.</li>
            <li> My little girl is 7 years old and still loved that thumb!  </li>
            <li> Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t try to stop a child from sucking their thumb but his thumb sucking was causing significant speech and dental problems.  </li>
            <li> I used Mavala Stop on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s thumb and she finally quit sucking her thumb for good since the first application.  </li>
            <li> The reason it didn&#x27;t completely work is it was so strong when you first put it on, you can taste it on everything you eat (finger foods).  </li>
            <li> We got the product very quickly, and so far it has really helped!</li>
            <li> The delivery was very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li> Very much like nail polish, painted it over the entirety of her thumb.</li>
            <li> It also arrived in a timely manner, which I very much appreciate.</li>
            <li> I used it daily for a week and now 3 weeks later I have nails that are very nice looking.  </li>
            <li> I still put the Mavala on ever other day or so (after baths) because the dentist said it takes a good six months to know that you have really kicked the habit because stress, holidays, etc can cause relapse</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews regarding this product and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> We laughed a little because he would think about putting his thumb in his mouth but then shake his head and scream at his thumb.</li>
            <li> liquid is very potent so make sure to follow the directions and only use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would caution people that it is strong so less is more.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old had a HUGE problem sucking her index finger.</li>
            <li> Really not knowing what I would find I searched nail bitting on Amazon and found this product and the reviews were amazing</li>
            <li> It is, quite simply, the most vile flavor I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth before.  </li>
            <li> The first is that it relies upon user compliance with the application regimen.  </li>
            <li> The first is that it relies upon user compliance with the application regimen.  </li>
            <li> This works very well!  </li>
            <li> From the first time i put some mavala stop on her paci, she spit it out and didnt want it again.  </li>
            <li> She tried one more time later that day but smae reaction.  </li>
            <li> It worked the first day as my son was into trying to stop sucking his fingers</li>
            <li> In the first week, she had a day or two that she would say she forgot and put here finger in her mouth, but the Mavala reminded her to stop...</li>
            <li> and we went through the chart 2 times ( double stars on each block) just to be sure there was no bcaksliding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try reminding them they are big boy or girl and do not need their thumb, rewarding them with a sticker and take away the sticker when they do suck thier thumb, or time out.</li>
            <li> that i start to become aware whenever i try to bite it.</li>
            <li> I love that it is applied ONLY ONCE every two days.</li>
            <li> My Daughter hasn&#x27;t even tried to suck her thumb after the first day.</li>
            <li> I bought the Mavala Stop, and at first my son fought me on using it.</li>
            <li> I encouraged only fork and spoon use for the week we were using it the most.  </li>
            <li> After the first week, he had a couple relapses, and we just told him to tell us if he was getting the urge to bite</li>
            <li> I had maybe 6-10 instances where I tried to bite my nails for the first 1-4 days.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review more than a year after buying the product and she has never gone back.  </li>
            <li> She was whinning the first day a couple of times, thne</li>
            <li> You have to apply it pretty consistently ever 2-3 days because it does wash</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say, unless you&#x27;re really ready for them to stop sucking their thumb then don&#x27;t try it!</li>
            <li> He stopped biting his nails after the first time we used it.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product on line and thought we would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time she put her hands in her mouth</li>
            <li> first I was a bit hesitant bec.</li>
            <li> It really, really works!</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is Ethyl Acetate, and another ingredient is Isopropyl Alcohol.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Mavala Stop on her</li>
            <li> so she was aware of what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I made her aware of how it would taste.  </li>
            <li> of the next week she had figured out a way to suck her thumb without it touching her tongue.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptic at first, but with this it took just 1 week for my 5-year-old to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The first time we used Mavala Stop</li>
            <li> This product was inexpensive (compared to thumb guards) and seemed to work from the first application.  </li>
            <li> and I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks now since I first started putting this on, and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails</li>
            <li> I tried everything from garlic, to hot sauce, rubbing aloe vera plant on thumb, to the THUM nail polish (sold at drug stores)</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t want to quit and cried the first night with the Mavala on.</li>
            <li> If you need to take it off use nail polish remover but its pretty stubborn</li>
            <li> My husband and I both painted it on our thumbs first</li>
            <li> He said he didn&#x27;t think it would work and didn&#x27;t want to use it again because of the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; nail polish look ;)</li>
            <li> I thought it was really important that my 3 year old son stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is a useful tool when the child is ready.</li>
            <li> I tried Thum first</li>
            <li> At first, she didn&#x27;t want it, but then she said she wanted to stop sucking her thumb and wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the easiest night, but the next day and night things were so much better.  </li>
            <li> Finally, about a year ago, I bought this product, and I was finally able to stop.  </li>
            <li> Also, at the first sign of relapse, use the polish again.</li>
            <li> I was sometimes able to quit for a couple of weeks, but I always feel back into the habit.</li>
            <li> He has really opened up without that thumb in his mouth all the time!  </li>
            <li> He chats constantly and seems to enjoy his newfound thumb-freedom!  </li>
            <li> but the first time she put her thumb in her mouth she started to gag</li>
            <li> It actually made him suck his thumb more because it made him focused on it.</li>
            <li> He is actually doing better with this approach.</li>
            <li> Each of them got it in their mouth a couple of times the first day.</li>
            <li> After that first day she did not suck her thumb again.</li>
            <li> I do think you have to be consistent about putting it on their fingers.</li>
            <li> My five year old has stopped sucking his thumb completely and now we are working on all his nails and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> they are gonna start to taste funny.</li>
            <li> She would bite her nails and say mommy my nails taste funny and run to get her drink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the first time I applied the stuff to his thumb, he&#x27;s never sucked it again.</li>
            <li> effective to stop nail biting as it leaves bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Also for the first week we had a cup of kool-aid for her to drink if she did taste it.</li>
            <li> just make her aware of sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> This was the first remedy</li>
            <li> He isn&#x27;t aware of even doing it.</li>
            <li> Mavala has made him aware when he is sticking his tongue upward.</li>
            <li> Mavala has made him aware when he is sticking his tongue upward.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> My daughter wouldn&#x27;t dare to bite her nails again after the first application.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have counted over five kids whose parents have tried it with an absolute 100% success rate</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazingly, this stuff works and works exactly the way it is described.</li>
            <li> I would put my fingers to my mouth without thinking about it when I was stressed for the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It really work if you stick to it!</li>
            <li> i have nails for the first time and its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He may, probably, needs to be hypnotized to stop chewing his big headed fingers...  :)</li>
            <li> and we have tried many different methods to stop her habit.</li>
            <li> She stop sucking from the first day and until now.</li>
            <li> Well on the first day it worked wonders, she wouldn&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li> The whole painting your nails thing is worth it though.  </li>
            <li> I am applying it consistently for around 90 days because that is the amount of time I have heard that is required for breaking habits.</li>
            <li> It will surely be the last time they dine with YOU.</li>
            <li> at first they said no cuz nothing worked before but</li>
            <li> Thumb&amp;#34; thumb guard first</li>
            <li> Mavala was recommended by a friend and we were willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> We applied it for 2 weeks, but my child did not suck her thumb after the first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 20 years and this product really helps!</li>
            <li> After the first couple of nights.  </li>
            <li> Put it on her thumb first thing in the morning and by bed time she was done and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb</li>
            <li> It worked with the first use.  </li>
            <li> I used this product to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb and after the first use, she has never sucked her thumb since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to apply more liberally next time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it worked the first night.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Mavala Stop on Amazon and the first time I applied it</li>
            <li> It was a challenge the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Pretty embarrassing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three-tenths of an ounce doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but it&#x27;s more than enough to cure everyone in your extended family, as well as everyone on your block for that matter.</li>
            <li> and we tried many different behavior modifications.  </li>
            <li> and HE decided he was ready to stop, the product cinched the deal!  </li>
            <li> I put it on Wednesday afternoon for the first time.</li>
            <li> Long-time Amazon buyer, first Amazon review!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For sure put it on daily or every 2 days.</li>
            <li> He whined the first 2 days about it</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really and truly works!</li>
            <li> Had this issue for many years starting from the age of three.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> After the first night she has not even attempted to stick her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> On day 3 of my 2.5 year old being thumb sucking free.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the CVS product that looks similar.</li>
            <li> won the first bday gift from me.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: no need to apply, the liquid&#x27;s effect still continued.</li>
            <li> First four days she would wake up or start to go to sleep with the taste in her mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now consciously aware of when i put my fingers in my mouth</li>
            <li> My husband and I cannot believe how fast this product worked for our child!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop was recommended by my sister-in-law and it worked the first night!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m optimistic that we can stop using it altogether pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I first did it in his sleep</li>
            <li> It was interesting to see him go to stick his fingers in his mouth out of habit, stop, look at them and say \\&quot;Gross</li>
            <li> I know first hand the difficulties</li>
            <li> I know first hand the difficulties</li>
            <li> Even the first night, the taste woke the girls up</li>
            <li> I put it on while she was sleeping and the first time she tried to put her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li> It worked for the first two weeks but after that she got used to the taste.</li>
            <li> Really like how it applies like a polish and stays on for a couple of days!</li>
            <li> really does stay on!).</li>
            <li> On first night she tried to suck her fingers</li>
            <li> The first time she</li>
            <li> I wish I had done this first, it would have saved alot of tears and money.  </li>
            <li> You have to stay consistent and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a taste first and it reminded me of what finger nail polish would taste like</li>
            <li> The first night, he stuck his fingers in his mouth and cried for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what we needed to jump start</li>
            <li> At first this product worked well</li>
            <li> so she went back to thumb-sucking and is now a more obsessive thumb-sucker then before we used the product.</li>
            <li> I tried the polish on my thumbnail first, just to test it.</li>
            <li> I would also paint my nails pretty colors, get acrylics, etc..</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> He attempted to put his thumb in his mouth a couple of times the first day we applied the product.</li>
            <li> Its been ten days, we will continue with the product for couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff absolutely works!</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to work.</li>
            <li> ;-)ps from EATING anything at all that requires using your fingers to assemble or eat it</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Do make sure you don&#x27;t get any on your fingers while applying and use only the tiniest bit bc</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> first off, i had been biting my nails for 3-4 years.  </li>
            <li> First i wanted to see what it tasted like</li>
            <li> Before we got married we tried this product to see if he would stop and let his nails grow out for all the pictures and what not, it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am sure she will never go back to that habit.</li>
            <li> I grew my nails out for the first time I can remember.</li>
            <li> Our first attempt was the night shirt with the built in gloves.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t even acted like he wants to suck his thumb!</li>
            <li> First opinion of this product is...smells like nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> After the first week, my 7-year was still sucking his thumb and being stubborn.  </li>
            <li> The first day I put it on my daughter</li>
            <li> I prepared her for Mavala first.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I thought until she brought me the bottle an hour later and wanted more put on her fingers</li>
            <li> stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Our orthodontist told us to try this first before we had a habit device put in our daughters mouth.</li>
            <li> Stop a try first</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time he sucked his thumb with this product</li>
            <li> The first time we applied the \\&quot;solution\\&quot; it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> He is not complaining about the taste on his food, too much, and he is adjusting well!</li>
            <li> promising!</li>
            <li> The price is worth it as it works very well.</li>
            <li> The price is worth it as it works very well.</li>
            <li> To save money, we decided to try Mavala Stop first.  </li>
            <li> We tried many different ways and started to loss hope until we found this product.</li>
            <li> The first time we put it on her fingers, she did not even want to smell them, let alone sucking them.</li>
            <li> works pretty well.</li>
            <li> He objected and cried, and the first day he didn&#x27;t bite his fingernails.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason I&#x27;m finally able to tackle this is that I&#x27;m not only using this product to deter me</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day - and become rather aware when the taste is fading and make note to keep coating it on.</li>
            <li> I was at first going to purchase a product called \\&quot;thumb guard\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The first day I put the MAVALA stop on his thumbs and fingers.  </li>
            <li> cons to be aware of:&lt;br</li>
            <li> First day</li>
            <li> multiple times :)</li>
            <li> This product worked for the first week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this exactly 3 times since I first bit into my nails, and regretted it immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (call me weak-willed, but when I first bit them I needed to get rid of that taste</li>
            <li> It worked the first two days</li>
            <li> The first time she got a taste of it, she was like..\\&quot;its</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a life-long nail chewer, a nervous habit I&#x27;ve tried to stop many times over the last fifty years.  </li>
            <li> Within a day my son had stopped sucking his thumb; however, you should also be aware that it did make him vomit twice.  </li>
            <li> It worked the first day.</li>
            <li> Super-fast shipping too - thanks!</li>
            <li> But she really has no desire to suck her thumb!  </li>
            <li> To fix that make sure you regularly reapply.</li>
            <li> First time I applied it and she tasted it, she threw her thumb out</li>
            <li> I tried it myself first</li>
            <li> so first of all you must have the resolve to stop.</li>
            <li> try applying it earlier in the day, before you go to work/school/places where you tend to bite your nails the most.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, my mom tried it and was trying everything to get the taste out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review</li>
            <li> About four finger nails had been growing pretty well</li>
            <li> My daughter stopped sucking her thumb after the first application.</li>
            <li> I remember the first bottle I ever bought</li>
            <li> At first, we put mittens on him at night, but now he doesn&#x27;t even need that.</li>
            <li> she had to eat sandwiches with a fork ;)</li>
            <li> The first night that she wore it she woke me up and said every time she falls asleep, she puts her thumb in her mouth and the taste wakes her up.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff has me seeing the whites of my nails for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I try it myself first</li>
            <li> The first time my son used it, he did throw up, but it worked to stop his thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, I never saw her suck her thumb again!  </li>
            <li> I said &#x27;sure&#x27; without making a big deal of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as it says it does.  </li>
            <li> WORKED FAST!</li>
            <li> After the first application, she No longer sucked her thumb.</li>
            <li> The first Mavala we had gotten from the dentist</li>
            <li> It works in the first week.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product not quiet sure it would work.</li>
            <li> He did not like the taste at all but the first week I had caught him sucking his thumb at night (with the stuff).</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> My daughter started sucking her thumb in our first sonogram picture and has not stopped since</li>
            <li> We had been working on &amp;#34;reminding&amp;#34; (over and over and over again), but once he lost his first baby tooth, we knew it was time to step in to break the habit.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> works well and will make you aware of how often your fingers go in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I only paint more on about every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I consistently used it for about 2 months..</li>
            <li> we started using the product on February 10th in the first couple days</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t spicy hot</li>
            <li> The first time she picked her lips</li>
            <li> the taste did last more than a day on your skin.  </li>
            <li> We tried the finger guard first, I had the wrist wrap</li>
            <li> The most obvious tip I can offer is to eat finger foods with a fork.</li>
            <li> Really?!</li>
            <li> means you now fully realize when your doing it which was the first step of the battle.  </li>
            <li> I even got to paint them pretty for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> She likes my pretty nails.</li>
            <li> means you now fully realize when your doing it which was the first step of the battle.  </li>
            <li> I even got to paint them pretty for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> my son stopped sucking his thumb after first use after day one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 now and finally was able to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Being the parent I am I tried it first on my nail</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala has done a stellar job of making me stop biting my nail.</li>
            <li> (For us it is more than enough to deter my daughter)     </li>
            <li> I wished that I would have read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb in two weeks since I first used the product</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend that parents give it a try because there is a 50/50 chance that it will work from my experience.:)</li>
            <li> I HAD a 17-month-old thumbsucker who was so attached to her thumb that her top teeth were starting to buck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Frustrated, I finally remembered we had an almost-full bottle of Mavala Stop and wondered if it would be safe to use on a cat.  </li>
            <li> I checked every ingredient first to ensure there was nothing that could be toxic to kitty (there wasn&#x27;t) and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Within a week of using this I&#x27;m proud to say she no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> The first night I put it on her nails was the end of her thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> Looked like it worked during the first 2 days</li>
            <li> You have to be vigilant about applying it consistently</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months and surprisingly, his baby teeth looks straight!</li>
            <li> The bottle was most likely sealed but not the box.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what he needed because nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> Now almost a month later I don&#x27;t even have to apply any more</li>
            <li> Just make sure to put it only on your nails and not on the tip of your fingers also or else</li>
            <li> /&gt;First we tried the generic &amp;#34;no more thumbs&amp;#34; type from CVS.</li>
            <li> So it does exactly what I&#x27;d hoped it would ....</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have virtually zero desire to bite, and haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since the first week of January.</li>
            <li> After the first shock when she put her thumb in her mouth, she only did it out of habit 2-3 more times.  </li>
            <li> kind of a bitter &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; taste.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells exactly like finger nail polish and it is applied just like finger nail polish.</li>
            <li> It worked the first day.  </li>
            <li> For the first time ever I get to trim my kids nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We put it on at night with a &amp;#34;thumb sucker&amp;#34; the first week</li>
            <li> I applied it and at first she didn&#x27;t like the taste.  </li>
            <li> We talked about the importance of stopping the thumb sucking and he was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I put the Mavala on his thumb and the first time he tried sucking his thumb he realized the consequences.  </li>
            <li> I did a 3rd application just to be sure</li>
            <li> and it tastes like battery acid, which is exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Four weeks ago I bought this stuff and applied the first coat.  </li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> i no longer bite my nails its pretty SWAGGED OUT</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Make sure you only put it on the nail or you food will taste like it.</li>
            <li> Worked almost the first night (after one night of him tasting it and waking up screaming when he realize he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb again).</li>
            <li> First week I put it on every night.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my nail first</li>
            <li> Works pretty well except whatever food you touch</li>
            <li> I will say it did cause her to gag and throw up the first 3-4 times she tried it.  </li>
            <li> It has a heinous chemical taste, which is exactly what it should have.</li>
            <li> and you had to buy additional straps to keep the covers on if you needed more than what was sent initially.  </li>
            <li> I covered just the top third of the nail.  </li>
            <li> Worked for about the first minute</li>
            <li> If you still want to try this product, test it out on yourself first.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 almost 5 and up until her first dentist appointment (about a month ago)</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and if it didn&#x27;t work, I was willing to take it as a loss.  </li>
            <li> Now for the first time I am growing nails.  </li>
            <li> First night we put it on</li>
            <li> Finally ordered this, and we are so glad.</li>
            <li> And yes, it can get on food that she touches, but she seems to cope with that pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been nail-biting since the first grade, and now I&#x27;m in college....</li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> Ok so I brought this for one of my 4 y-old twin boy who eats his finger and toes nail &#x27;till the skin is red and raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> got it 2 weeks now, the first time I painted his finger and toes nails with it (which he let me do with no wiggling) he smelled it and says &#x27;yakky&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Works for like first 2 try and after that it has no affects on the child.</li>
            <li> I was interested in some of the gadgets a child wears on the thumb, but thought I&#x27;d give this cheaper product a try first.  </li>
            <li> I put it on every night before bed for the first week and</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when my daughter was two and had a nail chewing problem.</li>
            <li> The first week I had to keep brushing my teeth to get the taste out</li>
            <li> Ever since the first day I put it on my nails</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on</li>
            <li> My daughter has tried many products to stop biting her nails in addition to various rewards systems.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> WIth Mavala she instantly was able to break the thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> We put the product on for the first time and she put her thumb in her mouth a couple of times and that&#x27;s all it took.</li>
            <li> My daughter woke up couple times the first two nights and we gave her water to wash her mouth.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I put it on and the first time I started biting ny nails</li>
            <li> and I would immediately become aware of what I was doing and stop.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well in stopping my daughter&#x27;s thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> thanks I like it!)  </li>
            <li> Worked the first day, after that it washes off and finger sucking starts again.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> First night I painted his thumb nail, he attempted 3 times to suck..</li>
            <li> This product really WORKS!</li>
            <li> without getting a bit of that bitter taste, which is kind of unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked the first day.</li>
            <li> I once tried Tabasco on my first kid&#x27;s thumbs to get him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t reached that time period yet, but are hopeful that once they do the product will not be necessary any more.  </li>
            <li> , she made a face and continued sucking her fingers, but two days later I applied to finger nails and around the top of her finger tips</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> First day it was about every 20 minutes he ran for the bathroom to rinse out his mouth...</li>
            <li> Really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First thing we tried was \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; bought at drugstore...</li>
            <li> It might be a better product for a younger child who doesn&#x27;t think to rub it off.</li>
            <li> It really worked!  </li>
            <li> I kept applying it for 3-4 days just to make sure that the habit doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> She put her thumb in her mouth one time after the first application, and never again.</li>
            <li> Yup , he gagged first time he sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li> I lie to you not, after the first application, he immediately stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> When he first got it he put his thumb in his mouth and then immediately ran to the bathroom, started rinsing his mouth with water, then started brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first time she tasted it, she learned her lesson.</li>
            <li> It worked at first, and then he didn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> (most definitely the problem).</li>
            <li> We first tried Thum and he just sucked his fingers anyways.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even had to reapply it after the first week.</li>
            <li> My first order for this was in July 2014 and</li>
            <li> the first 2 months</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic meal butter for my entire life, and have managed stop many times for months at a time.</li>
            <li> We first applied before nap time, both thumbs.</li>
            <li> Same at night probably more complaining.  </li>
            <li> Next day was better with some complaining.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t blame the seller for us either losing it or, more likely, my daughter disposing of it.</li>
            <li> This works for me every time, but you have to be willing to quit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 hours after the first application, she was eating some Cheetos and stuck a finger in her mouth to get the cheese off.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> He plays more and is actually talking better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> first night I tried it, I guess I stirred while I was sleeping and bit my thumbnail or something (that&#x27;s a thing,</li>
            <li> The product broke him of his habit of wanting to bite by making him aware of the times he put his fingers to his mouth.</li>
            <li> However it got me a couple times that first day when I licked my fingers while preparing dinner, so becareful and encourge the use of silverware while using.</li>
            <li> HAHA!</li>
            <li> It broke her of the habit so fast, one taste and that was it!</li>
            <li> In the first nights he was awaking every time he put the thumb in the mouth complaining the taste.</li>
            <li> After an hour or so, she came to me telling me her tongue felt funny.</li>
            <li> If she made it for one whole week, without sucking her thumb, she would get to pick out a toy!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> I have rated this a five star because it is my first day</li>
            <li> We tried this and within the first week, it had dramatically stopped.</li>
            <li> From the first night we put the product on her thumb</li>
            <li> (I knew people who had had success with each one), and Mavala was much cheaper</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it first.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s stopped her somewhat, and she is aware that when I put it on she shouldn&#x27;t put her thumbs in her mouth</li>
            <li> She is a nail and skin biter and now after 3 weeks she is feeling great about her hands we apply at least 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> At first it did work at helping my daughter stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Need to be consistent.</li>
            <li> I tried everything and when I finally came across this Mavala Stop, it was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I have tried every nail biting polish, hot sauce, etc on the market and STILL bit my nails.</li>
            <li> Now he&#x27;s losing his first tooth, the dentist told him he should stop too.</li>
            <li> This product is working very well!  </li>
            <li> And I think emotionally it was better for her.</li>
            <li> They both stopped their habits within 2-3 days and now, I&#x27;m applying it for a second week, just making sure it sticks.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop really works!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to use it on my daughter until I had tested/tasted it first.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well, the problem is you can&#x27;t eat ANYTHING with your hands.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have tried this first, but I thought it was too pricey.  </li>
            <li> , It worked in the first try.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son the first 3 weeks he was bitting his nail but after that the taste was nothing to him</li>
            <li> No matter how many times a day I paint her fingers now they are back to being in there all the time.  </li>
            <li> because my daughters stopped sucking their thumbs after the first application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 2 months since we first used it</li>
            <li> It really worked!</li>
            <li> I put this on for the first time about 5 days ago</li>
            <li> She told me it tasted funny</li>
            <li> It worked the first time he tried to suck on them after the product was applied.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what we needed to get our kids over the hurdle.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different ways to stop, including hypnosis.  </li>
            <li> Worked for the first week but no longer works.  </li>
            <li> Overall I love it!&lt;br /&gt;-bree</li>
            <li> My husband and I were absolutely amazed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been married to my husband for over 20 years and he has always chewed his nails.  </li>
            <li> I may resort to tabasco sauce or something more drastic because my kid obviously doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> One thing you should be aware of is that after you apply this, if the child eats finger foods they could get some of the taste co-mingling with the food.  </li>
            <li> I gave some of it to a friend, and her daughter was also able to stop over a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> the first time we used Mavala and that was the end of it.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than braces!</li>
            <li> ; as we called it worked so fast!  </li>
            <li> Helps with exactly what it said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting off my fingernails for several decades now, and never been able to kick the habit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It traumatized him the first night.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this.  :)</li>
            <li> Better than alternative of future dental problems.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works!</li>
            <li> we first put it on, she seemed to accidentally get it on everything - her food, her face, her lips - and</li>
            <li> The first time he forgot it was on, and his thumb went in-</li>
            <li> My 2 year stopped sucking her thumbs after applying it the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first day I saw her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li> This helps minimize accidently mis-haps yet is still very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND CONTINUING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS TO GET A LASTING CESSATION.</li>
            <li> I was even able to clip his nails last night.  </li>
            <li> he never asked why his thumb had a funny taste.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I kept it was because I plan on having more kids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve caught several colds over the years because of all the germs I transferred to my mouth from my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used nail clippers on my fingernails for the first time ever today.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe it worked so well for our son, but I&#x27;m glad it was so simple.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s VERY shiny with mirror-like gloss!</li>
            <li> I ended up soaking in hot water, and that did the trick.</li>
            <li> But this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I eventually ordered another bottle and am trying to be consistent with it</li>
            <li> first tried the Thum brand liquid polish that tastes like hot peppers.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> We tried absolutely everything for my daughter&#x27;s thumb-sucking habit and nothing worked...until Mavala!  </li>
            <li> He vomited the first time he placed his thumb in his mouth, and didn&#x27;t try again until the morning when, out of habit, he did it again.</li>
            <li> fingers were in constant pain because I never let the nails grow to a healthy length.</li>
            <li> Now we are using band aids around top of her thumbs &amp; only at night.</li>
            <li> She stopped sucking her thumb on the first day and hasn&#x27;t done it for a month now.</li>
            <li> It worked the first time I applied, but he didn&#x27;t nap that day</li>
            <li> The next day we painted her nails all pretty again and used the Mavala Stop as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it would last more than two days, though.</li>
            <li> In my experience, we just need to be consistent and use it nightly.</li>
            <li> It worked first time we put it on.</li>
            <li> I tried everything OTC and even hot sauces</li>
            <li> Make sure you only put in on the nails.  </li>
            <li> he has stopped biting his nails after the first use.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, she woke up crying, saying her thumb didn&#x27;t taste good, almost threw up...</li>
            <li> The first night she was up a couple times to get a drink to take the taste away.  </li>
            <li> (Try it out on yourself first...</li>
            <li> The first time I put my fingernail in my mouth after I did this I immediately used another fingernail to try and scratch the taste off of my tongue.</li>
            <li> note of warning, if you like to lick your fingers after eating popcorn or chips, you will not be able to for the entire duration of this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> The first time she put her finger in her mouth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m biting my nails until I&#x27;ve already taken the first bite, then I can&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth for an hour.</li>
            <li> Only had to do it a couple more times.</li>
            <li> Its a great deterrent for my thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> The first time we used this on my daughter, it was 2 weeks of no thumb sucking before it started to wear off and had to be reapplied.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> her thumb nail the first night.  </li>
            <li> My daughter just went to her first dental appointment and the doctor advised she stop sucking hey thumb immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son first off</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on his thumbs was before his nap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first thing we noticed about the product we received was that it looked and smelled like acetone or nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do - keep thumbs and fingers out of the mouth.  </li>
            <li> but she willingly lets us put on her \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; every night after bath.  </li>
            <li> This is also the first Amazon review I have ever written as I would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> is to be aware with finger foods or what your nails brush up</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied it 3 days later when he was sleeping so he wouldn&#x27;t know and might do it one more time</li>
            <li> The ingredients in Mavala are most likely harmful to children.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and it ended up being so simple!</li>
            <li> I actually thought it was the cutest thing to see, just adorable..</li>
            <li> first tried just putting a band aid on it-</li>
            <li> the first 3 applications-spaced putting it on every 2 days-</li>
            <li> first time I put it on, I told him why I put it on and that it tastes</li>
            <li> Since any taste of that flavor pretty much transfers if they are eating a finger food!</li>
            <li> She lapsed into putting the finger in her mouth a couple more times over the next couple of days.</li>
            <li> I couldnt believe she stop sucking her finger the first day of the application.</li>
            <li> I was heartened by the reviews, which hilariously ranged from 0 to 5 stars for the exact same reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Entire batches of meals were ruined by merely touching their component ingredients.</li>
            <li> The urge to rip them to shreds with my teeth has passed, though I am confident that if it should return, I can simply reapply this product and defeat this foul habit.</li>
            <li> Put it on again 2 nights after the first night.</li>
            <li> i tried so many different items off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re back for more.</li>
            <li> i paint her nails with this, lets say she doesn&#x27;t think it is as funny as I do.</li>
            <li> I did consider doing this with my six year old if she threw a fit during the re-appication process.  </li>
            <li> I did consider doing this with my six year old if she threw a fit during the re-appication process.  </li>
            <li> The product works better than what we found in our local stores.</li>
            <li> The key is to make sure that you do not reach that point.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am giving this product five stars because it DEFINITELY works!</li>
            <li> After the first application she realized that there was no way to get it off.</li>
            <li> I am able to eat burgers and french fries without getting the taste in my mouth at all.</li>
            <li> We first bought the product, Thum, and that did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried painting my nails, thinking if they look pretty, I won&#x27;t bite them, and that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The last 6 months while sucking her thumb, she would pick at the top of her nose and face causing scarring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first week I would would bite but stop because of the taste reminding me not to.</li>
            <li> I did reapply every 2 days for the first 10 days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen her put her thumb in her mouth since the first day</li>
            <li> So lets hope this last and the thumb sucking ends :)</li>
            <li> The first day I painted it on, my son tried to suck his thumb...</li>
            <li> The first night I put this on her thumbs</li>
            <li> I am still pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> I used Mavala Stop on her and the first couple times she tried sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> biting his nails from the first application.</li>
            <li> but it really it working!</li>
            <li> My purchase of this item was fulfilled by Safe Sellers and I received a completely different product.</li>
            <li> The first day we covered the thumb and fingers nails with the solution.</li>
            <li> We would put this in the day and remove it in the night for the first 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I have chewed mine for 27 years and for the first time in my life, I have nails.</li>
            <li> I stopped biting my nails after a couple of days;)</li>
            <li> I tried it and it worked after the first application.</li>
            <li> I took the polish off first the first time in about 2 weeks yesterday</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would use it on kids without trying it on myself first.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it to my daughter&#x27;s nails she gagged a bit and spit rightaway when she tried to suck her thumbs,  </li>
            <li> I admit, when I first noticed him sucking it again, I licked his thumbnail and ICK</li>
            <li> This is not my first try with this sort of theory.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did go through a four-day period after my first week using the product where I didn&#x27;t apply it at all and promptly bit all my nails once the polish wore off.</li>
            <li> Once I put this on his nails for the first time, he about gagged when he bit his nails.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, without realizing it I had gotten some on my own hand and</li>
            <li> I applied this as directed and the first time my son put his fingers in his mouth he started to vomit.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I now have pretty nails, so thank you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> I gave my son a choice between using this or soaking his fingers in hot sauce.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Even though we&#x27;ve continued putting it on her nails for about two weeks, after the first time she tasted it, she never again put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Remember the first day, the child may be aggravated for not doing the habit.</li>
            <li> Obviously this tactic prob won&#x27;t work for boys. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been nail biting for a decade and this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> she is now growing nails out for the first time.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give anything a try to get her to stop.  </li>
            <li> But from the first application I knew this stuff was the ticket.</li>
            <li> But when it is applied it absolutely does its purpose!  </li>
            <li> Verbal warnings, hot sauce, nothing else worked.</li>
            <li> He DID mind me putting hot sauce on his hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> applied it first day</li>
            <li> and really works!</li>
            <li> and I kissed the top of her head shortly thereafter- and got a dose of the bitterness!</li>
            <li> in hot water they wash off.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this on my son, it worked.</li>
            <li> I tested it on myself first.</li>
            <li> The first day I painted just the thumb he sucked</li>
            <li> After 55-yrs of nail biting, I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since the first application almost a month ago--</li>
            <li> The first night we were up all night getting drinks because she forgot to not put her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> The second night was much better.</li>
            <li> She stopped sucking her fingers after the first coat.</li>
            <li> Worked for the first 3 to 4 applications...</li>
            <li> I did not think it would work this fast!</li>
            <li> It does come off with multiple hand washing, which more savvy kids will catch on to.  </li>
            <li> I figured after the first couple of times he put his fingers in his mouth, he would stop.</li>
            <li> He would grimace and start asking for water or juice at first.</li>
            <li> The first time we put it on</li>
            <li> you are an avid nail biter, you might just ignore the revolting taste and chew on your nails anyway.  </li>
            <li> I tried to stop on many occasions but would inevitably \\&quot;relapse\\&quot; within a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, but I also tried rubbing hot peppers on her nails and that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> We dipped her hand in hot sauce and vinegar in hopes she would stop sucking her thumb, not happening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter was 2 when we used this product on her thumbs to avoid her avid thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> so I was worried it would not work, well it absolutely did!</li>
            <li> it really did for us!</li>
            <li> from first day i apply on her nails.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it smelled like nail polish.</li>
            <li> this stuff does exactly as it claims.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> and then took a lick, at first nothing at all</li>
            <li> Again not the products fault, its doing exactly what it should be doing, but just something to be aware of in advance because it will sneak up on you!ing</li>
            <li> He did throw up from the first time he tasted it after trying to bite his nail.</li>
            <li> honestly think he likes the bitter</li>
            <li> I put it on him in the mornings when he first woke up</li>
            <li> I think he was sucking out of habit at night the first night.</li>
            <li> My daughter who has been sucking her thumb since birth now has no desire whatsoever (after the first night I applied Mavala) to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> I have bitten them once or twice because I forgot to apply the product, but when its on, you are immediately aware of what you are doing when a finger goes into your mouth.</li>
            <li> This product has absolutely un-trained my brain to bite my fingernails!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Mavala STOP!</li>
            <li> Enough for them to grow some and the edges to be rounded, keeping me from biting and picking some more.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ok, still 5/5, because I was only looking for the effectiveness, and boy did it work well.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids stopped with the first application.</li>
            <li> This worked at first</li>
            <li> but you may have to apply it everyday for good results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been helping me a lot, but it does bother me that finger foods are pretty much ruined for me right now.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> AND AS A BONUS, OUR 9 YEAR OLD STOPPED BITING HIS NAILS!!!!</li>
            <li> She was cranky for a few days, but I worked great,  after using so many other methods and failing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to end finger sucking right</li>
            <li> Right now I am going on about 2 weeks straight of nail growth.</li>
            <li> Right now I am trying willpower because I know that Mavala Stop will be too much of a problem when it comes to flossing.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about various products and read many positive ones about this product.</li>
            <li> At that point, I dipped a medical grade swab into the Mavala Stop container, wiped off the excess on the bottle&#x27;s edge, and then very, very lightly and gently ROLLED the swab along the incision--</li>
            <li> Sure enough, in it went and a quick exit it made followed by a loud, &amp;#34;BLEEEEECCCHHHHHHHHH!</li>
            <li> After a year, her thumb is normal, the nail is normal, and the dentist said her teeth are fine now too.  </li>
            <li> If he accidently put his thumb in his mouth he would take a sip and put a tic tac in and go back to sleep :) The orange tic tac&#x27;s  actually made his bedime routine easy as he enjoyed counting out his 4 tiny mints each night</li>
            <li> and we have tried EVERYTHING to get her to stop sucking her finger from hot sauce to positive praise for not doing it</li>
            <li> I put some on my own finger nail because I didn&#x27;t want to expose her to something that I was not willing to do to myself.</li>
            <li> I originally used this product when my son just turned 3yrs old</li>
            <li> I had optomistic hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my daughter&#x27;s nailbiting problem.</li>
            <li> The other products you have to use 2-3 times a day for them to be effective, thus one just once a day.</li>
            <li> I was excited to start using it on my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> my brain has decided it&#x27;s a good idea to take my newly acquired nails and wage war on my other nails...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any one who wants to cure nail biting and or thumb sucking!!</li>
            <li> I tried the product on my own hand, it&#x27;s very bitter.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;d wake up the next morning and come running in so excited because the yucky taste meant her thumbs didn&#x27;t want to be sucked anymore!  </li>
            <li> It is so bad and stays on so good that if he touched my lips with his thumb, I could taste it for a good 15 min.  </li>
            <li> worked great for a few days on my 4 year old&#x27;s fingers - he claimed he was cured and would never suck them again.</li>
            <li> Either way, this is by far the most effective treatment I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re serious about quitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> The taste of Mavala Stop is beyond what I can describe - kind of a cross between sucking batteries and chewing old tin foil.  </li>
            <li> ...their taste buds aren&#x27;t developed enough and it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to buy my own bottle until I knew that it was effective.  </li>
            <li> So I finally bought my own bottle of it for my 5 year old who is a nail biter.  </li>
            <li> FORGET about putting it on a \\&quot;few\\&quot; times a week though, if you really bite your nails often you have to put it on a minimum of once a day but more often if you wash your hands/take multiple showers.</li>
            <li> We could not get my three year old to stop sucking his thumb and it started getting more frequent.</li>
            <li> Finger sucking is ok when the kids are young, but for a 5 year old, it is detrimental to their tooth formation.</li>
            <li> This thing works exactly as advertised and within 4 days, I have pretty much stopped biting my nails.</li>
            <li> For the past three months I kept telling her that pretty soon her thumb will no longer taste good to her.  </li>
            <li> It really does work, you just have to be willing to see your child the first time or two gag for a minute when they get that taste in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> Her teeth are beginning to misalign and she gets colds more frequently because she is putting germs directly into her</li>
            <li> And I have learned how fast your nails actually grow!  :-)  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong and bitter chemical taste that stays with you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super Great product, but only needed a tiny dab and now have a full jar of it left.</li>
            <li> Works great for my nine year old, but didn&#x27;t phase my four year old at all, except for the first time when it leached onto her finger food and her meal tasted bitter.  </li>
            <li> No More Thumb Sucking! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> This product is a little better than the standard cyan pepper kind.</li>
            <li> maybe it is the human body getting used to it or something, but still there is a yuck feeling that it will keep u off but not as strong as the first day...</li>
            <li> It also usually wears off kind of quickly.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the taste first because it had such a strong chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> but otherwise strongly recommend it if you are willing to apply daily.</li>
            <li> But this will quickly make you aware how how often you put your fingers near your mouth</li>
            <li> After receiving rave reviews from friends that swear by this product and the positive feedback on Amazon I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I used it along with positive enforcement of the Berenstein bears book and letting him draw pictures on his fingernails with a nail art pen.</li>
            <li> somewhere I read about products like these, and picked this one off of Amazon based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> We explained to him what it was for, and tried to make it positive- \\&quot;soon</li>
            <li> We tried the product together with positive reinforcement, highlighting that the liquid in her finger is \\&quot;just to remind her not to suck her thumb\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You could count that as a positive though if you are picky about table</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so thankful for everyone who posted positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> We tried everything from thumb splints, bandaids, mittens, bribes of toys, positive reinforcement</li>
            <li> We tried the \\&quot;PC\\&quot; method of offering positive reinforcement and giving her all the benefits for not sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Took one day,&lt;br /&gt;(tried positive reinforcement/rewards for 6 months with no successs)&lt;br /&gt;Prepped our child for its arrival.  </li>
            <li> I see this as a positive because it will help me lose weight.  </li>
            <li> We tried band-aids, gauze tape as well as positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li> Of course, we used a lot of encouragement and positive feedback as well...</li>
            <li> I will keep using it until I am absolutely positive</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried thumb covers, positive encouragement, Thum (pepper)</li>
            <li> For those of you whose children have a problem that mainly just annoys you, then this should knock it right</li>
            <li> Maybe she needs to be older, but it is of no help right now when I need her to stop.</li>
            <li> product may be more suitable for little older kids but not for young toddlers.</li>
            <li> At its best this product helps keep you more conscious of your bad habit.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, my son is very taste sensitive, so he really did not want to suck w/ the Mavala on.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for pretty much my whole 29 year life.  </li>
            <li> He had pretty much stopped during the day but still sucked to go to sleep and at night.</li>
            <li> has also motivated DS 6 to stop his thumb sucking, and he pretty much stopped after a couple of weeks and</li>
            <li> Well, maybe she was just ready for this, but after the first night, when we put it on after she was asleep, (she woke at 4am complaining about the taste)</li>
            <li> her nails grew long and I was finally able to cut her nails.</li>
            <li> His nails are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> and now i have healthy, long nails.</li>
            <li> He pretty much stopped chewing his nails within a day our two.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and has pretty much been sucking her thumb sice</li>
            <li> i love this polish and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> so we did not have to apply for too long :)</li>
            <li> I put the thumb in my mouth, and, at first, I didn&#x27;t really taste anything.  </li>
            <li> but this is probably the first time in 29 years that I have real nails.</li>
            <li> The first time you bite your nails (or whatever you want to use this for really), trust me you&#x27;ll never purposefully bite into them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to break my daughters thumb sucking for so long and tried so many things by now that I lost hope at one time.</li>
            <li> Our daughter was ready and willing to stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> Then by the third or fourth day I would catch myself biting my nails again, but wouldn&#x27;t want to put more on because I enjoy my food tasting like food.</li>
            <li> Used it on my first son when he was bitting his nails and got over the habit real soon.</li>
            <li> This one is much stronger in flavor, and it really works!</li>
            <li> I let the girls keep water at their bedside for the first week or so because when they stuck their thumbs in they would want to run straight for a drink.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much immediately after tasting it once when</li>
            <li> Fast to apply, he puts it on willingly by himself.</li>
            <li> I tried so many other products with 0 success.  </li>
            <li> Note: needs to be reapplied every 4-5 days, pretty much just like nail polish.</li>
            <li> That pretty much sums it up.  </li>
            <li> I thought that because the nail polish was on my nails, I would still be able to floss as long as I didn&#x27;t put the floss around my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting the same enjoyment at all, and quickly becoming conditioned to equate nail biting with BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She would pretty much suck her thumb all day and night.</li>
            <li> I think as long as I keep using this stuff, I won&#x27;t have any more problems with my nail-biting.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product for a long time, was really glad when I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> it pretty much stopped her.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mavala Stop, it really works!</li>
            <li> He was really upset when he first tasted it</li>
            <li> Presumably most people won&#x27;t even need to use it as long as I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> A word of warning, this stuff affect pretty much anything</li>
            <li> No crying, no anger.</li>
            <li> Eating something sweet (like soda) will get rid of the taste but some of it was still on my soft palate</li>
            <li> Because I had so much difficulty with his older brother (who didn&#x27;t stop sucking until he was in elementary school</li>
            <li> I file them down and make them look nice and put a coat of this on it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunatley, what I didn&#x27;t realize that my 13-hour-a-night sleeper who was super easy to put to bed (we just put on his pjs and closed the door) was that way because he sucked his fingers to fall asleep and again any time he woke up during the night.</li>
            <li> use careful when applying it, I used to much on my son this stuff is very strong...  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old has pretty nails for the first time since we can&#x27;t remember when!  </li>
            <li> He has the most sweet little hands again because of Mavala.</li>
            <li> My son stopped bitting from the first application and my daughter stopped sucking completely 2 days after the first application!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re pleased to say that within one week out 6 1/2 year old whom sucked her thumb a lot to the point she created a major overbite is no longer sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I saw other reviews that suggested more often, but I didn&#x27;t want to overdo right away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving them toothpicks and/or utensils for finger foods as once they get a taste of it, they will most likely not want their fingers in their mouth again (my son has not).</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe the product is good, so many reviews cant be wrong, I even tasted it and was bitter as hell.  </li>
            <li> I have enough control due to the substance that I have been able to use scissors most of the time now that I have relocated them, but I still bite my nails occasionally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We tried putting his thumbs in vinegar, but it washed away pretty quickly and he was right back to sucking again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m floored with how well and quickly this worked for my 3 year old within one week</li>
            <li> 3 year old learned quickly to stop sticking her thumb in her mouth when we tried this.</li>
            <li> It arrived very, very quickly BUT it sat on my counter for over a week as it came in the same packaging as my medication and just assumed it was that.</li>
            <li> It definitely does not seem suitable for young children with developing brains!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked so quickly for the 6 year old.  </li>
            <li> It could easily be worn over nail polish and would probably work like an extra protective topcoat.</li>
            <li> It could easily be worn over nail polish and would probably work like an extra protective topcoat.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to apply while thumb is dry, otherwise it won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s more aware of what she is doing and trying harder to stop.</li>
            <li> Works but easily washes off after regular habd washing.</li>
            <li> My nails are now long, healthy, and they grow really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to keep her from touching it so it has time to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> But make sure the neck of the bottle is dry before you close it.</li>
            <li> I put it on the very tip of her fingernail the first night but after that I painted her whole nail.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old bit his nails to the quick.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find Mavala Stop quickly at the beauty supply store near me, so I purchased Orly&#x27;s No Bite.  </li>
            <li> worked quickly to help my 4/5 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Then he went back to sleep easily.</li>
            <li> could not believe how quickly my 3 year old stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> She stopped very quickly and it really only took 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> At bedtime I would lightly paint only her thumbs, and the first time she tried she immediately stopped putting it in her mouth.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that it spills easily.</li>
            <li> When you paint your fingernails with &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; any chance that you put your fingernails near or in your mouth will have you quickly removing them.  </li>
            <li> I do apply it daily as well to keep the taste strong.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly of nail polish when applies, and should last two days.  </li>
            <li> The first few days my daughter would sometimes forget and put her thumb in, and you will want water handy to wash the taste away.</li>
            <li> I am planning on buying Mavalas product to make their nails strong next as I noticed they are growing too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it is a must to reapply like daily so that it continues to be strong to the taste.</li>
            <li> , you get that taste as well only not quite as strong.</li>
            <li> It definately isn&#x27;t strong enough for her habits.  </li>
            <li> flavor for Mavala Stop is strong and last for almost 2 days even if u washed your hands over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seemed as though the habit was too strong to break, having been in practice for those five years since birth (our only child that preferred his digits over a pacifier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also smelt the product and deemed the smell too strong and actually threw it away without even using it in on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was such a strong habit that he had his thumb in his mouth any time he wasn&#x27;t using it--</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to survive my vigorous hand scrubbing in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I told my daughter if you bite your nails below a certain point</li>
            <li> This includes during the day when certain events would trigger it.  </li>
            <li> The temptation of not putting it on or letting it wear off quickly is certainly there.</li>
            <li> The temptation of not putting it on or letting it wear off quickly is certainly there.</li>
            <li> this product is certainly helping to break the habit.  </li>
            <li> It certainly works too.</li>
            <li> She was beginning to get a large overbite, and her dentist recommended Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li> With all the news regarding hand washing and the need to keep your hands off your face and certainly out of your mouth, I suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Operations Manager for a large company</li>
            <li> But if you have a smart child, they will notice that it gleams on their fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> but it certainly did the trick for me.</li>
            <li> We continued using it for a week just to be certain.</li>
            <li> She would suck on her fingers during car rides, before meals, before bed, during her sleep, a large part of her day was her sucking her</li>
            <li> For certain things like even eating chips, or flossing, your nails may accidentally brush your lips or mouth, and you will get the undesirable taste.</li>
            <li> It certainly would motivate me.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it was the product that helped her stop, or her own decision...she did figure out very quickly that it peels off when it&#x27;s dry...probably works fine as a reminder for a kid that wants to stop, but it&#x27;s not much of a deterrent for a kid that wants to bite</li>
            <li> We are hoping that in a few more weeks, he will kick nail biting good-bye!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my son&#x27;s nailbiting problem.  </li>
            <li> This is great for me because it just reinforces the lesson even after, which means I am less likely to attempt to chew again.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that you can&#x27;t really eat finger foods that easily without getting some of the taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought, could it really be that easy and simple?  </li>
            <li> You have to really slosh it on or else it might not be strong enough.</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot and after painting my nails with this product for a week and a half I completely stopped biting in my nails for good.</li>
            <li> Tastes pretty strange, mostly like tonic water and chemicals but adds a new type of excitement every time you go for a chew.</li>
            <li> Suggestion if using on kids put it on when they are sleeping for the first week or two, make sure to reapply every other day.</li>
            <li> Like many other parents I tried everything; from the sock to tape to hot sauce, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> We got Mavala Stop 3 weeks ago and other than the first time he &amp;#34;tried it&amp;#34; and one more accidental taste he has not sucked them since.</li>
            <li> Many people who found this product ineffective had children under 3, although some were lucky enough that it worked despite the younger age of their children.  </li>
            <li> Any time she eats anything with her fingers and gets a tast of the Mavala Stop product, she decides that she no longer likes that particular food!</li>
            <li> I got on Amazon to find a book that was suggested and one of the reviews of that particular book mentioned this!</li>
            <li> only drawback is if you are eating something like chips or a donut and go to lick your fingers, you will quickly remember that Mavala Stop has been applied!</li>
            <li> It was very highly rated.  </li>
            <li> Not going to happen with Mavala Stop, this stuff is pure, absolute poison.  </li>
            <li> But know that kids are smart haha.</li>
            <li> put a little on my own finger before I subjected them to it.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb the first time she tried putting it in her mouth with the Mavala Stop on it!</li>
            <li> months later, my real nails were the same length as the acrylics on top of them!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this first.</li>
            <li> None of them seemed to be consistent or highly effect deterrents.</li>
            <li> She is old enough to realize &amp; wanted to stop but it just wasn&#x27;t easy as its right there with her all the time.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a good boy and had a hard time letting go of the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself and it was a very strong bitter taste it stayed on my thumb for two days without reapplying!!</li>
            <li> Put one coat on my child&#x27;s thumb and after trying to put their thumb in their mouth 5-6 times the first day the thumb sucking stopped completely!!  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products similar to this one but the others are tolerable or flake off easily.</li>
            <li> But after reading many reviews and seeing other people having positive results, I figured we had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> We tried positive reinforcement, and so many other approaches we read about online and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> My 11-year-old son just stopped biting his fingernails after we used this product for a few weeks, it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> Taking away the finger sucking created a huge issue with him taking forever to fall asleep, getting out of bed in the middle of the night, etc.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gray product.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really seemed to work.</li>
            <li> We noticed within a couple days that she really wasn&#x27;t sucking her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> Really curbed her appetite .</li>
            <li> Thanks goodness</li>
            <li> and it broke habit fast.</li>
            <li> He no longer bites his nails and they are growing very well now.</li>
            <li> So, my husband ordered this product after much research.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> It really alters your teeth and face.</li>
            <li> Apply it to your whole nail if you want, or just the edges that you chew.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really stays on</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this on and off my whole life, and really need to quit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied one coat (not just to her nail, but over the whole thumb).  </li>
            <li> I never even realized JUST how much I bit my nails and cuticles</li>
            <li> it was supposed to stop me from biting, but after a while the snapping action just ended up sexually exciting me.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> The real test will be if I can condition myself to keep my fingers out of my mouth</li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> The real test will be if I can condition myself to keep my fingers out of my mouth</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used this with both of my boys to get ride of their pacifier and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll just close my eyes and go to town on my nails and and have like a shot of whiskey ready to get the taste out.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault, as much as it is my dd&#x27;s stubborn determination to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> If this didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t have much hope for anything else.</li>
            <li> This is not a taste you get used to over time either; it will continue to be one of the most bitter tasting flavors you can</li>
            <li> Really, I tried it on myself</li>
            <li> it really work so well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Now I think the urge/habit is really out of his system.</li>
            <li> This worked because when she would use her fingers to eat, she would not put that much of her thumb in her mouth to taste the cuticle area.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while, he himelf will let us know that he wants to apply it.</li>
            <li> But, it may very well not work for your child.  </li>
            <li> They both did very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also learned to be careful about touching my lips with any part of my fingertips as it rubs off then too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is like nail polish.</li>
            <li> So she was ready to stop but couldn&#x27;t stop the habit.</li>
            <li> His dentists and doctors kept saying he&#x27;d quit &#x27;when he was ready&#x27;</li>
            <li> She was VERY into her thumb.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find you want to use silverware or eat a lot more carefully -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to ANYONE who wants to quit a habit.</li>
            <li> He tried but really struggled when he was distracted (like watching a movie) or when he was going to bed.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you use it with caution and not put on too much like I did.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I always thought, I could quit whenever I was ready but somehow could never stop.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s promising reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after doing plenty of research, I learned it is an absolute must</li>
            <li> to mention that I really didn&#x27;t want to send a kid off to kindergarten still sucking his thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> So again this product REALLY works...  </li>
            <li> Thanks Stacey Oakland,CA</li>
            <li> Of course I had to take a sample taste, just to see if it would really work.</li>
            <li> The best part is that she is SO proud of herself, the worst part is we have to buy her that trampoline now that we&#x27;ve been bribing her with for the last two years!</li>
            <li> but it was fast) and freaked out when he put his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> From reviews we read we don&#x27;t put much on.</li>
            <li> This is important since the taste will last on the her thumb for a couple of days and every time she would eat a snack she could taste it.</li>
            <li> but the product really works.</li>
            <li> but the product really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> My daughter is now finished thumb sucking thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t paint my whole nails with it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and really wanted to stop sucking her thumb before she turned 4.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to stop my 3 y.o from sucking her thumb, but she would cry every time she tried to place food in her mouth and her thumb would hit her lips</li>
            <li> It works very well although it does come off</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really does work though.  </li>
            <li> It really does make you stop,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Its much stronger that \\&quot;Bite</li>
            <li> and it really did go a lot smoother than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> so you stop biting your nails and they are very understanding.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Also, after months of use, my son has gotten used to the bitter/pungent taste of the polish and doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it as much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it works, but taking a star off because the effects are very temporary.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let your child eat w/ fingers to much try to use fork or spoon</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my son stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> She wanted to quit, but just too much of a habit.</li>
            <li> It makes it a much stronger taste</li>
            <li> and she has continued to go the whole night with not one attempt at sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> but I really believe she is over it now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also hoping this will prevent him from eating food with his fingers so much.</li>
            <li> I am suprised that it worked so fast.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped with my nail biting.</li>
            <li> I reapplied inconsistently (it does wear off) - you could reapply twice a day or every couple days, depending on how much you need.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb in about 3 weeks, so I really believe that he has overcome this habit.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mavala because you saved me thousands of dollars for braces.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not each time, but very often.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> We were wondering why she wasn&#x27;t waking in the night, until we found her in the morning sucking on her thumb like it wasn&#x27;t covered in the most bitter foul tasting nail polish ever.</li>
            <li> She wants to stop, but as soon as the lights are out a robot takes over her arm and guides that thing straight to her mouth.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think it would stop so fast.  </li>
            <li> Product has really helped me.</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t have any affect on me whatsoever</li>
            <li> this has a real yucky taste, my daughter just kept spitting if she dare suck anytime.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter has sucked her thumb her whole life, I even have a Ultrasound of her sucking in womb.</li>
            <li> But no matter how much I applied the product to my son&#x27;s trumb, it didn&#x27;t stop him from sucking.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Mavala.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> She really had been trying to quit for months.  </li>
            <li> One more suggestion:  pick your time carefully.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for adults!</li>
            <li> MORE THUMB at least so far :)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t care so much if he&#x27;d keep it in the privacy of home...  </li>
            <li> , really, spicy probably doesn&#x27;t phase him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how much you inadvertantly stick your fingers in your mouth till there&#x27;s something like this on them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really, really nasty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been two months now, and she really is cured.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We still put it on for a while afterward, because she would wake up with her thumb in her mouth and be very distressed.  </li>
            <li> but they should really state that is for children 3 and up because it didnt say on the site for what age.</li>
            <li> He was getting really discouraged that he kept failing with everything he tried.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> The product contains Methyl alcohol, which is highly toxic!</li>
            <li> Turns out he really likes to pick his nose, like a lot, like if we pumped his stomach it would look like that slime stuff Nickelodeon.</li>
            <li> He likes it so much that he bought some and gave to a person in our neighborhood.</li>
            <li> His fingernails are looking much nicer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to order a hypnosis CD to assist with breaking the habit, via Amazon, when I found a link to Mavala.  </li>
            <li> This product really works for toddlers.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew this product before, it really worked.</li>
            <li> Before applying it on her fingers I tasted it and it was really yuck.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> so I rushed home and looked for something to help him stop fast.  </li>
            <li> this item really suited my need.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really have any effect on him.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> She was very reluctant, but she knew I wasnt giving in.</li>
            <li> Then I found this product and it really worked.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> and it really works out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you expected that</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much this product means to me and my family.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely what we needed</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to eat too many finger foods because you will get a hint of the taste while eating.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and am so thankful to Dr. Jeannie Moody in Austin, Texas for the referral!</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> That was a real treat....  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really foul</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work, or if it did, it would be a traumatic experience for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> For instance, you can&#x27;t really eat chips without tasting the bitterness in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It doesnt take much at all.  </li>
            <li> Too much of the product</li>
            <li> The taste is also very durable and lingering.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really find the taste all that offensive.</li>
            <li> I will stop biting my nails, even if I use the whole bottle breaking the habit.</li>
            <li> Haha just the SMELL did the job all by itself!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might work if your child wants to stop sucking their thumb, but if not, don&#x27;t count on it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it worked so fast.</li>
            <li> trust me on this one, this stuff really works and out son stop sucking his thumb in a week.  </li>
            <li> Read the bottles carefully, make sure you grab the one-a-day variety.</li>
            <li> Try to use forks and spoons for your food as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the bottles carefully, make sure you grab the one-a-day variety.</li>
            <li> Try to use forks and spoons for your food as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he must have spit for 3 hours straight, and the stuff would get on his food.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted to help give parents and informed decision.ste\\&quot; on their tongue.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted to help give parents and informed decision.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Mavala makes this whole process much easier.  </li>
            <li> company I bought it through though was very efficient.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the stuff seems to really attach itself to my lips, even though I haven&#x27;t bitten in that amount of time.</li>
            <li> My 3-yr son stopped sucking his thumb for 3 months and then re-started and was very stubborn about quitting.</li>
            <li> This is the nastiest, most bitter taste I&#x27;ve ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned, touching your lips leaves the bitter taste on your lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important kids get extra hugs and cuddle time to substitute the security their thumb provides.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter, I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> We were ready to have the dentist install a habit appliance in her mouth which was $600.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely suggest trying it.  </li>
            <li> The cost makes it a very inexpensive trial.  </li>
            <li> This product really relieved alot of stress for my husband and I.  </li>
            <li> We owe it all to Mavala, thanks it really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped me grow my nails out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this if you&#x27;re a nail biter!</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> and I believe it discourages her from eating as much.  </li>
            <li> I had so much anxiety about getting my son to stop sucking his finger</li>
            <li> and it was really a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> He was very agreeable to the process so that probably helped too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and have been biting my nails off and on my whole life.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to kick the habit</li>
            <li> I really want my nails to grow out</li>
            <li> This stuff was fantastic, though there were several nights I had to get up and get one of the kids</li>
            <li> Thanks to MAVALA</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tastes like absolute s</li>
            <li> though, the most bitter thing you&#x27;ve ever tasted.</li>
            <li> hahaha.  </li>
            <li> She has made comments that she wants to stop to.  </li>
            <li> Between breakfast and the ride to school, my son quit sucking his thumb thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> So it works perfectly, haha.</li>
            <li> fast forward a year,</li>
            <li> My husband has been biting his nails his whole life.</li>
            <li> I guess all I really have to say is that this product should do what you want it to do if you purchase it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all...</li>
            <li> I guess his thumb means that much to him.</li>
            <li> Something that really needs to be advertised.</li>
            <li> We tried everything: from gentle reminders to getting irritated; from distractions to a promised gift; he even bit his nails during soccer training while kicking the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> She bit her nails too, but not that much.</li>
            <li> She was sucking both at home and at school and it was really interfereing with her school work.</li>
            <li> absolutely turned me off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think I am going to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> and he really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But I would really recommend this for sucking.</li>
            <li> but it was too much of a habit without the help of MAVALA.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think we will need to use the whole bottle</li>
            <li> But he was never distressed or really even cared that he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> So I know he&#x27;s not quite ready to get off it</li>
            <li> It dries really fast.  </li>
            <li> He was ready to stop</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It wears away eventually, my child is very stubborn</li>
            <li> for the appearance of the stuff, it dries on very shiny</li>
            <li> My family and me were very worried that it would ruin her finger and the shape of her mouth.</li>
            <li> and it really tastes</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been complaining about it and saying he wants to stop because it hurts and it bugs him, but he can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It really helps&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use it much longer since I don&#x27;t really see her thumb going towards her mouth anymore.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting it for that purpose I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It never bothered me really until I realized it started affecting my work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I really needed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, not for children under 3 or really</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will work unless the child is really ready to quit though.</li>
            <li> the Mavala on his nails and described it as \\&quot;really terrible\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> We paint the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> She confirmed it was gross.</li>
            <li> The taste really does not go away.</li>
            <li> Even then I really didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Even then I really didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> Very sour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really was bothersome since the taste would get on the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> This product really helps you kick a nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mavala.</li>
            <li> It taste really</li>
            <li> really bad!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> For that- the product works very well and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it really works</li>
            <li> it really stops him from biting it.</li>
            <li> Really helped my daughter stopped sucking her thumb at night.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I can really tell this product is beginning to rewire my brain.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Mavala</li>
            <li> This product really helped&lt;</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get her to stop, she has the desire to stop, and I was really hoping this would work</li>
            <li> soon they&#x27;ve grown so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks God and to someone who came out for this invention.</li>
            <li> and if you dare touch your mouth, the bitterness is really really</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn, it is just a really undesirable taste.</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-Same</li>
            <li> After regularly applying after bath time he was completely free of thumb sucking in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I have been promising for 2 years that she could  have her ears pierced</li>
            <li> The thumb covers were very pricey</li>
            <li> decided to order the bitter nail polish as most of the ingredients looked like they were in nail products that I have used on them anyway.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really stop her thumb sucking though.</li>
            <li> It really helped me.</li>
            <li> People that know the twins have noticed they no longer suck on their fingers, too, which made me secretly jump for joy.</li>
            <li> works very well to keep my child from sucking her thumb but had to apply to all fingers as she would swap to another if it was just on thumb.</li>
            <li> shes very determined to do</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li> I knew I had to do something about it and FAST.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;ll still look at her much longer nails and say, &amp;#34;Wow</li>
            <li> , I just really want to bite them off.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I wish it had hold up much longer</li>
            <li> She was the one to tell us she was ready to use it.</li>
            <li> but we really didn&#x27;t need too.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> then you better be careful.  </li>
            <li> This really helps our grandson with thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes absolutely horrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just one whole day.</li>
            <li> ...thank you so much mavala....</li>
            <li> It is the most vile, horroble bitter taste I have ever tasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for 50 years and have never found any of the biting deterrents to really work.</li>
            <li> this has really helped my son a lot.</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that this product really worked.</li>
            <li> im thinking she needed something to do with her hands, so she just scratched and scratched her whole body..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to really deter my child from putting fingers in mouth.</li>
            <li> I also did not have to apply very often</li>
            <li> Tape, socks, finger splints, THUMB, offering money, and threats to cut off the thumb (Not like I would really do that, but</li>
            <li> and this was to avoid too much bacteria on his thumb and to his mouth.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed my kid stop outmatically after</li>
            <li> once I paint it thanks to those who made it and distribute thank you</li>
            <li> She used to suck her thumb so much that she didn&#x27;t even take her thumb out to eat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cover her whole nail because I didn&#x27;t want her to accidentally get it in her mouth while eating.</li>
            <li> I was very optimistic that it would work.  </li>
            <li> and he had a stomach ache for a whole week during school and at home because of it.</li>
            <li> This product has really changed my son&#x27;s feelings about biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> However, we have not found this product very helpful.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Then the bitter taste becomes more tolerable, but by that point you longer desire to bite your nails.</li>
            <li> but really doesn&#x27;t cure the problem.</li>
            <li> The first 2 days we thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, he still put his finger in his mouth, however it wasn&#x27;t as much as he normally did.</li>
            <li> It really is foul tasting and she would suck her thumb to help her fall asleep.</li>
            <li> The stuff lasts days, especially on an adult</li>
            <li> Both of us really wanted her to stop biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> It really helped her stop and was much easier than either of us could imagine.</li>
            <li> I think the kid needs to want to stop, but if they do - this is absolutely the tool to do that.</li>
            <li> He stopped biting his nails immediately because he hates the taste so much.</li>
            <li> and I was really hoping this product worked.</li>
            <li> the dentist told me there was nothing I could do until my daughter was ready.  </li>
            <li> So this has not been a really quick-fix, like 3 days</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t bring too much effect on my kid.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> her suck her thumb and apply this polish, I coat her whole thumb.</li>
            <li> It really does the job.</li>
            <li> I made sure there&#x27;s water close by so that when she wakes up, she can get the bitter taste out of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> very bitter(which</li>
            <li> I realized for applying covered almost the whole thumb&#x27;s nail.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I never saw something that worked so fast because my daughter and her thumb were glued together night and day, practically inseparable .</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to keep your kids from biting their nails, this works really well.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> She was running around scraping her tongue with a napkin practically the whole day.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her she just couldn&#x27;t anymore, even though she wasn&#x27;t doing it very often.</li>
            <li> It had am immediate impact and both of my kids actually appreciated the aide in stopping their habits.</li>
            <li> I started using Mavala when my fingers started hurting of so much bitting, I had to stop some</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This was accomplished practically overnight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> well anyways I received it really fast and that night I applied it on his nails.</li>
            <li> My whole family applied it so we could experience what he&#x27;s going through together and</li>
            <li> You will not need the whole bottle</li>
            <li> very cautiously because &#x27;stop&#x27; is ment for 3 and up.  </li>
            <li> so every day till he was really done</li>
            <li> , I really thought this stuff worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t bitten since, and his nails now look so much nicer and healthier.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Mavala Stop!  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to break this habit and have been trying for a year now.  </li>
            <li> and I think it was too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> It sounds like it really works</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop was an absolute miracle.</li>
            <li> and it is working very well.</li>
            <li> very often.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I want to relate this to &amp;#34;cruel and unusual punishment&amp;#34;; however, it should do the job of keeping nails from being bitten.</li>
            <li> My son, not so much.  </li>
            <li> When we applied to the whole nail, that&#x27;s when it started to work.  </li>
            <li> Though we were more likely to put it on each night, as if we missed a days, he would be more likely to put his thumb back in.  </li>
            <li> I have discovered that also hates the taste (hahaha)</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to need to use this for a while in order to really break that habit.</li>
            <li> but I can say that this stuff really works to help people stop biting.</li>
            <li> His dentist had mentioned twice that we really should get him to stop sucking his finger as it was moving his front tooth forward</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> Be careful eating anything with hands after applying because you can even taste it on your food from just touching it.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It has a bitter taste but is safe.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is 3 and the dentist stated she really needed to stop sucking her thumb because it was causing an overbite.</li>
            <li> but it was just too much to lick my lips or</li>
            <li> It really does.</li>
            <li> this really worked.  </li>
            <li> he just really didn&#x27;t want to</li>
            <li> But he really wasn&#x27;t very upset.</li>
            <li> but I think a child must be ready to quit sucking.  </li>
            <li> He would bite so much and often and make is fingers bleed etc.</li>
            <li> then well it can be really</li>
            <li> This absolutely works.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This time it seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s important to note that just using the nail polish to kick the habit probably isn&#x27;t going to be enough.</li>
            <li> it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li> Thanks Malvala.</li>
            <li> She hates putting them in her mouth now, and it really does help her to remember to keep her fingers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes u think fast about putting ur fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very cautious at how I put it on her fingers.</li>
            <li> Its way too intense.</li>
            <li> knows how much I wanted it too</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it with our daughter (5) and son (3.5) and it has really helped.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use it for my boys because it leaves too much of a shine on their nails.</li>
            <li> He is so proud of himself now that he had broken that habit.</li>
            <li> I have a real need to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> I have struggled my whole life with nail biting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very absentminded habit.  </li>
            <li> He kept asking me when we were going to buy this product, so he was ready to stop sucking his thumb and just needed some help.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to help their child to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> I really really recommend this for nail biters.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works real well.</li>
            <li> I talked to her about it as soon as I placed the order to get her ready for it</li>
            <li> Had to keep applying it until it really sank in.</li>
            <li> This really does help.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> i find this product really works.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that he sucked his thumb so much in his sleep too.  </li>
            <li> He does it so much that he tears his skin.  </li>
            <li> His mother bought this for him and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this whole heartedly.</li>
            <li> We were both hesitant that it wouldn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> It did seem to work well for my son - not so much for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The finger sucking did not bother us, but after she turned 3 or so, she started to do it very aggressively where she would hurt her fingers with her teeth.</li>
            <li> I was VERY</li>
            <li> They are absolutely correct.</li>
            <li> I did put it on a few more times just to make sure, but it seems like the problem was stopped after only 2 applications!</li>
            <li> We put a band aid over the thumb as a reminder but if she takes off the band aid it will be very yucky.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> and he didn&#x27;t really respond.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my whole life</li>
            <li> The taste really make you regret life.</li>
            <li> Our daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it that much, but idf</li>
            <li> It does wear off fast though, so you had to apply just about every day, but it has been working.</li>
            <li> really bummed it didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> Because really, it tastes aweful.</li>
            <li> It really helped my son to stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it and will continue to recommend it because it really works.  </li>
            <li> and she was very stubborn she keeps trying for 5 or 7 days</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cheap ($200) but it was the only thing that worked for us!</li>
            <li> so she may have straight teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought it would take much longer to break her habit.</li>
            <li> My son was the type to have his thumb or fingers in his mouth very often</li>
            <li> And they are more careful to not get their fingers in their mouthes when they eat too.</li>
            <li> That is really the purpose of this stuff.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for my nail biting toddler.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> but so far it has been worth it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I think the fact that it makes one gag really associates with the habit and helps break it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> So now his teeth are affected,his thumbs get really chapped and red,and sometimes he won&#x27;t even take his thumb out to talk.</li>
            <li> she didnt care much for.</li>
            <li> doesnt really work as well as shown.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> that also says not much had to be around the top for it to adhere itself.</li>
            <li> Plus much of their destruction occurs with finger to finger peeling,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two months and my nails are absolutely growing because I&#x27;ve stopped biting my nails.</li>
            <li> If you really want to stop, BUY THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> Greatly appreciated it really works used it for 2 days and stopped socking thumbs.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t force him, I told him when he was ready we&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> This product worked really well, I stopped biting my nails the day i put it on, however it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> My daughter was ready to stop sucking her thumb (almost 3yo) and this stuff helped in a matter of 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I painted the whole nail a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, it tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They will &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; to apply it haha</li>
            <li> She cried because she really wanted to stop sucking her fingers but couldn&#x27;t control her finger sucking impulse.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve ever done in my whole life.. .</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> Note that I followed the advice of one Mom who said don&#x27;t put too much on.</li>
            <li> your child doesn&#x27;t get used to the taste this could work very well, but it did not for us.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> He is 3 1/2 and has sucked his thumb his whole life.</li>
            <li> Now I say to use caution because you don&#x27;t need to apply that much, to the nail</li>
            <li> is he has stopped napping even though I really think he still needs the nap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend my whole life sucking my thumb.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> He really dislikes the taste and stopped biting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> why I have not broken the habit yet</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;We began the process on a Saturday morning so we could monitor her and continuously apply the mavala stop for the whole weekend as she attends daycare during the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLECH.</li>
            <li> I am sure the product works great for others, but our daughter was so obsessed with thumb sucking and nail biting that she would sit and scrape her nails and thumbs to try to get off as much as possible, then would put up with the taste until she has bitten and sucked it off.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> We snuck it on her fingernails while she was sleeping, and it was absolutely miraculous.</li>
            <li> think it helps if your kid is emotionally ready to stop the finger-sucking because this really works.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t put her fingers in her mouth for three weeks straight ...</li>
            <li> This product really works like they say.  </li>
            <li> This really works so give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have been a nail bitter for most of my life and could not find anything to help me from stopping.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who wants to stop the nail biting habit.  </li>
            <li> But now, the taste doesn&#x27;t really bother him</li>
            <li> You get \\&quot;punished\\&quot; for really doing nothing</li>
            <li> If your rub the ends of your fingers together like I do even hours after putting it on then your whole finger will taste of it.</li>
            <li> She was ready to stop and even asked for help from her &amp;#34;special nail polish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This product really worked and it stopped me from biting.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> mavala really works thanks mavala</li>
            <li> It really works, my daughter has not even attempted to stich her thumb in her mouth and its been over a month</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really think the products gets stuck in nose and throat causing me to want vomit and cough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they were almost gone thanks to this</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely nasty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes/flakes off much faster than some of the others I have used.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, who wants to quit biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> It worked for a while with my son, not so much with my daughter.</li>
            <li> This worked really well.  </li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> I just had to be more careful and eventually it wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, but you need to re apply it every day to really kick the habbit.</li>
            <li> I would do this for a month to really stop biting you rnails.</li>
            <li> it  really  works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.....</li>
            <li> Haha)</li>
            <li> But it really is helping her to stop bitting her nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and have been biting my nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Putting a nail in your mouth will ruin your whole morning.  </li>
            <li> I had a real addiction problem to it</li>
            <li> I figured for the price if it didnt work I wouldnt be out much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Like, really.</li>
            <li> Really want my daughter to stop sucking her thumb..</li>
            <li> I put it on &amp; was so ready to see her distaste for it.</li>
            <li> As the reviews said not to put too much on as it could get on her food &amp; she may not eat.</li>
            <li> I took them off and really tried to grow them out, but could not keep from biting them and the skin around my nail.  </li>
            <li> This really helped me stop biting my nails and helps my son keep his finger out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good for at least two or three days.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good for at least two or three days.  </li>
            <li> If your kid is some kind of mutant like mine, I guess it will be money wasted.</li>
            <li> We are on day 3 and we reapplied a coat to make sure we don&#x27;t lose any of the gains, but so far, this is working like a charm and, as a parent, have to say it has been relatively painless.  </li>
            <li> My six year old was willing to try and the first day she accidentally put her thumb in her mouth 3 times.</li>
            <li> The product smells exactly like nail polish remover which for the first application stopped our daughter from bringing her fingers any where near her nose, let alone her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a waste of money in that sense...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to quit on and off throughout my life but for the most part I&#x27;m extremely addicted to nail biting.</li>
            <li> She re-applies it as needed at bedtime, and surprisingly she hasn&#x27;t complained much at all.  </li>
            <li> It worked first time for my 2 year old the first time for finger sucking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to guarantee that this will work for your child, I can only tell you that my 3 year old is one of the most stubborn children I know</li>
            <li> On the second day he announced that he \\&quot;kind of likes the taste\\&quot; and has gone back to biting his nails anyway.</li>
            <li> so I will us it on and off for a few months, but we are so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> We actually painted over the clear polish with her favorite colors and</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have tried many different ways to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied with this product despite the minor hassle of avoiding finger foods.  </li>
            <li> I rose, went to the bathroom, rinsed with water, brushed my teeth, brushed my tongue, all to no avail.</li>
            <li> She can not stand the taste and was nearly in tears the first time she tried to suck her thumb, now she would just make a funny face.</li>
            <li> you have to put it on everyday though, to be effective, just fyi....</li>
            <li> and I used it for my toddler who was getting more and more addicted to thumb sucking .</li>
            <li> I think perhaps because one of her good friends in preschool still sucks her thumb</li>
            <li> I think perhaps because one of her good friends in preschool still sucks her thumb</li>
            <li> However, she did none of the above - she licked it on her own, said it was gross, and then went about her business.  </li>
            <li> so well you only need a tiny bit on the end of your nail to be effective.</li>
            <li> I kept it on her thumb for a week, just to be sure the habit was broken, but it was more like 24 hours</li>
            <li> short, I have been exceptionally pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> short, I have been exceptionally pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> I tried many different tactics with getting my 4 year old daughter to stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews, I was worried this product would be very strong</li>
            <li> , this product did not work at all, has hardly any taste, I quickly ordered Mavala Stop after reading many good reviews, tested it out my self, then tried with just a small dab on one of his fingers, he stopped finger sucking within a day.</li>
            <li> so I spit down onto my feet, which I&#x27;m pretty sure scared</li>
            <li> daughter has completely stopped sucking her thumbs and fairly quickly, and I now have a full bottle left</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, the bitter taste wasn&#x27;t really that strong.  </li>
            <li> I highly advice this product, along with so much needed positive feedback to help the baby break the habit.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves painting her new long nails :)</li>
            <li> since then I haven&#x27;t had to reapply or anything, she has completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 1/2 yr old to stop his thumb sucking habit and it worked like a charm!!!  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It took DAYS for the taste to completely go away from my fingers!!!</li>
            <li> After using this for 2 weeks they stopped completely!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> No, I mean a lot!  </li>
            <li> Our 3 yr old daughter stooped sucking her thumbs in 1 week!!!</li>
            <li> and he has completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li> 3 year old likes it!!!</li>
            <li> my 3yr old son loves his thumbs !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first night was rough on my daughter (and on us), but she very quickly stopped the thumbsucking.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great for a week but my extremely determined 3 year old is now back to sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> I do occasionally resort back to nail biting when life is particularly stressful, but then putting this stuff on for even just one day &#x27;cures&#x27; me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, this stuff tastes completely useful, so it can make eating finger foods a bit challenging, but</li>
            <li> My son (who turned 7 this year) has been sucking his right thumb since he was 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 year old daughter used to suck her two right hand fingers all night and also in the day time.</li>
            <li> Stopped my 6 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking at night almost right away.  </li>
            <li> A couple weeks later, I put this very, very lightly (like small drop) on top of the fingernail paint.</li>
            <li> and my nails are long and strong.  </li>
            <li> She really didn&#x27;t believe she could stop since we had tried so many other things.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviews we knew to put it just on the top of her nail and thumb, so it would not affect the taste of her food.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disconcerting to stick your finger into your mouth to do something innocent like pick your tooth and to have that unbearably bitter taste follow it!</li>
            <li> other thing I liked about the product is since its applied like a nail polish, I could put it directly on his thumbnails so it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on food if he were eating something by hand.</li>
            <li> There were 2 long nights of her coughing because the stuff was so strong, but it did the job.  </li>
            <li> I must be a good responder though as I have heard of other people still having problems after using similar deterrents.  </li>
            <li> Started using this product about 3 months ago and now my nails are long strong and never chip.</li>
            <li> I made a BIG deal of his nails and he was very proud to show me his little hands every day to see how long his nails were.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially for an older child.</li>
            <li> We applied that to both thumbs along with a lot of positive reinforcement and encouragement (never a negative comment).</li>
            <li> It was kind of funny the first day we applied it, I knew every time she tried to suck her thumb because she would run to the trash or toilet to spit out the bitter taste!  </li>
            <li> While this product helped for a little bit, I found that it was very easy for me to chip off my fingernails and start biting again....</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that the polish comes off very very easily after a day or two so applying over and over is necessary.</li>
            <li> Followed the instruction and applied every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been more than two weeks now</li>
            <li> I am still applying the solution at night while he sleeps (every other night) just to make sure he doesn&#x27;t start up again.  </li>
            <li> My husband DID catch her a week later (2 weeks after the original application) sucking at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> The other products we have used were OK but after a while she got used to the taste and continued to bite her nails.  </li>
            <li> I had tried many other technigues to stop the habit, but nothing worked until Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product will work for most, but not for the extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li> sure there are some kids where other thumb sucking remedies do work.</li>
            <li> This defintely helped my little nail biter be more aware of his habit.</li>
            <li> We originally had bought thum at a local pharmacy and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> and if I ever did, I&#x27;d have bigger problems than nail biting (laugh)!  </li>
            <li> After the first application it began its magic and after only a week of applying it (and that&#x27;s only been two applications because you paint it on once every two days)</li>
            <li> I am excited about finally having nails!</li>
            <li> I made a big deal about it and she became excited about trying it.  </li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m able to help one other person out there</li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m able to help one other person out there</li>
            <li> She has been so excited to be a big girl now, too.  </li>
            <li> So, if you plan to use this on a young child, you might want to start out applying a minimal amount to the tip of the thumbnail, and be aware that the effects may be more far-reaching than you intend.</li>
            <li> BUT this also means french fries and finger foods are no longer finger friendly.</li>
            <li> For a second I got excited that this just might work.</li>
            <li> Recommend to many other friends.</li>
            <li> Directions say to repeat coat every other day, so hoping it will go away soon :)</li>
            <li> have used so many other products and they never work.</li>
            <li> My guess is it would work better with other kids, but no luck with mine.</li>
            <li> reading the many glowing reviews of this product on this and other websites, we decided to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had to learn to eat food with her other hand to avoid touching her thumb to her food or her face.  </li>
            <li> I think it is safe to say I am officially no longer a nail bitter!</li>
            <li> Just as many other reviewers I bought this from my child&#x27;s dentist to stop him from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> This product works so much better than any other product I tried for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> be sure to put it on all fingers every other day</li>
            <li> I am also happy to report that he now has enough new growth that I actually had to clip several nails.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re as eager as anyone to find a magic bullet to fix this problem, but we have concluded that using alcohol and solvents of unknown efficacy and safety is too high a risk.  </li>
            <li> My beautiful little 3 year old girl sucked on her thumb like an addict chased their next high.</li>
            <li> I read all of the great reviews but remained skeptical since my 5yo daughter was an avid thumbsucker.</li>
            <li> Our son was pretty much born with his thumb in his mouth, where it stayed until he was 3-1/2 years old</li>
            <li> oI was very hopeful in the beginning when I first used this product on my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> BUT not nasty enough, apparently.  </li>
            <li> Point two is important because generally this is a sub-conscious habit that I believe I&#x27;ll need to consciously break.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it any more now and just clipped his nails for the first time in quite a while a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> At almost 4 she shouldn&#x27;t really remember the trauma of it when she is older.  </li>
            <li> and she is more active now , her speech is improving as well.</li>
            <li> Ok it works but the whole experience is probably not worth it.</li>
            <li> It knocks the taste of the product down a good bit, especially after getting a bath.</li>
            <li> you bite your nails, chew up the skins of your fingers or enjoy picking up change off the ground with ease due to healthy long fingernails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful as she is a different child, more social and talkative, not to mention her bite is improving!</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly for anyone who wants to quit.</li>
            <li> Thanks, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any family whose child wants to stop.  </li>
            <li> I first bought it about 3 years ago, and held off submitting a review because I wanted to see if it really worked long term, since I&#x27;ve only ever been able to stop biting my nails temporarily.</li>
            <li> (Yesterday, I caught him in his sleep putting them in his mouth, but the he made a funny face and took them right back out and went on sleeping!)</li>
            <li> The first day he put his fingers in his mouth repeatedly and pulled them right back out.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, my daughter has also declared that she no longer needs her \\&quot;special white blanket\\&quot; which she used to rub on while she was sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I explained to my daughter that it was time for her to be a big girl and that this special polish was going to help her do that.</li>
            <li> this after reading the reviews; immediately following the first application he stuck his thumb in his mouth and spit it right out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know why, I just do - take a quick swipe of them with my hand, swiping all 5 at the same time.</li>
            <li> The bitter taste it has is so incredibly intense that it outweighs even my strong urge to bite.</li>
            <li> I would suggest only making a quick swipe across the nail bed as it doesn&#x27;t take much on the finger to keep it out of the mouth.</li>
            <li> It goes away and is easily washed away, but it&#x27;s enough to keep you conscious of what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product worked for about a day and half until my daughter (2 years old) decided she liked it and proceeded to bite her nails anyway.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for people to be giving less stars if it didn&#x27;t work on their younger kids.</li>
            <li> In the past 4 weeks we have had amazing results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works exactly like a clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeping it around to actually use in future if he doesn&#x27;t naturally stop sucking his thumb at bed time, but for now I&#x27;d call it a huge success!</li>
            <li> Beware though, the first night, he was up all night spitting and needing water to clear the taste out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> This put a bitter taste in her mouth and worked from the very first time we used it, we&#x27;re on day 6 of no thumbsucking (day and night) and she is getting a party to celebrate her success.</li>
            <li> We first tried using this on our 2.5 yr old for thumb sucking and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My two year old stopped sucking her thumb the whole weekend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid nail and cuticle biter since I was 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> My two-year old sucked her thumb consistently while sleeping</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumb immediately after the first application.  </li>
            <li> but we could not use it full fledged as the box says \\&quot;only for 3+ yrs\\</li>
            <li> It somewhat deterred him, mostly because of the idea of it I think, but I had to reapply it daily and two weeks into the whole process he is still biting his fingers and nails albeit not quite as often as prior to our using Mavala.</li>
            <li> What turned into a cool trick is now a gross problem.</li>
            <li> First we tried \\&quot;THUM,\\&quot; which my 3 1/2 year old just sucked off.  </li>
            <li> We painted it on our 3 year old thumbs the first night and it has been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> the thumb sucking came back full force.  </li>
            <li> We tried this on our 3-year old and the first 2 days he did not like it at all and stopped sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty well for my 5 yr old son, although I think pool water (chlorine or something) makes it come</li>
            <li> and it only took about 2 full days for her to stop completly.</li>
            <li> My three year old at first didn&#x27;t like the taste but</li>
            <li> My son stopped completely after first use.</li>
            <li> The first time we applied it to our 2-year old daughter&#x27;s thumbs, she stopped.  </li>
            <li> I first tried Thums on my 2 year old daughter when she started biting her nails.</li>
            <li> It might be useful for a very taste sensitive child or an adult that just want&#x27;s a reminder.</li>
            <li> At bedtime, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and got a full taste which caused her to gag and throw up several times.</li>
            <li> It did make my 2 yr old throw up the first time I put it on his thumb</li>
            <li> I have a full bottle left and don&#x27;t need it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece, who was three years old when she first tried it.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 33 years old and my nails are &amp;#34;human sized&amp;#34; for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> He would not put his fingers near his mouth after the first application.</li>
            <li> My four year old stopped sucking his thumb from the first night</li>
            <li> thumb guards are the only true solution.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm;) It helps with stopping my three year old from sucking her thumb, she hates the taste, therefor she stops and restrains herself from putting her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I made my peace by realizing she eats her boogers (from time to time) and occasionally indulges in a mouth full of dirt for and afternoon snack.</li>
            <li> First let me say, do not let the rating of 2 sway you completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mavala Stop since I received it and although it hasn&#x27;t completely prevented my granddaughter from sucking her two fingers, she is aware that she will receive the &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; on her fingers if she places them in her mouth.</li>
            <li> My 2.5yr old son stuck his thumb in his mouth on the first day that he was born.</li>
            <li> Within the first week I completely stopped biting.</li>
            <li> It definitely lasted a full day or two.  </li>
            <li> 7 yr old missed lots of sleep first night since started sucking as fell asleep then ended up trying to wash out the taste.</li>
            <li> Just after the first time I used it it made me quit biting completely for over 3 years....</li>
            <li> The first time she sucked her thumb, she gagged and almost puked,i kept a trash can near her</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t solve the problem as my child was sucking her thumb a week later with 2 full coats of polish on each thumb.</li>
            <li> I found her sucking her thumb in the middle of the night with a full coat on thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> After the first application wore off, he did reverto to old ways</li>
            <li> The thumbsucking completely stopped about one month after applying the first application.</li>
            <li> was exactly what we were looking for to get our 4 year old to stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and the bottle still looks as full as it did the day it arrived.  </li>
            <li> 3.5 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumbs in the first day.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s highly sensitive to tastes, and so when we first put it on, he cried and howled and swore he&#x27;d never let us do it again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice for nail-biters (unrelated to the product) : I got acrylic nails on top of my severely bitten nails (down to the cuticles).</li>
            <li> I noticed one of her nails had been bitten down, so I used it one more time.  </li>
            <li> and they were both amazed and were sure to write down the name of the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how conditioning works even when you&#x27;re older than a child - when this is on my nails, my hands are NOT going near my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I used Mavala instead of a thumb guard because in hindsight, if I&#x27;d gotten a thumb guard, she would&#x27;ve just sucked her other fingers!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many other moms!</li>
            <li> It felt dry to me before I&#x27;d went to bed, but I found that about an hour to an hour and a half were the best times for it to be totally dry!</li>
            <li> I had little faith, thinking it similar to another \\&quot;paint on\\&quot; product that had no effect, but the reviews were good, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> The clear coat is a little shiny and looks nice.  </li>
            <li> It is so strong that even eating a sandwich, crackers, etc would allow enough contact to get a full taste of the bitter flavor.  </li>
            <li> I went out and bought brand new nail polish to celebrate!  </li>
            <li> We also gave her an incentive to stop sucking her thumb ( a new bike!)  </li>
            <li> So as we laid him down, we quickly turned on the video monitor because we knew that thumb would quickly go in.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes that this product would work since my destist recommended it to me, however, this did not work for my 3 year old son, he have a very sirious thumb sucking habbit.</li>
            <li> This did not work for my 3.5 year old daughter, but I think it&#x27;s due more to the fact that she is very stubborn.</li>
            <li> I need to get a new bottle, as he is sucking his thumb again since it broke (though not as much).  </li>
            <li> When probed, she just said, &amp;#34;Yeah, it tastes kind of bad, but I kind of like it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Heard it many times and each time, we tried to change the subject.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought some thumbsucking gloves, but he was able to take them off.</li>
            <li> At the end of a week it will be duller and more matte, but also less effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the end of a week it will be duller and more matte, but also less effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We literally applied this TWICE, just to the top half of his thumb nail, over the course of 4 days.  </li>
            <li> We were able to stop using mavala after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> he was playing with toys more, and sucked his finger less.</li>
            <li> It takes about a day in a half before he&#x27;s able to start putting his thumb in his mouth</li>
            <li> and he has tried once more in the week and a half of using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is so bitter, and so easily transferable from fingers to food, that after one application and one ruined meal my son tearfully promised not to bite his nails again, and for a month now has not.  </li>
            <li> This has surely help to curve the habit of my daughter sucking her finger in less than a week</li>
            <li> He used about half the bottle and it took about two weeks to reduce and two more to quit.</li>
            <li> Beware though - initially you will be ruining finger foods and the like - as others have attested to - however, you quickly learn how to work around this.</li>
            <li> It has such mild unnoticeable taste FOR ME that I had to test it on two friends.</li>
            <li> I was able to get my 8-year-old son to stop nail-biting entirely after only three applications.</li>
            <li> biting - 0.2 Oz / Pack, 3 Packs]], which wore off quickly and had to be constantly reapplied.  </li>
            <li> (we&#x27;d recently taken away her pacifier and she&#x27;d quickly replaced it with her thumb...</li>
            <li> They learned really quickly though and now, one week later, they have both stopped.</li>
            <li> My older one got scared watching her and has stopped biting her nails.</li>
            <li> It also was still on his nails several days later - even after washing his hands many times.  </li>
            <li> By Monday afternoon, I could see decent nail growth on both children.</li>
            <li> I would recommend some sort of &amp;#34;special shirt&amp;#34; (closed off hands) or thumb guard for night time, and then mavala during the day, when it is more of a battle of wills or a conscious decision to suck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li> I think it was easier when she was older and had the will to do it.</li>
            <li> Super simple to apply it is just like nail polish.</li>
            <li> She wouldn&#x27;t go back to sucking that thumb even after several days when I was sure it had worn off</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with an older child.</li>
            <li> My son mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime, and during the night.</li>
            <li> In the end, it had reduced the sucking tremendously and I only catch her every now</li>
            <li> You only have to put it on every 3 days or so, and it dries quickly when</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting I&#x27;ll have nice long nails before too long.</li>
            <li> My main concern with both Hoof and Malvala is that the lingering bitterness will desensitize my daughter too it.</li>
            <li> Overall these challenges are avoidable if careful, and its a really effective product.  </li>
            <li> So ending your nail-biting habit if anxiety related might take more than a simple paint on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle has more than enough in it to last for what we need and the product does work for us.  </li>
            <li> We tried many different things to get her to stop, reward charts, painting nails with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> She likes to suck on two of her fingers on a particular hand</li>
            <li> The next day, we applied more but this time on a larger surface area of his thumb.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, he did not put it back in.</li>
            <li> few years ago, I had several I thought to be good bouts of non-biting after reading this book</li>
            <li> I had tried a different product called Thumb that worked for about zero seconds, the taste was really mild and was probably meant for toddlers.</li>
            <li> however, this clever girls knows when I forget to put no the Mavala</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work, my son was waaaaay tooooooo clever for this item.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the texture.  </li>
            <li> Works decently.</li>
            <li> appears to last a good few months&lt;</li>
            <li> I also make sure to keep her nails as short as possible.</li>
            <li> My older daughter did have a gagging episode, but just once.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and keeps parent from being the constant enforcer.</li>
            <li> The next time, I put on more and also tested it on her older sister, just to see if it was actually working.  </li>
            <li> but as she was getting older it became a habit.</li>
            <li> My main problem with this product is that it made my daughter gag and cry.  </li>
            <li> The box does state that toddlers may find the bitter taste appealing because of under developed taste buds.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied several times a day and works instantly.</li>
            <li> I have daughters who are much older and knew if she didn&#x27;t stop now, she never would.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work, try it again when they&#x27;re older.  </li>
            <li> The older one just powered through it and sucked it all off ...</li>
            <li> Later that night I caught myself biting my nail and quickly tasted the Mavala and removed my finger.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe now that he&#x27;s older</li>
            <li> Probably works well for adults and older motivated kids.  </li>
            <li> Couple of days later he actually started asking for more solution as he managed to develop a taste for it.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I think if the child is older they would figure out how to scratch the coating off or otherwise remove it.  </li>
            <li> I always believe the more expensive the better the product.</li>
            <li> The official who responded to our inquiry seemed concerned about the solvents and alcohol that form the main ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> but I would say not till shes older.</li>
            <li> During that time I have tried many many products along with willpower to stop - all failed.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY different methods to stop nail biting and this is the ONLY product that has worked for me!</li>
            <li> Children are clever and can put two and two together.  </li>
            <li> then quickly so I applied it again next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Your nails will definitely grow quickly and it also works as a hardener.  </li>
            <li> When she gets older, if she has problems, i will give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would  never last more than a couple days without starting up the habit once again</li>
            <li> This product stays on your nails, even after washing your hands, and has a strong bitter taste that lingers.  </li>
            <li> (made it kind of like a fun game</li>
            <li> The bitter taste was so strong that she could not stand to put her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> She was reluctant to put her fingers in her mouth because of the strong bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Well, the very first day I put that stuff on I (again, absentmindedly) took a quick double swipe of my left hand...</li>
            <li> This was (very little) money well spent for such great results!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy my kids really want to get rid of this bad habit themselves, they like that their nails are longer now and not ugly and all chewed up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really quite surprised at how well this product works!</li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t taste much so it was already wearing off pretty well, but it was enough to stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying my second bottle right now, it really works.</li>
            <li> Only word of caution for this product - its really strong, and you will taste it if you are not careful while eating with your hands.  </li>
            <li> While I think emotional and mental readiness certainly played a role, I was surprised at how well Mavala Stop put her over the top on the first night.</li>
            <li> Washing your hands seems to dull it out more quickly, and removes some of the taste, but not all, by far.</li>
            <li> Washing your hands seems to dull it out more quickly, and removes some of the taste, but not all, by far.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with a nail-biting habit.</li>

            <li> We ended up stopping its use since it&#x27;s so high in chemical content</li>
            <li> : Ethyl acetate is a respiratory tract irritant and, at high concentrations, it causes narcosis and depression of heart function [Hathaway et al. 1991].</li>

            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first two days I didn&#x27;t get a taste of it at all as I was very conscious about putting my hands anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> high price to pay for a habit that will wear off eventually.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> I do think that it is important though to make sure you only apply the mavala on the nail bed only try not to touch the skin, my theory is that this will help not to have the bitter taste while she eats and touches the skin.</li>
            <li> Well, we tried it because of the high, high rating.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend, and I NEVER write reviews.  </li>

            <li> HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on his thumb he must have forgot it was on and threw up a little, but after that he was fine.  </li>
            <li> I tried many other polishes with my 5 year old that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my one-year old and did not realize this is for older kids... much older!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews for this product, I was so excited that I finally found something that would get my 3 year old son to stop sucking his finger.</li>
            <li> After trying some other creative ways of breaking the habit, I decided to purchase Mavala Stop to see if it would deter me from putting my fingers near my mouth.</li>
            <li> and I honestly thought that it would not work since this is for 3yr+ due to to smaller kids</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t something I will intentional put anywhere near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were almost certain nothing would help our 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Before I begin my review, a little bit of background of who was using it: I&#x27;m 23 years old now, but when I was very young I noticed my mother biting her own nails, and in my toddler mind, I thought I was supposed to mimic her, which resulted in a very fierce nail biting habit from my early childhood.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and would recommend it for those kids who can understand a little better and are a little older.</li>
            <li> you read that correct, one time of putting \\&quot;clear nail polish\\&quot; to have her stop sucking her thumb!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;Oh, that tastes a little funky.\\</li>
            <li> and when she got her first taste of it she had a major fall out.  </li>
            <li> And that little bit of encouragement made the tears stop and made her hold her thumb out and say, \\&quot;OK, Mommy</li>
            <li> It is a little shiny, but it looks a lot better than having mangled nails from biting.</li>
            <li> That night I applied a little more on both thumbs.</li>
            <li> I finally ordered this and after the first time i put it on her thumb, she hasn&#x27;t sucked it since!</li>
            <li> recommend this product completely!!  </li>
            <li> Sure, this little bottle or putrid stuff is like $14.</li>
            <li> Our eighteen month old has been sucking her thumb with gusto since she was born!!</li>
            <li> Okay, I have been biting my nails since I was a little kid.</li>
            <li> so it looks okay, just a little shine.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never put your hands near your mouth again!!</li>
            <li> Any time there is even a little bit of &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; at the top of my nail, its gone within the day.</li>
            <li> Of course every child is different and results will vary but if you are consistent it does work!</li>
            <li> The taste is more like a little zap-</li>
            <li> My 8-yr-old son has white at the tips of his fingernails for the first time since he was 2!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a battle, so what actually transpired was not how I was imagining this whole thing would go, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier, that&#x27;s for certain!</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old suddenly started biting her nails right down until they were sore and bright red.  </li>
            <li> Just in time for her adult teeth to grow in and most importantly, she won&#x27;t get sick as much!!!!</li>
            <li> This most certainly has.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small bottle</li>
            <li> other than that its been way easy.</li>
            <li> However, the taste of the nail polish is easily transferred to other things like finger foods (chips etc.).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use (like applying nail polish) and we&#x27;ve not yet noticed any change in her diet (due to transfer of the taste to her food).</li>
            <li> My son has no idea that he even puts his thumb in his mouth, so it&#x27;s hard for him to stop on his own.</li>
            <li> I had been encouraging her to stop, but it was too hard for her to break the habit on her own.</li>
            <li> Nit worth 1 cent let alone the actual high price.</li>
            <li> The first night was hard, as he woke up every time he put his thumb in his mostly asleep mouth...</li>
            <li> Sure beats having to get braces somewhere down the road because of thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> Make sure to put only a little bit on top of her fingernails because that stuff stays on for a long time and it will get on anything she touches.</li>
            <li> It came super fast and worked so well on my one daughter the other one, not so much.......</li>
            <li> We sat down with her and offered to put on &#x27;special nail polish&#x27;, but in return would also paint the rest of her nails for the first time.</li>
            <li> was not as impressed as I thought I would be with this product it does not taste as bad as it should taste, it is shiny</li>
            <li> Really, though, I&#x27;d rather have the attention to pitted, cracked, and short nails, than I would to a swollen, red finger filled with some sort of infectious goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really, though, I&#x27;d rather have the attention to pitted, cracked, and short nails, than I would to a swollen, red finger filled with some sort of infectious goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far, I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this really works, so far i haven&#x27;t seen my son put his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with Tourette&#x27;s/OCD and have struggled with nail biting my whole life.  </li>
            <li> yr old dad who has also been biting his nails his whole life stopped after using Mavala.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to break this habit before she started getting her adult teeth in.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucked her thumb so much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in over a week, and they have grown longer than they&#x27;ve ever been (which isn&#x27;t all that far, haha).  </li>
            <li> However, didn&#x27;t work very well for my 6 yr old to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> six year old daughter sucked her thumb very often.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 17 year old daughter who has bitten her nails her whole life.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was skeptical, but this product is inexpensive and works great for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you want to keep reapplying, but that can get tiresome.</li>
            <li> Great concept but useless when a child gets to a point where he/</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to prevent my 6 yrs old daughter from sucking her thumb,and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> While the incision looks normal, I&#x27;m pretty sure she managed to pull out at least some of her surface stitches.  </li>
            <li> old daughter get ready for braces.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely amazed how fast it worked.</li>
            <li> My 5-year old twin daughters absolutely refused to stop sucking their thumbs.  </li>
            <li> So much so, that he won&#x27;t put his hands near his mouth.</li>
            <li> Great bitter, bitter taste which definitely stops my nervous nail nibbling habit.  </li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 yr old daughter has sucked her thumb her whole life.  </li>
            <li> But with a young child, it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how fast my 13 year old stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Also used it on our 5 year old niece and it worked very well for her.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my 10 year old son.  </li>
            <li> This worked really well to help my 3 year old stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter really wanted to stop sucking her fingers, but she said she didn&#x27;t know how to stop.</li>
            <li> It must really stay on there, because my 6.5 year old says he can taste it for a day or two after I paint it on--even after washing his hands.  </li>
            <li> He was sucking on the fingers so much that he has sores on both of those fingers and the nails are extremely soft and brittle.</li>
            <li> my 20 month old  son would suck his thumb so much that he got marks on his thumb from it...</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to be very regular in applying it during the crucial early phase when they need the most help.</li>
            <li> We kept on using it for a few more weeks, but now we do not even need to do that.</li>
            <li> But it wouldn&#x27;t be cute when in a few years her teeth would be all misaligned and we would be paying substantial orthodontic bills.  </li>
            <li> He was unaware he was using his tongue &amp; if an another kid saw it they would laugh.</li>
            <li> Overall I can&#x27;t stop singing this products success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price to not just grow out your nails but break the entire habit..</li>
            <li> I feel like one bottle is going to last me a long time even though I use it every so many days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Click buy, have your children be responsible for applying it, and move on to the next challenge as a parent ;).</li>
            <li> For a normal nail biter who doesn&#x27;t mind the glossy look</li>
            <li> you the same success--</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to use all of the contents in the jar because it was dried shut.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been chewing his fingernails for at least 20 years by his own account.  </li>
            <li> some crying in the night (need some compromise on your sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: tried to thumbsuck one time, just to be sure I applied again.</li>
            <li> first few hrs were filled with tears and mommy giving him OJ to wash away the taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loaned it out to several friends, who&#x27;ve also had success with it.</li>
            <li> A few tantrums occurred which we assist her through by distracting her with book reading, a bubble bath and lots of love and encouragement.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> But that is not a negative thing...</li>
            <li> We applied for a few weeks just to make sure.</li>
            <li> Overall for the price of this product it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Assuming I would need to reapply in two nights, as instructed, I figured it would be a week or two before success would be achieved, but it WORKED with only ONE use!</li>
            <li> Finally, our ped dentist nicely told us he was destroying his mouth and gently insisted we stop listening to mommy bloggers and use this product.</li>
            <li> He stated that it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;tasty\\&quot; and pretty much kept it out of his mouth the entire time for that day.</li>
            <li> if she used it everyday, I&#x27;m sure that it would keep her from biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> Today I actually had to trim most of my nails (before this photo was taken) because they were getting too long.</li>
            <li> Their tastebuds are definitely not developed enough to be able to dislike this and stop finger sucking.</li>
            <li> the nail beds are beginning to take the shape of normal beds which may occur in another 6 months or so from what I read.  </li>
            <li> Not their fault, but if you are going to get this product, make sure that you are going to stick with it and not eat finger foods for a few weeks/months.</li>
            <li> Is been 11/2 month since she stop sucking her tomb that even her tomb looks like normal.  </li>
            <li> My thumb-sucking daughter \\&quot;tasted\\&quot; this product only about 3 or 4 times before deciding it wasn&#x27;t worth \\&quot;tasting\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li> never expected it to work that fast or that well!</li>
            <li> I have to reapply it at least twice a week for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> went to a local salon and started with a fresh manicure.</li>
            <li> I have tried eating normal food (e.g. cut fruits or chips).with my fingers as well.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this is that it stays on the nails for a long time, so if you give your kid finger foods to eat they will still be able to taste the bitterness and might not like that food</li>
            <li> We never discussed it, she never complained and let me reapply without a fight,&lt;br /&gt;Done</li>
            <li> A few days to a week and things should be much better at night.  </li>
            <li> Dream come true solution for our almost 5 year old son who was sucking his thumb still at bedtime or for comfort occasionally on couch.</li>
            <li> My son will be 3 in a few more months and has sucked 2 of his fingers forever.</li>
            <li> but now they are a normal mens length</li>
            <li> the reviews said and now I&#x27;m left with about $9.75 out of $10 worth of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> So once again it has to be applied at least twice  a week in order to be effective.</li>
            <li> I did apply the Mavala stop every few days for almost 3 weeks just to make sure we didn&#x27;t have a relapse.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend starting this on a weekend, though - she didn&#x27;t get much sleep the first night because she kept sticking her thumb in her mouth inadvertently</li>
            <li> If there is one negative thing it is that it makes your nails looks kind of glossy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but in this I will because the reviews that I read did help me decide to make this purchase</li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t normally be an issue, but I have found this stuff to give me a sore throat akin to strep in severity.  </li>
            <li> We bought her a book, showed her pictures of crooked teeth from thumb sucking, and tried to put colorful band aids on her thumbs.</li>
            <li> so be sure to be consistant and re-apply few times.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, she only threw a minor fit during her second application.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, she only threw a minor fit during her second application.  </li>
            <li> This definitely worked for us and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Within a few days he stopped biting them for the most part and then within a week he was done biting them altogether.  </li>
            <li> and they taste pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> Now a month later, we&#x27;re just about ready to cut his nails for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> I red the reviews and thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> No negative effects.</li>
            <li> When I read the negative reviews about it being too strong, I thought, this is exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> Great product but starts to dry out a little after a bit but still worked well!!</li>
            <li> Applied the first night while asleep-- she coughed and gagged mildly a couple of times, but that was it; has barely put her thumb in her mouth since then (5 days later), and she was a frequent thumb-sucker.  </li>
            <li> And of course the first thing she did was put her fingers in her mouth to only find the strong bitter taste to be so displeasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first we thought maybe we didn&#x27;t make the right decision by telling her it was bitter nail polish and what it was going to do.  </li>
            <li> Our 5 year old son has been biting his nails since he was old enough to bring his fingers to his mouth and no amount of reminding, begging, rewards, removal of favorite toys or other creative solutions would stop him from biting his nails past the quick.... and he would even gnaw his cuticles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes your nails are a bit shiny after applying Mavala Stop, which more or less equates to a clear coat of nail polish that tastes horrendous....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing it for 25+ years and have half hazardously tried to stop several times to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure to put on nails only and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for children under 3 because their taste buds are not fully developed and can easily adapt to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> The second day it might not be strong enough to keep them from sucking or nail bitting.</li>
            <li> Finally a product was strong enough to break the will of a stubborn 7 year-old with a 5 year habit of biting nails!!!!  </li>
            <li> I found that even after washing my hands several times a day and even taking a shower the taste still will linger for a second day though it is not as strong.  </li>
            <li> I found that even after washing my hands several times a day and even taking a shower the taste still will linger for a second day though it is not as strong.  </li>
            <li> reviews for Mavala were so great and cost was minimal compared to the other options, I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been explaining to her that she is a big girl and needs to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I think alternatives like this that will require much attention and consideration to use properly don&#x27;t get suggested by the docs because they presume that most people are not willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li> It does begin to wash off within a couple days and needs to be reapplied but even so the single bottle has been more than enough.  </li>
            <li> This product, though applied properly, transferred to any food my son touched and he tried to quit eating for days because nothing tasted right.</li>
            <li> But after a day, she went right back to sucking her thumb even with nightly applications.</li>
            <li> then he was right back to sucking.</li>
            <li> My daughter stopped sucking her thumb right away, especially at night when we had the hardest time with it.  </li>
            <li> simce he was about 14 months, right after i had my 2nd son and took his binki away!!</li>
            <li> Only works while she is awake, but as soon as she falls asleep her thumb goes right in her mouth and does not seem to bother her</li>
            <li> It worked for maybe a week and he was right back to it.</li>
            <li> (it lasts for about a day) and she&#x27;ll go right back to sucking.</li>
            <li> I applied it on my son&#x27;s right thumbnail the same day we got it just before his bed time.</li>
            <li> She then commented that it &amp;#34;tasted funny&amp;#34; and put it right back in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Put the finger right back in.</li>
            <li> He is right back to biting and no amount of polish is working.</li>
            <li> Anytime we washed his hands, for instance after he used the bathroom or came in from playing outside, it seemed to wash right off</li>
            <li> We just jumped right back on it when we got home.</li>
            <li> My kids ignored it or washed their hands to get it off then went right back to nail biting.</li>
            <li> and he would have his thumb right back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> so I put it right back on.</li>
            <li> but then she just gets over it and goes right back to it.  </li>
            <li> it was only his right hand</li>
            <li> so she pulls it right back out.  </li>
            <li> but she&#x27;d go right back to sucking her thumbs as soon as we stopped applying it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;7 mths later my son is 4 yrs old &amp; occasionally we will find him sucking his thumb in his sleep or find evidence of it because his thumb is cracked &amp; dry, but during the day he is free of thumb sucking which is perfectly fine with us.</li>
            <li> This stuff works unbelievably well, the bitter taste is so strong you definitely will not be able to bite through it!</li>
            <li> At her last dentist appointment the dentist said she was going to loose her top and bottom front teeth because of the pressure she was putting on the teeth while sucking.  </li>
            <li> the taste that this leaves in your mouths really reminds you (very abruptly) not to do it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid he would cry or not be able to put himself to sleep with out his fingers, but he did fine!</li>
            <li> The following night pretty much the exact same thing happened.  </li>
            <li> bottle recommends putting it on every other day, which I will say is accurate.  </li>
            <li> and my pinky was becoming a shriveled mess.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son constantly bit his nails, and this worked well as long as he had it, but he kept fussing about not being able to eat, and refused application all together.</li>
            <li> The real dark magic happens when you try to bit a nail coated in this transparent horror</li>
            <li> because the first day, after lots of talk about being such a big girl, a fun reward if she stopped, etc.</li>
            <li> This seems to work great and the small size will still last quite a while, even with regular applications.  </li>
            <li> (my habit is extremely stubborn, and even when I stopped using this product because I thought I had defeated the habit I found myself making mistakes unconsciously time and again), but the longevity of the product means it&#x27;s always available when I start to slip up and need it&#x27;s not-so-gentle reminder again.</li>
            <li> 5 (almost 6) year old girl is a little more stubborn.  </li>
            <li> It worked like a miracle :) i got this product, had the same old long talk with her and applied it on her finger before entering a movie theater to keep her mind off of it</li>
            <li> It definitely kept me from biting my nails, but was a little TOO effective.  </li>
            <li> On their website they say that there is going to be a new kit for nail biting.  </li>
            <li> and that she has now found a new confidence in herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gotten fed up with my 5 year olds new \\&quot;finger chewing\\&quot; habit and ordered this.  </li>
            <li> I tried New Years resolutions, hypnosis, and \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> For fellow guys, you will want acetone to remove layers before applying new ones.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We will keep the new bottle on hand for a lot longer this time.</li>
            <li> I have found a new method in which I chew gum a lot</li>
            <li> Tried everything - sewing socks on her pjs at nite, dipping her fingers in vinegar, putting tape/bandaids on her fingers at nite, distracting her, helping her to develop new habits, taping gloves on her hands at nite, telling her that if she stopped sucking her fingers she could go to Disneyland.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> The new problem now is she doesn&#x27;t want to break or file her nails....</li>
            <li> So my lil man who is newly minted five year didn&#x27;t argue or stay put for the polish job</li>
            <li> Now I am on the hook for a new bicycle and a trip to the aquarium...</li>
            <li> My son just started a new school</li>
            <li> He stopped within 24 hours of application and now he reminds me when it is time to put on a new application.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely live on without finer biting habits, but I cannot live a day without any non-bitter chip/cookie.</li>
            <li> It is my new year resolution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her new pediatric dentist recommended Mavala.  </li>
            <li> from  New York, USA</li>
            <li> he goes around tapping his newly grown nails on every surface in the house...</li>
            <li> I put a new coat on one a week.</li>
            <li> Out of nowhere one night I decided to look up new treatments for nail biters, thinking maybe some new miracle cure has came out.  </li>
            <li> It is still new to us but seems to be working.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been doing this a couple of years and really wants to stop, but has had a hard time and hasn&#x27;t been able to.  </li>
            <li> She used so little of the product that she was able to give it to someone else who had a similar positive experience with it.  </li>
            <li> effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN\\&quot; has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can&#x27;t be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!!  </li>
            <li> But touching your lips is also a bad habit, so that&#x27;s kind of a plus.</li>
            <li> One slight drawback I have noticed about this product is that it comes off easily during showering, so</li>
            <li> latter when she&#x27;s older and, hopefully, more sensitive to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> We only had success with one child, the 6.5 year old nail biter.  </li>
            <li> maybe if she was older like 3 years old i would try it again, hopefully she wont need it.</li>
            <li> It really is a bitter taste that lasts a good few minutes.</li>
            <li> Even my own Mom had applied a few products to my thumb as a child, but I simply washed it off.  </li>
            <li> As far as negative reinforcement is concerned, this product is extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> My seven year old took a while to get used to and kept on trying to put it back in his mouth, but the taste kept on reminding him that well, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> One slip and your entire mouth and lips are filled with a gross taste that you never want to experience again.</li>
            <li> I will try that with my 2 year old IF it doesn&#x27;t work &#x27;as is&#x27; when he&#x27;s older.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use this product for a few months and now have basically stopped chewing completely.</li>
            <li> However, by the third day, I didn&#x27;t really think that much about it.</li>
            <li> Our son is almost 4 years old and mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime or for comfort when he was upset.</li>
            <li> of course at some point in time, my fingers were in my mouth and my taste buds were instantly assaulted by the most foul, bitter taste ever.  </li>
            <li> I am a compulsive nail biter and before this product I have tried numerous products available at local pharmacies to try to help me stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for my 4 years old son.</li>
            <li> I finally have normal looking, not gnarly nails, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> has been a little harder, and we have found we do have to be more consistent with reapplying the polish with him; however, with the polish on, he does avoid sucking his fingers much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the stuff i tried before was very thick and almost fun to bite off, i was pretty sure that this would be the same.  </li>
            <li> As long as you put this on about every three days till they dont have the desire it really really works!!</li>
            <li> It may seem a little extreme, but I think with the right approach and lots of communication, you can handle the situation the best way possible to cure the habit without traumatizing your little one.  </li>
            <li> It may seem a little extreme, but I think with the right approach and lots of communication, you can handle the situation the best way possible to cure the habit without traumatizing your little one.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re an adult and dedicated to breaking the habit, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is nearly 5 and with kindergarten imminent, and flu season in high swing we decided</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes of breaking my daughter (6yrs old) of sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> But I have to speak up for this product; I believe it could work if your child has a very sensitive palette.</li>
            <li> I never thou my litter will leave this habiat in only 1 week, thak you very much for  selling this product.</li>
            <li> In my case to help remember not to put the thumb in his mouth, I wrapped a very soft tape below the nails to remind him not to put the thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> It will definitely deter anyone from biting as the taste is very very strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worked right away to deter my 3 year old from sucking.</li>
            <li> We checked on her, and there she was fast asleep, thumb in mouth, so before nap the next day I applied a little more.</li>
            <li> It needs to be reapplied every few days as it tends to wear off pretty quick.</li>
            <li> My five year old started kindergarten this year!</li>
            <li> wow this stuff does!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t taste it at first but 5 seconds later you can&#x27;t get the taste out of your mouth for anything, can&#x27;t describe it....</li>
            <li> The product did only work during the first night, but my daughter hasn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb thereafter...</li>
            <li> , because i only needed that first week to break my habit, after that u should be in control.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I can see her teeth are slowly starting to turn, I can only imagine what a year more of this habit may incur - thank goodness</li>
            <li> My son is an avid thumb-sucker, so this was our last resort.  </li>
            <li> Last night I had to cut his nails for the very fist time since he was 3!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It has been 3 weeks, and he essentially stopped sucking after the first application.</li>
            <li> I do have to say she didn&#x27;t like the taste on that first night and even made herself throw up, but that was the only night she did that.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> old stopped sucking their thumbs!</li>
            <li> and she seems to have completely forgotten the habit!</li>
            <li> Also, please note, the package insert says that it likely WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN 3 AND UNDER as their taste buds don&#x27;t have the same sensitivity to the bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> I asked my nephew if it burned and said it only did once because my sister didn&#x27;t put the lotion first.</li>
            <li> I asked my nephew if it burned and said it only did once because my sister didn&#x27;t put the lotion first.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time last week and not bitten my nails since.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical at first, but when I finally saw nails of my son after one week of applying Mavala, my scepticism disappeared.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first night of using it, I noticed she kept her finger out of her mouth the following day</li>
            <li> Just needed 3 applications over 6 days and it stopped my 3 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking habit!  </li>
            <li> Its been almost 3 weeks and for the first time in my life, I can actually see the \\&quot;whites\\&quot; of my nails growing.</li>
            <li> I apply it every other day on top of my regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Mavala Stop for a month and my nails are growing, I am seeing white nail for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> First time in recent memory that I have quit \\&quot;chewen\\&quot; my nails for over a month.  </li>
            <li> She was so used to sucking her thumb to go to sleep we had to give her lots of extra TLC to help her go to sleep the first night.</li>
            <li> First I purchased Thum, which she had her fingers back in her mouth that evening.</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks, they both had completely stopped sucking their thumbs!</li>
            <li> After rave reviews online and watching the success with another child (5yr) at school, we had plans to stop our daughter&#x27;s (3.5yr) thumb sucking in one long weekend.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> she never puts her hands near her mouth anymore!.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks he had completely stopped biting his nails!</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using Mavala Stop, she stopped completely!  </li>
            <li> but after the first used and only used I did on him it work</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 yr old daughter would eat her fingers and toes!</li>
            <li> This was a last resort after trying hot sauce, gloves at night, tape on his thumb, etc.  </li>
            <li> He has completely stopped sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s enough to make him aware of what he is doing without me having to say a word.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t be such a surprise when i first bit my nails.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I havent put my fingers near my mouth in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> But after 5 just days, he had stopped sucking his thumb completely!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works pretty well but tends to wear off rather quickly, especially if you wash your hands often.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter would not keep her hands out of her mouth and nose!  </li>
            <li> Her finger wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near her lips!  </li>
            <li> Its not worth , dont buy, its not working for mydaughter, she still bites nail , will update review if sound any change</li>
            <li> my 5 year old daughter stopped after a week of this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mainly, I had to become aware of what I was physically doing so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a problem, since the directions are pretty much obvious (Shake.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a problem, since the directions are pretty much obvious (Shake.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm to get my 3 year old to stop sucking her 2 fingers!</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes gross, I have tried other stop biting nail in the past, but I was able to &amp;#34;get used to them, this product I do not think I will be able to.</li>
            <li> This was a boy who had his first two fingers in his mouth almost 24/7, and his teeth were already crooked because of it.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this is our last resort, as we&#x27;ve tried MANY other remedies to no avail.  </li>
            <li> she is so used to this nail paint, she almost know when exactly to put her thumb back for sucking after the nail paint is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter has been sucking her thumb since she was born!  </li>
            <li> After a recent visit to the dentist and his suggestion that she really really needed to stop, I bought Mavala Stop!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> The first time I put it on her thumbs, I painted the entire nail.</li>
            <li> First week she cried every night because she didn&#x27;t get her soothing, but a week later she even stopped trying to put her thumb in mouth.</li>
            <li> Helped my 5 year old to stop thumb sucking at night!</li>
            <li> At first I just did the middle of the nail fearing it would ruin his food</li>
            <li> After our first application, she stopped instantly!!!  </li>
            <li> I put it on yesterday, only once, for the first time</li>
            <li> He put them in his mouth for the first time moments later and started coughing.  </li>
            <li> The next day, however, she discovered her OTHER (non-treated) thumb, so I applied more Mavala.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li> Unless he tried again when i wasn&#x27;t looking, that first suck with the Mavala was also the last.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a stubborn 6 year old on my hands!</li>
            <li> My son has gotten used to it but says it&#x27;s still pretty gross.</li>
            <li> Now I have grown pretty solid nails after 35 years, and from time to time keep appreciating my fingers (my co-workers watch me suspiciously..</li>
            <li> Worked for my 6year old son!</li>
            <li> Same with hot sauce.</li>
            <li> Within 5 days she had COMPLETELY stopped sucking her thumb!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> , it was complete torture for her!</li>
            <li> So unbelievably surprised and grateful!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Mavala worked the first day, but by the 2nd day she was sucking her thumbs again.</li>
            <li> and she is terrified to put her hand near her face!</li>
            <li> Worked in a day to get my 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> but it was only that first night</li>
            <li> Cured my 6 year old&#x27;s nail biting habit in 3 days!  </li>
            <li> Also, the first night be prepared with some orange juice to help get rid of the taste so they will go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> I must say the first day, I only applied to the nails</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks on our 8 yr old daughter and she has not even attempted to suck her thumb again!</li>
            <li> I put it on my two year old daughter and after a week she stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> but the next evening, peaceful sleeping..</li>
            <li> We painted it on only her thumb nail, covering it the first night with two thorough coats of &#x27;polish&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> At first we tried to keep him busy/distracted during the day and it seemed to help however in the last 3 months</li>
            <li> Tried this on my 2 years old and  it works!  </li>
            <li> The results were instant from the first application.  </li>
            <li> , all it took was the first two times and she has not even looked at her thumbs the same way since!  </li>
            <li> However it got me a couple times that first day when I licked my fingers while preparing dinner, so becareful and encourge the use of silverware while using.my son since he sucked his middle and ring finger, which he doesnt use to eat.</li>
            <li> Day 1 - applied the nail polish (just a small dot on the top of the fingernail)&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> Intially we were so excited when we got the nail polish, because of all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> So far I think this will do the trick!</li>
            <li> and I have completely stopped biting my nails!  </li>
            <li> my almost 4 year old has sucked his thumb since before he knew he had fingers!  </li>
            <li> I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter who literally has been sucking her thumb since she was in the whomb!  </li>
            <li> I put the product on the first and 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> researched only the first ingredient, \\&quot;Ethyl Acetate,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve nearly completely kicked the habit!</li>
            <li> Apparently without that, picking their nose isn&#x27;t quite as much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first put it on only his nail.</li>
            <li> We originally bought it to get my then-two-year-old son to stop sucking his thumb as our kids were giving each other strep over and over.  </li>
            <li> One person told to put a tiny drop of hot sauce.</li>
            <li> So I first removed the blanket from the picture (probably a week prior to using Mavala)</li>
            <li> This product has helped me to completely stop biting my nails!</li>
            <li> She did have several relapses within the first 1-2 weeks, so I kept applying it at night.</li>
            <li> The first night I put it on, he had to keep a bottle of water next to his bed because he would start to suck his thumb in his sleep.  </li>
            <li> not sure how to describe the taste, but I would say more like a chemical taste.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I can still recall vividly the situation, months</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this is only the first step in stopping to bite your fingernails.</li>
            <li> but this one was the only product that really helped her!</li>
            <li> Within 5 days I must say she stopped completely sucking her thumb - and it has been 4 years since!</li>
            <li> Both kids have quit putting their fingers anywhere near their mouths!  </li>
            <li> Not to criticise anyone who does, but my children are tiny and making sure they got enough daily nutrition was of concern to me at that age.  </li>
            <li> It is highly likely that the first 3-4 days will be the roughest</li>
            <li> Not to criticise anyone who does, but my children are tiny and making sure they got enough daily nutrition was of concern to me at that age.  </li>
            <li> It is highly likely that the first 3-4 days will be the roughest</li>
            <li> I definitely see this ultimately working as it has significantly curtailed the habit.</li>
            <li> Should it ever come back, though, I&#x27;ll have this stuff ready!</li>
            <li> yet?\\&quot;  He adamantly refused!  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I now have actual fingernails that have to be filed and shaped.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to work on my 3 y/o with the first application, but after the second application the finger sucking behavior went away and did not return!  </li>
            <li> definitely worth it in the long run :D.</li>
            <li> This got me and my 4 year old son to stop biting our nails!</li>
            <li> I have been a life time nail biter, but with this stuff i do not want my fingers near my mouth!</li>
            <li> It took 4 days and she stopped completely!</li>
            <li> It works on my 5 yr old grandgirl!</li>
            <li> After the first taste my daughters thumb never went back in her mouth.</li>
            <li> That was the first and the last time she has sucked her thumb since.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> We tried painting her nails more and she would just tear past the paint with not a worry in the world.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its an anxiety thing or a boredom thing, but most of the time I don&#x27;t even realize that I&#x27;m doing it until someone&#x27;s like \\&quot;stop biting!!!!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Used this on my 3 year old to stop her thumb sucking and literally worked overnight!</li>
            <li> We tried this on my now 4 year old who has officially stopped sucking her thumbs with the help of Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li> At first he fought me about putting it on, but after the second night, he would just hold out his hand and let me put it on.  </li>
            <li> Our only mistake was not covering his hand that first night.</li>
            <li> so far It has!</li>
            <li> I had tried a similar product as a kid (thanks for trying, mom!)</li>
            <li> I put a lot on her whole nail on all her fingers and made sure it dried, 10 minutes later she was biting her nails!</li>
            <li> It tastes very bitter and it lasts through many hand washings for several days.</li>
            <li> My little one stopped sucking her thumb very quickly using this product.</li>
            <li> If it was this easy to stop thumb sucking and nail biting and cost so little...</li>
            <li> But it is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> 20 seconds later his lunch from earlier that day was on the floor (this is the clean version).  </li>
            <li> Maybe wait to use on a kid who can at least articulate themselves decently, because this stuff lingers and they need to be able to understand instructions from you to ensure they don&#x27;t keep getting it in their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long enough to leave a taste in my mouth, but it shows how quickly it works!  </li>
            <li> My nearly 5 year old daughter has been sucking her middle and ring fingers of her right hand since she was born.  </li>
            <li> My three year old was a prolific thumb sucker, and very strong willed.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my own thumb to try, and a little will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Both girls cried the first week, but I had to practice tough love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months since I purchased this product and let me first say that I have been a nail biter for the last 20 years, since I was VERY young, about 4, but now I have stopped completely and the urge to even put my fingers CLOSE to my mouth is 100% gone.</li>
            <li> For many years and many different and expensive techniques tried, my 9 year old daughter would not stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> She has completely stopped thumb sucking for almost a week now, and I only had to apply it one more time after the initial application (2 days after the initial one).</li>
            <li> It took a few nights for him to not put them in his mouth in the middle of the night and woke up to get a drink to wash his mouth out but the falling asleep habit went away right away!!!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for most, although the contents (ingredients)are a little scary, by the second day my two year old learned to have an aquired tatse for the product.  </li>
            <li> BUT, its so worth it in the end if you kick a life long habit!</li>
            <li> She is now 6 years old and her new teeth is coming.</li>
            <li> My son woke up in the middle of the night once for the first few nights, but after that he was fine.</li>
            <li> The taste lingers over a few days and doesn&#x27;t just wash off easily.</li>
            <li> I tried several more times, but no success.</li>
            <li> because you expected it to change you, instead of thinking that this is a quick fix, think of it as a post-it on every 1 of your fingers.</li>
            <li> The bottle gets stuck, but don&#x27;t make the mistake and leave it partially screwed because it dries out quick.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with initial hopes of using it on her to stop this from becoming a lifelong habit.</li>
            <li> However, I was furious at our dentist for recommending this product as a first line remedy for such a young child.</li>
            <li> My girls were old enough that I explained exactly what we were going to try.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my adult life, I am actually getting compliments on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worked on the first try with my 6 year old who constantly had her fingers in her mouth and bit her nails.</li>
            <li> It was really difficult to use at first, but I&#x27;ve learned to put small dots of the stuff where most effective, and to be cautious about putting my fingers near things that may go in my mouth.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different things with no success.</li>
            <li> However, when she half-woke up during the middle of the night she subconsciously started sucking her thumb (full force) and immediately started sticking her tongue out and fussing.  </li>
            <li> It is helpful but the bitter fading away just so quick</li>
            <li> He sucked his thumb from birth and after no more than 2 weeks he was completely thumb free!</li>
            <li> but then he liked the taste and instead of every other day I have to put it on every other hour.</li>
            <li> This was the first and ONLY stuff we tried for our almost five year old.  </li>
            <li> Another unconsidered advantage is that I am constantly aware of putting my hands to my face, which is a good thing to avoid in cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I gotta say, as a long time nail bitter</li>
            <li> My 23 month old did not approve of the taste at first, but became accustomed to it by the second day and continued to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> She said it tasted gross, but not bad enough for her to keep her fingers out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> However, my son grimaced for the first little while, then went right on sucking.  </li>
            <li> I was hesistant to use this product on my 20 month old daugther who was sucking her thumb very frequently.</li>
            <li> So I explained to her that now that she was three years old, she was big enough to use a \\&quot;special polish\\&quot; on her nails.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every single penny to me.</li>
            <li> However, due to the problems I had had with my older son, I thought it would be worth trying Mavala.</li>
            <li> very rarely write reviews on Amazon because I don&#x27;t usually have much to say.</li>
            <li> This along with the Bouncing Blue Large thumb sucking glove and a reward program ended our 6 year old thumb sucking in under a month!</li>
            <li> It was pretty bad, we called it bitter, but the best way to describe it was it reminded me of licking envelopes.  </li>
            <li> I applied sparkly nail polish first to make if fun and then a coat of the &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; on just her thumb (obviously you&#x27;ll want to apply to all nails if you have a nail bitter).  </li>
            <li> A great deal of other languages were represented in the instruction pamphlet, including German, Portugese, Spanish, French, and a number of Asian languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My daughter is 3 years old and has been sucking her two fingers since TWO DAYS OLD!</li>
            <li> There is more than enough in the bottle to last as long time.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old (26 month old) to be exact has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 5 months.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it for my 5 year old who was still sucking his thumb after intermittently starting and stopping on his own over the past year.  </li>
            <li> My 6-year old had his first two teeth come out as his adult teeth were fighting to come out at the same time.  </li>
            <li> He was perfectly willing to let me paint it on every night, and every morning I saw that the polish was missing from his right thumbnail.</li>
            <li> application seemed to last me about 4-5 days, more or less dependent on how often I washed my hands.</li>
            <li> People do not really notice that your nails are more shiny, and also I let the coating dry till its sticky then I touch my finger to it</li>
            <li> We thought this would be fabulous based on all the reviews, but after two coats of it that were allowed to dry, he stuck his thumb back in his mouth and looked at us like \\&quot;WHAT??\\</li>
            <li> and I could hear the same thumb sucking sound he always makes when he is sucking his thumb dry.</li>
            <li> still have more than half of the bottler left, and probably would use it on her sister!</li>
            <li> in less than 1 wk (only 4 applications) on my 3.5yr olds thumb nail he was done, we are 2 months thumb sucking free now!</li>
            <li> Finally, after two or three months, I went more than a day and a half without reapplying, and I never caught him again with his fingers in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> the other reviews were correct in indicating you only need a tiny drop for it to work as it is very strong.</li>
            <li> After a life long habit of nail biting this product has deterred me more than any other.</li>
            <li> I will say, one kid was smart enough that he figured out he could scratch it</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s just working for a short time, and seems to not be strong enough after the initial application.  </li>
            <li> Like one of those teeny little cheap nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products for nail biting and they would work for the first few days</li>
            <li> As a male user of this polish, I certainly did not want everyone around me to think I wear clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> I did further research and found that certain taste buds do not fully develop until a child is over 3 years old</li>
            <li> This product is very strong, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Subtle shine, easy to apply (even on a sleeping kid!).</li>
            <li> They suggested a cone, but our area only sells the plastic ones and the cat wouldn&#x27;t be able to eat, drink, sleep, or even get into her little house bed with it on, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  </li>
            <li> could she that she wanted to stop and most likely just needed a little help.  </li>
            <li> and I just applied a little bit to the top of his thumbnail, and we went outside to play -</li>
            <li> I tasted and it tasted moderately sharp and then went away quickly.</li>
            <li> I tried some other anti-nail biting creams that would come off too quickly</li>
            <li> We were really excited to hear about this product because our almost 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs for about a year and a half now.  </li>
            <li> It tastes really nasty and quickly and very successfully stopped him from nail biting.</li>
            <li> Our son agreed that it was hard to stop on his own, and agreed to \\&quot;extra</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly to help my 13 year old teen stop biting her nails, I applied it every 2-3 days, now she&#x27;s loosing the bad habit</li>
            <li> Anyway, to summarize I told my daughter that the Tooth Fairy knows how important good teeth are and that she makes kids&#x27; thumbs taste bad when she feels they&#x27;re a big girl/boy to help them stop sucking their thumbs.  </li>
            <li> it kept his thumb out of his mouth which was great since he likes to play in the garden and then will suck on a dirty thumb - reminders for 3 year olds</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few hours till it was dinner time, she was so disgusted with the taste on her fingers (not so great with her fork,</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few days and have already seen a huge improvement in my daughter&#x27;s nail biting.</li>
            <li> two or three times before touching the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;list of the good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;Really bad bitter taste that makes your want to gag</li>
            <li> It looks like clear polish.  </li>
            <li> The Mavala Stop arrived and I painted his whole thumb nail early the following morning while he was still asleep.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick however it goes on looking like clear nail polish and stays shiny which sort of bothered him.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly clear and shiny.</li>
            <li> Everyone told me that my 3 year old son would stop sucking his thumb when he was ready and that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  </li>
            <li> My three year old is autistic and she has a huge problem biting her nails</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has finally stopped sucking her thumb thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala Stop has a shine comparable to clear nail polish, but not as shiny as premium or ultra-shine clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala Stop has a shine comparable to clear nail polish, but not as shiny as premium or ultra-shine clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> I let my son watch me put clear polish on my nails</li>
            <li> and I can clearly see why she did not want her fingers with that taste in her mouth.</li>
            <li> my 6 yr  old daughter wants to stop sucking her thumb but needs the extra help to kick the habit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear - this is a nail polish.  </li>
            <li> To the guys: This stuff is like clear nail polish and does leave a shine.</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase a great tasting kids mouthwash too because when he put his thumb in his mouth while he was sleeping he screamed and cried about the awful taste and mouthwash did the trick.</li>
            <li> It looks like clear coat nail polish and lasts for a couple days.  </li>
            <li> She really didn&#x27;t want to stop sucking her thumb but was old enough to realize she had no choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear color</li>
            <li> Clear so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li> It is actually a clear nail polish that you can not see.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and it STAYS on my nail, even if I pick at my nails.</li>
            <li> For me, the taste sticks around well after a few days primarily because I have been making a conscious effort not to bite.</li>
            <li> It is just like clear nail polish; you cannot see it on his fingers.  </li>
            <li> It works just like clear nail polish and doesn&#x27;t get in the way of putting in contacts.</li>
            <li> We may resort to the clear cast thing for night time.  </li>
            <li> The polish goes on clear</li>
            <li> I really do like the product and so far it seems like it will definitely work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li> Helped my 4 year old daughter stop chewing her nails.</li>

            <li> i am one never to trust reviews or delve into gimmicks, this time i needed a product for my three year old to stop the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Since I wanted to put a ring on her finger and she was awfully conscious of her nails, I decided to buy this for her.  </li>
            <li> It tastes just like regular nail polish--maybe a hint stronger, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I have five year old twins.  </li>
            <li> After that she completely stoped.</li>
            <li> We are using in on our 9 year old.  </li>

            <li> The instruction says: Not for under 3 years old.</li>
            <li> This information is not to be found anywhere although the reviews suggest that this product has worked for 18month old.</li>
            <li> She is now 2 years old.</li>
            <li> The research says not to worry about your child sucking their thumb until around 5 years of age or when their adult teeth start coming in.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old that will bite his fingernails until they are sore.</li>
            <li> Well my two year old wouldn&#x27;t get rid of her passifer</li>
            <li> This product completely stopped my 3 1/2 year old son from biting his nails in just a couple days.</li>

            <li> My six year old daughter stopped sucking her thumb within 3 weeks but did not stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li> It is NOT harsh on the skin, nail, or mouth.</li>
            <li> I read in the instruction booklet after receiving the product that it isn&#x27;t meant for children under 3 because their taste buds aren&#x27;t fully developed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for both me and my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li> At 8 years old it is affecting his permanent teeth and the shape of his mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried this with my 10 year old daughter to get him to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that made me hope this would be the cure for my 5 year old daughter from sucking her fingers.  </li>

            <li> Hell it&#x27;ll even stop you from putting your fingers near your mouth.</li>
            <li> Your sandwich or pizza will taste bitter unless you&#x27;re careful to make sure your nails dont go anywhere near your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my 10 year old still sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how OFTEN you put your nails in or near your mouth until you have this stuff on your nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my almost four year old son who had been sucking his two fingers since he was four months old.  </li>

            <li> My wife and I didn&#x27;t have any concern (given how young she is</li>
            <li> For about a week, we tried to get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb by encouragement and rewards, but she was too young for that to work and said that stopping sucking her thumb would make her feel</li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;bite no more\\&quot; nail polish from Sally&#x27;s here in town to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>

            <li> I came to amazon.com and searched for thumb sucking remedies and saw the terrific reviews for Mavala Stop, saw the reasonable price, and thought what the heck...  </li>
            <li> I kept my fingers FAR away from my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Working well with my 6 year old nail biter.  </li>
            <li> I am 17 years old, and I&#x27;ve been biting my nails since before I can remember.</li>

            <li> read that a child&#x27;s taste buds are not fully developed before 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> It took ONE application and he stopped completely.</li>
            <li> My almost 3yr old cried when she tasted this on her thumb.  </li>

            <li> After trying the THUMB nail solution, band-aids, gloves on hands and everything else I had heard of, I had almost given up on finding a solution that would work for my 23 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li> and our doctor recommended we try to get her to stop sucking even though she was so young.</li>

            <li> My two year old son stopped sucking his thumb immediately, I just put it on in the morning and before he went to bed.</li>
            <li> This is going to take time, but with this stuff I think i can get him to break the habit young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old and have been chewing my nails since before I can remember.</li>
            <li> This worked for my 4 year old.</li>

            <li> This product is awesome, was skeptical about the product initially as I didn&#x27;t want my kid to be tasting the chemical stuff ,but they don&#x27;t after 1 or 2 trials, yep that bitter..</li>

            <li> My son is 16 years old and he ALWAYS chews his nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was hoping to break my 2-1/2 year old of her finger sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping this would keep my 4 yr old from bitting his fingers.  </li>
            <li> only issue I have with this product is that you can&#x27;t really eat with your fingers without tasting it (forget trying to pick something out of your teeth...gag).  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it for almost five weeks and has completely stopped sucking her thumb (and twirling her hair).  </li>
            <li> This stuff does work and I tried it on my 4 year old but until he wanted to quit sucking his thumb nothing worked.</li>
            <li> If you are an adult who bites their nails</li>

            <li> Purchased this for my almost four year old son, who has been a thumbsucker since he was 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> If his thumsucking habits were different (not during sleep), I would absolutely use this.  </li>
            <li> At first he kept sucking his finger then while sucking he was making a strange cringe with his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old won&#x27;t stop sucking on her index finger..</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for close to 20 yrs, and this product has allowed me to almost completely break the habit in about a week.  </li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, my 5 year old has been struggling with this</li>
            <li> However, my 4 year old did not mind the taste and continues to bite his nails.</li>

            <li> and I did not put my finger near my mouth for days.</li>

            <li> something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, I can&#x27;t put this shiny nail-polish-looking thing on her knuckle or her whole back of her hand, can I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much and could even come in a smaller size!</li>
            <li> We started treatment the night before last, and yesterday while driving home from a play date, I looked at her in the mirror of my car and she was fast asleep WITHOUT her thumb in her mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> We used this on our 2 1/2 year old for thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We had to do this because her one front tooth was starting to look funny, and it&#x27;s already looking almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crossing my fingers - so far I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 1/2 and has been sucking her thumb and index fingers including their knuckles since she was 3 months old.</li>

            <li> (I&#x27;m almost 22), and I managed to stop completely in three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with my daughter was that she would suck her thumb in the night, so she wasn&#x27;t&#x27; even conscious that she was sucking it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help my 6 yr old stop biting her nails</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old says she doesn&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li> With this stuff on my nails, I wont go near em -</li>
            <li> Also, i accidentally gave my 1 year old a piece of apple</li>
            <li> Frankly I only really tried to bite my nails once after putting it on, and that&#x27;s all it took, man</li>
            <li> let my four year old son take one sniff of it, explained its purpose and he was sufficiently motivated to stop sucking his thumb except at bed time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was applied once to my 3 year old daughters thumb</li>
            <li> bought this for my 7yo daughter who&#x27;s been sucking her thumb since being days old.  </li>
            <li> then she completely forgot about sucking fingers.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old was still sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> My 7 year old was biting his nails with the gusto of a gray squirrel (Sciurus Carolinensis).</li>
            <li> My son has completely stopped chewing on his nails.  </li>
            <li> My biggest issue is that a) now that his adult teeth are coming in, he&#x27;s developing an overbite, and b) when his thumb&#x27;s in his mouth, his index finger tends to make its way into his nose (ick).</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon for my four year old son.</li>
            <li> old-</li>
            <li> Sometimes having our hands near our mouths like that is an unintentional antecedent.</li>
            <li> Sometimes having our hands near our mouths like that is an unintentional antecedent.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem stress-biting my fingernails ever since college and continue into my professional career.  </li>
            <li> We tried this on our 3 year old -- it worked practically over night.</li>
            <li> what stopped my son from biting his nails completely.</li>
            <li> No gagging, no crying, no fussing, just asking for a drink of water when she accidently forgot.</li>
            <li> adult put this on his thumb just to see what it would taste like.</li>
            <li> But, by accident I found this product on amazon and in just two days my daughter stopped sucking her thumb completely.</li>
            <li> Each application lasts for about four days, the taste gradually fades but doesn&#x27;t go away completely by day</li>
            <li> 1 sucked her thumb (4 years old) and 1 sucked her fingers (2 years old).</li>
            <li> My soon to be 7 year old</li>
            <li> Within days, she completely stopped sucking her fingers.  </li>
            <li> Used for my 2 yr old daughter&#x27;s finger sucking...</li>
            <li> So far Mavala is working to help my just turned</li>
            <li> My almost 5 year old daughter had sucked her thumbs from birth and nothing we did would make her stop.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was 7 years old and could not break the thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> daughter was 5 years old and had sucked her thumb since birth.</li>
            <li> she just really needed an occasional reminder for zone out times like when watching t.v. or falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop biting their nails.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter that started to bite her nails</li>
            <li> I applied mavala stop on my three year old daughter&#x27;s thumb</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 24 and have been biting my nails since I was 6) and my 18 year old habit was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nearly 8-year old son was a habitual thumb-sucker before I found Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> I have decided to get one for my 6 year old niece and 4 old nephew that suck their thumbs.</li>
            <li> and once I tasted this I removed it off of my two year old daughters fingers.  </li>
            <li> We had tried everything to get our 6 year old to quit sucking here thumb.  </li>
            <li> We bought this product for my four year old.  </li>
            <li> It may work on an adult though.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is now 2 years old.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son stopped sucking his thumb in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I am 14 years old and still have problems sucking my thumb along with biting my nails.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you have to really do with this product is apply it one a week because the taste fades away after about 5 days.</li>
            <li> , she would completely zone out and not hear a thing the teacher was saying.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 year old daughter who was biting her nails.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is nearly 5</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, who wanted a product that would help his 3 year old son stop sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> He says that his 3 year old is kicking the habit and that the taste of the product is preventing his son from wanting to put his thumb in his mouth at all.  </li>
            <li> If your habit really stems from an underlying issue like OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), then you may find it doesn&#x27;t cure the obsessing about irregularities in your nails, but it very likely will cure the biting itself.</li>
            <li> 6 year old daughter asked to get it as well.</li>
            <li> I had two of three children who sucked their thumb (a 6yr old boy and 4 yr old girl) and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li> Well, for my 4 yr old it was effortless.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product with my six year old daughter.</li>
            <li> and she hasn&#x27;t put her fingers even near her mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get my 3 year old to quit sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> His teeth were already starting to protrude and had a callus on his thumb from the pressure and how much he did it.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucked her thumb while pulling her hair.</li>
            <li> We purchased this to stop thumb sucking for our 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> This product works for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> stopped my 3 year old in one day from sucking her thumbs</li>
            <li> that way you keep your hands busy</li>
            <li> I tried this with my 12 year old son to get him to stop nail biting.  </li>
            <li> Her thumb does not even go near her mouth anymore.</li>
            <li> So we gave it a shot with our four year old who was bitting her nails.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything to get our 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> It broke the habit completely within one week of putting it on her thumbs.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need frequent reapplicaitons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My two year old stopped biting her nails because of it.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> We were just months away from paying hundreds of dollars for an appliance to help my 6 year old stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> We have a seven year old that was still thumb sucking, mavala stopped the thumb sucking immediately.</li>
            <li> meanwhile when I read the review on the item it also mentioned that it will help to deter thumb sucking which is something my daughter started doing when she was 2 years old</li>
            <li> Neither myself nor my 4 year old have bitten our fingernails since it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I used it when my son was about 3 years old.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 yr old son has sucked his two fingers since he was 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> I literally did NOT have a middle finger nail because I had bitten it so much</li>

            <li> have 7yr old boy/girl twins and both</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it under 4yrs old</li>
            <li> I think my daughter has secretly developed a taste for this stuff, as we have been using it for some time now, and still have not cut her finger nails with a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Was for a 10 year old with a packed lunch for school.</li>
            <li> I put this on my 3 1/2 yr old.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll probably re-apply today, but she won&#x27;t even go near her thumb</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop worked immediately to stop the thumb sucking of my four year old son.</li>

            <li> He has sucked his thumb since he was about a year old and any time he was sitting still it was in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> as I was busy in the kitchen, my wife was yelling for help, as my daughter began vomiting all over.  </li>
            <li> I however have an 8 year old son that has a nail biting problem I am trying to break.  </li>

            <li> My son has been nail biting since before he was one year old.  </li>
            <li> Since this habit didn&#x27;t start overnight, I expect it to take some time to break completely.</li>
            <li> You will not want to put your fingers anywhere near your mouth.</li>
            <li> I put the Mavala on and he stopped completely.</li>

            <li> Still in the early stage of breaking my habit but so far am amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 43 year old husband.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 years old.</li>

            <li> My 4 year old was so stubborn we tried everything to get him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Made my 2 1/2 year old stop sucking her thumb nearly immediately.</li>
            <li> I chalked that up to his taste buds not being fully mature, so I held onto the product.  </li>
            <li> This product did NOT help my 4yr old from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> After trying EVERYTHING, I bought this product for my three year old who would not stop sucking her fingers.  </li>

            <li> My daughter had just turned 3 years old and I wanted to get her to stop nursing</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how well it worked</li>
            <li> I used this both for my three year old sucking his thumb and my 5 year old biting her nails.</li>

            <li> and it seems to be doing the trick so far ...</li>

            <li> One use was all it took for my 3 year old daughter to quit sucking her fingers.  </li>

            <li> He now stopped completely.</li>
            <li> I have been applying a nail growth supplement, then the Mavala Stop, every 3-4 days for nearly a month now.  </li>
            <li> So far its been 3 months and counting.</li>

            <li> I was completely amazed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Mevala Stop off of amazon, and my six year old daughter hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since it arrived.  </li>

            <li> and he is completely over sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old stopped thumb sucking completely after only three applications, he was ready.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old and 11 year old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on 3 months without even putting my hands near my mouth.</li>
            <li> but since I have tried EVERYTHING on my 3 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Her nails are so soft and moist that not even nail clippers will trim them sometimes.</li>
            <li> I put it on my 3-year old&#x27;s thumb twice (over a 6 day period) and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied 2 days later, just in case, but she really didn&#x27;t need it.  </li>

            <li> We have to put it on frequently</li>
            <li> Within two days my son completely stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s unusual enough to grab your attention, so you can then realize what you were about to do and stop.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter (6 years old) and is still sucking her thumb.</li>

            <li> This really work I tried only for two weeks</li>

            <li> /&gt;Do not try to use it for kids under 3 years old.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants their child to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> 4 Days in and no thumb sucking from my 6 year old.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for naturally looking matte finish</li>
            <li> My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb (which she was doing since she was about 6 months old) after a week of using this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps your fingers and hands far away from your mouth.</li>
            <li> I would never use it on young children</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 3yr old son who had been biting his nails since 18 months.</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old</li>
            <li> wow-</li>
            <li> Worked in a week to stop my five year old from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old had somehow developed a severe nail biting habit, seemingly overnight.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old understands this is helping him to avoid nail biting.</li>
            <li> Helped my 5 year old stop sucking her finger in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Our 2 1/2 year old daughter was sucking her thumb all the time</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s completely stopped trying to suck his thumbs.  </li>
            <li> so far it seems to help.  </li>
            <li> We tried to use this on our 3 year old when she turned 3 after the advice of our pediatric dentist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to stop my 3 year old from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I used this for my 3 year old son who kept sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> my three year old stopped sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> She did not like the taste and so far it&#x27;s been about a week and no thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3yrs old son.</li>
            <li> I could see this product working for an adult, but not someone so young.</li>
            <li> Stopped my 3 year old from bitting his figure nails</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 10 yr old thumb ducking lord</li>
            <li> to help break my nine year old of thumb sucking...</li>
            <li> I know they say that the young children may not have their taste buds fully developed</li>
            <li> Helped my nearing 3yr old to stop sucking his thumb in just a week or two.  </li>
            <li> My kid is 11 years old and has had this habit since birth, it was getting to the point where it was affecting his speech and the shape of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this product on our 3 year old son since December 8, 2012.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to me for my 6 year old daughter who loves her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I still apply it in case he reverses, but so far no sucking.</li>
            <li> The dentist was putting pressure on us to help our 3 year old stop sucking his fingers.  </li>
            <li> My two year old daughter immediately stopped sucking her thumb after using this.</li>
            <li> Truly, it should not be used with young children if you don&#x27;t want to chance them not liking any food they eat and accidentally touch their fingernails to their mouth.</li>
            <li> I completely stopped messing with my nails.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand to put my fingers anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have an eight year old and a six year old who have sucked their thumbs since they were newborns.</li>
            <li> One application is all it took for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li> my 4 year old wont stop, tried everything</li>
            <li> My 17 year old son has chewed his nails for 10+ years.</li>
            <li> We had to apply it about 3 times before she completely stopped (it would wear off in about 2-3 days or so and she would start sucking her fingers again).</li>
            <li> coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Her speech has markedly improved, as well as her attitude.</li>
            <li> We purchased Mavala Stop to help both our almost 3 yr old daughter quit sucking her thumb and our 4 yr old son to stop biting his nails and fingers.</li>
            <li> I think it would work with adult but not kid.</li>
            <li> bought it for my 8 year old girl too as she started doing that when the school started this year...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything to stop that directly, but decided to try Mavala since I figured he would get his nails in his mouth as well while chewing on his fingers.</li>
            <li> Worked within a week for my 10 year old for a thumb sucking kid.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for  my six year old.</li>
            <li> it also stop my seventeen year old from chewing his finger nailing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my 7 year old to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked for my 10 year old until he discovered that he could soak his fingers and scrape it off the nails.</li>
            <li> We decided to try this product because we couldn&#x27;t get our 13 year old son to stop biting his fingers and our 5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> We are very concerned about this and have tried various methods to get him to stop.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> My 6 year old has sucked her thumb for years and nothing has stopped her from sucking her thumb until we tried this.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucked his thumb and bit his nails until they bled.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old understood</li>
            <li> and she would be able to just rub it off or at least wash her hands</li>
            <li> how well it worked because he was VERY dependent on sucking his fingers throughout the entire night.  </li>
            <li> Daughter has sucked fingers since a child to 4 years old, we tried a lot of stuff</li>
            <li> I still have about 95% of the bottle left, so if there ever is a reoccurance then I&#x27;ll be ready.</li>

            <li> I surprised her with glitter nail polish</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old sucked her thumb quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I was about to see a dentist to have an appliance placed in our 5 year old&#x27;s mouth to break the thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has been sucking her finger since she was in the belly.</li>

            <li> No crying, no whining-</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son stopped biting his nails and hasn&#x27;t bitten them since we started this product 12/23.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want your hands anywhere near your mouth with this stuff on it.</li>
            <li> Though she is completely correct, we still were seeking options to resolve this issue.  </li>
            <li> A six year old should be working toward eliminating the habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A six year old should be working toward eliminating the habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Simply stated, this product really worked for me.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any issues with her eating, although I can see how it might cause some concern with young children, since almost everything is finger food.</li>
            <li> really wish i could return it.. or get my money back.</li>

            <li> and she started when she was about 9-12 months old.</li>
            <li> I put it on my 3 year old twice</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the effect it had on my friends 6 year old son.</li>
            <li> i used this on my 9 year old because he has a habit of using his fingers while eating.  </li>
            <li> However, the reason why I bought this in 1st place was for my 4 year old who started to bite her nails when she went to preschool.  </li>
            <li> Fixed two children of thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with my 9 years old daughter</li>
            <li> This product does not work well on my 2 year old thumb sucking daughter.  </li>
            <li> I believe she was a bit too young for this product at the time because she didn&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> old stopped sucking thumb within days and husband now uses it to keep from biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> old nose picker as well.</li>
            <li> My son was still sucking his thumb at 2 1/2 years old.  </li>
            <li> and she was just too young.  </li>

            <li> so  far I have  applied it 3  times  </li>
            <li> I have a seven year old that bit her nails and a four year old that sucked her fingers.</li>
            <li> help cured my friend&#x27;s decade old nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m now 20 years old).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 yr old</li>
            <li> I am using it on my 20 month old daughter who was always sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3.5years old.</li>
            <li> her be a big girl&amp;#34; and she was ready to prove it.</li>
            <li> Child has sucked her thumb nearly since birth.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my 6 year old and he can&#x27;t stand to bite his nails now.  </li>
            <li> My eight year old stopped sucking his thumb the moment we put it on.</li>
            <li> Our 6 yr old has struggled years to stop sucking her thumb at bed time.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, manicures helped, but stress could still set me off.  </li>
            <li> Stopped my four year old from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> This was completely ineffective in trying to stop my toddler from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> We had tried EVERYTHING in an attempt to get my 7yr old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Somehow in the busyness of having two young kids, I didn&#x27;t notice he&#x27;d picked up the habit of chewing them as a toddler.</li>
            <li> It is one of the worsts tastes I have ever came across, and it was not just a wow</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s 7th birthday was fast approaching, he had permanent teeth coming in</li>
            <li> My son is 7 years old and was sucking the life out of his thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 yrs old.</li>
            <li> But like i said, it has been working for me so far.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well.</li>
            <li> 4 year old has not sucked his thumb in over a week now....</li>
            <li> Took him I would say maybe 3 days to stop completely.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son has been sucking his 2 fingers practically since birth, and we never thought we could get him to stop.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucked her thumb at night and we figured what the heck and used it on her too</li>
            <li> Used it on my 4 year old daughter who has been sucking her fingers ever since she grew some in the womb.</li>
            <li> We tried everything to get our 3 1/2 year old to stop sucking his thumb without any luck.</li>
            <li> We had tried almost everything to get our 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb including the $80 thumb guards and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I tried crocheting to keep my hands busy</li>
            <li> Took les than a week for 5 year old to stop sucking fingers.</li>
            <li> The dentist recommended it for my almost 4 year old, who won&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Tried this on our 3 1/2 year old and she didn&#x27;t mind the taste and continued to suck her thumb with no problem.</li>
            <li> One application really does last two days.</li>
            <li> old girl that has the nervous habit of chewing her fingernails...</li>
            <li> Completely cured my 6 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking within one week.  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old has bitten his nails for years.  </li>
            <li> and I had nails to clip for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> The junk you get at the local pharmacy is just lemon juice and cayanne pepper and is only useful for babies.</li>
            <li> I will admit that she did cry a few days later when I wanted to put more on.</li>
            <li> Made me laugh harder.</li>
            <li> fun bandaids and a bitter herb product hadn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> She cried for the first few days, but when we explained to her that Dr. B (her dentist) said this would help her to stop sucking her thumb and give her pretty teeth</li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost, even though I only had to use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> A few days later she started sucking again, so we applied it one more time.  </li>
            <li> The last time I covered the whole top of my finger-sucker&#x27;s finger, including the skin part on the \\&quot;palm\\&quot; side of the finger, and still she sucks them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying the product a few more times under different conditions (just out of the shower, etc.)</li>
            <li> She desperately wants to stop biting, but is unable to on her own, as she does it without thinking.  </li>
            <li> Since most young children do not floss, they will probably not have the flossing complaint I have.</li>
            <li> This product has already helped me a lot in the last few days, and is more jarring than when my mom and boyfriend smack me for doing it.</li>
            <li> She finds the whole thing fun, and asks me everyday to put the nail polish on her</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things over the last few years to quit biting my nails.</li>
            <li> she has not quit her habit (because if I don&#x27;t put it on for a few days she goes back to the habit), but I think she will once I do this for more than a month.</li>
            <li> For some reason my whole fingertips tasted bitter too (maybe from touching my nails after they dried or rubbing them together during hand washing?</li>
            <li> After a few days she would ask for more on her fingernails because the temptation came back</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this product but tried it after reading lots of good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but I am SO happy it is!  </li>
            <li> we only applied it a few days, which was rough for him, but it was for the good.  </li>
            <li> It was a rough few days because it was that effective.</li>
            <li> May be good for some just want for us, sorry.</li>
            <li> fail to work if good habits aren&#x27;t put in place</li>
            <li> she wakes up, it will be completely dried which is good as it may be sticky before it get dried.</li>
            <li> My bottle was barely used!!!</li>
            <li> The next things we noticed were that the product seemed to wear off rather quickly with our son and that he was willing to put up with the residual taste at prime thumb-sucking time (such as when he was tired).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned about the frequency of application required, we then contacted the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to see if they had any information about the product.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old just goes right back to chewing his nails as soon as it wears off enough.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t use the time to build up good habits of cutting them, you will go right back to biting them as soon as you stop.</li>
            <li> This worked well for a few weeks, but then our daughter simply ended up sucking off the polish pretty quickly &amp; continuing her thumb sucking routine.</li>
            <li> but the liquid got around the bottle top a little as normal but mine adhered together and when finally loosened to open it actually broke the top and the liquid all dried up</li>
            <li> After the second day, however, he went right back to sucking like there was nothing on his fingers.</li>
            <li> I know he accidentally puts them in his mouth out of habit, especially when he sleeps, but he always takes them right back out.  </li>
            <li> [my right hand] then you&#x27;ll see how short my middle finger nail is.</li>
            <li> But, as soon as he fell asleep after about 20 mins later, his right thumb instinctively went back in to his mouth</li>
            <li> I brushed it on the finger nails and the next time he tried to put them in his mouth those fingers came right out.</li>
            <li> By the  next day I guess it wears off because he is right back sucking again.  </li>
            <li> My  newly 4 year old daughter sucked her thumb to sleep and calm down.  </li>
            <li> It goes in mild but after a second it is repulsive and depending on how long the finger was in your mouth it tends to stay with you.</li>
            <li> We have all been healthy for the past 2 months!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as a parent I love this product, no more nail biting!  </li>
            <li> My son was a little nervous but also excited to try it.</li>
            <li> This worked for a while, but soon DD just bit right through the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> We applied the polish and its bitter taste, made her stop right away.</li>
            <li> I am at a loss right now and really do not know what else I can do.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter started biting her nails down to the quick and then would hide her hands.</li>
            <li> it is pretty bitter so make sure its completely dry before your kid runs off or else he will get it on his other fingers</li>
            <li> 6 months of positive reinforcement and constant reminders along the the incentive of a new big boy bike didn&#x27;t make a dent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been so effective that I have been using it less and less, and still managing to be deterred from the thought of bringing my hands to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I will use it with my son, who is only 1 year old and is a finger-sucker, when he is older (it says ages 3 and up).</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son bites the skin off of the back of his fingers, mainly his pointer finger.</li>
            <li> The only down fall of this product is that you really have to make sure to be careful when you are eating finger foods and stuff</li>
            <li> I am also a germaphobe and figure that, if I can control myself enough to wait until after I wash my hands to bite my nails, I should be able to stop with a little discouragement from this product!  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that it will get onto finger foods and make whatever you are eating taste funny; otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;We have tried other products without success</li>
            <li> When some other kindergarteners made fun of her I knew we had to somehow end the habit.  </li>
            <li> and she wasn&#x27;t having much success with other methods and reminders.  </li>
            <li> and she will not mess with her nails now.</li>
            <li> Then we put it on every few days, under polish when I had time to make it fun!</li>
            <li> The wet wipes that we use for dirty hands at the dinner table actually remove the layer of Mavala on the nail, so it seems best to apply a new layer after dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with such a quick and positive results I have recommended it to other friends who are experiencing similar problem with their child.</li>
            <li> I seriously thought I would never be able to break the habit since it was so ingrained in my mind.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so awful, if you even touch your lips with your fingertips you will taste that strong bitter taste, which is great for diehard nail biters like me!</li>
            <li> We had used this product in the past to stop thumb sucking and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> (I was slightly), and you occasionally get the taste in your mouth simply from touching your mouth/food during eating or trying to get food out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> To begin, I typically never write reviews, but for this I have to.  </li>
            <li> My older girl had a habit of biting her nails, and my younger one, age 3, sucked her thumb from infancy.</li>
            <li> The taste is sooo gross and it stays in your mouth for an extra minute, so you really get punished and learn your lesson!</li>
            <li> Imagine my excitement when I did finally open it.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter is a dual thumbsucker, me, a lifelong nail biter and a sweet boy who likes to snack on (dare I say it)</li>
            <li> It worked only on the first day and then started swolling this from the next day..</li>
            <li> Put it on her fingers 4 days ago and she tried sucking it twice the first day and gagged, following that only tried 2 or 3 times and stopped immediately.  </li>
            <li> I only had to apply it twice the first week and once a week later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We ended up wrapping his hand in socks, mittens, and first aid wraps for the next two months (taking it off only for eating) while the fingers healed.</li>
            <li> I find that I know exactly when the recent Mavala Stop application has worn off, as his thumb is back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> The first day she was a bit upset that her thumb tastes different but from next day onwards, it does not bother her at all.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing, is simple things like typing this review are different because I have nails.</li>
            <li> Funny thing, is simple things like typing this review are different because I have nails.</li>
            <li> She woke up 3 times the first night because she accidentally sucked her thumb, only once the 2nd night, and that was it.  </li>
            <li> After days of shower and frequent hand washing, it&#x27;s still as bitter as the first day I put it on.</li>
            <li> daughter was quiet upset the first time we tried this on her thumbs only.</li>
            <li> This was simpler and I didn&#x27;t have to nag and stay on top of it, other than applying it every other day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my older daughter, but trying it again with my younger one.  </li>
            <li> I bought Mavala Stop for my eight-year-old after trying the local pharmacies&#x27; cayenne pepper product, which stung his tongue at first, but not enough to prevent him from licking it off.  </li>
            <li> The first time my daughter sucked on her thumb (after I applied Mavala) she was crying and spitting the whole night.</li>
            <li> even though this is the first day we&#x27;ve used it, the taste is just gross enough for him to keep his fingers out of his mouth!!</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny bit - the first night I covered his nail</li>
            <li> My wife and I tried several &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; such as bandages, soap, hot sauce, and caster oil.</li>
            <li> I read the disclaimer to only use it on kids 3 years or older.</li>
            <li> After 10-12 times of putting her thumb in her mouth the first day she stopped entirely by the next day.</li>
            <li> Might work for older kids but not for younger ones who don&#x27;t want to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> Supposely on little kids is less effective.</li>
            <li> The taste of the stuff isn&#x27;t as bad as I have read on other reports, so I was happy, but it was strong enough to cause him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Product comes with instructions in English and pretty much every other language</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 6 year old in our family with a major thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucked his thumb constantly, no other trick had worked.</li>
            <li> that was gross and then the taste went away, this disgusting taste lingered for a good 5 minutes or more!  </li>
            <li> I thought it would take a full month of using Mavala to get my three year old to give up his habit, but it took less than two weeks!</li>
            <li> After being an extreme nail biter for 60 years and learning to hide my nails to where it became an art form, I tried using Mavala Stop and it worked right away.</li>
            <li> We tried other methods before this one and he would just suck right through them.  </li>
            <li> so much, I highly recommend to a lot of mommies, who are going through the same situation as I am.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> I would highly discourage using this on smaller children; thus, I have yet to use this.</li>
            <li> To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers.</li>
            <li> I think he was highly motivated to stop and just needed the extra boost which this did.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone with a similar problem!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and am planning to send my bottle around to friends as I only used probably 10% of the bottle on both kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and am planning to send my bottle around to friends as I only used probably 10% of the bottle on both kids.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that if you are eating food with you hands, you will most likely taste the product which is extremely bitter and gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this high because I received on a Saturday and we are only almost one week into this product and</li>
            <li> Well now that same child is in high school with the pressures of essays and test and sports</li>
            <li> I will add that I was highly motivated to succeed this time and that is always a key step in any transformation process.</li>
            <li> I started biting my nails in high school, and seemingly nothing could get me to stop, despite my multiple attempts over the years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially people who believe they have tried it all!</li>
            <li> He is currently 5 years old and his new permanent teeth are moving because of his thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> I felt I put very little on the 1st time when I lightly coat thumb nail</li>
            <li> He was very motivated to stop biting fingers because he was starting to notice the social stigma</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also economical -- applied over dry or polished nails and cuticles, it will last days.</li>
            <li> Only buy this product if you will follow through and re-apply it every few days because it fades away easily.</li>
            <li> Every week or so, I would not reapply the polish, and sure enough, when he got tired or upset, he would stick his fingers right back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> In short, if you are considering this product even for someone as young as two and a half, as long as he or she can somewhat understand what is going on, then this product could not be more recommended.</li>
            <li> Since then she tries her best to not absent mindedly put her hands near her mouth because the taste is so bad and it lingers.</li>
            <li> but i guess my daughter didn&#x27;t really care for the taste as long as she could suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for us, our 4 year old daughter sucked her finger at bed time only but even that is enough to cause damage to teeth.</li>
            <li> The day I got the polish in the mail, I put it on my 5 year old daughter who constantly has her hands in her mouth, my four year old son who was a thumb-sucker, and my three year old daughter who bites her finger (and toe!!)nails....</li>
            <li> and I have been nail biting free for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> people who can tolerate this taste probably will have a higher rate of getting a&lt;br /&gt;negative result in tasting bitter on the genetic factor test as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Although the first couple of nights were rough on her, the Mavala did work.  </li>
            <li> For the first night, it was rough.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST WEEK WAS VERRRYYY ROUGH</li>
            <li> and they are back to normal.</li>
            <li> Now her finger nail start growing back like normal.  </li>
            <li> The first night was rough since she put her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li> The first day, he had to brush his teeth 5 times because he bit his fingers forgetfully.  </li>
            <li> worked exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li> The first night was rough as she did put her thumb in her mouth and then gagged and spit and couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> This morning I made some pretty bitter sandwiches.</li>
            <li> FIRST try on an empty stomach the 1st time (just in case)  </li>
            <li> Now 2 months later, my nails are normal lengths and</li>
            <li> I recommend it and need to go get a manicure because my nails are looking like a normal human again!</li>
            <li> Of course, it does need to be reapplied to maintain its usefulness, but with a pretty pink underneath it, she doesn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> (she would peel off the tape), hot sauce and Bitter Apple spray.  </li>
            <li> I will admit when you first put it on and your child tries to suck his thumb</li>
            <li> We ended up finding a pink fabric thumb guard that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product helped me become aware of when I was biting and deterred me with the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> It does taste bitter, but my kid used to the taste after first try.</li>
            <li> The first night was rough-</li>
            <li> This, coupled with the Mavala, is finally making my nails look normal.</li>
            <li> The first couple of weeks were rough with her going through withdrawal.</li>
            <li> Warning:  the first night, she did suck her thumb and the taste was so bitter, she threw up.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t suck his thumb again until after a few days when it began to wear off and we just reapplied, It was so cool to see him understand what it was for and that it was to help him.</li>
            <li> We apply a coat every night and will continue to do so for the next several weeks until we know the habit is broken for good.</li>
            <li> is a good product my son liked thumbsucking but after this what you are thinking, this tastes awful is durable and also definitely think I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> My bigger issue is I&#x27;m not very happy with the chemical ingredients in this; if this is something there putting in their mouth, I would hope for more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product that stands behind what it says!!!</li>
            <li> She thought she was going to be smart and wash her hands with soap and water, only to find out later that it was still on her thumbs.</li>
            <li> Only problem was, he was smart enough to hide it.</li>
            <li> However, it does only last a certain amount of time, and even though he promised not to bite his nails, he has forgotten so on with the Mavala again.</li>
            <li> I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter.</li>
            <li> Product is really helping my 4yr old son stop his habit of bitting his nails which are like half of normal nails length</li>
            <li> This scent seems to have been a bit more offensive than the last one we tried, but it&#x27;s not strong enough for a dedicated nail biter.</li>
            <li> We found the product very useful in preventing thumb succking for our 3 y old.&lt;br /&gt;We applied a small amount (one touch) on her thumbs</li>
            <li> He complained that food tested bitter the first couple of days, but after that he was ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t believe it was that simple.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried band-aids, tape and other brush-on things to make her finger less appealing.  </li>
            <li> It has been hard for her, but after only 3 applications and two weeks she is thumb sucking free!</li>
            <li> biting is definitely still a habit that&#x27;s hard to shake but this product helps way more than what it costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back 2 years later buying some for my older son who has taken up a nail biting habit!  </li>
            <li> The other bad thing is if you hand wash dishes like I do the soap and warm water will wash off most of the taste of it</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t want all the details of the hour long ordeal!)</li>
            <li> It also applies much like a clear coat nail polish, not like a thin liquid, as I originally thought it would.</li>
            <li> I placed a very small dab on the tip of his thumb nail (not the whole nail just a small dot on the very top) after breakfast, he tried to suck his thumb but each time he got close to his mouth he pulled it away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to quit many times, and used other \\&quot;bitter tasting\\&quot; products on my nails that never worked because the taste was just not enough to override my compulsion to chew my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not know how much of this was internal motivation, and how much was due to the Mavala Stop, but it has worked.  </li>
            <li> The first couple days are a little tough, but it was amazing to me</li>
            <li> We had tried everything, taping fingers with medical tape, taping on a mitten, paying money, offering to go to Sea World, offering to go to Target to buy a new toy, etc.  </li>
            <li> Her new teeth were starting to come out with a gap.</li>
            <li> The coat will last for 4-5 days and if I get the urge to bite my nails again, I just apply a new coat.  </li>
            <li> 2 weeks later I haven&#x27;t applied a new coat, I&#x27;ve washed my hands over and over and over again</li>
            <li> As soon as I put some on her thumb, she popped it right in her mouth and decided it was no fun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to stop if your kid knows wha&#x27;s good and bad and ready to accept.</li>
            <li> I never really thought about it much until I became an adult, and since that point I&#x27;ve always wanted to stop.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have painted the entire nail and you wish to remove it, acetone will remove Mavala Stop--you just might have to work at it with several cotton balls and then wash hands VERY WELL to remove the acetone taste.  </li>
            <li> We bought Mavala stop last week for my 2 years 3 months old daughter who has been sucking her thumb since she was 3 months old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I doubt you&#x27;d use the whole bottle, or you have a more stubborn child than I do.</li>
            <li> and I was starting to get really concerned about the constant thumb sucking and hair twirling.  </li>
            <li> Plenty more for my 2nd thumb sucker in a year or so!&lt;br</li>
            <li> He never really complained about the taste, but the look on his face with the first few attempts were all telling.</li>
            <li> It lasts a couple days, and like someone else mentioned, I only put a tiny bit on his thumb - not the whole nail.</li>
            <li> I just got this in last night and already used it on my 5 year old for thumb sucking, and it is so far working just as described.</li>
            <li> Even if it seems easier just to bite or peel away an uneven bit of nail, you&#x27;ll spare most of it by just clipping off those rough edges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One small note: pretty much a finger food killer.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was not sure if this would really work</li>
            <li> And for less than $10 it&#x27;s worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much in fact that my daughter threw up all over the place even though I only put a tiny spot on the problem thumb.</li>
            <li> We used it with our 2 1/2 yr-old because he keeps biting his fingernails, and we only put a tiny bit, and after about 30 minutes he threw up so much ...</li>
            <li> He still sucks his thumb at night on ocassion, but even that is starting to get better over time.  </li>
            <li> Now he just wants to suck his fingers and go to sleep, but he keeps forgetting and putting them back into his mouth only to start heaving again!  </li>
            <li> Literally after 2 applications my 3 1/2 year old stopped putting his hands even NEAR his mouth - and this was a constant nail biter and bleeder before this!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually use this product, because we bought the book &amp;#34;David Decides&amp;#34; for my 5 year old girl, and to my complete surprise, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had tried everything and were ready to actually have the doctor put a cast on our son&#x27;s arm to physically stop him from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> and he didn&#x27;t bit the his finger or toe nail the whole day, nor the next day, nor the next...</li>
            <li> /&gt;She is now in fourth grade and has long pretty nails</li>
            <li> It took only 4 applications and about one week to completely stop my 7 year old from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I have an 8 year old and a 3 year old who bite their nails constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to apply it a couple of times just for precaution, but really it wasn&#x27;t even necessary.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter has sucked her 2 middle fingers since she was 2 months old.</li>
            <li> I agree that it works but only for the period of time it stayed on, I guess it is because I&#x27;m an adult and old habits</li>
            <li> During her speech evaluation, she recommended Mavala Stop to me as her son was a thumb sucker and had many orthodontic problems and facial asymmetry as a result of it.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 6 months old (she is 3 1/2 years old now).  </li>
            <li> My ten year old had developed a nervous habit of biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old who has been sucking her index and middle fingers since she was 2 months old.</li>
            <li> I make her nails few times per week to keep them smooth and short</li>
            <li> my grand daughter finally stopped sucker her thumb once I started using this product</li>
            <li> Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were a few instances where finger foods led to an accidental taste, but that also was quickly self correcting.  </li>
            <li> The taste is a very odd taste, sort of sweet and then like acetone...</li>
            <li> Tip for use:  only apply one swipe of the brush onto nail and make sure it is a very little amount!  </li>
            <li> We only have to reapply every couple days even with very frequent handwashing habits.</li>
            <li> The first few nights were hard as she kept getting up to tell us her mouth taste like soap and no being able to comfort herself....</li>
            <li> I purchased it based on reviews from other parents, and it does exactly what was indicated.  </li>
            <li> and just today i had my first nail trim to take off the sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I was actually able to stop biting my nails and have not bitten them in 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> the reviews from other parents were instrumental in my purchase decision so I am writing my first ever product</li>
            <li> We put it on every day for the first week, and now we just put it on every other day.  </li>
            <li> product definitely helped while I was using it to stop biting my nails, I actually purchased a second bottle once the first was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only had to apply 1 time and my 2 1/2 year old stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> 24 day later, my 5 yr old son has stopped sucking his thumb!  </li>
            <li> It did make her gag a few times the very first day but after that she wouldn&#x27;t even put her thumb close to her mouth.  </li>
            <li> We went to a tea room with little sandwiches and other finger foods, and just barely touching her bottom lip with her thumbnail</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d ever get my daughters (especially my 5 year old) to quit sucking her finger!</li>
            <li> Going into first grade, it seemed imperative that he stop soon to avoid an onslaught on taunts from other children.  </li>
            <li> now i think there is no other thing which could stop them from thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> She still occasionally sucks her thumb, but never when actually asleep and much more rarely in general than she used to.</li>
            <li> (they told me that any time they had it on and accidentally tasted it, that they immediately had to spit it out), but only if you use it frequently!</li>
            <li> I hesitated doing it to my son, worrying it would majorly upset him.</li>
            <li> We got this product last year because our 8 year old was still sucking his thumb-almost ALL the time!  </li>
            <li> the hot stuff, bitter stuff, even a device that was like wearing a thumb-only glove!</li>
            <li> But like other reviewers, at first he did not care for the taste, but after a day, the taste did not bother him.</li>
            <li> Our 4-year-old was a MAJOR thumb-sucker, she did it all throughout the day as well as at night.</li>
            <li> And now a month or so later, I&#x27;m completely cured!</li>
            <li> apparently this is what my mom used on her for her thumb sucking!  </li>
            <li> No other problems that night.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old is an avid thumb sucker and the dentist said we really needed to nib it in the bud.  </li>
            <li> My nails are weak and on top of that</li>
            <li> include being unable to floss and not being able to touch my hands to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Upside &#x3D; MY HANDS DON&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on real shiny and clear and really does last for two days as advertised, but it does start losing a little of its potency</li>
            <li> He was upset once or twice the first day when he would forget it was on his fingers and put them in his mouth, but other than that it worked without a problem.</li>
            <li> But it totally made me stop biting my nails or even putting them near my mouth!  </li>
            <li> I tried other products for my 5 year olds nail biting problem and this worked on the FIRST DAY.</li>
            <li> It was a major issue for me because I eat with my hands(finger foods)</li>
            <li> I applied same amount on her nails as I did to my 9 year old, and it didn&#x27;t bother her a one bit!  </li>
            <li> After about three weeks I would forget to put it on and they still didn&#x27;t revert back to old habits!</li>
            <li> Trust me, this will be a major disturbance.</li>
            <li> Worked the first time I put it in my 5 year old finger nails - roughly 5 weeks ago and never looked back!  </li>
            <li> Using a small amount (nail only) with a 5 year old only had a minor affect and was sucked off fairly easily without much effect (</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself first to see how it tasted, it was very bitter.  </li>
            <li> I did try this product out first before I used it on him and it just leaves a very bitter taste in the your mouth.</li>
            <li> He is a chronic nail biter who always gnaws his claws down to the quick, and so he&#x27;s never had the white show on his fingernails before.</li>
            <li> My daughter was biting her nails down to the quick and actually hurting herself.  </li>
            <li> and I quickly put my hand back down haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I quickly put my hand back down haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked, though he has developed lot of taste due to that.</li>
            <li> Although the instructions say paint every other day, sometimes he needs a fresh coat the next day.</li>
            <li> There are other posts for lack of success with Mavala for younger children.</li>
            <li> Given that she hasn&#x27;t reacted as strongly as other reviewers&#x27; children, I&#x27;m wondering if it will be as useful for curbing her thumb-sucking habit, which is the next hurdle on our list.  </li>
            <li> taste lasts for a few days, which can be problematic as you have to plan ahead to make sure there are no activities that the taste could interfere with.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very careful eating any sort of finger food with this on, as even the lightest touch on your lips will give you the taste and require some manner to remove it from your taste buds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as a fun little story for you guys, I do this thing where I lick my nails as well.</li>
            <li> Sure, some urges from a habit are still there, but they&#x27;re getting less and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> no getting up in the middle of the night to put back in her pacifier ... but became a problem as she got older.</li>
            <li> The older child had to do it again a couple of weeks later when he fell back into the habit but</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old was a constant finger sucker since an infant, impeding speech, fine motor and basically everything since he always had his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> It dries on clear (a little shiny at first) and it lingers for days.  </li>
            <li> The taste of the nail polish is excellent for stopping the nail biting habit, but the product tended to rub off on finger-foods even hours after it dried and the taste is hard to miss, and somewhat hard to get off the palate once it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of polish and with one of them I actually grew used to the taste and bit right through it.  </li>
            <li> Seems to working, but only if you coat often enough and a large enough area to cause gagging (may be some vomit too).  </li>
            <li> Be careful to only paint the very very tips of your nails...</li>
            <li> It was funny watching her the first time she tried to suck and hard not to pretend something was different.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t take the nail polish off (except for the brave daughter of another reviewer that sucked up the bad taste and washed it away with water).</li>
            <li> It was a great reminder for her and the taste was really bad.</li>
            <li> My advice to parents with thumb suckers is to use the free methods before jumping into buying something.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m still amazed that how easily she stopped.</li>
            <li> You can spoil your meal while eating with your hands if you accidentally lick your fingers or just by eating with your hands in general.</li>
            <li> First off, let me give my complaint - there is way too much of this stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter cried inconsolably for over 4 hours, refused to drink, would not swallow her saliva because of the discomfort, would not speak clearly because of the discomfort, and finally threw up.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old calls it the &amp;#34;yucky nail polish&amp;#34; and hates it so much that she tries to wash her hands off multiple times in the day to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works as long as you are responsible enough to keep applying it every 4 or 5 days.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that has helped me quit biting my nails is keeping them painted with a color and clear coat</li>
            <li> it looks like regular clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The stuff goes on clear, dries totally and lasts about 3 days, so you reapply every three days.  </li>
            <li> You should apply it daily, but it&#x27;s clear and you can&#x27;t see it.  </li>
            <li> She is now six years old and she has not gone back to sucking her</li>
            <li> I used it for myself and my 7 year old and it totally works.</li>
            <li> I found it because my 3 yr old daughter was starting to put her hands in her mouth</li>
            <li> The first night was no fun, we had to brush his teeth every time he tasted it</li>
            <li> The bitter taste really conditions you to not bite your nails.</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old was so grossed out with this that it only took two applications</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of making guacamole with my bare hands...gross.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when my 2nd son (5-1/2 years old) stopped sucking his 2 middle fingers in 2 DAYS!!</li>
            <li> Our 3 year old only sucked her thumb when going to sleep, but our dentist insisted she stop.</li>
            <li> We got it for our 9 year old son who has had a constant habit of putting his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I have used everything possible to help my 4 year old stop biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> It all had started the summer before my 7 year old son went into second grade.  </li>
            <li> I believe she naturally put her thumb in her mouth while sleeping and left it there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely even used the contents in the bottles.  </li>
            <li> Apparently he put his thumb in his mouth as he was falling asleep and the taste got him up out of the bed.</li>
            <li> My (recently turned) four year old had been sucking his thumb</li>
            <li> I am 36 years old and have bitten my fingernails my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think ANYTHING was going to get my six year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, but this worked in only 1 application.  </li>
            <li> We joke that he does not have taste buds, but apparently he does.  </li>
            <li> It only worked for 1 day, then my 3yr old got used to it and started thumb sucking again.</li>
            <li> My daughter was five years old and still sucking her thumb constantly.  </li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have been a nail biter my entire life.</li>
            <li> the second you start to move your hand near your mouth your brain starts screaming to stop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter is 7 years old and has sucked her thumb constantly for 5 years.  </li>
            <li> used this only once: my 3 yr old had a belly ache, threw up 2 times, and has not put her thumb in her mouth again</li>
            <li> Be careful not to apply too much however...</li>
            <li> Apparently the taste grew on her as it hasn&#x27;t deterred her since.</li>
            <li> She is now 3 years old and still hasn&#x27;t gone back to sucking her fingers!!!</li>
            <li> So I just don&#x27;t screw it back on completely.</li>
            <li> But, my 3 year old went ahead in the middle of the night and sucked his thumb even with Mavala on it.</li>
            <li> It really does taste bitter.</li>
            <li> It Is recommended by mavala stop not to use it earlier than 3yrs because taste buds are not fully developed.</li>
            <li> They woke up the next morning complaining of a yucky taste in their mouths and from then on one of them stopped completely.  </li>
            <li> purchased this product as a last resort for our three year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son bit all 10 of his finger nails to the point of bleeding for the last 7 years.  </li>
            <li> He said that the bitter taste of the product was too much for him to handle.</li>
            <li> Apparently she was \\&quot;ready\\&quot; to give up the thumb,</li>
            <li> We purchased multiple items hoping to rid our 4 year old of her thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> my 3 1/2 year old stopped sucking her thumb/fingers and hasn&#x27;t gone back.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing that has stopped my three year old daughter from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> We saw the reviews and we weren&#x27;t getting anywhere trying to persuade our four year old daughter from sucking her middle two fingers (and causing her teeth to grow outwards), so we went ahead and ordered some!</li>
            <li> We purchased this after months and months of trying to get our 8 year old son to stop sucking his middle fingers.</li>
            <li> Tastes gross so my daughter wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near her mouth.</li>
            <li> This product has made it possible to break my 6 year old from sucking on his thumb.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about his teeth obviously, but I was also concerned that he was just picking up germs and putting them directly into his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We used it for 2-3 weeks on our 3 year old son to kick the thumb sucking habit since it was starting to affect his teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this is a last ditch effort to get my then 13mth old son to stop sucking his two fingers.  </li>
            <li> and it has definitely helped me so far.  </li>
            <li> The orthodontist recommended this product for my ten year old son, who has an oral device to keep him from thumb-sucking but he is still trying.  </li>
            <li> The effects didn&#x27;t last on me or my 10 year old son (nail biting, not thumb sucking) for even a day.</li>
            <li> This is such a help so that she don&#x27;t need braces when she gets old....</li>
            <li> So after reading several reviews, one review said that this product, Marvala Stop, worked wonders on their under 3 year old.</li>
            <li> I only noticed that his product is not recommended for children under 3 since their taste buds are not fully developed and might have no effect on them.  </li>
            <li> I barely put any on her finger nails but trust me</li>
            <li> My four year old was starting to but his nails and always had his fingers in his mouth and was still sucking his thumb at night</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter stopped chewing her nails almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It is not peppery-</li>
            <li> My wife and I were extremely surprised at the instant effect this had on her.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t in nearly a week, and they are already healing and growing back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We re-aplied the drops every month for the next 5-6 months to wean her off completely.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 3 year old niece, but she simply continued biting her nails.</li>
            <li> Whatever, this stuff has done the job for us, and our thanks to the Swiss for their chocolate, army knives, furtive banking and now this.</li>
            <li> My daughter had reverted to an old habit of sucking her index and middle finger.  </li>
            <li> the bottle somewhere visible and where you frequently have your line of vision (but obviously away from children).</li>
            <li> But anyone with an OCD habit for nail-biting understands what this refers to and how much of a &#x27;trigger&#x27; those rough nail edges are.</li>
            <li> this refers to and how much of a &#x27;trigger&#x27; those rough nail edges are.</li>
            <li> Put hand lotion (sensitive skin type, nonscented) on ALL THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, leaving your nails alone is a psychological thing.  </li>
            <li> you want to stop biting/picking, bitter polish is absolutely the way to go.  </li>
            <li> We even prepared for middle of the night awakenings (some parents recommended having juice near the bed with which to rinse out the taste)</li>
            <li> three yr old stop sucking her middle two fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I completely and totally recommend this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely has helped my three year old break the thumb sucking habit, but it should be used cautiously.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a 21 yr old male that has bitten his nails all his life, i just haev to say that this product realy worked wonders.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well, has a uniquely bitter, and lingering taste.  </li>
            <li> It has been the only thing that has helped my 10 year old to stop sucking his thumb or fingers.</li>
            <li> works for trying to get 4 year old to stop sucking her fingers - but need constant reapplication</li>
            <li> My eleven year old finally stopped biting her nails because of this product.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, my son&#x27;s taste buds wasn&#x27;t too altered from this product because he sucked his thumb anyway inspite of a heavier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We kept it up an extra week just so old habbits would not set in.  </li>
            <li> our 3.5 year old stopped sucking her thumb and never went back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have been chewing my fingers as far back as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> After ONLY one application she STOPPED COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li> Bitter taste is very unsatisfying and stays on your tongue for a while.</li>
            <li> When my 4 year old daughter began biting her nails, I realized I couldn&#x27;t tell her to not bite them when she saw her mom doing the same thing.</li>
            <li> and it had actually fallen off completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is possible that she is too young for</li>
            <li> , IDK I was such a young child</li>
            <li> I like the constant busy work of it, the way the nails and cuticle feel when i chew them, the way feeling afterward</li>
            <li> for the cat, our 5 month old kitty was recently spayed.  </li>
            <li> My son is 3 years old and is constantly sucking his thumb day and night</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails since I can remember and now at 30 years old, I&#x27;ve had enough.</li>
            <li> Now my second son has developed the habit  (both around age 7) and we hope he&#x27;ll get over it soon.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old male.</li>
            <li> My three year old stopped sucking his fingers after only ONE application.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 years old and was still sucking his thumb regularly.  </li>
            <li> This took only one day of applications to completly stop my 4 year old son from sucking his thumb during the day.  </li>
            <li> My niece is 3 years old, only used one time, he stopped suck his thumb.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it may rub off to food if you using bare hands-</li>
            <li> And definitely helps, but it doesn&#x27;t completely solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I thought if I tried something like this early into the phase that we might stop it instead of him possibly doing it for the rest of his life.</li>
            <li> He stopped by third week and completely probably by 5th or 6th week.</li>
            <li> It only took 2 days with my 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> The bitter taste really helped me control my nail bitting</li>
            <li> MY 3 year old daughter totally forgot this product was ever on her nail.</li>
            <li> level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest switching to a fork for eating while using this product, as the taste does interfere with eating foods with your bare fingers.  </li>
            <li> After the second application he was completely done sucking.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has been biting his nails out of the blue</li>
            <li> Only reason I give the item 3 stars is it did not cure my 5 year old daughters</li>
            <li> My kids were old enough to deal with the yuck and the gagging.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my 2 year old and he stopped sucking his thumb the same day!!!</li>
            <li> We had tried several things to try to get our 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb that did not work.  </li>
            <li> I have only applied twice so far.</li>
            <li> If it can help someone who has bit their nails for the last 33 years plus then it will help you, too.duct works on children, but I can speak for an adult and this product does work.</li>
            <li> My six-year-old has sucked her middle and ring finger since she was three months old.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 year old used to suck her thumb constantly.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old not only bite her nails but sucked on  her thumb since before she was born ( I have an ultrasound that shows it!)it</li>
            <li> Finally got my two year old to stop sucking on her hand.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and at 3 years old, she was starting to affect her bite.</li>
            <li> She will be 3 in the winter, so perhaps she isn&#x27;t old enough for the product yet.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my almost 3 year old daughter to finally stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> We did try it one when she was younger (2yrs old)</li>
            <li> Not only did it stop me immediately from biting my nails, but my two year old also stopped his thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my 3 year old niece who has suddenly started sucking her thumb out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product for children old enough to express themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and literally will NOT put my fingers in my mouth or near it.</li>
            <li> Similarly, my 8 year old tried to eat carrots and some chips --both times, her fingers touched her mouth and she couldn&#x27;t handle eating anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have been biting my nails since I was in middle school.</li>
            <li> The bitter taste stays on the skin for two days and it really deters the user.  </li>
            <li> As she was going to bed she attempted to suck her thumb and was completely taken back by the taste.</li>
            <li> Maybe using it on a younger child would work, I dont know, but my 5 year old outsmarted the stuff almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This did the trick for my 5 year old who bites her nails daily.  </li>
            <li> realized the biggest problem I had was not the willpower, per se, but simply that when I got busy I would start biting out of habbit without even realizing it.  </li>
            <li> I only had to use this once for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> My seven year old stopped sucking his thumb the same day I applied the Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li> My four year old son finally stopped chewing on his nails!</li>
            <li> After reading even adult reviews of this product and how psychologically they thought before putting it into their mouth and it changed their behavior I knew it would work.  </li>
            <li> The answers in Q/A section saying this nail polish had some shine but barely noticeable were the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> The child needs to be old enough to understand what is going on.</li>
            <li> think there is a note about younger kids not minding the taste on the instructions, but I think some kids may fall into that category well after 3 years old depending on their motivation.</li>
            <li> tried again in vain to get him to stop, even going so far as to show him pictures of the medieval torture device they call a palate spacer.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t necessary, he had completely given up the thumb</li>
            <li> I say: thumb sucking is subconscious and what this product does is bring the process of thumb sucking to the conscious level.  </li>
            <li> Our 4 year old sucked her thumb constantly and was developing quite an overbite.  </li>
            <li> and we barely used any.  </li>
            <li> and I am determined to stop because I noticed my 2yr old starting to bite hers.</li>
            <li> My 6-year old continues to bite his nails even with multiple coats of this on.</li>
            <li> soon as the nail polish comes off my fingernails, I go back to my old habit of chewing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> We only had to use this twice before my 11 year old daughter quit sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old male who is trying to stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I used this on my child when he was about 4 years old because he would occasional suck his thumb</li>
            <li> I have a 7-year old boy who HAD been biting his fingernails constantly!</li>
            <li> My boy actually cried when he realized that he would have to taste the Mavala every time he got his fingers near his mouth...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason that I only gave it 4 stars was because I tried it with my 2 year old twins who suck their fingers.  </li>
            <li> Within an hour of trying it out my 2 year old was back at sucking his thumb like there was no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> only go so far.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old who is constantly biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> 8 yr old finally quit!</li>
            <li> I would agree that for a younger child who cannot fully understand what it is this may not be the correct course of action.  </li>
            <li> I tried a similar product when she was around 3 yrs old but didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and have been biting my fingernails my entire life.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 2 year old who constantly bites her nails.</li>
            <li> I usually only need to apply about two coats per day since I wash my hands a lot and use hand sanitizer frequently.</li>
            <li> She was starting to get self conscious about her habit</li>
            <li> My 19 month old daughter had a severe addiction to sucking on her 1st 2 fingers of her left hand.  </li>
            <li> Instantly helped our 4 year old stop ducking her thumb at night.</li>
            <li> I have to mention that she somewhat mentally was ready for stopping though.</li>
            <li> My just turned 4 year old sucked two of her fingers at once, on a daily basis, from the time she was an infant.</li>
            <li> She sucked her fingers while watching tv, while falling asleep, and to help her fall back asleep when she woke early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until she was asleep for the night and her fingers had fallen out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mavala Stop because my 3yr old has recently started biting her nails.</li>
            <li> It is enough to keep me from even placing my hand near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that made my 6-year old stop sucking his thumb, I can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it stop my 7 year old daughter from sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> By the time his third birthday arrived, I had already researched and purchased Mavala Stop for fear of having a 9 year old thumb-sucker (I&#x27;ve seen plenty).</li>
            <li> I used what was left in the bottle (about 2 ml) and by the end of the week, he completely stopped thumb-sucking.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son sucked his thumb constantly, day and night.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, my THIRTEEN year old daughter has finally kicked the sucking thumb habit,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 month old son who was sucking his thumb to the point that we were concerned about the possible loss of his nail (yuck).</li>
            <li> Stopped my three year old from biting his nails almost instantly.</li>
            <li> we have applied it only two times for my five years old..</li>
            <li> Has worked so far on GF only thing is you have to stay on the ball with reminding whoever is using it.</li>
            <li> My son has had a habit of sucking on his pointer and middle finger together at once since he was 4 months old.</li>
            <li> I initially reviewed this and gave it 5 stars after about a week as my 3 year old son had virtually stopped sucking his thumb about 90% of the time.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old finally stopped putting her thumb into her mouth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> The recipient (a 6 year old former nail-biter) doesn&#x27;t mind it being applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old male.  </li>
            <li> This worked instantly with my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Only had to put this on my 3 year old daughters thumb nail once and</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;ve been using this, he has stopped biting his nails totally and completely.</li>
            <li> Stopped my 5 year old from sucking her thumb instantly.</li>
            <li> works really well is really bitter</li>
            <li> This was the ONLY product that worked for my 5 year old son...</li>
            <li> /&gt;We turned to this as a last resort because he&#x27;s going to need early orthodontia, but his orthodontist told us that she wouldn&#x27;t put anything on his teeth until he stopped biting his nails because that could undermine the quality of the braces.</li>
            <li> awful!&amp;#34; I continue to apply Mavala Stop every day if I can (every other day at least), but after a week I have finally been able to trim her nails!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old had a rather gross habit of picking her nose and eating her...</li>
            <li> the product did warn that kids may get used to the taste/smell and go back to their old habits.  </li>
            <li> My six year old would not stop sucking on his fore and middle fingers.</li>
            <li> Fingernails on 7-year old child are starting to grow within a week.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely bitter (I tested on my fingers first) and an instant deterrent, however, a bit after a week my daughter got used to the taste</li>
            <li> My son struggled to get to sleep the first night, upset with the bitter taste each time he attempted to suck his thumb, however by the next night, it was no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Even more she the one asked me to apply when she find out no more bitter taste on her thumbs when by coincidence she bite them.</li>
            <li> This product never worked on our kid, first day she felt bitter taste but later got adjusted to taste.</li>
            <li> Everything was back to normal for us on the third day.</li>
            <li> It is a bitter chemical taste that stays in your mouth for several minutes after you first taste it, no wonder</li>
            <li> I am thinking the poor reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work might be by their genetic&lt;br /&gt;factor of not being able to taste bitterness?</li>
            <li> We still apply it every few nights to keep the success going.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it for awhile to make sure the habit is broken</li>
            <li> I used the stuff for about two weeks until I was confident that I had broken the habit.  </li>
            <li> She even sucked on her fingers, just a few minutes after a fresh coat of the product was applied.  </li>
            <li> We will keep using it until we are sure that the habit is broken.  </li>
            <li> We continued to use the Mavala every night for about 6-8 weeks just to be sure the habit was broken.  </li>
            <li> This product worked much much better, lasted longer, and tasted much worse.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t sucked her finger in almost a year, so I&#x27;m sure the habit has been broken by now.</li>
            <li> Time to step up the game from bandaids on his thumb to something more.</li>
            <li> She seems completely healthy and isn&#x27;t any worse for wear.  </li>
            <li> after reading this, I&#x27;m really glad that I didn&#x27;t let this touch my child&#x27;s thumb, and I&#x27;m annoyed that I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> So many people told me that this habit would fall away, but in our experience it just got worse.  </li>
            <li> I have found a worse tasting product that works better for me.  </li>
            <li> I am still using this product until I am sure that the habit broken.</li>
            <li> She promptly asked me if she could suck her thumb as soon as the Mavala had dried, and I obliged with a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> Believe me, it is totally worth the money now, then having to pay for braces further down the road.</li>
            <li> After the first taste of it he wanted to have something to drink to wash it down for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Looking down at my nails right now, any minor issues are completely excusable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve eaten my share of gross things over the years, and generally a quick rinse and a few spits</li>
            <li> The longest I&#x27;ve ever gone without biting my nails is a few months and it was only because I was pregnant and for some reason didn&#x27;t have the urge.  </li>
            <li> Even if you remove the product (such as if a child deliberately strips the stuff off as soon as you&#x27;re out of sight), you will still taste it strongly for at least a day or two.  </li>
            <li> Overall we were shocked at how quickly and easily it has put a stop to the thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t stop using it right away because she started sucking again after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After having had no fewer than dozens of serious infections, two of which prompted my physician to emphasize the urgency of this matter - and after having removed the white part of my middle finger nail on my dominant hand (while leaving the remainder in tact) on two separate occasions, I thought I would give it one more</li>
            <li> I started to see him sucking his thumb less in the first week</li>
            <li> Whenever I bite my nails, I don&#x27;t even realize it at first, and by the time I realize it, half of my nails are already ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-----&gt;Now to the product, after applying it less then 24 hours ago for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My only recommendation is to use it in small quantities on the offending digit, as we originally put excess amounts on all of her fingers</li>
            <li> Be consistent about applying the product daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> She was hesitant at first but finally agreed when I explained to her how it looks like to other people seeing her that way.</li>
            <li> Actually this is my second time to use mavala stop,first with my older daughter and now with the second one</li>
            <li> I applied while she was sleeping and used it twice and noticed right from the first week that she was biting her nail less and less, after the 2nd used she quit biting them all together just yesterday</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.</li>
            <li> We tried discouraging the thumb sucking since he was about 2.5 years old with very little success (that was when he went from sucking his thumb all the time to only at night and when upset).</li>
            <li> I originally bought Thum brand polish to stop my nail biting, but it wasn&#x27;t the least bit</li>
            <li> I realized he started sucking on the other hand after two days, not as intensely but still.  </li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t think it would work since I had tried other products like Thum.  </li>
            <li> We tried other methods for months without much luck.  </li>
            <li> In just two applications (just a dab based on other reviewers saying not to use too much) he quit.</li>
            <li> The direction call for coating nail every other day, but it may require coating once or twice a day depending on how much they have sucked.  </li>
            <li> I Bought this product for my son who was still sucking his thumb at 10 years old,I tried other products which really did not help, after just 2 application</li>
            <li> I really thought I would never break him of this habit, if he was not eating one of his thumbs were almost always in his mouth while the other was playing with his toy or whatever he was doing.  </li>
            <li> I just put a dab on (thanks to other comments on here).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for other kids who are ready to get help breaking &amp;#34;hand in mouth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried three different products from drug and beauty supply stores with little success.  </li>
            <li> and we are just finally getting back to normal although he&#x27;s still only doing 9 hours instead of 13.</li>
            <li> Maybe my children just don&#x27;t have sensitive taste buds (they&#x27;re generally not picky eaters like some I&#x27;ve seen), but this did not help us at all.  </li>
            <li> After 2 bottles worth it may have been wasted money, as it did not help in the long run of breaking my old habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does taste terrible and it was a pretty good deterrent for daytime, but we really needed something to get her through the night without sucking her thumb and this did not work.  </li>
            <li> It also has an annoying numbing effect on your tongue which in this case is a good thing!</li>
            <li> stop the bite\\&quot; is very bitter and the taste comes on much quicker than Malvala.</li>
            <li> This tastes very bitter, as advertised, but that didn&#x27;t seem to stop my daughter too much.  </li>
            <li> It was to much , she threw up, and everything tasted very bitter for 2 days.</li>
            <li> Had been trying all sorts of tactics for the last year (including vinegar and other &amp;#34;bitter&amp;#34; tasting products, positive reinforcement charts, games of &amp;#34;hiding the thumb&amp;#34;, etc.)</li>
            <li> I tried Mavala Stop after seeing other positive reviews, and it has definitely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> This one does, but at least for us and our incredibly oral child, it still is not a perfect solution to end thumbsucking</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the perfect solution to my 3yr old&#x27;s disgusting habit of&lt;br /&gt;nail biting</li>
            <li> When asked if she was ready to stop sucking her fingers, she would reply in the negative, so I didn&#x27;t think she was ready for the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant, sure, but it&#x27;s certainly not much of a deterrent  for an adult chronic nail biter.</li>
            <li> It actually does coat your nails in a clear coat so that if you are a male, it does not look like you have polish on your nails.</li>
            <li> We tried several different things to help our 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Since she is only 2 years old, initially we were concerned about the safety of Mavala</li>
            <li> after doing everything possible for over 5 years to get my 11 yr old to stop biting her nails, this finally worked.  </li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old female who has been biting my nails since 2nd grade</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth.</li>
            <li> The only downside comes when eating, especially with my 4 year old because her fingers sometimes go into her mouth by accident.</li>
            <li> We also plan on using it with my younger daughter in the near future.  </li>
            <li> This is the only polish that actually works for my 9 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter finally stopped sucking her 2 fingers (index and middle)!  </li>
            <li> We have tried everything to help our 3½ year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, and this is the only product that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> Applied as directed on my 3 year old son and 20 minutes later he&#x27;s sucking his thumb without so much as a second thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the product on my 3 year old daughter who constantly bites her nails.</li>
            <li> We next tried to rig up a homemade soft collar to stop her injuring herself, but that didn&#x27;t work well either and only lasted</li>
            <li> We had to apply this once every other day on our 5yr old to stop biting his nails and it took 2 months for him to completely stop!</li>
            <li> We tried to be gentle, we tried to be firm, we tried to keep her hands busy but nothing was working.</li>
            <li> Our 3 1/2 year old sucked his thumb on a regular basis, and we have tried multiple products to get him to stop.  </li>
            <li> Around the second week, she figured out that it was bitter and didn&#x27;t want to let us use it, but we reassured her that it is nontoxic and would really help her stop sucking her</li>
            <li> We tried different methods for making my four year old stop sucking her thumb, this is the only product that is stopping her.</li>
            <li> I will be using it on my younger son when he is old enough per the package directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This weapons-grade liquid evil goes on nice and clear, and only with a close inspection would anyone be able to tell that your fingernails are especially shiny.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how often I put my fingers in my mouth, not only to bite my nails, but to dislodge food that was stuck in the back of my mouth or when I was eating a finger food like potato chips.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 2 1/2 yr old who has a habit of sucking on his 2 middle fingers, but also is constantly is sticking all of his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Our 2 yr old daughter would constantly suck her two fingers (middle and ring) until we used this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this back in 2012 for my then 18 month old who was sucking index and middle finger.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old is back at it again sucking on her index and middle finger.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that worked for my nine year old son, didn&#x27;t think it was possible at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old female, and have been biting my nails my entire life.</li>
            <li> I am a 32yr old male and have been bitten my nails since middle school.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 yr old daughter sucked her thumb mostly when she slept or got bored</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with it is it&#x27;s not immediately bitter</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to know those germs are not constantly being transmitted to her mouth and through the broken skin on her fingertips.  </li>
            <li> make sure u apply only a thin layer on the nail because if it is on skin and if u touch anthing u eat, you will feel a taste change</li>
            <li> It is somewhat irritating, but I can definitely see that soon I won&#x27;t have to have the reminder to keep my nails healthy anymore.</li>
            <li> It tastes nasty, but you have to keep applying every 2 days at the most for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I was excited at the idea of using this on my 4year old thumb sucker who had pushed his teeth out of position, thinking that yes the end is in sight!</li>
            <li> I thought its gonna be too hard for her, specially she was used to suck it so she can sleep.</li>
            <li> Very strong and difficult to get the taste out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> At this point I would most rather get my money back, but I realize that its pointless (due to the price and the fact that I have opened it and used it).</li>
            <li> minutes after applying the first coat, I saw a streak of little person running to the refrigerator to grab some water.</li>
            <li> This product works for us, my little girl hates the taste of it but is willing to put it on if I give her a piece of gum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first application I put on my sons nail stomps, but also a little beyond on his finger tips, so he wouldn&#x27;t move his biting attention.</li>
            <li> After feeling like we had no other options, we finally tried this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my nail biting was getting to be a big enough problem that this small inconvenience was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> i went days with out putting it on at first and my stubborn little guy was hiding sucking his thumb....</li>
            <li> First thing this morning, without even thinking about it, I went to bite of the smallest little piece of nail.</li>
            <li> From start to finish, the process only took one week with the major part being 2</li>
            <li> He has not bitten his nails since using it, and we just clipped his nails for the first time since he was a little baby.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy his poor chewed up finger nails can finally grow normally, while keeping unnecessary germs out of his mouth</li>
            <li> When I got this stuff in the mail I put it on right away, a few hours later when I went to bite my nails</li>
            <li> Her thumb went in her mouth, came right back out, and she started crying for a drink to get the taste out.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few nights, then, she went right back to sucking.  </li>
            <li> My son no longer sucks his thumb and it worked right away!  </li>
            <li> We put pretty pink nail polish (speed dry) on her toe</li>
            <li> It was not easy, but totally and completely worth it.</li>
            <li> - we just put a couple of small dabs since it is quite strong and bitter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-you can&#x27;t remove the taste from your nails right away, it&#x27;ll slowly fade (usually gone by day 2 or 3, but you can reapply a fresh coat!), so if you&#x27;re going to have any lady friends nibbling on your hands, you should probably warn them...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used another product that was more of a salve for your nails and it healed my hands much more quickly, but was not so nasty and it dried out in my pocket and required reapplication.  </li>
            <li> My 9 month old will get his thumb painted when he gets a little older.</li>
            <li> but I guess our daughter will stop this bad habbit on her own terms!</li>
            <li> Generally deters my child, who is a rabid nail biter, but only if we use it intermittently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving this product 4 stars as we have tried several other products that really don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old woman who has been biting her nails for as long as she can remember.</li>
            <li> She was four years old and been sucking her thumb as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> As a nail biter all my life so far this stuff works (as long as you put it on).</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son has been sucking his thumb for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Apparently the breaks in the skin from his teeth combined with getting dirt or whatever on his hands was enough to cause the infection.</li>
            <li> but my two year old was not put off for long using this product.</li>
            <li> I put in on my son&#x27;s fingernails every other day the first week, every 3 days the second week, once a week the third week and up to present.  </li>
            <li> My son has gone from sucking his thumb all day long to completely stopping.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Orly nail biting product and you can barely taste that stuff, even shortly after applying.</li>
            <li> As a side note, my 19 month old was still pestering me to nurse her before bedtime, long after my milk supply had vanished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t taste it myself, but it wasn&#x27;t apparently THAT gross.</li>
            <li> After another application, the problem was mitigated for a considerable while, only happening during sleep several weeks later.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been sucking her fingers so long that she has tooth marked scars on two of her fingers where her teeth meet the flesh of her finger.  </li>
            <li> It did not take long for this to work on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have been a nail biter for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Of course he was very cranky for a while trying to adjust to such a big change, but that&#x27;s like any habit someone tries to quit.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the rim of the jar had gotten sticky and I cleaned it myself earlier this week and apparently got some on my fingers.</li>
            <li> The first day she tried to switch to her other thumb, but she didnt like that and didnt try it for long.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 4 products similar to this one and this is by far the most useless one for me.</li>
            <li> After this first night, he never woke crying again.</li>
            <li> For the first day, I put it on her, she try to nibble before it dried, and she vomited.  </li>
            <li> The first night we tried Mavala he was up a lot during the night, crying because he needed his thumb to fall asleep (he said).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I applied it after the first few days.  </li>
            <li> We have a block full of recovering thumb suckers now..</li>
            <li> Our son got hooked on sucking his thumb when he was born at 35 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be held for the first few weeks of life.  </li>
            <li> My son (9) who chews his fingernails doesn&#x27;t touch them when the Mavala is freshly applied (usually lasts 1 to 2 days).  </li>
            <li> Not sure it was worth it...</li>
            <li> Just be aware because this has ruined my appetite quite a few times.</li>
            <li> well the first few times I have used it.</li>
            <li> I applied a heavy coat on both kids&#x27; fingernails the first night I received Mavala in the mail.</li>
            <li> The first couple of nights she was whining all night &amp; crying at times</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks she asked me every night if her thumb was still yucking and</li>
            <li> The first day she put her thumb in her mouth a few times and gagged.  </li>
            <li> This product worked well the first few times.</li>
            <li> First time he forgot it was on, he spit for a few seconds, and now he learned a lesson.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first few days</li>
            <li> 2 minutes later her thumb is right back in her mouth, should would frown a little bit</li>
            <li> It took us a long time to calm them down and they kept putting their fingers back in their mouth and it started all over again.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> However, applying a larger glob to cover some skin area too had a more dramatic effect when the thumb was sucked;  There was coughing for about 5 minutes,</li>
            <li> and we really didn&#x27;t want to go down</li>
            <li> It has slowed him down a bit, but if he really wants to suck his thumb it doesn&#x27;t stop him.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it fabulous for discouraging nail-biting, but it also helps if your little one tends to eat their noodles (or other fork-worthy foods) with their fingers.  </li>
            <li> Our dd was addicted to her thumbs, and after trying many other things (including rewards, transferring to a different lovey, pep talks from dentist and pediatrician), we got the book &#x27;Thumb Love&#x27;, and after reading it a few times, applied just a dot to her thumbs every other day for maybe three applications.</li>
            <li> so I only put a little bit on at first.  </li>
            <li> The first day she put her thumb in her mouth without thinking over a dozen times, each time ripping it back out and spluttering a little.  </li>
            <li> it was like a miracle,with my second i put for her twice,at the first time coz she kept trying to suck she throw out a little</li>
            <li> It works, but does wear off towards the end of the day due mainly to hand washing.  </li>
            <li> biting nails is super hard to break.</li>
            <li> When they got too old we just told them that their thumb would start tasting bad when it was ready to be left alone :)  </li>
            <li> after few weeks i noticed that i don&#x27;t get the same first YUCK feeling that i got the first few days..</li>
            <li> tip - be very careful getting the lid on tight &amp; periodically clean the threads on the cap.</li>
            <li> This one seems to have been a little more offensive than the last one we tried, but it&#x27;s not strong enough for a compulsive nail biter.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and as expected, tastes extremely bitter when you get it in your mouth which is a great way to make you stop biting your nails however it does make eating finger foods a little difficult.</li>
            <li> I thought I just had my hands near my mouth when biting my nails, but I realized I put them near my mouth other times as well, such as when eating foods with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> He did vomit once that first night due to him sucking on his thumb just long enough while falling asleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered it here on Amazon and was really hoping it would work since it was so much more expensive than the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Product was effective for only approximately one week with an every other a day application.</li>
            <li> my child would just keep right on sucking that thumb without missing a beat!</li>
            <li> she would suck right past the taste.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers, I would bite my nails down the quick.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is five years old and comes from a very long line of thumb-suckers (three generations that I know of).  </li>
            <li> That was the main reason I stopped wearing it on my own nails, it basically made me sick when I tried to eat anything</li>
            <li> It is funny because most people don&#x27;t believe it could be that bad</li>
            <li> It sure does taste bad, and it makes me aware of what I&#x27;m doing with my hands.</li>
            <li> The bad flavor lasts for 2 full days with a less effective 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> It does say should be used on ages 3 and up, and shes only 2 1/2, but at such a young age, I feel like its easier to break the habit now, And watching her bite her nails, to where they are bright red, and just look painful, I can&#x27;t let it continue.</li>
            <li> For he knows that we still have a full bottle ready to use if carelessly bites his nails again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We applied the Mavala on his thumbs, and the smell was less than appetizing.  </li>
            <li> For myself, if I ever needed to buy another bottle (hopefully not) I might look for something that provides a less intense reminder to not bite my nails.</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle and then didn&#x27;t really need it anymore, every once in a while</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 1/2 years old and sucks her first two fingers.  </li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old who sucks his first two fingers</li>
            <li> For a 3 year old, coating only the nail was plenty to cause gagging and some minor throw up, and the child hasn&#x27;t sucked thumb since.  </li>
            <li> We have so far not had any problem of her contaminating her food, but have been careful to only apply the tiniest amount of product as far back as possible on the fingernail.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s obviously too young and a long ways off from this type of thing.</li>
            <li> I am currently 30 years old and I have bitten my nails for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> He woke up once the first night crying, and I went in and explained that he must be getting to be a bigger boy and congratulations!</li>
            <li> My four year old was an avid thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, he didn&#x27;t like the taste, but within a few hours the thumb was back in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> If your child has the same night time habit, try this for the first few times during the day to prevent the meltdown at bedtime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 2.8 year old was an avid thumb sucker:  while playing, watching TV, traveling, before and during sleep.  </li>
            <li> It wears off relatively quickly and has to be reapplied at least once a day.</li>
            <li> My niece just turned 3 years old and was an avid thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> Now my little guy did throw up only once when he took this first big suck on the thumb.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway we use it all the time and it single handedly stopped our 3 year old form sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I gave him a bath, and he figured it out (the little smart alex)  </li>
            <li> We really wanted to cut the habbit before her 3rd birthday because as a former finger sucker myself, I know the older</li>
            <li> Please note that the bottle recommends not giving this to any child under 3, but my wife and I were desperate :) The product works!</li>
            <li> and it was really begining to mess up his teeth.</li>
            <li> the whole bottle was a gummy mess.</li>
            <li> I actually tried it first and was shocked on how potent it was..</li>
            <li> Avoid eating finger foods and touching your lips (or at least be very careful)!</li>
            <li> Avoid eating finger foods and touching your lips (or at least be very careful)!</li>
            <li> I have continued to apply the product regularly for the past few weeks just to be sure she does not relapse but have not seen her thumb in her mouth once since we started using it.  </li>
            <li> To alleviate this problem, I began to paint only a small part of her nail, right over the cuticle and onto the finger itself.  </li>
            <li> that being said, I cannot testify to any of its other uses (such as to deter thumb sucking), but I do highly recommend it to anyone with a nail-biting problem.</li>
            <li> that being said, I cannot testify to any of its other uses (such as to deter thumb sucking), but I do highly recommend it to anyone with a nail-biting problem.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the second bottle was not nearly as strong a taste as the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used this for my two and half year old daughter who has been sucking thumb ever since she was a week old and had started to use her thumb sucking as a weapon because she knew it irritated us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My 2 and half year old kid get used to suck her thumb since she was 2 months old and was still suck it just before I use Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> But with this product I have been able to slow it down, and actually recognize when I&#x27;m doing it.  </li>
            <li> Soon after applying a thick coat of this to my 3-year-old&#x27;s entire thumb nail, she stuck it in her mouth, quickly pulled it out and looked at her thumb.</li>
            <li> I quickly explained &amp;#34;I know it doesn&#x27;t taste good, and every time you put your thumb in your mouth it&#x27;s going to be nasty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 years old and have been a chronic nail biter and after using this product I have Long Nails!!</li>
            <li> only negative is that I wish is came in a smaller size because we have almost a full bottle left over!</li>
            <li> I used it on my 4 year old daughter who thumb sucks and am getting positive results already.</li>
            <li> We tried a few approaches (reward charts, positive encouragement, constant reminders, etc).  </li>
            <li> It is definitely bitter enough to deter carefree finger sucking, but so far hasn&#x27;t really slowed my child down.</li>
            <li> We had to make sure we don&#x27;t forget painting it every night, gently reminding son of his bad habbit by reading a social story and a lot of support and encouragements throughout the process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, but slightly glossy (not as glossy as regular clear nail polish, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was clearly disturbed by the taste of the product and within a few days, she had completely stopped sucking or trying to suck her fingers!</li>
            <li> Since she was older than the average kid that uses it for thumb-sucking, I didn&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li> Then two of her milk teeth became loose and fell out in which I realized that this habitual hand sucking habit could potentially alter the locations of her emerging adult teeth.</li>
            <li> or I would need to pay out large amounts of money for an appliance for his mouth now, and braces in a few years.</li>
            <li> It does go on easy like nail polish and dries fast, The taste is bad enough to stop anyone from putting their fingers anywhere near their mouth however if you eat anything with your fingers the taste rubs off on the food and makes the food inedible.</li>
            <li> the first night was rough, very rough.</li>
            <li> i have a very stubborn little boy.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I read the horror stories about this product, but it worked absolutely as advertised for us.</li>
            <li> After a hug and a kiss and a little time sitting together talking about it she was ready to sleep again.  </li>
            <li> While she was fast asleep, I put just BARELY a little on.</li>
            <li> As far as her diet she has been doing well she has not refused to eat any of her normal food due to the bitter taste of her thumb.</li>
            <li> We have not applied Mavala Stop more than that one time and, as I stated, only used a very, very light amount--just so a bit of the nasty taste would be there to stop her licking and chewing.  </li>
            <li> I think she was ready to quit and just needed a little help since it was such an ingrained habit for her.  </li>
            <li> i was biting my nails all the time since i was a little girl, now that I used this my nails are long and pretty.</li>
            <li> this product is such a life saver, my daughter has been sucking her thumb for a while, she has callous on her thumb due to her sucking habit, i&#x27;ve tried putting betadine, ginger, onion, garlic, cinnamon, band-aid but still no luck with it until her new dentist recommended this product, she stopped sucking her thumb for just 2 days,she said she don&#x27;t want to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> You heard me right - 10 year old thumb sucker, we tried EVERYTHING even a myotherapist and NOTHING worked until this!  </li>
            <li> So I recommended that you use very little and try it first</li>
            <li> was impressed, but skeptical, at the large number of glowing reviews on Amazon about this product, and the bad reviews were a result of improper use or not following the directions.</li>
            <li> So excited when I got the package and washed his hands and put a small little drop on his thumb nail (I read other reviews that said doing the whole nail made for a exorcism type experience</li>
            <li> Money very well spent!!!</li>
            <li> My 2 year old twin girls used to suck their thumb almost all day long!!!</li>
            <li> just not that good ( or bad ..  </li>
            <li> He said it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it didn&#x27;t taste good by any means.</li>
            <li> Bad Habit&amp;#34; helped him stop biting his nails for good.  </li>
            <li> The taste is bad and it lingers in your mouth for a good 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> my kid loved it, the smell was bad</li>
            <li> Which is a good and bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is a nice clear coat of nail polish, so it doesn&#x27;t look bad on your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good and bad at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is good and bad since it is a constant reminder you are breaking your habit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was bad enough for her to stop for good.</li>
            <li> So I ordered it and got it pretty fast and the first time she stuck her thumb in her mouth after I applied it she started screaming and said her thumb tasted bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 3 year old chronic thumb sucker and it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old daughter sucks her thumb so much -- including while asleep -- that the dentist said she had begun to deform her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she sucks on her thumbs sooo much.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son sucks his thumb so much</li>
            <li> We used this product simultaneously on 3 children: an 8.5 year old that puts his thumb in his mouth (not actually sucking) when he reads,  a 6.5 year old who bit her nails until the white was all gone with occasional bleeding, and a 2.5 year old who sucks both thumbs when sleepy/bored.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that worked and I will be using it with my 3 year old thumb sucker when I think he is ready.</li>
            <li> the more subtle it becomes until you&#x27;re back to biting your nails even with the slight taste of the product.  </li>
            <li> so I was initially hesitant to try this, however the polish is clear and not very noticeable</li>
            <li> It is a powerful formula with an incredibly bitter taste which stopped me dead.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give it to my child without knowing exactly what she was in for, so I put a little on my nail, let it dry &amp; put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> On the down side I have this nearly full bottle about to go waste.</li>
            <li> I was pretty careful to let them dry thoroughly and not touch them when wet</li>
            <li> absolutely stopped my daughter from sucking her thumb, highly recommend this for nail biters or thumb suckers!</li>
            <li> We continued to apply it about every other night for several weeks to be sure the habit was truly broken.</li>
            <li> I continued putting it on every other day for ten days or so just to make sure the habit was broken.</li>
            <li> I guess they are right because it didn&#x27;t work for us, my daughter is 2 and is still a finger sucker in spite of our attempts with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> It also says it is not effective for kids under three right on the package</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are please with the results and it works better than expected, with the minor annoyances of your child crying for little bits.</li>
            <li> Sometimes he is so proud of himself for going five days without sucking and then other times he gets really frustrated.  </li>
            <li> It dries rapidly and is not thick like a typical nail polish.  </li>
            <li> It dries rapidly and is not thick like a typical nail polish.  </li>
            <li> We then did every other day for about two weeks and have stopped completely for ten days now.  </li>
            <li> Used just a tiny dab on my son&#x27;s (3 1/2 years old) thumb nails once every other day for a week.</li>
            <li> I actually made a deal with my 3 year old that I would stop biting my nails while she stopped sucking her thumb - so we helped each other.</li>
            <li> I can literally wear it off in less than two days through my normal routine of hand washing and two showers per day.  </li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old daughter had begun to have problems with her bite due to constantly sucking her thumb, so I knew we needed to do something about it.</li>
            <li> 3 year old stopped thumb sucking in a day, but also got allergy and red spots on face and at some other parts of body.</li>
            <li> And if my daughter dips her thumb in milk or water or any other food the whole thing gets bitter and can&#x27;t be eaten.</li>
            <li> We had tried EVERYTHING to get our 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb once and for all, from reward systems, bribes, discipline, several other nail polishes for thumb sucking, but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product on my 2 year old, even though I read reviews of it possibly not working, due to his developing taste bud</li>
            <li> Just give them a little warning, so they&#x27;re not completely shocked by the bad taste :)</li>
            <li> The first few nights he still would suck his thumb after he was already asleep, but eventually the bitter taste would wake him up &amp; he would fall back to sleep without putting it back in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I seriously began seeing results within the first couple of days!</li>
            <li> Used it on our 2 and a half year old whos finger sucking was ferocious; after a couple of rough nights, she stopped sucking her fingers completely after about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> But for our older child who wanted to stop, this did the trick in giving her the little push she needed.</li>
            <li> We tried putting on two coats and letting each coat dry a few minutes, but the bitter taste did not last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same as Bite Free, tastes pretty bad when you put it on</li>
            <li> As you can see in the photo, this product has a shine comparable to that of other clear nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> As you can see in the photo, this product has a shine comparable to that of other clear nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> I had been trying to get my 3 year old to give up thumb sucking with other methods.</li>
            <li> We tried other products (like Thum) to help our 3-year old daughter&lt;br /&gt;stop</li>
            <li> As far as night time goes I had to put it on her fingers every other night and did that 3 times before she didn&#x27;t do it at night anymore.  </li>
            <li> The first day was a little rough on the kids and parents.  </li>
            <li> I put a little on the first time to be careful.  </li>
            <li> The taste can only be described as bitter with no other notes...</li>
            <li> The first day, my daughter was not happy with the taste but decided it was worth to keep sucking her fingers and crying that they were \\&quot;yucky\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This was for a true chronic thumb sucker!  </li>
            <li> A few days and the habit was broken, and her nails are nice and long.  </li>
            <li> #34;dude are you wearing nail polish?&amp;#34; Aside from that I would discourage the use of this product with infants or kids young enough try cry when they taste something horrible, because this product is super potent.</li>
            <li> Over time cap can be hard to open - rinse bottle in hot water and twist.</li>
            <li> Ive had mine for a few months and its gotten gummy, Im reordered a new bottle and hope to beat the habit soon!</li>
            <li> It goes on clear (maybe a little too clear and shiny for my male fingertips, but small complaint) and stays on strong.</li>
            <li> So, I trimmed them down - as hard as it was to see my first-time natural long nails cut - filed and buffed them, then painted them with a light pink polish.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this first especially since one of the twins sucks either thumb</li>
            <li> My son only really sucks his thumb anymore in his sleep when he isn&#x27;t even aware of it.</li>
            <li> If you have been doing it for a long time and are having trouble quitting I really suggest this stuff.</li>
            <li> Our son was an avid thumb sucker at night and occasionally throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We researched products out there</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the first time  I used it it literally glued its self shut.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that he has is that for the first couple of weeks he could taste it on his food too when he picked it up.</li>
            <li> However, I do think it might be enough of a deterrent to at least make me aware that I&#x27;m biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Her husband couldn&#x27;t open it by hand and thought that the taste would be off the bottle after such a long time of not using it, so he used his teeth.  </li>
            <li> I think one bottle would last long enough to treat about 100 people.</li>
            <li> That sucks, but I must say it&#x27;s worth it to have long nails.</li>
            <li> After using Mavala every day for a couple of weeks, his nails were long enough that he actually needed to cut them with clippers!</li>
            <li> and it LAST long, it could last maybe 3 days (</li>
            <li> I found it didn&#x27;t last long that way, so just ended up painting the entire thumbnail on both hands.  </li>
            <li> We decided it was long enough and want to avoid any potential issues with his teeth, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first day he was already discouraged from biting his nails, and within three weeks he has broken the habit completely.</li>
            <li> Just a brush of the nail near her mouth was enough to get the sour taste</li>
            <li> The first few tries of thumb sucking he said it was &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; and wiped his tongue off with a towel and wanted water.</li>
            <li> As long I keep applying it every few days or so, she does a fantastic job of not biting her nails, so they are finally starting to grow out a little!</li>
            <li> and i have not been chewing my nails for the past 10 days, which is certainly a record for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boyfriend has bitten his nails down to nearly nothing left for 35 years and hasn&#x27;t in the month since this arrived!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 4 years old and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where I bit nails, the skin around my nails, the surface of my nails, and I had bites going down my entire thumb!</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that the product states that it is for 3 years old and up.</li>
            <li> As a man who is not exactly into painting his nails everyday that&#x27;s a pretty big drawback.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing, which is really a good thing, is that I no longer lick my fingers when I&#x27;m eating (ok, admit it, you do it too with fried chicken).</li>
            <li> Be careful with putting the lid back on---it stuck and my husband finally got it back open with pliers.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half, she completely stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> My older son had to have an appliance put in his mouth when he was four to stop thumb sucking - this is so much less traumatic and inexpensive!  </li>
            <li> I am 19 and I&#x27;ve been a pretty hard core nail biter for about four or five years.</li>
            <li> First night my 4 y/o had a hard time trying to figure out how to fall asleep w/o his thumb...</li>
            <li> The first two days were hard but by day three she was done.  </li>
            <li> This makes it really hard to eat finger foods (chips, hot wings, burritos, etc.)</li>
            <li> The first night was hard.  </li>
            <li> A bit hard at first as he could not eat with his hands at all, would get in his mouth even when he was not biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that since my habit was so bad, I kept doing it by accident and my sense of taste was altered for most of the first couple of days because I had basically embedded it into my lips and tongue.</li>
            <li> The next day, I promised him a new toy if he could go 3 days without crying about not sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> Every few weeks we need to apply a new coat to remind him not to pick the habit back up.  </li>
            <li> We kept hearing from doctors that we should not punish him or make him feel bad about sucking his thumb, but rather let him stop on his own because of social pressure from his friends at church.</li>
            <li> This only took one application for my 3 and a half year old son.  </li>
            <li> It just tastes like really strong fingernail polish, but not horrible or disgusting as others have posted.  </li>
            <li> The taste of Mavala Stop is absolutely horrific and is easily one of the most vile things I have ever tasted.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer and is equally effective, not to mention less expensive.</li>
            <li> It was tough for the first few days (maybe the first week)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but was amazed and how quickly this worked for my almost 6 year old.</li>
            <li> My pediatric dentist recommended this product for my six and a half year old daughter who is beginning to get her adult teeth and is experiencing movement of her teeth due to the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> The negative reinforcement was exactly what she needed.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle and has a brush that you apply the liquid with- much like a bottle of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> 30 seconds he took it out and complained about his mouth feeling funny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months since we first used mavala stop and she no longer sucks her fingers.  </li>
            <li> first time she acidentally tasted the polish on her thumb from eating (my one complaint about the product)</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about my experience was that I could still bite the skin at the end of my nail bed, but that&#x27;s only because nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on skin very well.</li>
            <li> We were very stressed out over this and really wanted him to stop but didn&#x27;t want to go about it the wrong way and cause an even bigger dependency on it.  </li>
            <li> From the first day we used this, we have a non-thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> That first night I slept with him and was worried how he would do because I know he sucks his thumb in his sleep.  </li>
            <li> When we are ready for a few sleepless nights we will be using!</li>
            <li> My son is a thumb sucker since first days.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product since it does make my granddaughter aware of what will happen if she doesn&#x27;t follow the instructions and keep those fingers where they should be.</li>
            <li> she complained that her finger tasted funny.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my daughter and in three minutes flat</li>
            <li> And YES it does last that long.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product to see if our results would be long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember, and it seems like I have tried everything out there to help me quit-this product is the only thing that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Long story short...</li>
            <li> The serum is supposed to work for two days, but 24 hours later my kid is unaffected.  </li>
            <li> Since I applied it, my son has not put his fingers in his mouth and his nails have gotten long enough for me to cut!  </li>
            <li> This product works well and the bottle will last extremely long with 1 application a day.  </li>
            <li> long story short</li>
            <li> But that is a minor inconvenience considering that  you only have to put up with it for a couple</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough</li>
            <li> Long story, short: it works.</li>
            <li> Long lasting (1-2 days)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry such a long review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/14/2013</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry such a long review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/14/2013</li>
            <li> As long as I keep his nails polished, he does well, but as soon as I forget, he goes back to biting.</li>
            <li> some gagging, minor throw up, but now thumb sucking is finally beginning to stop with just that one heavier application.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> naturally we had problems with his sleeping because he was so accustomed to suck his thumb to fall asleep and even during his sleep however that only lasted a week or so and with coaxing, reassuring, and sleeping in the bed next to his a few nights..</li>
            <li> I ended up sawing a glove to one of my son&#x27;s long sleeve shirts and that finally helped break the habit.</li>
            <li> Does not last long for my daughter&lt;</li>
            <li> I made up an excuse as to why I was only applying it to her thumbs, but she didn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> However he did use it long enough to start to break the habit.</li>
            <li> I have biten my nails for as long as I can remember and this is the only thing that has stopped me from biting my nails</li>
            <li> Long story short:  </li>
            <li> now I actually have to trim my nails so they don&#x27;t get too long.</li>
            <li> We put this off for a long time - but finally nothing would stop my son sucking his fingers so we tried this.</li>
            <li> The taste definitely stays on the lips for a long time.  </li>
            <li> so it last a long time if you need.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> so it is long lasting throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t stop putting his fingers in his mouth, biting his nails as soon as they grew long enough, etc.</li>
            <li> He attempted to suck his thumb but could not bare the taste.</li>
            <li> Co-worker recommended this and added idea I read off another Amazon review for a shopping trip (x5) for nails getting long enough to trim.</li>
            <li> We paid $75 for thumb guards which broke, caused sores and got strange looks as we went into public.</li>
            <li> After eating a couple french fires the only taste in my mouth was the bitter nail stuff, it ruined my entire meal!</li>
            <li> After eating a couple french fires the only taste in my mouth was the bitter nail stuff, it ruined my entire meal!</li>
            <li> But other than the first week we realized we didn&#x27;t need it everyday.</li>
            <li> When we first put it on her she avoided her fingers, but slowly got used to the taste and now it doesn&#x27;t bother her at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (there is no way to tell really as it was closed tightly but did not have any seal on the lid)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to use nail polish and nail care products seriously for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> My 4 year old bites her nails down to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Mavala because I have a 7 year old with ADHD who bites his nails down</li>
            <li> So far, we use those &amp;#34;one-size-fits all&amp;#34; gloves that you can get for $1.00 and athletic tape at night to keep the sucking down while she sleeps.  </li>
            <li> I am more of the older person who still bites :(</li>
            <li> My daughters nails were so far down</li>
            <li> /&gt;The biggest unexpected down side for me was that with any sort of finger foods (fries, chips, sandwiches, etc.)</li>
            <li> Although he hasn&#x27;t completely stopped, he has slowed down just because we are always watching.</li>
            <li> Been using this product on my 4 year old son for 2 weeks and is not even slowing him down on sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> The other thing I noticed is that it is so powerful, that if you&#x27;re even eating chips or other finger food, the taste will rub off on what you&#x27;re eating - even if you&#x27;re very careful!</li>
            <li> The solution does leave your nails a little shiny, similar to clear nail polish, and this helps to remind you not to chew at your nails.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is almost 4 and had we heard about this product earlier we would have done it a little sooner maybe 2 1/2 or 3 years old.  </li>
            <li> So be careful how much mavala you put on, start with a little bit and increase as needed.</li>
            <li> Application is as easy as normal nail polish and her habit is slowly getting broken.</li>
            <li> My son thought it was gross, but can i just reapply the product every few days without cleaning the previous application off first .</li>
            <li> She did this so much and so hard that she literally rubbed an open wound into the tip of her nose.</li>
            <li> Its been a little over a month now and my girl has completely stopped using her thumb!  </li>
            <li> Only problem now is that I have long nails and don&#x27;t know what to do with them!</li>
            <li> and actually it is in the same category as other products such as \\&quot;THUM\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As long as I keep reapplying every few days, it works for a 40 year old mom too!!</li>
            <li> Sounds like I am a pretty mean mom.  </li>
            <li> I mean the reviews are stellar.</li>
            <li> Here are two major reasons I like this product over the other product I tried.</li>
            <li> A teeny tiny bit goes a LONG WAY!  </li>
            <li> but you can help your little person get past this addiction with patience, love, and a little Mavala Stop.a child that was under 2.5 or 3.  </li>
            <li> but you can help your little person get past this addiction with patience, love, and a little Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> After couple of weeks of use my little girl completely stopped bitting her nails!</li>
            <li> every few you will have to apply a new a coat.  </li>
            <li> Mavala Stop lasts for a very long time, I probably only used it two-three times a week when I changed my polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started young, never was able to shake it, and its really bad when I am stressed out, which is often these days.  </li>
            <li> For someone who has had this disgusting habit for more then 33 years this is huge.</li>
            <li> And for any guys who may be concerned, it isn&#x27;t as shiny as a typical clear nail polish, but it does have some shine to it.</li>
            <li> It clearly says on the box not for children under three because they would be less bothered by the taste.</li>
            <li> It leaves the fingernail with slight gloss but not like that of a clear nail</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old son and a 3 year old daughter that are thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old stopped thumb sucking in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After just a week and a half, she has completely stopped sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> My sister has a 7 year old son that can stick his tongue half way up his nose.</li>
            <li> I had a 10 year old thumb sucker and a 9 year old nail bighter -</li>
            <li> This product stopped our 6 year old habitual nail biter and 4 year old thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> My 3 and a half year old started biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> We used on our five year old and in less than 5 days he was no longer sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> He would just wait for it to dry up and his thumb was back in his mouth again.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when using on small children because for the first time I tried it in the evening</li>
            <li> My 6yr old daughter stopped sucking her thumb in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I didn&#x27;t let my polish dry well enough</li>
            <li> This stuff you simply brush on, let dry and</li>
            <li> I definitely had the gag reflex, couldn&#x27;t stop dry heaving and could not get the taste out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> In less than a month she had stopped sucking her thumb completely.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t as awful as many of the reviewers made it sound.</li>
            <li> My four and a half year old has been trying to stop chewing her nails and cuticles for about a year.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with nail biting, the only thing I have a complaint about is the way it stays in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading its previous reviews for my nail biting seven year old daughter.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I saw my 4year old try biting his nails again</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is the ONLY product with a taste bitter enough to get me to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> This is because of the bitter taste and also the coating feels different than regular nail since it is a varnish of sorts.  </li>
            <li> We will probably continue to use this for a long time because her habit has been for so long, but this bottle is really lasting</li>
            <li> because they woke up crying in the middle of the night but eventually both of my girls (6 1/2 and 3 years old) stopped sucking their thumbs.  </li>
            <li> she had a brief slip up when she got in trouble and had to go to bed early (which was understandable).  </li>
            <li> This product arrived, and I even put a clear coat over my gel nails, and it has only been a few hours, but I have a feeling if I continue to use as directed</li>
            <li> know some people are commenting to only use a tiny amount and to be careful not to overwhelm the child.  </li>
            <li> It has not completely stopped the sucking because you have to remember to reapply it, but it does last a long time with one coat.</li>
            <li> Here we are almost a month later - the thumb sucking is a distant memory and the sores and skin have finally healed.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s only been a few days, but she hasn&#x27;t bitten her nails once since we got it.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit applied and my 3 yr old paid a price, worked a few days</li>
            <li> I got this to help me stop my nail-biting, and it definitely has a gross, bitter taste every time my fingers touch my mouth.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old started biting her nails a few months ago, out of the blue.</li>
            <li> Recieved order quickly but the bottle was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Well, meet the first failure.  </li>
            <li> and I got worse at it when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> Just to ensure the breaking of this orally unhealthy habit, I applied it a few more times</li>
            <li> love my kid too much to risk using this crap, even if it does work.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself before putting it on my 4-yr-old daughter, which is good because I found that you need to apply just A VERY TINY BIT TO THE BASE OF THE THUMBNAIL.  </li>
            <li> Our 3 year old was a major sucker and it took only one time, yes</li>
            <li> The polish is not very noticeable either, just a little shiny at first and then dulls after a day or</li>
            <li> It seemed a little expensive at first but was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but again the taste is a little worse than the standard pepper kind.</li>
            <li> The taste is bad enough to accomplish this, but not so bad that he can&#x27;t stand it - he was worried about being in school and not being able to wash his mouth out right away, but this hasn&#x27;t been a huge problem.</li>
            <li> He has now gone 14 days without a single slip up after 8 years over daily thumbsucking.  </li>
            <li> After that, we painted a single coat every third night and stopped using it after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts that this product would work for my nearly 7 year old, but it did the trick!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s positive reinforcement rather than negative</li>
            <li> We tried positive and negative reinforcement, but both proved fruitless.</li>
            <li> We tried everything else like bandages, gloves, positive and negative reinforcement.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to be very powerful, and I really felt bad after using it, since it caused her to vomit twice.  </li>
            <li> He started sucking his thumb at 6 months old and now at 6 years old and losing his first tooth I became desperate to help him stop (before those permanent teeth came in).</li>
            <li> Once we dialed back the dosage to just the target thumb and only applied a small amount near the tip, all seemed to work well for us.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, this stuff kept my son from putting his thumbs in his mouth, but he needed to be ready to give up the habit so the absence of the thumb sucking didn&#x27;t have negative consequences.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While we are usually quite skeptical of simple sounding remedies, I can honestly say this is the closest thing to a miracle drug I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny for your nail biter, thumb sucker, and would  probably work for the nose pickers too!</li>
            <li> Our 4 year old is still a pretty heavy thumb sucker and also a nail biter.</li>
            <li> It also has a smell to it, it is not a very loud smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied the malva (strange flavor name) to my nails and were dry about an hour later, after that it was off to the races.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> She did break down crying each of the 5 days , especially when she was ready to sleep for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, I used very little on her nail tip for the first time...and it worked.</li>
            <li> And, because she had such a large area of her hand in her mouth, it caused some serious pallette issues.</li>
            <li> Our 2 year old (WAS) a left hander ring and middle finger double sucker.</li>
            <li> second night was much more difficult because he was tired and really wanted to go to sleep and suck his thumb and begged me to take it off.  </li>
            <li> The first couple days it was a deterrent and then the taste must not be too bad because he went right back to the biting.</li>
            <li> If I only apply it every other night, by the second night he is sucking his thumb again.</li>
            <li> We were looking into thumb guards and other expensive contraptions, but came across a review for this product and are so glad we gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been seeing a psychologist and trying everything to stop these habits (such as using other polish that claims to do the same thing as Mavala, we also tried having her wear gloves, we tried distraction, tried putting bandaids on her thumbs, tried stress relievers like squishy toys for her to squeeze and bracelets for her to fiddle with, we tried a reward program where she would get surprises if she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb or pull her hair, we tried disciplining her when she would do these things, we had her pediatrician and her dentist talk to her about it, we tried everything).  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and are starting to reapply it only every other day.  </li>
            <li> We only applied it every other day (or even every third day), and as I said .</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can understand this product&#x27;s usefulness for some individuals, such as a school age child who has unsuccessfully tried other methods, who understands how this product works, and for whom this might be a last resort.</li>
            <li> For the next 24-48 hours, he only tried a couple of times to place his thumbs in his mouth before finding other things to do in order to occupy and soothe himself.  </li>
            <li> I assured them that if they grew their nails back out to regular length, I would stop applying the Mavala (which I had been applying about every other day).  </li>
            <li> I could see that it was starting to change the development of her upper jaw, so we needed something other than telling her not to suck.</li>
            <li> I wiped my face one day only to realize I must have gotten some residue on my lips, only to lick them and taste the extremely bitter polish--all of this happened with completely dry nails.</li>
            <li> He had a hard time sleeping for a few nights, but after a few days, he was fine!</li>
            <li> She has very dry skin and sucked her two middle fingers.  </li>
            <li> my daughter sucked the very bitter flavor off her thumb soon enough and is back to her merry thumb-sucking ways.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that you have to be very careful with eating and hand-held foods.</li>
            <li> It rubbed off a little easier than I anticipated, even with a clear coat over it!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 1/2 year old little girl who sucked her thumb and twirled her hair all thoughtout the day.</li>
            <li> i guess the little ones are to young to care about the taste to even stop sucking.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to use this on my 3 year old and basically kept just telling her if she didn&#x27;t stop biting her nails off</li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s been working well, maybe a little bit too well.</li>
            <li> Daughter was sucking her thumb and was getting a little too old for it.....</li>
            <li> We tried using this when our daughter was still a little too young</li>
            <li> I am 24yrs old and have been biting my nails since I was little.</li>
            <li> I have a 19 year old niece that has been struggling with her nails since she was a little girl</li>
            <li> I am adult nail biter and let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve fought this battle since I was little.</li>
            <li> This product has cured me of fingernail biting, chewing my fingers, picking cuticles and if you try to tear off the skin any other way, through clippers, the skin is also pretty terrible and tainted, so good luck with that method.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my four year old daughter who has developed a serious nail and skin biting problem.</li>
            <li> After months of trying other methods to help our 6 year old break his finger gnawing habit, we finally broke down and purchased this.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 and was really having a hard time stopping his finger sucking habit.</li>
            <li> It works incredibly fast, but is too hard on children.</li>
            <li> 7 months ago I noticed my 9 year old twins were both biting their nails down to the nailbeds and beyond!  </li>
            <li> (my own bad habit) and get a mouthful of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried some on my own thumb, to see how bad it is.  </li>
            <li> i tried it myself and it honestly doesn&#x27;t taste that bad.</li>
            <li> He does complain of the bad taste- which I guess makes it effective.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s had a bad nail- and cuticle-biting habit for a while, and I&#x27;ve held onto this for a while hoping he&#x27;d stop on his own -</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so bad because it was a nice reminder to never put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It honestly tastes so bad you want to rinse your mouth immediately.</li>
            <li> It cured my 7-year-old son of nail-biting, but he refused to eat any kind of finger food during the process--no sandwiches, cookies, crackers, carrot sticks, etc., because it made the food taste bad.</li>
            <li> Sure enough she came out the next morning telling me that her fingers tasted bad because she had tried to suck them....</li>
            <li> Upon applying I noticed it had a smell quite similar to nail polish remover, but an even more unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything to get our son to stop sucking, his speech therapists and dentist were really stressing the negative impact of this habit.</li>
            <li> i tried it with my son so i would know what he is talking about (bc he complained about it so much).</li>
            <li> Mostly, it was trying to do it \\&quot;cold turkey,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter(toddler) who is a very determined thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> The taste is really yucky and lasts for at least 2 days.  </li>
            <li> But than she got used to the flavor and now she sucks on her fingers no matter how much i put on them.</li>
            <li> So much so that I have recommended to all the moms and dads in the neighborhood with thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> They both hated the taste (which is great to get them to stop).</li>
            <li> It definitely has a HORRIBLE taste and initially was a great deterrent for my son.  </li>
            <li> I made it back to bed, and hours later when I awoke again for the day, the sharpness of the great evil that is contained in this bottle remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a really stubborn finger sucker.  </li>
            <li> She has calluses on both thumbs where her bottom teeth rub from how much she sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> Will prevent your fingernails from shinning which can be awkward if you are a guy (it also saves a lot more nail polish for continual use).</li>
            <li> To say the least, it kept me from snacking too much</li>
            <li> I think he was ready but needed a reminder to help him stop since it had just become so common for him to put his fingers in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> This product is a must for all thumb suckers it really works</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first  because my 3 1/2 year old loves both his thumbs.</li>
            <li> Some say they grow out of it, some not sure, either way I didn&#x27;t want it to become a big issue when her adult teeth came in.  </li>
            <li> Works for my husband as well as long as I can get him to put it on.</li>
            <li> I realize it is not recommended for under 3 as their taste buds are not developed yet.</li>
            <li> This started off as a minor annoyance and swiftly turned into a truly obnoxious behavior.</li>
            <li> and I got long nails now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my friend who has been biting his nails for as long as he can remember.</li>
            <li> I regret that I let her go too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails so long that I can&#x27;t remember ever using clippers.  </li>
            <li> How often does 10 bucks change a life long habit?</li>
            <li> - you don&#x27;t want to bite them because it&#x27;s so bitter, then you have nails, and it&#x27;s not the bitterness that stops you (since I haven&#x27;t had to put it on for several days now)</li>
            <li> Its really strange.</li>
            <li> It lingers in your mouth for a solid minute, making it a lot harder to &#x27;want&#x27; to bite your nails.</li>
            <li> She has the habit of sucking her fingers to go to sleep since she was a few months old.</li>
            <li> It goes on and stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few things about this that surprised me.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks until I tried it on him because we never happened to be near the bottle when I saw him with his fingers in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it takes.</li>
            <li> I was embarrassed for so long because it caused my teeth to poke out.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts through multiple hand washes and leaves a horrid bitter taste in your mouth that lingers</li>
            <li> this long.  </li>
            <li> His nails are long now.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully as long as you apply it every two days or else</li>
            <li> It has a bitter taste like nail polish and grapefruit mixed together</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic nail biter for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> We thought it would be a long struggle.</li>
            <li> The polish is alarmingly foul enough to make me realize what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be careful about is once you put it on the finger nails</li>
            <li> It was a LONG night</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 69 and a life long chewer).  </li>
            <li> but I think that in time I will basically &#x27;forget&#x27; to bite my nails after not doing it for so long.</li>
            <li> Usually by the end of the day I can barely see it on my nails, so doing an extra coat helps it last longer.</li>
            <li> They both had absolutely NO nails left and also were biting the skin around the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> I applied the product to my younger brother, and he stop biting since the nail taste bitter.</li>
            <li> , it just started tasting a tiny bit bitter and that is how I remembered that it had the polish on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thats the end of a 2 year long habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old daughter quit sucking her thumb in just a few days after someone recommended this product to me.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to be transferable -- that is, if I touch my lip, my lip will keep the offensive taste long</li>
            <li> I applied this product and it took a few times for her taste this stuff and has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product, he had completely stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> The kids that suck their finger all day long might need all day encouragement to stop and with this product they would get it to with out giving away their dexterity or finger use.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use a bitter nail polish but finally caved in when my method wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to wear away.  </li>
            <li> I am a college student who has been biting my fingernails as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> there is a loss of appetite throughout the day as he realizes not to suck his thumb because it&#x27;s now bitter (and the taste lingers even after drinking several glasses of water...</li>
            <li> Long time fingernail biter here</li>
            <li> However, for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as long as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Bitterness lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for probably, as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had no trouble eating food, and he never had trouble during the night.  </li>
            <li> I had to realize that she had been doing this for so long</li>
            <li> Only problem is if you touch food with it on your finger the bitter taste will get onto your food.</li>
            <li> There is a another fingernail product out there at local dept stores that claims to have a bitter taste.</li>
            <li> My husband has even given me a hello kiss after a long day at work where he struggles with biting his nails.</li>
            <li> My husband has even given me a hello kiss after a long day at work where he struggles with biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for as long as I remember and as soon as I got engaged</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> But I can say that since it is working i will deal with these two minor problems.</li>
            <li> The only pit fall is that finger foods (ie fruit, chips) also taste bitter.</li>
            <li> The problem is it has to be applied daily to get that bitter taste effect</li>
            <li> The bitter taste of this product is the key.  </li>
            <li> This would have minimize the degree of orthodontic work, which did not completely reverse the effects.</li>
            <li> We used the *Malavada* for about 2 weeks if that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails as a nervous habit as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> As of last week he is napping and sleeping through the night with no problem and no longer even tries to suck his thumb,  </li>
            <li> It also stays on for a long time because it is like nail polish.  </li>
            <li> This product stopped my 1 1/2 year old from trying to suck her thumb in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star only because of the food issue.</li>
            <li> I had been a big-time nail bitter for basically my entire life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a life long nail biter and nothing</li>
            <li> I had a long talk with her and explained that the polish would help her to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> We were careful to only get the polish on his nail so it would not bother him while his was eating.  </li>
            <li> Only warning to parents:  be careful not to get any on your hands.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take my daughter long to break the habit.</li>
            <li> far it has been a week and his thumb is starting to regain its normal color and none of the disturbing thumb sucking noises in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> , the only thing is that you have to be careful while they eat</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago and based on the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> The taste sticks to the inside of your mouth and stays there for a long time.</li>
            <li> We even forgot to bring it with us on a weekend trip and so she didn&#x27;t have it for a long weekend, but she didn&#x27;t backslide.</li>
            <li> I carefully applied this product to her nails only (avoiding her fingers)</li>
            <li> so I am not sur eof its long term effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t linger long if it was just a glancing blow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become so second nature that I cannot mentally convince myself to stop.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks for my 7 year old son.  </li>
            <li> It occurred to me, that my daughter was tasting this discussing stuff long after she tried biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> We have been trying to get my 7 year old son to stop sucking his fingers for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> As intended, this product has finally brought an end to my lifelong nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of how short and stubby my fingers look without my long pretty nails.</li>
            <li> used it for my 2 year old to stop sucking thumb, ended up just letting him suck it because he wouldnt stop crying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Does seem to be bitter enough to deter finger sucking though.</li>
            <li> and this will have saved us a lot of anxiety and money in dental bills in the long run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, using the pink thumb covers did the trick.</li>
            <li> Been struggling with nail biting for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when my nails were this long.  </li>
            <li> product takes a long time to wear off.  </li>
            <li> she has long nails...</li>
            <li> : It is bitter enough to alert me every time I put fingers in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works, but it&#x27;s not really practical to use with children.</li>
            <li> i was not ready for what happened next.  </li>
            <li> And it is not a conscious decision for her to do it, so</li>
            <li> After doing some research, we ordered Mavala Stop and he quit sucking his thumb completely as soon as it dried.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later she went to put her thumb in her mouth and took it out a split second later.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes everything you eat taste incredibly bitter, and requires multiple mouth, face, and hand washing a to get rid</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m eating dinner (hamburger, French fries, hand food) it taste like the bitter nail polish.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to apply it ONLY to nails and exposed nail-beds and NOT to fingertips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve bitten</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll have to continue applying this to my nails for a long time</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t done that in a long time since didn&#x27;t have any nails.</li>
            <li> but he did it for so long...</li>
            <li> I use this on my child every few days , so far it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s on, there is no thumb or finger sucking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review.</li>
            <li> I have been a fingernail biter for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As long as you wear this nail polish, you won&#x27;t bite them.</li>
            <li> This stopped my 3 yeard old from sucking her thumb in just a few days.</li>
            <li> You will achieve your goal as long as you don&#x27;t stop applying for months to truly break this habit.</li>
            <li> a drop goes a LONG way-</li>
            <li> This nail polish helps control my biting to minimum level, if not completely.</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on for a long time too - through baths, handwashing and everything.  </li>
            <li> complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I think we need to do it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Let your nails grow long and keep putting mavala on.</li>
            <li> Long Story:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Finger foods are out as long as it is on.</li>
            <li> I use to bite my nails to the point of drawing blood sometimes, but nothing that I ever tried before worked long term to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a bitter taste similar to nail polish remover, but lasts up to three days before needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> As long as she rea</li>
            <li> Took a few days for my 4 year old to stop and after 2 weeks she never even thought about sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> one problem, but minor, when you&#x27;re eating finger foods it does get on the food</li>
            <li> Get the expected result in only 2 days !</li>
            <li> and it took only 3 tries.  </li>
            <li> After that he doesn mind it as long as he can suck his thumb and bite his nails.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have gotten this long ago.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as i can remember and it has already stopped me and i&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week now.</li>
            <li> where I would still bite my nails despite the bitter taste because it was tolerable enough.  </li>
            <li> But, as long as it&#x27;s on he doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> However for my 5 1/2 year old whom I coated his nail, he didn&#x27;t mind one bit and sucked his thumb within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> My son developed a tolerance for it after a few days..</li>
            <li> It is so disturbingly gross that I have to be careful even when eating things with my fingers to ensure I don&#x27;t accidentally get any in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself as well and the bitter taste definitely will deter you ftom biting your nails!</li>
            <li> I had been biting my nails for as long as I could remember.  </li>
            <li> Going to long between coats will not prevent kids from biting their nails.</li>
            <li> After a hand wash or two, the shine actually faded while the repulsively bitter taste remained.</li>
            <li> and it dont take long to kick the habit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who had bitten his nails and the skin around his nails for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I did find it strange that the taste was delayed maybe 1-2 seconds or so</li>
            <li> As long as we kept the medicine on his nails, he didn&#x27;t suck.  </li>
            <li> So even though I have my nails long, I still use it to keep my hands out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Every time I even think about biting my nails, I&#x27;m automatically thinking about the bitterness that was stuck in my throat for long minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> (In hind sight, I should have painted a thin stripe the first night and increased the coverage over the next 3-4 nights.)</li>
            <li> The bitter taste of this product last in your mouth for a long time.  </li>
            <li> recommend MAVALA stop, the bitter long lasting taste keeps my fingers out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was geared up for a lot of crying and no sleep for the first few nights</li>
            <li> and, clearly, not using this product again.</li>
            <li> So expect some crying on reflex sucking the first few days.</li>
            <li> Is some pretty nasty tasting stuff, but is quite effective because of that.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work for me to stop biting my nails completely and the price is pretty steep for the product.</li>
            <li> The first time we used this he cried and cried (poor thing) and never went back to the thumb.  </li>
            <li> He woke up crying for the first few nights.</li>
            <li> While my thumb sucking kid hated it the moment he licked it the first time, i love it for having stopped him from sucking his thumb any longer.</li>
            <li> taste is bitter and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> but I decide to give it a shot after my cousin, who is worse than I am, found success.</li>
            <li> Goal accomplished, just wish it was a little less assaulting to the taste</li>
            <li> It worked particularly well as a reminder during the nights, and she never woke up crying as some of the other kids have that have used this product.  </li>
            <li> Tried the weaker versions at major drugstores and multiple other ideas with no success.</li>
            <li> annoying thing - the bitter taste transfers to food really easily for the first couple days.</li>
            <li> It worked for a little while but not long enough.</li>
            <li> When he first sucked his thumb right after that he was in a bit of shock at the bad taste and had to drink water and gargle it out to get the taste out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> I decided the benefits would greatly out weigh the negatives when we were all continuously sick this past year.</li>
            <li> My son is 6 yrs old figured out very quickly that it tasted bad.</li>
            <li> and I have only been able to use each once before the lids become impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only applied it twice, which surprisingly enough works out to almost a week and a half of time, and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails once.  </li>
            <li> You only need to apply it every 3 days, and it can last half a year if you put the optimal amount</li>
            <li> She knows this is to help her not suck and that it will taste bitter/bad, and is extra careful to let it dry, and welcomes the application.  </li>
            <li> The only downside (being a male) is that it has a slightly glossy finish.</li>
            <li> but if you really want long nails then you get past the bitter taste and just eat the food and learn ways to avoid the nails, like a fork!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Malava STOP, on the other hand, is so bitter that you won&#x27;t even consider putting your fingers near your mouth unless you&#x27;re eating (which can be a downside, because you may indeed get a blast of bitter while you&#x27;re eating finger foods).</li>
            <li> Of note, it says to apply every other day, but after a long day in the swimming pool, I think the taste had dissipated and therefore have applied it daily for this reason.  </li>
            <li> So I am not sure if it really Works for other children</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would recommend putting it on in their sleep, and be ready with a little sip of milk to help rid the taste in the child&#x27;s mouth a little faster.</li>
            <li> With this stuff on I&#x27;d never even think of putting my fingers near my mouth., and it does not easily wash</li>
            <li> son was recently promoted to the \\&quot;big kids\\&quot; class at his pre-school, and we&#x27;re very anxious about the physical and social effects of his thumb-sucking.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed after reading such great reviews.</li>
            <li> i mean completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li> does dry to appear a little &amp;#34;less shiny&amp;#34; than most clear polishes and there have been some reviews expressing concern that this will draw further attention to already ugly chewed up nails.</li>
            <li> a year later when we brought it out to try on our next child, the cap was stuck on tight.  </li>
            <li> At first, she found it bitter and made some funny faces, but after a couple of minutes, enough of the polish would be removed that it didn&#x27;t taste as bad anymore</li>
            <li> While my daughter who also has been sucking her thumb for the past 5 years, and has a very sensitive pallet.  </li>
            <li> It is a very bitter taste that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> (apparently, at least), I put a tiny, tiny dab of this stuff on one of my fingers - not even my finger nail, just a random place on the top</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs so hard and for so long that they have become red and sore.</li>
            <li> He was a little sad for the first few hours, but quickly got over it</li>
            <li> Others have pointed out that this product rubs off on other things, and I definitely agree with that.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;d tried several other products over the years also to no avail.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of some other reviewers and told her that she is a big girl and that the thumb fairy would probably soon come and sprinkle fairy dust on her thumb, signalling to her that it&#x27;s time for her to stop.  </li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t fall asleep without sucking her fingers, and because it started when she was in a Russian orphanage, and was literally starving due to reflux, her two fingers were all she had for compfort.  </li>
            <li> I am 38 and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember!  </li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t take long to be eating BBQ and accidentally lick my fingers!  </li>
            <li> bite\\&quot; polishes before, but my determination to constantly bite my nails beat out any other product.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t have any of the issues that the other reviewers mentioned about finger foods tasting gross or vomiting from the taste.</li>
            <li> The only other downside is that it seems to transfer its taste onto finger foods.</li>
            <li> currently have no nails due to biting them off, maybe I&#x27;m just stubborn.</li>
            <li> We tried the (expensive) thumb guards which our daughter was actually excited to get until we put them on her</li>
            <li> Other motivators did not work because it was a subconscious act for her.</li>
            <li> The other won&#x27;t if she knows I put it on her nails but still struggles only because I am not consistantly putting it on.  </li>
            <li> He started speech therapy this year, which he likely in part needed due to the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several other people and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> She needs that sucking sensation to soothe herself to sleep, so she has resorted to sucking a little on her middle finger, but we are trying not to make a big deal of it.  </li>
            <li> I wish we would have bought this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> We have tried other ways (taping the thumb, wearing a glove) and I had spoken to our dentist about some possible solutions.</li>
            <li> We tried Vaseline, and that other product that stops thumbsucking (which you can buy at your local Target) to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I would just put it on her thumbs and not her other fingers since that was really my only concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to eat the other \\&quot;gross tasting\\</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because even a little bit of a nail polish remover taste hasn&#x27;t seemed to work and most just wear off after biting your nails once.</li>
            <li> I only had to put in on her thumbnail every other day for a week.</li>
            <li> I tried begging, bribing, and multiple other over-the-counter items.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have tried it long ago!</li>
            <li> She has not reverted back to sucking her fingers, but I do have to reapply it every other day on his to keep him from chewing his fingernails.  </li>
            <li> One application will last you the entire day, sometimes a little into day two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products similar to this</li>
            <li> The other problem is that when eating it sometimes rubs off on my lips, etc especially with finger foods.</li>
            <li> The third night, he was sucking his finger even with the Mavala, and I thought I must have one of those extremely stubborn kids I&#x27;ve been reading about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only put it on every other day.  </li>
            <li> and then the second week every other night.</li>
            <li> We only applied it every other day for about a couple of weeks, and haven&#x27;t needed to since.</li>
            <li> I have used other similar products, but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> Because his habit has been for so long, i still have to apply to his thumbs, but it does its job!  </li>
            <li> and I am a life long chewer!</li>
            <li> I eventually brushed it on every other night just in case for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> no fuss and long process !</li>
            <li> Her teeth were noticeably displaced due to her habit, so I knew I had to do something finally.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other parents looking for a similar solution.</li>
            <li> But notice his thumbs slips back in if I don&#x27;t stick to the every other night routine.</li>
            <li> (whereas, a thumb guard, her friends would&#x27;ve noticed and asked about it, and I&#x27;m not sure she would have done as well emotionally with it -- because it was very emotional for her to give it up --- if it had been so public).</li>
            <li> I was nervous because of the reviews that left kids gagging, but even after quite a bit of coating they did not have an extreme reaction.</li>
            <li> I know the product says 3 years and up - mostly due to the potential for undeveloped taste buds.  </li>
            <li> We tried numerous things to get our daughter to stop; reward charts, other nail coatings, socks...</li>
            <li> She only even wanted to one other time</li>
            <li> my nails are long now!</li>
            <li> It also stays on through hand washing and other daily tasks...</li>
            <li> One problem is that when I quit using it, I started to bite my nails again, so now I have to start using again until I break this nasty habit for good!</li>
            <li> We have tried guards and other products so this was the last resort.</li>
            <li> Over the course of the last 15 years I have bought one other product again and again to help me stop biting my nails</li>
            <li> It says every other day, we started every day and the last 2 times</li>
            <li> She was extremely moody the entire day, as thumb sucking is her way to soothe herself if she is upset, but after day one: her thumb REMAINED OUT OF HER MOUTH!</li>
            <li> and I only apply it every other day because she is officially done, but I want the taste still there JUST IN CASE.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work because it is GROSS tasting to an extreme.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure because it arrived COMPLETELY SMASHED!</li>
            <li> I tried to reward her for not doing it, constantly remind her and other things that never worked.</li>
            <li> I am only taking off a star due to the fact that it clings to everything she touches.</li>
            <li> From interacting with other users, as well as reading reviews, I understand that the results will likely differ based on the child and the strength of the habit.</li>
            <li> This thing is disgusting and that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> Not only did this help my daughter stop sucking her thumb, it also stopped my other daughter from biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> We tried other products, but this was the only one that worked for us.</li>
            <li> I am definitely using it again with my other daughter when the time comes for her to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I had bought the glove with the thumb covered several months ago, but that didn&#x27;t work, his teachers have tried forever, but with just a dab on his thumbnail every other night for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> but this was definitely money well spent!</li>
            <li> and him probably liking the taste of it, but it worked for me, so I see no problem with any other parent taking the same leap of faith I did when I decided to try.  </li>
            <li> That was six years ago, and we&#x27;ve tried everything -- alternate chew options, gum, painting his nails with other stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were laughing so hard and that his older brother came to see him</li>
            <li> I applied polish every other day (as directed) in the beginning and then less frequently after a week.  </li>
            <li> MY daughter is almost 6 years old and we have had SUCH a hard time trying to get her to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Hard core biters will adjust to the taste so, like quitting smoking, they need to be mentally prepared and ready to stop.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the directions saying apply it every other day but after two days it was still strong.</li>
            <li> only downside is that, if you&#x27;ve really got the habit, you might try to bite your nails in front of other people and make a ridiculous face when you hit the polish instead.  </li>
            <li> My primary complaint though is if you have to wash your hands a lot, which in working in the healthcare field I do, plan to use two coats and apply at least every other day, if not daily.</li>
            <li> The taste of this stuff is very bitter and gross.</li>
            <li> , she got a very strange look on her face.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and its a very bitter taste that actually intensifies when you drink water.  </li>
            <li> But it only took a couple of times of her putting her thumb in her mouth to make her VERY CAREFUL not to do it again.</li>
            <li> She is 5 and has been sucking for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is very bitter so use only the smallest amount</li>
            <li> The taste is very bitter, but simply reminds her of what she already knows....that she should not be putting her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Be a little careful of certain finger foods as the taste can transfer a little if you have just applied it that day.</li>
            <li> , she was completely bald on one side and her thumb was raw.</li>
            <li> At 3 years old she would still suck her thumb raw.</li>
            <li> Just to be on the safe side, he is still applying the product on his nails every week, and we encourage that so he won&#x27;t slip back to his bad habits.  </li>
            <li> for the pricetag you shouldn&#x27;t expect much but if its worth stopping a bad habit what could you lose?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it tastes like, but it must taste pretty bad, because my daughter ran to the bathroom and drank a whole bunch of water after she put her thumb in her mouth!  </li>
            <li> and no matter how many times we brushed his teeth and gave him water it still seemed to taste badly.</li>
            <li> First thing is first, this product is advertised as having a bad taste to curb your desire to bit your nails, so I painted it onto a finger, let it dry for a couple minutes</li>
            <li> works amazing and tastes terrible HAHA</li>
            <li> He let me put it on (doesn&#x27;t dry immediately</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails dry.</li>
            <li> is how it worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: applied once and let it dry.</li>
            <li> old son was ready to stop sucking his thumb, but it was too difficult, being a habit he&#x27;d started before he was born</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s dry on her finger nails&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I applied it to both of her thumbs and let them dry.  </li>
            <li> : Give AMPLE time for this product to dry.</li>
            <li> Stopped sucking his thumb the moment polish was dry.</li>
            <li> painted my nails, waited for it to dry, and went about my day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> He has had an infection under the nail from sucking, lost the nail a couple times and his skin was so cracked and dry that it bleed.  </li>
            <li> it was a pain to keep him still while i waited to the stuff to dry.</li>
            <li> but when I found out she was doing that I would wait for her nails to dry.</li>
            <li> put an even layer on and it takes just about 15 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> My 4-yr old sucks his ring and middle finger and has a lisp because of it.</li>
            <li> her 2 year old sister sucks her two middle</li>
            <li> I wish there is another flavor like spicy because my son is afraid of spicy, more than bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and finally decided to buy it for my four old thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it for at least a month to be sure the habit has been broken.</li>
            <li> People mentioned it stayed on for 2 weeks, while for me, it seemed to last only a few days.</li>
            <li> My 2yr old daughter sucks her 2 middle fingers, I read the review and ordered it thru amazon.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old was a finger sucker big time.  </li>
            <li> bottle holds roughly the same amount as a regular bottle of nail polish, but Mavala Stop seems to be of a slightly thinner consistency.</li>

            <li> I brought this product last month for my 6 yr old daughter whom was a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> Over the next few hours she put her thunb in her mouth several times and immediately pulled it out.  </li>
            <li> and when I woke up the next morning I had to take the polish off because it hadn&#x27;t dried properly and had creased and stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different products to get my son to stop chewing his nails, and this is the only one that worked.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later and his digits are finally recovering.</li>
            <li> However, I have an autistic son who it only helped for short periods of time.</li>
            <li> Nail biting is far, far worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously purchased a bottle of Mavala Stop and it worked, until I left the closed bottle on the side and enough leaked onto the threads on the bottle to seal it forever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 30 days now; I&#x27;m a believer and so grateful we found this in time to help my 4 1/2 yr old younger child who is also a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> We applied Mavala Stop regularly for the next few weeks, &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;, and he has never sucked his thumb again.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for him, a few days later he was back at it.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my 6 year old and 4 year old and by the end of the week they were both broken of sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li> Initially, we were skeptical, but decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that with continued use of this product over the next few weeks, the urge to bite them will finally be gone (and I can start eating finger foods and dips again).o</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that with continued use of this product over the next few weeks, the urge to bite them will finally be gone (and I can start eating finger foods and dips again).</li>
            <li> Minimal results on his 5yeaf old son whom I believe would put a dead skunk in his mouth, but</li>
            <li> Had to apply it again one last time a few days later, and that was it.</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting, which in this case is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider, people who get frequent headaches or migraines might be affected from it</li>
            <li> Every time I put my fingers near my mouth, even when eating, I got this nasty taste for a good 5 minutes that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> My son is high-functioning autistic and began biting his nails way down past the quick.</li>
            <li> Finally at five years old and only one application he is no longer a thumb sucker!</li>
            <li> The first 2 nights were tough</li>
            <li> We reapplied the product every day for the first week and it was a tough week on all of us.  </li>
            <li> That said, I am not sure it was really the Mavala Stop that did it so much as her orthodontist telling her she would end up with so much damage they would have to do painful surgery to correct it.</li>
            <li> It comes with  a little story about a little ballerina conquering thumb sucking, a little ballerina doll ( I think it is meant to go on your finger somehow, but my daughter just cuddled it) AND the important thing is a little book of star reward stickers.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR THUMB SUCKER.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for incorrigible thumb suckers like my child.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product if you have a thumb sucker or a nail biter.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff and highly recommend it to anyone who has a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit on his thumb nail every other day and he has stopped completely.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails a single time.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, after a single momentary exposure, and even after the attempted removal, the taste STAYS IN YOUR MOUTH for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and have not taken one single bite out of my nails.</li>
            <li> I mostly got this b/c of him sticking his fingers in his mouth all the time, since we have a newborn and don&#x27;t want the entire household to be sick all the time.</li>
            <li> After realizing that she most likely was getting sick (colds/ flu) from preschool germs by sucking her thumbs we tried this product.</li>
            <li> His poor fingers were so raw, once he chomped them down on top, he would start in on his cuticles.</li>
            <li> Same thing, but not the third it must of hit him a little harder cause he took out his tounge for like 5 minutes drooling while watching tv.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The next day was a little harder because when he would eat with his fingers he could taste the stuff on his thumb and it would put that gross taste in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> Same went with face washing and also eating hand-held foods; face washing seemed to run the polish a little, leading to bitter tastes on my skin</li>
            <li> The flavor is really unpleasant, it&#x27;s definitely a strong enough stimulus for</li>
            <li> You learn very quickly not to put your hands anywhere near your mouth and to handle your food carefully.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very please so far and this was way less expensive and cumbersome than those thumb guard contraptions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old son, who had chewed all his nails down to 1/8\\&quot; or less.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old tried sucking her thumb a few more times, drinking a couple cups of water every time she tried, to wash the bad taste out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> It smells and looks just like clear nail polish, so I was not sure it would do anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point a phase out seems distant and the only other thing that will keep my son from biting his nails would be if he didn&#x27;t have any nails.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few other products (topical and a hand guard) with no success on my  6 year old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We did have a small issue with my finger sucking 2 year old.</li>
            <li> Not only does it ruin the taste of your nails, it ruins the taste of the food you eat with your hands.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would use it on a young child under 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> Our 10 year old had an issue with mindlessly biting his nails while doing other activities.</li>
            <li> being an adult bitting nails, is not cute..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it will keep until my 2 year old</li>
            <li> I painting Mavala on both thumbs just in case he would revert to the other thumb and within a few days he has completely stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Been a professional nail biter for past 35 years.</li>
            <li> My only comment is that it could come in a smaller bottle, as you&#x27;re unlikely to need a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is what fixed my son&#x27;s habit</li>
            <li> I am a mental health counselor in Phoenix, and for as long as I remember having teeth and fingernails, I have put the two together.  </li>
            <li> The taste is SO bitter that there was no way I was going to do it for long.</li>
            <li> It coats on pretty thin.  </li>
            <li> The first time we tried this stuff, she was not happy about it one bit.</li>
            <li> The dentist said as long as we stopped her before her permanent teeth errupted at age 6 or so that the damage to her bite would be minimal.</li>
            <li> but he thought it was funny and a game.</li>
            <li> this product is extremely bitter with even a trace amount and the taste just lingers on for long time.</li>
            <li> both were annoyed when i used first time on thier thumbs but after that it did not make any difference to both of them</li>
            <li> The taste is so bitter and lingers in your mouth for so long that you just stop biting.</li>
            <li> This has a bitter taste and it can linger long after you use it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, not only did he suck off all 3 coats we put on him EVERY SINGLE NIGHT for a week, he started sucking on his other fingers too!</li>
            <li> only real downside, and a perfectly fine one in return for finally kicking this awful habit</li>
            <li> So, if your child will be eating finger food, wash well before turning them loose for</li>
            <li> I used it on my two fingers that I tend to pick at and chew at loose cuticles and yick</li>
            <li> The only down side is that you can taste it when eating finger foods, etc.</li>
            <li> The older girls had stopped at one point for like 2 weeks, but all of the sudden started again and started doing it worse than they ever did before.  </li>
            <li> Shortly afterwards, she again bent down to lick the incision.  </li>
            <li> The Mavala Stop had gotten on my contacts and the taste was trickling down to the back of my throat!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The only down fall is when he puts his hands to his mouth to eat, he can taste it</li>
            <li> It did not bother me until I&#x27;ve noticed her upper teeth shaping into an upside down</li>
            <li> only down side is that if you like to eat with your hands you may taste it when sticking fingers in mouth</li>
            <li> He did, however, manage to push a chair across the room, snipe the bottle of mavala, and dump it down the drain after out second application.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and this product is the only thing that stopped a student of mine from after her mother tried every product on the market as well as other products recommended by her doctor!</li>
            <li> I have long feminine nails!!</li>
            <li> Second week every other night, and after that every time I remembered!</li>
            <li> I mean, the aftertaste has an aftertaste,  on top of its aftertaste that leaves one more nasty aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> First few days he was warry of putting his fingers in his mouth,but he quickly got over the bad taste and did it anyway no matter how often applied.</li>
            <li> only minor drawback is that you can indeed taste it a little bit if you pick up food with your fingers.</li>
            <li> When he goes too long without putting it on he sometimes starts to revert back to nibbling on his nails a little.</li>
            <li> If you think it&#x27;s too matte (which I don&#x27;t think it is) when your nails get long enough you can put the product under your nail a little to avoid messing your manicure...</li>
            <li> I had already tried several other tactics with no positive results.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m really enjoying watching her learn new things, I hate some of the behaviors she has picked up from other children!</li>
            <li> is firstly because my son is very sensitive to taste and secondly because once I ordered it, every time his fingers went into his mouth I would tell him that if he didn&#x27;t stop his fingers would start to taste bad.</li>
            <li> Sadly, we are one of the few unsuccessful stories for this too good to be true product. :(</li>
            <li> She is a middle child, her older sister is rough and tumble, and she is usually tough in the face of boo-boos and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many different methods to stop biting my nails including other &#x27;bad tasting&#x27; products.  </li>
            <li> It took a week of applying it every other day and then coming back to it once a few weeks later, but the nail biting has stopped.</li>
            <li> I usually look at my nails like this, 2 good 8 bad.</li>
            <li> Amazingly potent and impossible to ignore.  </li>
            <li> Since the recommended age is 3 and over, and my son is only 2 and a half I was not using it every day, however since his birthday is around the corner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a particular taste that I can liken to anything else I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Our son also bites his knuckles and constantly has his hands near his mouth - not a good thing when flu season is upon us.  </li>
            <li> I still have over half the bottle) and I actually have nails and dont bite them.</li>
            <li> The sucking was so severe it caused a slight speech delay (only because she would prefer to suck her fingers instead of talking!)</li>
            <li> I painted, carefully, just his nails and blew on them to dry them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad/old batch, or if different taste buds perceive the taste differently.  </li>
            <li> After trying desperately not to laugh, I spent the next two hours blissfully NOT saying \\&quot;Don&#x27;t suck your fingers!\\</li>
            <li> When we finally stopped wrapping his hand he seemed to need to suck less than before.</li>
            <li> As such, it adheres to the nail like a glue, making it pretty difficult to wipe, lick or wash off by accident (or on purpose, muahaha).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice and am still not sure it will be enough to keep my from biting my nails and fingers, but I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I only coat about half the nail.</li>
            <li> In fact I have half to two thirds of the bottle left!</li>
            <li> She knew something was wrong but kept quiet the first day.  </li>
            <li> the next day, she was grumpy, from being up half the night..</li>
            <li> I have stopped myself numerous times raising my fingers to my mouth, haunted by the memories of previous encounters with Mavala Stop in my mouth and on my lips.</li>
            <li> soon as we got the package, I explained what it was and painted it on the BOTTOM half only of each finger.  </li>
            <li> I only did the bottom half of each nail so that when she was eating finger foods she didn&#x27;t accidentally get it in her mouth</li>
            <li> By the third day we noticed it was less and by the forth day</li>
            <li> It was MUCH less emotionally taxing for me than when I was reminding her 50 times a day, offering stickers, etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I find that you have to reapply once a day because the taste completely wears off after two days of normal hand washing/showering.</li>
            <li> He applied some each day and it totally cured his nail biting in less than 3 days-</li>
            <li> Still half asleep and feeling stressed she stuck her thumb in her mouth again and sucked and got another big taste.  </li>
            <li> The temptation to bite is definitely there, but it is less every day.  </li>
            <li> After only a day, day and half he stopped.</li>
            <li> but I think it would be more sad to see them come home from school crying because they got picked on for sucking their thumb!</li>
            <li> and I only had to apply it for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m going to post a pic in the photos above of my nails after less than a month of growth.</li>
            <li> I even re-applied it several times thinking it had already worn off (in less than a day)</li>
            <li> The only slight concern I have is about the chemical ingredients in the product even though it hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse effects in terms of health.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to try this product on my two daughters but with no options left</li>
            <li> A year and a half later</li>
            <li> :It&#x27;s super expensive-</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical but it worked.</li>
            <li> The only down side is if you eat something with your hands you will taste the bitter polish.</li>
            <li> His thumb was starting to get distorted, raw, and flat.  </li>
            <li> make a long story short, he officially stopped sucking his thumb in less than 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> So, be wary of a little sickness especially if your kid can&#x27;t make it to the toilet fast enough yet.</li>
            <li> A few words of caution from her: is that she doesn&#x27;t like to eat certain foods anymore like any foods that are normally eaten with her figers (like chicken nuggets, french fries, etc).</li>
            <li> Now the only bad thing is that I have a full bottle of the stuff left.</li>
            <li> I carry it in my purse so that I can reapply it every other day and never have an excuse for accidentally biting them.</li>
            <li> Her thumb is such a shredded mess from her sucking, not to mention how her teeth are moving as well.  </li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s just a voracious thumb sucker at seven years old!</li>
            <li> AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE, THIS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OLD.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on her thumb, I put too much on and she got sick.  </li>
            <li> There is not very much of a difference and the bitter taste does not seem to bother her.</li>
            <li> The taste is bad and lingers for ages, so you learn quickly to keep your hands far from your mouth.</li>
            <li> He initially threw up and continues to dry heave every few minutes.  </li>
            <li> We apply Mavala every day because she takes long baths and the taste was not strong enough to keep her thumb out of her mouth after one bath.  </li>
            <li> so tight it left marks on my son&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Then when I tried to start using it again it accidentally leaked in my pocket because I didn&#x27;t screw the cap tight enough</li>
            <li> The first couple days were rough, and I constantly had a terrible taste in my mouth, but each day got a little better.</li>
            <li> It is very bitter and lingers in my mouth for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for as long as I can remember and even though I tried to quit several times, I would always revert back to my old habit whenever I was stressed, bored, etc.</li>
            <li> She now only sucks it in the middle of the night, but not for very long.  </li>
            <li> My 4 and a half year old daughter was an addictive thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that we&#x27;ve found that works for a stubborn 5 year old thumb sucker!  </li>
            <li> Of course with the first use my son started throwing up, screaming, and crying from the horrible taste but having his mom next to him the whole time comforting him and helping him to get through the night without his fingers made things much easier for him.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter gagged so hard from the first taste that she threw up a little bit, but since day #2, they have not sucked their fingers!</li>
            <li> First, I thought that was just plain mean.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin weak nails, I tend to both subconcioulsy pick at them when the get rough or snag and when nerves are high bite at them as well.</li>
            <li> It work for a little bit than she&#x27;s back sucking her thumb againg.</li>
            <li> I thought that I only put on a little, but my son&#x27;s digestive system has a difference of opinion.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I know it&#x27;s a lie, but it&#x27;s a little white one.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of starting this my little boy broke this habit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little ones, as stated above, watch because finger foods might be contaminated if they eat with their hands.</li>
            <li> SO, my orthodontist initially gave me a bottle little thingy of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Following the advise, I applied just a little to her thumbnails to start.</li>
            <li> only 2, because little girls don&#x27;t paint her nails,</li>
            <li> The directions indicate to reapply every 48 hours, but I would catch my little guy sucking the second night if I didn&#x27;t reapply.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit it was a tad skeptical at first as we&#x27;ve tried several other products/methods to get him to stop biting.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because one review said there was no information in English or what the ingredients were.  </li>
            <li> You need to use only a little bit, on the edge of your nail (if you&#x27;re a biter).</li>
            <li> I caught the little princess with her thumb (by her mouth she says - it was definitely inside).</li>
            <li> But now she will just say &amp;#34;It only tastes a little bad&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> now my little one is back to biting his finger and toes nails...</li>
            <li> and this was the little extra thing that did it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first night he woke up screaming at 2am because he sucked and we had to deal w/ the rinsing and wiping his tongue off w/ a towel!  </li>
            <li> I felt sorry for my toddler the first time she latched on and started gagging!</li>
            <li> The next night she was a little scared to nurse, but still wanted to.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and</li>
            <li> but it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how it is for little kids that suck their thumbs.</li>
            <li> , so you only need a little for tip of nail.</li>
            <li> So I decided to get this for her and only put a little bit on</li>
            <li> Her third appication occurred with little protesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her third appication occurred with little protesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue some may have with it is that it works a little too well.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that eating finger foods can be a little tricky, but otherwise, I&#x27;m on my way to stopping my nail biting.</li>
            <li> My wife says only use a little though as she had a taste from using it to stop biting her nails....</li>
            <li> We applied the Mavala on both thumbs just in case, but her left thumb is the choile Filet Mignon in her little mind.</li>
            <li> and it lingers a little, but not enough to make her cry.</li>
            <li> The second day the shine fades away a little and bitterness remains.</li>
            <li> so I could honestly warn my little one about the bad taste).  </li>
            <li> Due to this product our sons fingers are no longer dry, cracked, &amp; sore.</li>
            <li> If they were even a little long, it was too long.</li>
            <li> I put this on her thumbs, and like the other reviews have said, they get it in their mouth and start dry heaving and borderline throwing up.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for our 4 year old daughter after she worked as hard as she could trying to quit sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old had a hard time breaking his habit of nail biting.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks my son completely stopped sucking his fingers and he sucked both his index fingers, which I thought would be hard to stop him form</li>
            <li> Old habits die hard for grown ups</li>
            <li> The reaction was so dramatic that I tried some as well, think sour patch kids with a horribly bitter after taste lasting about 15 minutes no matter how much beer you pour on it</li>
            <li> Guess it wasn&#x27;t bad enough, so I went on the search for soemthing else that was still safe to be ingested, and found mavala, and this did work on my little girl</li>
            <li> Day one was rough, sleep didnt go well for her, but the taste was bitter enough to keep that little thumb out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb for 3 years straight , bought this product , only had too apply it 4 times too her nail and the habit was completely broken in a little over a week .</li>
            <li> She did try the other thumb and we simply applied it to that thumb and in less than 2 days all thumb sucking ceased.</li>
            <li> - i feel bad for my daughter but cant think of a better solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause if they use their fingers food will taste really bad, and I also would suggest to apply this at night while they are sleeping :)</li>
            <li> She did not complain of bad taste, and did not even seem to want to suck any more.  </li>
            <li> We were able to explain to him why it is bad to suck thumb and explained what we were doing.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend has this bad (but sometimes sexy) habit of biting her fingernails and sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve never thought something would be able to stop him from this bad habit.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is 2 years and 9 months old he has a bad habit of thumb sucking while watching tv and when falling asleep so much so that i notice an overbite starting to form-</li>
            <li> It was kind of sad because it really tastes bad</li>
            <li> It tastes TERRIBLE and the taste lingers in your mouth, which is great to train yourself not to bite.  </li>
            <li> This stuff tastes as awful as advertised, which is great in this case.</li>
            <li> Her older sister could taste a faint bad taste when she turned her nail over and put it next to her tongue, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t so strong she was heaving or anything.  </li>
            <li> It works great, tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> Great product, taste horrible!</li>
            <li> Knowing how much germs and sickness is passed around in preschool, I was stressed and desperate to help My 3 yr old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> According to the kids it has a disgusting taste, which is great because it works.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> Taste terrible which is great</li>
            <li> He did great, just the idea of how terrible it would be and me saying it won&#x27;t wash off kept him from sucking it for some 24hrs...</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s nails are growing and the taste is disgusting as I have experienced the residual of it from my nails after applying it to my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great product with a horrible aftertaste</li>
            <li> My three year old no longer sucks her thumb after using the product for about 2 weeks.  </li>

            <li> I bought this to use on my 2 year old daughter who sucks her fingers.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m an adult thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> i thought this might worked for my 10 month old because she has eczema and sucks her thumb, which sucking her thumb doesn&#x27;t make it easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a 3 year old thumb sucker who&#x27;s habit was affecting her bite.  </li>
            <li> So I would definitely recommend this product if you have a constant thumb sucker.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my 3yr old who sucks two fingers.</li>
            <li> The only negative about the stuff is that if you love finger foods like fried chicken</li>
            <li> a thumb sucker up until I was 7 yrs old</li>
            <li> he is 2 months shy of his 3rd birthday so this habit was really troubling me.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has sucked his index finger since birth and his dentist is concerned about the negative impact it is having on the roof of his mouth and front teeth.  </li>
            <li> As a general dentist, I usually recommend an oral, cemented appliance be placed in the mouth for up to three months to stop a finger or thumb habit.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is a hardcore thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> Does not work for my 7 year old thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> Not effective for my 5 year old even when we painted twice a day.</li>
            <li> My 3-year old sucked her thumb a few times the first and second day and then decided that the product tasted pretty awful</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3 yr old who sucks his fingers.  </li>
            <li> the people who complained that the taste got in their food, I would suggest to not use it until your child is 3 or 4 years old and they can use utensils.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 ur old who sucks her finger.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old sucks</li>
            <li> My three year old sucks her two fingers</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old son sucks his thumb when he&#x27;s sleeping.  </li>
            <li> MY 5 YR OLD SUCKS HIS FINGER...</li>
            <li> My daughter is now 4 1/2 years old and she still sucks her fingers.</li>
            <li> Worked on my 5 year old who was an exsessive thumb sucker since birth.</li>
            <li> Our six year old has been a life-long thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> I have a 3yr old thumb sucker and nothing was working.</li>
            <li> My son recently turned 3 and has been a CONSTANT thumb sucker since birth.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old no longer sucks his two fingers.</li>
            <li> So far it is working for my nail bitters and thumb sucker children...</li>
            <li> My 3 year old was a 24/7 thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that she still sucks.</li>
            <li> My hubby complained about the lasting aftertaste it left.  </li>
            <li> my 3 1/2 year old sucks his thumb</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried for years (I know, I could have tried harder along the way, but was discouraged when nothing seemed to work) to get my daughter to quit sucking her fingers.  </li>
            <li> My husband cannot taste bitter.</li>
            <li> and I DO taste bitter and we both practically gagged when we tried</li>
            <li> I really got tired of nail biting and the way my nails look</li>
            <li> until I started tasting that bitter taste ALL of the time.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll forget and try to pick out a stubborn piece of meat that got jammed between your teeth and will cringe when you taste the stuff on your nails.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful and remind the child not to put their fingers in their mouths while it is on their fingers-</li>
            <li> product is so bitter she could not continue to keep her fingers in her mouth</li>
            <li> Careful about finger foods and cooking when you&#x27;re wearing this product.</li>
            <li> I put in on every few days and after just 3 weeks, he stopped bitting his nails all together, even if I skip using the product for several days.</li>
            <li> One setback occurred when we had not applied it for 3 days (the bitter taste had dissipated), and he woke up and announced that he had sucked his thumb overnight.</li>
            <li> It only took a few times putting his fingers in his mouth before he stopped.  </li>
            <li> and she stop because of the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> It has a bitter taste and just 1 application lasts for 3-4 days on the nails.</li>
            <li> Within a few days she actually had visible nail growth.</li>
            <li> only a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;DS 3</li>
            <li> We just received one today, and my curious 3-year-old dropped it out of the box, and the glass bottle broke at the neck, and the contents spilled all over the floor.  </li>
            <li> Our kids have learned to eat finger foods carefully so that their nails don&#x27;t touch their food or their mouths.  </li>
            <li> This product by far is the most disgusting and the taste lingers for days on my nails (even with several hand washings, showers, etc.).  </li>
            <li> She was careful not to lick her fingers</li>
            <li> I tasted it and it is just like wet nail polish.  </li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work, we would have only wasted $15 compared to $75+</li>
            <li> If it winds up that your child is one of the few that it doesn&#x27;t work on, you&#x27;re only out about $15.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on shinny, but dulls in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say.  </li>
            <li> It has a bitter taste to it, so it discourages nail biting.</li>
            <li> My 4 year-old was never ready to give up the habit of thumb-sucking, but we started using Mavala Stop 4 days ago, and she has not attempted to do this ever since...</li>
            <li> I was curious to see what it tastes like</li>
            <li> However, it seems like the effect is cumulative and anything you touch begins to taste like bitter, rotten fish.  </li>
            <li> When I 1st started, I put it on every day, but now I only put it on every few days.</li>
            <li> As a guy it kills me to have my nails look like they are perpetually wet.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because this product is rough for guys to use, when guys are supposedly the majority of nail biters.  </li>
            <li> She accidentally sucked it a few times, especially  at night and the taste was traumatic for her, she had to drink a lot of milk to get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li> She hates the taste of it, as it leaves a bitter aftertaste that lingers on after the sucking is done.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful eating finger foods like burgers and fries or</li>
            <li> I had never really tried to stop before now.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t care about the bitter taste and continued to suck.  </li>
            <li> so I spent the $12 hoping this would be the answer.</li>
            <li> This helped my son stop sucking his thumb in a few short days.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confused because it doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything.  </li>
            <li> applied it on her two nails and applied it again a few nights later.</li>
            <li> We only used it for a few days with our daughter and we could have stopped at one day -</li>
            <li> The reason it works is that it is non-water soluble and so stays on for about 2 days, and the taste is unbelievably bitter and foul.  </li>
            <li> In the middle of the night, we could hear him gagging and crying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is bitter</li>
            <li> I made a deal with her that I would get her a pink nail polish (the ones for kids) if she would wear this for a week.  </li>
            <li> but I reminded her about the pink nail polish.</li>
            <li> I only applied this product a few times and she no longer needs the &amp;#34;reminder&amp;#34; not to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> and she found out that it was too bitter and yucky</li>
            <li> Delivered in time, as expected.</li>
            <li> The taste is bitter and it stays on your fingernails even after washing your hands over and over.  </li>
            <li> I applied it every 2 days but had to switch to everyday because it did not last 2 days.  </li>
            <li> He just did not like the bitter taste at all.</li>
            <li> I warned her about the bitter taste if she puts her fingers in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Later she came out of her room crying</li>
            <li> but it worked so be careful.</li>
            <li> He forgot few times during the following day but that was it.</li>
            <li> I just had to be careful not to touch any food with that</li>
            <li> You will cringe at the thought of placing your fingers remotely close to your mouth.  </li>
            <li> When i ordered this i thought it would be a waste of my money because i have tried something similar before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think she slept as well over the next few days (even during nap time)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bitter.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you eat finger food, as the taste can get on your food.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like acetone (nail polish remover), bitter, rotten wood, and some sort of fish put together.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Malvala Stop\\&quot; is bitter</li>
            <li> Just be careful when you eat and cook.</li>
            <li> son says it tastes bitter for about 20 minutes after he tries to chew fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Although, when I asked her what it tasted like, she said it was a mix of bitter, peppers, and dog poop.</li>
            <li> Absolutely bitter taste and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> After applying this product and a few habitual nail bites later my daughter stopped within a week!!!</li>
            <li> The last few months he&#x27;s been biting his fingernails until his fingers bleed, so as soon as it came</li>
            <li> tired and ready for bed.  </li>
            <li> but I have now been on an anti-anxiety medication for a few months prior.</li>
            <li> And have a wet wash cloth nearby to help at night when they wake up, with the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; on their tongue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, and I&#x27;d been biting my nails for roughly 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Buy this or any bitter nail polish and put it on every day.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Some people may have a stronger reaction to this product than others, so I am not discrediting those who feel this product is too bitter.  </li>
            <li> The taste is so bitter that she wouldn&#x27;t dare to suck her tumb again.</li>
            <li> just a day.&lt;br /&gt;I would say to consider this product if you want something that tastes bitter.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this product looses its bitter taste as time goes by?</li>
            <li> I apply it to my fingers in the morning everyday and inevitably end up biting a finger once -- and the taste it leaves on my mouth/mind keeps me away from biting for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in over 3 weeks but its so bitter that if I mistakenly put my finger in my mouth I shudder from the bitterness.</li>
            <li> My son is a thumb shucker but the bitter test of the product</li>
            <li> I have had a lifelong struggle with nail biting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a combination of crushed aspirin and bitter leaves or herbs.</li>
            <li> Be careful though...</li>
            <li> Really bitter to stop biting.</li>
            <li> Taping it up, essential oils, mittens just to name a few.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few weeks and applied it again, and the second time around it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> This product works since it&#x27;s a bitter reminder that I&#x27;m biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> The flavor to me is bitter, but not a digusting flavor.  </li>
            <li> maybe it would have been harder on us....</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Working as expected.</li>
            <li> Be warned, do not accidentally get any on your fingers, you&#x27;ll be tasting bitter things all afternoon if you do.</li>
            <li> Its bitter and just yucky.</li>
            <li> my daughter woke up crying in the middle of the night saying she was going to throw up.  </li>
            <li> it does get all over everything you touch so be careful eating.</li>
            <li> Seems to last after a few hand washes.</li>
            <li> Your fingers will be BITTER.</li>
            <li> Finally I bought this and after a few applications while she was asleep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely bitter to the taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really even tempted to bit them anymore.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> A few seconds later, she said &amp;#34;tummy</li>
            <li> She is just so stubborn she wouldn&#x27;t keep her thumb out of her mouth even though she was crying, screaming like she was in pain and telling me how gross it was and asking me to kiss her tongue (not going happen).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terribly bitter, and the taste takes some time to leave your mouth.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra few bucks and order this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stop biting my nails for years, using lots of methods including &#x27;bitter bite.&#x27;</li>
            <li> - he simply put his hands in his mouth a few times, realized taste</li>
            <li> guess my daughter is not ready to quit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few days and report later.</li>
            <li> A few months later</li>
            <li> I do have to put it back on every few weeks to remind her to not bite them.</li>
            <li> I have to use it every few months on her again when I see that thumb sneaking back in while she&#x27;s sleeping.</li>
            <li> Bitter when taste.</li>
            <li> One application will last a few days.  </li>
            <li> a few weeks later we stopped Malava and she started sucking again.</li>
            <li> I have tried sticker charts, bitter nail polish, band-aids, socks, gloves.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s momentarily bitter and then stops.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived broken with the whole package smelling like nail polish funk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just bitter to the taste, it&#x27;s long-lasting bitterness in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It started to be only when she was sleepy, but a few months ago, I noticed her doing it out of boredom.  </li>
            <li> You paint it on every 2-3 days and that bitter taste does not go away.  </li>
            <li> and the thing has a bitter taste</li>
            <li> even though I&#x27;ve painted it with Mavala, seems his taste buds has gotten use to the bitter taste.....</li>
            <li> you get the harder it is to quit.  </li>
            <li> By day 3 she was really starting to go through withdrawl (moody, crying at night, etc)</li>
            <li> I only had to apply it for a few days and she broke the habit.</li>
            <li> so we applied it a few days later</li>
            <li> The taste is bitter which makes me not want to bite my nails.</li>
            <li> For example.. I used it to try and help me stop biting my nails, but than anything I ate with my hands would have that bitter taste.</li>
            <li> It had been a lifelong habit.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let them fall off, and my nails were so damaged they were BENDY, rough, and jagged.</li>
            <li> Again, if this even remotely touches that food from your fingers, you are done for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it has a non toxic bitter taste kids don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> She did need to be careful when eating anything with her hands to keep that thumb away from her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Only had to use it a few times.  </li>
            <li> it still tasted bitter.  </li>
            <li> the bitter taste on his finger was gone.  </li>
            <li> Bitter, repulsive, and lingering are words that can be used to describe this product if it manages to reach your mouth.</li>
            <li> It only took a few days of this for me to gain an awareness of my nail biting and this awareness has enabled me to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> We put this on her thumb nail and a few hours later we were driving in the car.</li>
            <li> My only warning/concern is if your kids are messy eaters &amp; tend to eat all their food with their hands, the taste might get into their food.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product goes way beyond expected.</li>
            <li> The thing is, you must remember to reapply it every few days, or else she&#x27;ll go back to sucking her index finger.</li>
            <li> It had a bitter after taste but it didn&#x27;t bother him at all.</li>
            <li> The product tastes like a bitter nail polish, but the taste lasts on the nail almost all day.  </li>
            <li> It really is a horribly bitter, yucky, burning sensation of a taste that lingers and lingers.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few days ago and haven&#x27;t even thought of biting my nails (which is a big accomplishment for a nail biter).</li>
            <li> The bitter taste keeps my fingers out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> We did notice the bitter flavor did not bother her when she was asleep.  </li>
            <li> She woke up an hour later, crying, gagging.  </li>
            <li> : It is too bitter....</li>
            <li> The taste is outrageously bitter and it dries out your mouth...</li>
            <li> we gave up after a few applications (ended up putting mittens on her hands which finally worked).  </li>
            <li> Be careful though, you may want your kids to wear a glove on the affected finger when they are eating since it seems to taint everything they handle with the hand that has the nail treatment on it.</li>
            <li> I only had to use it twice in two weeks, now with the longer nails I don&#x27;t feel uneven edges neither the urge to bite them off.  </li>
            <li> I have tasted it and do believe that it could work, but I think my son has gotten used to the bitter taste</li>
            <li> and I noticed his skin was looking rough to around the nail</li>
            <li> I thought it would just leave a bitter taste in my mouth, but it did in fact make it easier to resist.  </li>
            <li> This product helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb at night after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The longer you leave it in your mouth, the longer the bitter taste lasts - about 10 minutes when I tried it.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of virtually no sucking I thought she was done, but gradually the fingers crept back in.  </li>
            <li> It leaves an extremely bitter taste whenever you put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It worked in one night although the one night was rough.  </li>
            <li> the taste is bitter.  </li>
            <li> maybe 8-10 for like 3 sec</li>
            <li> The bitterly pungent, acrid taste of this solution is persistent and will put you off biting.</li>
            <li> Even if you put your finger in your mouth for one or two seconds its still bitter for approx 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Yes, sometimes you can taste it when you eat if you aren&#x27;t careful about the way you put it on.</li>
            <li> so he didn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth while it was still wet.)  </li>
            <li> This stuff has a bitter taste  </li>
            <li> My God it is ver bitter</li>
            <li> By applying Mavala to my nails, I still get hit with the terribly, terribly bitter taste if I try to chew a nail.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re wondering, the taste is extremely bitter but not nausea-inducing.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> It takes hours to get the bitter taste out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It does taste bitter.</li>
            <li> The taste is bitter that it made my child vomit her breakfast.</li>
            <li> It definitely is bitter and the taste lingers for awhile.  </li>
            <li> and the taste was so bitter</li>
            <li> But this stuff is so bitter.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few weeks if you stick with it and the thumb sucking/fingernail biting goes away.</li>
            <li> I have two kids aged 8 &amp; 10 who I am using this product for.  </li>
            <li> She tasted the BITTER taste and immediately took her thumb out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rough couple of days in the beginning</li>
            <li> Then I waited until the next weekend to apply it again and continued putting it on everyday ..</li>
            <li> This stuff is so bitter.</li>
            <li> My expectations were not high, but we are now on day 12 with no thumb sucking day or night!  </li>
            <li> I tried pink color thumster</li>
            <li> the taste is really bitter too.</li>
            <li> careful when applying it.  </li>
            <li> In short, it was a waste of time and money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Taste is bitter.</li>
            <li> worked for a while, the bitter taste stays with you.  </li>
            <li> Ive eaten sandwiches, cheeseburgers and fries, and i get that bitter taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This product is what I have been searching for these last few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to be broken of this habit very soon.</li>
            <li> no se coma las u&amp;ntilde;as</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely bitter, and the taste will linger on anything it touches (like finger food etc.)</li>
            <li> I have tried the &#x27;spicy&#x27; or &#x27;bitter&#x27; ones but after a while I got use to the taste or would stop putting it on my nails.</li>
            <li> The longer you wait, the harder it will be to break the habit</li>
            <li> My son is a nail bitter.</li>
            <li> and she also exhausted all my ingenuity in stopping thumb sucking but thanks to Mavala Stop</li>
            <li> Basically, everything I touched now tasted bitter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two of my children bite their nails and cuticles and I remember my parents putting this stuff on my fingers (it did not really work for me)</li>
            <li> However, the coating (what provides the bitter taste) stays on for weeks after you apply the polish.</li>
            <li> Since one coat is barely a 1/10 of the bottle, I suspect this small bottle will last me a few months, if not years.</li>
            <li> the bitter flavor does fade away.</li>
            <li> there is a hit and a miss, be careful with what you ask for...</li>
            <li> However, be careful how you use it.  </li>
            <li> He woke up a few hours later gagging and screaming</li>
            <li> I only applied it for a week (before the bottle was mysteriously misplaced?</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks because my daughter is swimming every day and you need to reapply daily since the chlorine seemed to neutralize the effects, and we kept forgetting to apply.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, this clear nail polish has a sheen to it, so being a 21 year old guy, I get a few people that look at me with a weird face asking, &amp;</li>
            <li> If you only have a few nailbiters in the house then you will be set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> In fairness to these methods, she was just not emotionally ready to break the habit.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t try to eat anything with your hands or you will get a mouthful of bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Of course he has had a harder time going to sleep without it</li>
            <li> You will get a taste of the bitter.</li>
            <li> She has stopped sucking her thumb throughout the day but still tries to do it at bedtime to soothe herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is bitter &amp; won&#x27;t make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I expected a bitter taste, not a toxic taste that causes upset stomach.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer then expected but within a month we were done</li>
            <li> I stopped bringing my hands even close to my mouth within only a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> My son had spent a day with his cousin and began sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> We had a really rough 1st  night.</li>
            <li> It made absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> will say that I accidentally got a drop on my nails and although I washed my hands over and over, I could still taste this bitter liquid.</li>
            <li> A few nights later, I snuck into his room while he was sleeping and painted this on.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail bitter for over 50 years....</li>
            <li> I have not seen her even try it and has therefore avoided the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I could not eat anything with my hands, everything tasted bitter.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had a lifelong nail biting problem.</li>
            <li> but maybe it has to do with location of your bitter taste buds on your tongue?</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t a total waste.  </li>
            <li> careful when eating.</li>
            <li> and I also put it on my husband, a lifelong nail biter.  </li>
            <li> ; has a shockingly bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> the next go round</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my 3 year old is either too young or too stuborn.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately our 6 year old broke the bottle and our 4 year old</li>
            <li> And it seemed as if the product became more thick and difficult to use the longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many times to stop and it just kept getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> Now, a few months later, even when he is really tired or really upset, he doesn&#x27;t suck his fingers.  </li>
            <li> It gives a slight shine to your nails which isn&#x27;t terribly noticeable, but it was a little concerning to me at first as I am a guy with what looked liked</li>
            <li> , i mean, i got to some points where my nail length (starting from the root) was around 2 or 3 millimeters only..</li>
            <li> a little later, She started sucking on OTHER part of her hands....</li>
            <li> The other things we tried helped a little bit, but he would always return to finding a way to get his thumb back in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> I applied a little at the middle of her thumb nail because I read other reviews that it may cause some children to vomit.</li>
            <li> It does however leave your nails with a slight shine, me being a male this leads to a few questions or strange looks.</li>
            <li> your old picked up a bad thumb sucking habit and this mavala stop cancelled it right away.</li>
            <li> We have seen so many negative things happening to our daughter (teeth being moved, marks on face from where she rests her nonsucking hand, etc), but it is hard for a little girl to understand that these long term affects are because she sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, my opinion is to start with just a thin coat on the nail or part of the nail every other day per instructions, but be ready to move to coating everyday and/or thicker and larger area if you find your child continues to thumb suck.  </li>
            <li> You quickly learn to be afraid and stop biting, as long as you continue to apply.</li>
            <li> So far, the results are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I mean, wow.</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old daughter has a mean habit when it comes to thumb-sucking.  </li>
            <li> She only likes plain bread, plain pasta, white rice, etc...  </li>
            <li> Simple and plain, if you need this to get someone to stop, then this is one product that will do the job.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, we used it for 2 days and</li>
            <li> just too make sure my child would not get sick.  </li>
            <li> did have a little trouble remembering in the beginning not to lick my fingers to be careful when eating hand-held foods, but it didn&#x27;t take long to adjust.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a positive or negative.</li>
            <li> really effective, stopped a life long bad habit!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, but it&#x27;s not strong enough to keep him from biting his nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it tastes terrible, something that preventing the other stuff I had tried before from working, and it is shiny</li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucks his thumb and has an overbite due to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We started using Mavala a few weeks ago (after having tried other similar products with no luck).  </li>
            <li> I became very wary, very quickly.</li>
            <li> Previously he was sucking his finger off and on all day long.</li>
            <li> My daughter figured out very quickly not to stick her thumb back in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I did notice is that I had to put it on everyday and not every other day.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my 5 year old nephew who bites his nails til his fingers are bloody.</li>
            <li> product is great because it tastes awful; it&#x27;s very bitter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful but very effective.</li>
            <li> I would even make little castes out of toilet tissue and wrap it on my thumb, but it would fall off</li>
            <li> Other ones of these are not actually strong enough to pass on that bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I have tried other bitter tasting nail polishes, but they were not strong enough to deter biting.  </li>
            <li> Even for an emotional, dramatic, sensitive girl, there were no tears or throwing up (as others mentioned).</li>
            <li> Evidently, the taste is bad enough that he finally left the paw alone to heal.  </li>
            <li> but my poor boy did mention that it was &#x27;icky&#x27; (which it&#x27;s obviously supposed to be ;))</li>
            <li> We tried many things that failed and were pretty frustrated and worried we never could help him stop.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;due to Mavala bitter taste\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything to get her to stop, including other bitter extracts.  </li>
            <li> Needs reapplication every other day, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> (warning: be careful when you eat popcorn because you may get the bitter taste when you start getting salt all over your hands!)</li>
            <li> I purchased this and, based on reading some other reviews, I carefully put it on the bottom portion of her thumb nail</li>
            <li> He suggested using the implant behind the teeth as a last resort, but fearing major dental problems</li>
            <li> Other bitter polishes did not help.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;ll stop due to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I painted her nail with the mavala stop and her other nails pink.</li>
            <li> We tried band-aids and other bitter nail polish when she was a toddler ~ no luck.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was a very small maybe about four years old.</li>
            <li> , is that the bitter taste tends to find its way onto things other than your nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction, or if he just has a sensitivity to the chemical, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on small children with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made his fingertips peel all the way down to his first knuckles!  </li>
            <li> By the second day it wears down a little but still deters you from biting your nails.</li>
            <li> I was very careful when they were wet)  </li>
            <li> Okay so i ordered this product hoping it would help my 2yr old and 4yr old with sucking there thumbs and bitting her nails so very disappointed because my 2yr has gotten used to the taste and now she still sucks her thumb</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you eventually get a little bit used to the taste due to small amounts getting near lips or on things that go in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I only put a small bit on her thumb to begin with, as many people have said it caused their kids to get sick.</li>
            <li> My nails were so bad it is taking much longer to grow than normal</li>
            <li> He said it tasted bad, but not bad enough for him to keep his fingers out of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> my son quickly discovered that it does not really affect his nail biting because when he does so, his tongue does not touch the nail, so the only effect is that it makes his lips taste bad after the fact.  </li>
            <li> If you use this to stop a child from sucking his or her thumb I would be careful to only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was never able to stop more than a week cold turkey.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old had a serious finger sucking habit.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was eating messy things and then licking my fingers, Kinda ruins the meal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s yucky no more chewing your finger, the next time I knew she was careful</li>
            <li> Our 2 year old son has had a serious attachment to thumb sucking since birth.  </li>
            <li> so we plan to apply this daily for at least that long.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old daughter, who has a serious nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> Be careful to only put a small amount on the thumb nail and not the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> His sucking got worse as he got older.  </li>
            <li> It tastes absolutely horrible and lasts a good long while both on your nails and in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very worried about the health hazards of this, but when I realized how little I have to use (not the full dose) and, that during the winter my poor little 4 year old&#x27;s two fingers were actually WEARING AWAY, raw, peeling and painful ...</li>
            <li> Just be careful, a little of it goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I had not cut my 5 year old nails in at least 2 years as he would eat them down to nothing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique bitterness is unpleasant enough to keep the fingers away from the mouth after just a few exposures, but not toxic tasting or odorous.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I expect this stuff to stick on - but, after hand washings (which little boys do all day long) the polish wears off.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend, even if you feel like you have exhausted all avenues (</li>
            <li> other than some minor cough/saying throat was a little sore).  </li>
            <li> , Mavala is in a whole new realm of bad.</li>
            <li> The first couple of nights were rough because the taste is pretty awful, but all in all it worked when so many other methods had failed!</li>
            <li> and I am currently 2 weeks into using this with no nail biting and very little biting of my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it takes forever to dry, and seems like will smudge hours after applying.  </li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so nasty and is so strong, you really think twice before putting your fingers in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> so I will continue to use the product for the next few weeks in case he regresses to previous behaviors.</li>
            <li> To keep it strong enough I have to reapply every two days or so which I find to be a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does taste horrible, and it smells like really strong nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails and fingers since very young, and I&#x27;ve tried all methods I can to quit but not successful.</li>
            <li> stuff is extremely shiny--certainly as shiny as women&#x27;s nail polish.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s transparent does not take away from the fact that any self-respecting man would be embarrassed to walk around with extremely shiny nails.</li>
            <li> I know, though, that I&#x27;m not going to remember to do it every other day,</li>
            <li> I know, though, that I&#x27;m not going to remember to do it every other day,</li>
            <li> One time it didn&#x27;t try well, and my kid touched it with his other hand, and it ended in my mouth when I kissed his hand:)&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Other things did not work but this did.</li>
            <li> and she would even comment that other products (Thum) didn&#x27;t taste like anything.  </li>
            <li> Other products didn&#x27;t work, this did</li>
            <li> Just teach them how to comfort themselves in other ways.</li>
            <li> I put it on after school the other day</li>
            <li> However, I did find that I had to reapply every night before bed, not every other as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always been pretty skeptical of products like this</li>
            <li> It was so entirely bitter, he wouldn&#x27;t try to bite his nails at all!</li>
            <li> But it rubbed off her fingers on to other parts of her hand face</li>
            <li> It works so extremely well that my wife and I have passed it on to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Even after it came it sat for a week before I was lazy enough to use</li>
            <li> All you need it to put a TINY DAB on each finger, no more than that is needed, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thumb worked for two of my other kids when they were two year olds to wean them from their binkies.  </li>
            <li> If you not having luck with other products give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I put the nail polish on every night (while he was sleeping) instead of every other day (like the directions say) because he kept trying to take the polish off.  </li>
            <li> We tried EVERYTHING to get him to stop... bribes, thumb sleeves, other paint-on products.</li>
            <li> It says to do every other day -</li>
            <li> Mary had one experience with the taste and has not sucked her thumb or any other finger since we started using it.  </li>
            <li> --unlike other nail biting \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I guess we&#x27;d have to try a thumb guard or some type of restraint with the other two if we wanted to break the habits.</li>
            <li> We figured 6 was past time to stop sucking his thumb and tried various ways of having him stop.  </li>
            <li> I tried bribery, other products, you name it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt peel off like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Taste bitter so they truly wont suck thier thumb!</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put it on every other day.</li>
            <li> The other downside is that the product gives your nail a feminine shine</li>
            <li> Other that that, the product does what it says.</li>
            <li> product works, just have to re-apply every other day or so</li>
            <li> I apply it every day to every other day and my son doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> so he wouldn&#x27;t just start sucking on the other thumb instead.</li>
            <li> I think that it would work on other kids who are not as willful.</li>
            <li> For the ones that are resistant those other remedies there is Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all of our other efforts appeared to be fruitless, I decided to give some \\&quot;reminder fluid\\&quot; a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do it every other night and in a week you would see a result.</li>
            <li> He, along with me and 3 other Preschool parents, had girls who sucked their thumbs.</li>
            <li> I have tried other \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past and had no success (even tried crazy glue).</li>
            <li> Nobody likes bitter noodles!  </li>
            <li> I had a few minor tastes (from the product rubbing off while eating or something)</li>
            <li> Free\\&quot; or other products like it.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from fake nails to hot peppers.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try the other brands that are in the stores, they don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed as I wanted to stop the daytime thumb sucking more so even than the night time sucking.</li>
            <li> Now not sure what to try next.</li>
            <li> Other products do not work as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff, you put on every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I just kept reapplying it every other day, and it started to build up a texture on my nail.  </li>
            <li> As soon as we would pull one thumb out the other would go in.</li>
            <li> for this one, i had to take the time, and hopefully help other parents.  </li>
            <li> the other bites her nails.  </li>
            <li> If you wash your hands or use antibacterial stuff, it comes off so you must reapply about every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of any other nail polish</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking his thumb for years and we couldn&#x27;t find any other products to stop him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19-year-old male who has had the horrible nervous habit of biting my nails and cuticles for pretty much my whole life!</li>
            <li> Ive tried other products and nothing has worked this well.  </li>
            <li> I was so hopeful this was going to work after reading all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> We applied this liberally and every day (despite the claim that the product should be applied every other day), but she would pick it off and kept on biting.  </li>
            <li> We tried a couple other home remedies to no avail.</li>
            <li> Socks, mittens, and every other cover-up we tried were no match for her desire to suck her fingers while she was sleeping.  </li>
            <li> a little gos a LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s 6 now, he does it in school, the other kids tease him - so it&#x27;s time to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being that my son is in daycare and around other children I was concerned about him picking up germs by always sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> Any suggestions on other products?</li>
            <li> We have tried other paint on products but he just sucked them off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and methods to no avail.  </li>
            <li> But that was a small price to pay for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> She does report that sometimes she accidentally gets a taste of this stuff while eating a sandwich or some other finger food, but it&#x27;s not often, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected her appetite.  </li>
            <li> it is a bitter taste that you would not want to lick over and over again!</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well, my granddaughter completly quit sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I applied the product to my daughters thumb nail before bed every other day.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old girl sucked her middle 2 fingers everyday when she was tired (going to bed, watching TV, etc).  </li>
            <li> cause he was determined to suck the other one.</li>
            <li> there are other products out there that cover the finger with plastic and other materials</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb until I started using this product used all other items bought from amazon</li>
            <li> We followed others advice and only used a small amount.</li>
            <li> Just like all the other products, her desire to suck her thumb ruled.  </li>
            <li> That first night was difficult because she kept saying she wanted her \\&quot;thumbkin\\&quot;, and she wanted the polish off.  </li>
            <li> I will keep trying other things to help my daughter from biting her nails.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have done the taste justice...</li>
            <li> Then she began sucking her thumb while using her other fingers to rub the tip of her nose.</li>
            <li> oh and i dont liek that the product gets on other stuff dispite</li>
            <li> so he was never aware that he had it on and</li>
            <li> Trickiest part to using this is remembering to put it on every other day.  </li>
            <li> He requests it to be applied every other day.</li>
            <li> I would mention, though, that we had to reapply the product every day, not every other day, in order to prevent relapses.  </li>
            <li> She would try orange juice, water, milk, and other foods to get the taste out.  </li>
            <li> We had tried other things (\\&quot;Thumb\\&quot; and hot sauce), but unfortunately he likes spicy stuff.  </li>
            <li> The other kids tried it also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it states to use it once every other day.</li>
            <li> She winced and then looked at her thumb like it was a foreign object.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nail-biting treatments but nothing comes close to Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other things, like the gloves, and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li> She touched her thumbs to her other fingers.  </li>
            <li> I began to research other methods to help break the habit.  </li>
            <li> So that day, I prepared to order both devices when my husband pointed out if wearing a cast for four weeks didn&#x27;t break the habit, neither will any other device we applied.  </li>
            <li> every day/ every other day.  </li>
            <li> I applied every other day, but she still chewed on her nails.</li>
            <li> It was affecting her school work because as soon as her thumb went into her mouth (and her other hand would twirl her hair)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read the other reviews of this product, when we got it I started out with just a dab on her nail.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to experience any extreme adverse reactions (i.e vomiting).</li>
            <li> Later that evening when it was time for bed, he went to sleep with his thumb in his mouth as usual.</li>
            <li> It did the trick, but after 12 days of extreme emesis (vomiting).</li>
            <li> First, I applied on the one thumb and rest of fingernails for the guilty hand.  </li>
            <li> She went for the other fingers.</li>
            <li> But it rubbed off his fingers on to other parts of his hand or face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bitter!</li>
            <li> The taste wears off on other things after you wash your hands or shower, but not this.</li>
            <li> recommend only putting a small dot on each thumb nail as it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The roof of his mouth is correcting itself and his two teeth have come in and are almost lined up with the other teeth.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when eating finger foods!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take this issue over the other.</li>
            <li> As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t an irritant ( no capsaicin like other products)</li>
            <li> With Malava, the next day no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> We reappled it every other night for about a week and now the thumb sucking is history.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the rave reviews and testimonials from other people on this site who said it worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sharp objects and go for it.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, we decided to only apply a small amount to the tip of his nails.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply it every other day to have the maximum effect</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and the kids got used to it.</li>
            <li> so you have to retouch it every hour like other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried other things before.</li>
            <li> seen others describe the taste, but frankly, I can&#x27;t compare it to anything - other than to say -</li>
            <li> I used it for about a week or two, using every other day -</li>
            <li> The taste is really bitter so remember to use a fork when eating, you&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> I think it will work for most children, but just not mine. :(</li>
            <li> weeks of this stuff, applied once every other day...</li>
            <li> but man is it bitter!</li>
            <li> this worked on my son and we&#x27;ve tried other products that didnt.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for some of the other products on Amazon, but the MAVALA STOP does work for us.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands with the flavor trigger to induce vomiting if fingers are put into mouth.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to use every other day.</li>
            <li> I started off doing that, but my grandson has learned that he can suck his thumb every other night.</li>
            <li> Here we are about a month later, and no more thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it on every other day, but whenever he or I thinks of it, probably twice a week.  </li>
            <li> and we did other things like that to try and help him not get that taste in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> (Its been 6 weeks and absolutely no sucking!)</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to only use a small amount on the thumbs.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> thumb sucking is a distant memory!  </li>
            <li> We have even tried orthodontic prongs and devices that were sharp in his mouth in attempts of stopping his thumb sucking habit and nothing worked like this product.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds extreme, but I couldn&#x27;t find another way to get them to stop biting their nails.</li>
            <li> The son figured out that the other brand washed off, but Maval Stop is like nail polish.  </li>
            <li> my other twin doesn&#x27;t bit his finger nor toe nails...</li>
            <li> The other junk we tried out from Walgreens didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> then every other night the 2-3 week.  </li>
            <li> After a couple nights I noticed she began sucking her other fingers to soothe herself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other methods but couldn&#x27;t stop my daughter from sucking her thumb even though she is also want to stop this habit herself.</li>
            <li> Applied this to my 3.5 yo daughters nails, and it was extremely efficient in ending her sucking the thumb.</li>
            <li> Gives you a bitter reminder that your nail is in your mouth!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d advise doing what I did - minus the pepper spray!</li>
            <li> I got the Shellac since it lasts so long and applied Stop every few days.</li>
            <li> Put it on every other day.</li>
            <li> I would sit here on Amazon and other websites reading reviews and</li>
            <li> I had tried every other tactic in the book, but nothing had worked.</li>
            <li> Needs to be reapplied about every other day.  </li>
            <li> I applied Muvalva to both thumbs every other night (once he fell asleep) for 1 month</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Just as expected!</li>
            <li> Good luck to my fellow peers who have been a victim to this nasty habit.</li>
            <li> Get this stuff, put it on every other day..</li>
            <li> every other day for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used other over the counter, well-known, thumb sucking products and they didn&#x27;t prevent my daughter from putting her fingers in her mouth at all.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want her to just start sucking OTHER fingers</li>
            <li> (I did this based on other user</li>
            <li> I awoke sharply to the taste of a thousand exploding batteries in my mouth.</li>
            <li> but they did refund the money due to</li>
            <li> I took other parents&#x27; advice</li>
            <li> Have moved to every other night.</li>
            <li> so she sucked her other thumb.</li>
            <li> I put it on her other thumb, then she started sucking her pointer finger... put it on that finger, and so on, until she had it on all 10 fingers</li>
            <li> I applied a small dot to the upper part of her fingernail as soon as she fell asleep.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, works like it</li>
            <li> The money we spent is not worth at all.</li>
            <li> In other words, JUST your biting problem is targeted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I need to reapply the polish every other day.</li>
            <li> This product worked extremely well and served its purpose.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about applying it all the time (like other products).  </li>
            <li> I saw her holding hands with other kids and then immediately sticking her fingers in her mouth-YUCK.  </li>
            <li> I needed soada to remove the bitter taste!  </li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but I said to myself if this stuff works I will write a review so it would help other mothers.  </li>
            <li> Yes this will keep you from chewing your nails, it will also ruin a lot of other things.</li>
            <li> I was using this to keep my son from chewing clothing, and other things.</li>
            <li> the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on like nail polish.  </li>
            <li> and I ask for the other, he reluctantly gets it for me and the nail</li>
            <li> However, daycare informed me that she was now sucking her other thumb.</li>
            <li> Husband stopped chewing his nails after only a few days!</li>
            <li> Awful, but effective!</li>
            <li> I had tried some other devices and cures but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I have tried all other nail polish &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; out there.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t know about Mavala or other products).</li>
            <li> you are doing and drink water or other liquid .</li>
            <li> it was about every other week.</li>
            <li> He turned 8 and the dentist said his palate was deforming due to the thumb sucking and his teeth were spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for over twenty years and tried one other nail polish product.  </li>
            <li> I got used to the taste of the other polish</li>
            <li> Be careful, though, not to get it on the pads of fingers or else anything they touch while eating/brushing teeth will taste aweful!</li>
            <li> One needs to stop thumb sucking and the other needs to stop nail biting.  </li>
            <li> Tryed other brands that didnt work.</li>
            <li> It is not designed for children who are not aware of their problem.</li>
            <li> other than a glove pinned to him 24-7.</li>
            <li> and she said she was done sucking her thumb, but we still applied it every other day for a week.  </li>
            <li> including when he ate pizza, popcorn, chips, or any other snack food.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, you may want to ask yourself whether you want your kids to be guinea pigs for the untested products of a foreign chemical company.</li>
            <li> He stopped biting his nails and sucking his thumb if we applied it every other day like instructed.  </li>
            <li> I will also agree with other users of this product</li>
            <li> I put  a band aid on and I also encouraged eating with the other hand..</li>
            <li> but after you wash your hands a few times it wears off so as long as you don&#x27;t mind reappling it will work</li>
            <li> We used only a small dab on the cuticle of her thumbs and that was it.</li>
            <li> saw this being used by other parents online and thought  I would try it.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products that did not work.</li>
            <li> I bite my nails, especially during peaks of anxiety and I needed something that was going to help counter than anxious habit.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can do next.</li>
            <li> have recommended to my other &#x27;nail biting&#x27; friends.</li>
            <li> I had to reapply it at night while she was sleeping every other day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried Orly No Bite, and the other Bite</li>
            <li> I applied it every other day for two weeks and broke an over 50 year nail-biting habit.</li>
            <li> I just paint it on his thumb every other night while he is sleeping.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit concerned that the product would affect her eating habits.</li>
            <li> I did take the suggestion of another reviewer of only putting a small dot application on his nail so it wouldnt hinder his eating.  </li>
            <li> not sure if anyone had the same experience..</li>
            <li> Re-apply every other day(or even every day) if you&#x27;re an aggressive biter like me.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other products like this, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> has an extreme overbite,due to thumb sucking,so I needed to do something to get him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Read reviews that it made other children vomit.</li>
            <li> a baby!My other daughter is eight</li>
            <li> I even got him to stop sucking one thumb, and instead he started sucking the other.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money on other products - just use Mavala stop and your issues with thumb sucking/fingernail biting/ chewing on fingers</li>
            <li> Due to stress, habit, and who knows what else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still putting it on him every other day just in case</li>
            <li> His other issue he has now started biting his nails.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews where they state that it gets on everything.</li>
            <li> Other similar products I have used in the past lasted through weeks of being in water, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brand again due to that.  </li>
            <li> but you do have to reapply every other day like the label says.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about this product, or this method of control is there are times the fingers go in the mouth for things other than nail-biting, thumb-sucking.  </li>
            <li> but that night he used his other thumb to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> but I have to apply every other day</li>
            <li> my son would still suck on his thumb until the bitter taste goes away!  </li>
            <li> I put every other day for a couple of weeks and now its been over 2months</li>
            <li> My wife and I looked at each other and thought this just might work.</li>
            <li> We have applied some Mavala on her thumbs every other day for three weeks</li>
            <li> It only needs to be applied every few days for a couple weeks and the problem is gone!</li>
            <li> long as I remember to apply this every few days, I have no temptation to bite my nails.</li>
            <li> That being said, remember to be careful yourself, if you get any on your hands your in for it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 months, and we still reapply every other day just for reinforcement.  </li>
            <li> We did try this on her at age 3 with not much luck!</li>
            <li> As some other people mentioned you can taste it on food that you eat with your hands.</li>
            <li> Tried 2 other kinds from a beauty suply store but they didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> We tried all sorts of methods before resorting to purchasing this product, because other reviewers said that the product transferred to their food-</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to put the &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; on her finger and ask to put them on every other night.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I even recommend other mother to try them too when saw the kid suck their thumbs in the mall.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with finger foods!</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with finger foods!</li>
            <li> in other words it may work for your kids</li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand...</li>
            <li> We applied it to his nails after dinner every other night and then reduced the frequency of application to about once a week.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product:( With all the great reviews we were really hoping it would break our 5 year old of sticking his fingers in his mouth and chewing on his fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to add a negative review, but this did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for my finger-sucking 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, he was still eating mostly with fingers at 3 yo, too, and this was a very hard situation for all of us.</li>
            <li> I have stopped biting my nails due to the VERY bitter taste it leaves in my mouth.</li>
            <li> She is sleeping now without sucking although it does seem harder to put her down because she doesn&#x27;t have a comfort mechanism now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those who are serious about Stopping the nail biting habit!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is so great because it is so nasty that my little girl just doesnt stick her fingers in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> My five year old was a die-hard thumb sucker and this little bottle helped her kick the habit.</li>
            <li> This product works great and it tastes horrible, kinda like nail polish remover,(I got some in my mouth when i was little).</li>
            <li> The taste is very bitter</li>
            <li> He became very careful not to put his thumb in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Every time I made the mistake of brushing my lips against my fingers, I had this very bitter aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> Smells like nail polish and is very bitter.</li>
            <li> It is very bitter, so I can&#x27;t have my nail-nibbler daughter help in the kitchen to dice and chop veggies unless she is wearing rubber gloves after this stuff is applied.</li>
            <li> it has a very bitter taste &amp; it works for her, thank you.</li>
            <li> It tastes very bitter.</li>
            <li> ; Very bitter; Does not sting eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> It tastes very bitter almost like hairspray.</li>
            <li> I was very careful applying it onto just my nails.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to be very careful eating them</li>
            <li> It is very bitter.  </li>
            <li> I tried the product - it tastes very bitter.</li>
            <li> Very very bitter.</li>
            <li> It is very bitter, so we just painted the bottom part of his nail to keep him from tasting it when he ate.</li>
            <li> At the very least, I put them in my mouth twice within an hour, and let me tell you - I did not put my fingers back in my mouth for the rest of the day, especially because this stuff doesn&#x27;t just wash off.  </li>
            <li> It is very bitter.</li>
            <li> A very bitter sort of taste.  </li>
            <li> If you were biting because of nervousness, I think you would easily overcome the bad taste and keep going.</li>
            <li> The taste is so strong that even sampling cheese or eating a cracker with your hands will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my daughters fingernails thinking it would help her stop biting (trying to get my moneys worth since it didn&#x27;t work on master 4) but she came back and said it didn&#x27;t taste bad at all.  </li>
            <li> When my daughter developed a nail bitting habit I wanted to act fast before it got too bad.</li>
            <li> but the \\&quot;Holy cow, what did I just put in my mouth\\&quot; gag.</li>
            <li> It will definitely make you wary of putting a finger near your mouth.  </li>
            <li> the $14 I spent on it should last me at least 6 months.  </li>
            <li> My nails are long and pretty now because I&#x27;m so afraid I will have to use this product again.  </li>
            <li> Active ingredient listed as Cayenne pepper extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Active ingredient Denatonium</li>
            <li> Active ingredient Denatonium Benzoate (branded Bitrex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoof</li>
            <li> The first day I applied the product, she complained and cried that it was no fair and that it stained her mouth.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was CONSTANTLY sucking her thumb as of late and it was driving us nuts, as I didn&#x27;t want that habit to get worse as she got older.  </li>
            <li> By the second and third week we were applying it every day, sometimes twice a day because she got used to the taste, but by the end of the month, she had broken the habit.  </li>
            <li> Really helps for cutting back on nail-biting.</li>
            <li> There is enough nail polish in the bottle to last you until you have permanently broken the habit too, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about a temporary fix</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have done it when she was 4 and not 5; it probably would have saved me a few lectures from the dentist and a few doctor trips for her.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately when I was reading my book I had managed to slip my finger in to my mouth and gnaw on it not even a split second after I did, I ran downstairs and directly into the kitchen for some water.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE WAS HALF EMPTY..</li>
            <li> I tried it on my own finger and it does taste awful but that is what was necessary to stop this habit.</li>
            <li> We had tired a similar product once before when our daughter was younger, but at that time she told us &amp;#34;it tastes yucky but I am used to it.&amp;#34; She&#x27;s four now, and we thought we should try it again.</li>
            <li> Worth the meager investment to not be in pain, bite your nails like a mental patient, and look like weevils chewed away your hands.</li>
            <li> The gloss from the polish will rub off after a few days (especially if you wash your hands with soap a few times).</li>
            <li> A little difficult getting her to sleep during bedtime, but eventually everyone falls asleep right.</li>
            <li> (I would not subject my child to something without knowing how bad it was, and I certainly would not use it without her consent.)  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have a little hand or thumb sucker in your life!</li>
            <li> I skeptically bought this after reading the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to deter my son at ALL, but it apparently tasted so bad to my 2 year old that she gagged and threw up repeatedly for the next 3 DAYS!!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much (I still have 3/4 of a bottle left) and depending on how bad your habit is will determine how long you should use it.</li>
            <li> and im pretty sure it made my tongue numb as the taste was sosososososososooooooooooooo bad.</li>
            <li> I hate to love this product because it tastes so terrible that it works amazingly!</li>
            <li> We have tried other formulas that you paint on as well as some home formulas with no success.  </li>
            <li> My six (almost) seven year old daughter could not stop sucking her thumbs (she was an ambidextrous thumb sucker!).</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 3 year old who sucks her thumb a lot!</li>
            <li> It stopped her day time habit right away, But she thinks it&#x27;s worth the horrible taste to suck it off at night.</li>
            <li> He was already starting to extinguish the thumb sucking during the day due to peer pressure, but was still sucking hard at night.  </li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 year old daughter still sucks her thumb at night and a recent bribing effort by her grandma failed to get her to stop sucking her thumb, so I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> I had tried everything I could think of - just focusing on not biting, rubber bands on my wrist, and other random stuff that really just did not work.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, the stuff isn&#x27;t that expensive and much cheaper than other methods to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs.  </li>
            <li> only other complaint was when she would eat finger foods.  </li>
            <li> Even though the taste is disgusting (and my boyfriend threatened to not kiss for a significant amount of time if he could taste it on my lips), the taste didn&#x27;t bother me as much after a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slightly glossy sheen to it, a bit like clear nail polish, but that is way better than nasty looking nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that also were not effective</li>
            <li> I tried the other stuff from the local drug store and it didn&#x27;t even phase my finger sucker.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop demonstrates exactly how often we put our filthy hands directly in our mouth!</li>
            <li> Was getting tired of nail infections and sensitive finger tips due to nail biting.</li>
            <li> and he put all his fingers in his mouth just to be smart and try to prove it wouldn&#x27;t work and ended up feeling ill.</li>
            <li> However, he sucked this thing right off, told me it was awful tasting but kept right on.</li>
            <li> She started getting sick all the time because of the constant influx of germs from everything she touched going right in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I may wait a little while till \\&quot;I&#x27;M\\&quot; mentally prepared to handle her trying to sleep without her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> even that little dot tasted SOOOOOOOOOO bitter-</li>
            <li> BUT...prepare for the crankiness as your little one tries to adjust to NOT having to suck his thumb...</li>
            <li> Just be careful while eating hand held food as you might get a little taste on your tongue.</li>
            <li> But this product tastes so bad, and lingers for very long, that I quickly became averted to putting my fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> She was a major thumb sucker before we used this product, so I was a little skeptical, but it really did work.  </li>
            <li> I applied a coat to her nail bed every other day for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> I  bought this item for my two daughters, one two and half and other one ........</li>
            <li> I decided to try this first (a much less expensive and less invasive alternative).  </li>
            <li> We also gave the other half to his Kinder teacher who bites her nails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a habit that is hard to break - especially when you pop that thumb in your mouth while you&#x27;re asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that now they have a hard time falling asleep since they can&#x27;t suck their thumb.</li>
            <li> It is hard to do, especially @</li>
            <li> and it was really hard to eat any finger foods (especially popcorn) without getting the taste on your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The sheen is a problem as well though as a male it is hard to wear shiny nail polish but since it is working I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> The first night, he cried a little in bed because he was sad he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb.</li>
            <li> I had thought I would have such a hard time getting my 2 1/2 yr.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this stuff can get hard &amp; unuseable once it starts getting low.</li>
            <li> But, we need to have a hard psychological support during the process</li>
            <li> We were having such a hard time breaking her of this habit.  </li>
            <li> Well it only took one hard night and its been 3 months</li>
            <li> It also becomes hard to open after a while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gross, and you have to train yourself the hard way to keep you hands out of your mouth, but that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> so I really thought it would be very difficult to make her stop and thought we would go through major crying fits</li>
            <li> , the product delivers a very bitter odd taste when you come in contact with it.  </li>
            <li> but as a mother there is a huge burden lifted from my shoulders because she has stopped this bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She thought it was funny when I was all hyped up about her \\&quot;stop sucking\\&quot; polish because I made a big deal about the bad taste of Thum</li>
            <li> The first night she did put her fingers in her mouth out of habit - and the bad taste of this stuff was enough to wake her up and make her get up and take a drink of water to wash the taste out.  </li>
            <li> She was pretty emotional for a while - like someone quitting any bad habit that had comforted them.</li>
            <li> Not because we used the entire first bottle, but because our kid dumped it out because she hates the taste so bad.</li>
            <li> However, the bad taste of Mavala Stop kept my fingers away from my mouth during those critical first two weeks when I was tempted to bite.</li>
            <li> He complained the next morning it took all night to get that \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; taste out of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to keep them awake as long as possible so they are extremely tired</li>
            <li> (I painted the entire thumb nail), I realized that when she would pick up her food with her fingers (as toddler&#x27;s usually eat---picking up a green bean, whatever..)</li>
            <li> Making her nauseous is not worth it.</li>
            <li> When she tried to put her thumb in her mouth, she instantly pulled it out, made a face and said this is icky.  </li>
            <li> Complained of a stomach ache and was drooling and gagging and very shortly vomited from the taste.</li>
            <li> Usually, he puts up a fight during application but after a few hours, he&#x27;s back at it.</li>
            <li> and then she complained about eating, etc., as mentioned by another poster above.  </li>
            <li> My son is very persistent and stubborn so when we are met with behavior that needs changing it is always difficult to find the solution.</li>
            <li> It was so easy...just apply a thin layer of this clear nail-polish like liquid on the thumbs, and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> only part that sucks is it does rub off on your food.  </li>
            <li> so then it ruins the shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> Just happily sucks her thumb same as ever.</li>
            <li> I will mention that he only sucks his thumb at night and during naps.  </li>
            <li> I found if I only use one coat it doesn&#x27;t take long at all for it to thin and wear off.</li>
            <li> Perhaps he doesn&#x27;t taste it when he is asleep??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend if your child only sucks their thumb while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my sixties who has been biting my nails constantly for at least fifty years.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried everything but with no success.</li>
            <li> We had tried another brand with no success before.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you can eat finger foods with it</li>
            <li> This product tastes SOOOOOO gross if you accidentally try to bite your nails and the taste lasts for at least 5 minutes in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It has a very chemical taste with a sweet undertone that makes for a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> wins in that it tastes the worst and must have a higher concentration of Denatonium Benzoate.</li>
            <li> She no longer sucks her thumb, it only took about a week to stop.</li>
            <li> Absolutely because my son is no longer sucking his thumb which is a habit I thought would be extremely difficult to break.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> We tried THUM with no success.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that our bottle glued itself shut.</li>
            <li> I got his for my son who sucks his index and middle finger while he sleeps.  </li>
            <li> Because now I keep looking at my nails, knowing that the taste is not worth the bite.</li>
            <li> Because now I keep looking at my nails, knowing that the taste is not worth the bite.</li>
            <li> My daughter (6) at the time was a constant thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old only sucks his thumb at night, and I tried putting it on after he&#x27;d fallen asleep, but he sucked his thumb anyway.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated it so much that she felt like throwing up the first time we applied it to her nails.</li>
            <li> She complained all the next day.</li>
            <li> We only had to put it on my daughter&#x27;s nails 3 times,  she no longer sucks her thumbs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative side is the taste it leaves...</li>
            <li> My daughter has sucked her thumb since she was an infant and lately her thumb has rarely left her mouth.</li>
            <li> All 3 times they still bit nails and complained of belly aches later.</li>
            <li> So that is my only negative.</li>
            <li> She sucks her two middle fingers and in two days, she stops.</li>
            <li> She was a thumb sucker and also when board or nervous she would grind her teeth into her nail beds to the point where it caused enough trauma that her fingernail would fall off.</li>
            <li> My son was a big time thumb sucker and he used this product three times and has kicked the habit.  </li>
            <li> We tried a lot of things for years with no success.</li>
            <li> she no longer sucks her two middle fingers!</li>
            <li> But his teeth were already getting wonky from it and it was time to take the next step.</li>
            <li> tried socks, gloves , bribery, medical tape, thum, scare tactics with the dentist/orthodontist and negative reinforcement.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing is even just the slightest touch of your lip, and u have that taste there for a while, which i just apply some chapstick over if that happens.</li>
            <li> We were amazed since she wasn&#x27;t an occasional thumb sucker, she did it</li>
            <li> After the 3rd application he was no longer a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> It ruins them.</li>
            <li> If your kid sucks both of his/her thumbs interchangibly, I might suggest that you work on only one thumb at a time.  </li>
            <li> It appears to last at least 3 days for her.  </li>
            <li> My youngest daughter was a thumb sucker and her teeth were starting to shift because of it</li>
            <li> Use this product all the time, ruins finger food so just eat with a fork or something.</li>
            <li> Lasts for several days, at least five before needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> My daughter just sucks it off even when we painted the entire finger.</li>
            <li> with no success.  </li>
            <li> and I can attest it is an icky taste that definitely would make me not want to put my fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> the Mavala paid for itself essentially and now both of her boys (two and three) are also no longer thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this for nail bitters and thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> I used this several years ago for my son who was a notorious thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> When this stuff comes into contact with my mouth, it ruins my day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts at least 2-3 days with regular hand washing and baths.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a big thumb sucker and after this product hit her thumb, I have not had a problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also ruins finger food.  </li>
            <li> When all else fails, this really works.</li>
            <li> I feel that if I did not apply it daily I would bite my nails on the second day and just deal wit the faint bitter taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that if I did not apply it daily I would bite my nails on the second day and just deal wit the faint bitter taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are sad because were really hoping this would work, and it has not phased her at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has worked to curb her habit in the least was making her wear gloves all the time.</li>
            <li> He only complained about the taste when he ate fingerfood.</li>
            <li> havnt broken the habbit completely been about a month.</li>
            <li> She has been completely addicted to her thumb since she was eight weeks old.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries, she cried, it would wear off and we would try again.  </li>
            <li> My son had a harder time because he would accidently put his thumb in his mouth at night and wake up crying from the taste.  </li>
            <li> Good news is it is disgusting.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my first bottle after a few months because it got very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> We got this for our son, but after a few tries and seeing it not working we gave up on using it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply the liquid to all fingers (at the base of the nail not the tips).  </li>
            <li> We were hesitant to use this product on our 4 yr old son, but his thumb sucking was getting worse.  </li>
            <li> This works well, tastes awful, and is a good aid in relieving thumb-sucking and nail biting.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this for our 3 year old who was absolutely addicted to his thumb.</li>
            <li> It has been a few weeks now and we reapply every couple of days on the nails just in case she tries to suck her thumbs.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old had been broken of the thumb sucking habit expect during the night.  </li>
            <li> So far the habit seems broken and my nails are well on there way to not looking like a mutant&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I stop myself and the few times today that I have forgotten and unconsciously tried to bite them I am bitterly reminded of why I need to keep from biting.</li>
            <li> You will hate your self, but love what happens to your hands and nails....</li>
            <li> The taste is awful which is a good thing unlike others.</li>
            <li> There are also a few expected downsides.</li>
            <li> It is a horrible taste which is good to not sucking thumb.</li>
            <li> it works cause it tastes real bitter.</li>
            <li> You even have to be careful when you are eating finger foods because if your finger happens to touch your mouth, you are in trouble.  </li>
            <li> My little guy decided to rebel against the bad taste and daddy telling him not to bite, so he immediately put all four fingers right to the back of his throat !!!</li>
            <li> Yay to fewer dental/orthodontist bills later down the road!!!</li>
            <li> We tried other nail nibbling deterrents, but they seemed to be merely seasoning for the main course.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize half the time when I was chewing on them, which definitely makes it hard to break the habit.</li>
            <li> I mean, like everyone else said it tastes horrible and will completely ruin foods for you, but it&#x27;s amazing in that it works.</li>
            <li> The other 4.5 nails were bitten half way down or less.</li>
            <li> the bad taste lasts for days, unlike most other products which need reapplying twice a day, also once the taste is in your mouth, it is hard to get rid of, deterring you from biting them again.</li>
            <li> Wd have learned that the younger they are the less developed the tastebuds, so it can be very hard to discourage very small kids.</li>
            <li> He was doing it so bad that we put it on everyday for the first 5 days or so then cut back to every other day and then as needed.</li>
            <li> I put this on my daughter&#x27;s fingers one week ago, along with some pale pink nail polish (for her liking) and she has not sucked her fingers yet.  </li>
            <li> However, by the time its taste effect goes down</li>
            <li> so I can quit using it somewhere down the road..  </li>
            <li> so I can quit using it somewhere down the road.</li>
            <li> When he put his thumb in mouth, he found the taste disguisting and tried to spit out the taste and water it down.</li>
            <li> From then on when awake it would make it to just before his mouth then he would put the thumb down.  </li>
            <li> We have gone a couple weeks without an application and he hasn&#x27;t chewed his nails down since.  </li>
            <li> after months of biting my nails down to the root and trying every product out there</li>
            <li> and then the taste shoots down both sides of the tongue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stop wasting my money and pay the orthodontist down the road.</li>
            <li> I would see him trying to put his thumbs into his mouth and would make a face and put it down.  </li>
            <li> He would bite his fingers not just the tips around the nails, but down the sides as well.  </li>
            <li> the down side, he complains about the taste getting on his sandwiches.</li>
            <li> So until that dies down, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, which is advised anyway.  </li>
            <li> but I was there trying to tell her finger down</li>
            <li> and I have to make her sit down</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even sit down with her on the couch without her pulling my shirt down or putting her hand on my breast.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to stop someone, maybe yourself, from biting nails this stuff will do the trick hands down.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes terrible and boy you really do all you can quick to keep it from entering your mouth.</li>
            <li> I would even try to hold her down with her arms away from her face so she would fall asleep without sucking.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d worn it down to a flesh colored nub.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully we stopped it in time to avoid the costly expense of braces down the line.</li>
            <li> The down &#x27;n&#x27; dirty:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My nails were always worn down into the cuticle because I could not stop biting them.  </li>
            <li> I glanced down thinking it was about time to cut his nails, and he didn&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li> and there was no sign that his thumb sucking was slowing down.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are accurate - it goes on like clear nail polish and tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> Just like what other reviewers said, it worked OVERNIGHT!</li>
            <li> I only needed to use it for a week and no more finger sucking!  </li>
            <li> this time it did work - 2 weeks later, no more nail biting!  </li>
            <li> Find other means to stop biting your fingers!</li>
            <li> I applied a little but at the cuticle every other day for a couple of days</li>
            <li> Well there were a couple of instances of throwing up in the middle of the night  (due to gagging and screaming not actual nausea) which was sad</li>
            <li> I could stop there as that statement says it all - but to add a little and respond to some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read:&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> but I still put a little every other day just in</li>
            <li> And I mean everything (!)</li>
            <li> 6-8 days of ONLY a SMALL DROP of Mavala Stop on the TIP of the FINGER NAIL!</li>
            <li> one is doing nail biting and the other one is thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> I mean apples, grapes, sandwiches, pickle spears, burgers, french fries.  </li>
            <li> The taste is truly terrible, though, unless you like the acrid, bitter taste that lingers for a half hour in your mouth, impervious to toothpaste, rinsing, or just about any other kind of imagined remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best worst tasting stuff you can get, put it on my 4yr old before she went to bed one evening, she put her thumb in her mouth once, and she hasn&#x27;t done it again for over a month, she fussed about it a few times, but doesn&#x27;t even talk about it now, haven&#x27;t put any on for almost 2 weeks, still no thumb sucking, to bad for all the orthodontist out there.</li>
            <li> Poor little guy, every week or two he would bite them down so far his fingers would hurt.  </li>
            <li> It certainly tasted bad, I just couldnt get it concentrated enough to matter.</li>
            <li> I also gave her a VERY SMALL taste of it before applying it to her thumb in fear that having her entire thumb coated in it and her not knowing would traumatize her if she put it in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Very bitter taste!</li>
            <li> I hesitated because of the price and tried a few other remedies.</li>
            <li> I have been using it over the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t had to reapply it the last few days and have had no urge to bite them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts on the thumb for quite a few days and the taste is so bitter!</li>
            <li> but I only apply a very small amount to the tip of her thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of applying this stuff every other day she has reduced the amount she bites her nails</li>
            <li> It says to apply every other day but we apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> And whereas other products we had tried would wear off after a few days, this product along with its bitterness lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> I only applied a very small dab on her thumbs.  </li>
            <li> Our little thumb sucker actually likes the taste!</li>
            <li> Our son tried to suck his thumb after we had put this on and it was a pretty rough hour or two while he really struggled with the terrible taste</li>
            <li> So, I applied one coat on his nails and he just couldn&#x27;t even eat anything b/c anything he touched, it tasted very very bitter!  </li>
            <li> Our 4.5 year old is a die hard thumb sucker</li>
            <li> My eldest son was a thumb sucker from the time he was 6 months old until a dentist warned us at 4+ years that he was changing his hard palate with his vigorous habit.  </li>
            <li> With other products she would endure the unpleasant taste long enough for it to wear off, but after 1 night of using Mavala, she wouldn&#x27;t even try to put her thumb back in her mouth.</li>
            <li> while he watched a TV show for instance, he would forget and suck his thumb, but that taste was bad enough that he really worked to not do it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells and looks like clear nail polish, but tastes so bad that it deters her from putting any of her fingers near her mouth.</li>
            <li> My nails are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been after using this product for less than a month.</li>
            <li> After a brief discussion I put this on her nails (two coats) and seriously she stopped putting her hands in her mouth within an hour of application.</li>
            <li> In hindsight, I wished I stopped this habit when she was around two and a half.  </li>
            <li> Half the time when I eat something I don&#x27;t even think I touched</li>
            <li> less than a week</li>
            <li> this way would make it less of a control issue between us and also thought the bedtime suck would be the hardest to fade so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s subtle enough wearing</li>
            <li> She is sucking it less.  </li>
            <li> Less than a month</li>
            <li> (Less than a week via USPS priority to Hawaii)</li>
            <li> which is typically around the age of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I did not use very much, less than an M&amp;M size spot on his thumb.</li>
            <li> It took less than a week for her to stop the habit</li>
            <li> It worked for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that it leaves a nasty taste in your child&#x27;s mouth which make effect how food tastes after they try to suck there thumb when you first use it.</li>
            <li> This has to aid in less germs and sicknesses.</li>
            <li> Thumb sucking has slightly changed the shape of his bite and teeth.</li>
            <li> Compared to the prospect of potentially having a teenager who still sneaks and sucks his thumb, I can deal with the gloves for a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought the Mavala Stop put it on his thumb nail while he was sleeping, and he stopped sucking his thumb in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Now they don&#x27;t even seem tempted and it has been less than a week.  </li>
            <li> No grief, no crying she just said it was disgusting and quit.  </li>
            <li> I turn 32 here in less than a month so for almost 30 years</li>
            <li> My husband and I had tried several other strategies including a thumb guard, which was not successful at all as he would take it off during the night.</li>
            <li> You can take a bit of a cloth and dab at it while it&#x27;s drying to make the shine less noticeable if that&#x27;s a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one slight touch and your food is ruined.</li>
            <li> Literally everything our kid ate, came out in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Less than a month</li>
            <li> In less than a month we had ended the thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> but this product stopped his thumbed sucking in less than 4 days.  </li>
            <li> We Tried Mavala and she quit the habit in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> My nails are slightly longer because I have not been biting them anymore.</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of his dentist I ordered this product, skeptical that it would actually deter him enough to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> We had previously tried EVERYTHING else under the sun and had even used the $80 plastic thumb guards (they were returned for a refund).  </li>
            <li> My son stopped sucking his thumb  in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> It took less than  a week to get my son to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I tested it myself and the &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; seemed to stick to my lips and took almost half a day to go away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had this nervous habit of chewing my nails and it was starting to get ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I could literally bend the tip of my nail in half.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> She says when she puts her finger in her nose she&#x27;ll feel it burn ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li> My son is 3 and he could care less if this stuff is on his hands.  </li>
            <li> it took less than 48hours, and my daughter has no craving to stick her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Please try this product but a slight brush on ur nail and , u wud have hatred towards it.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews for the product and decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so foul that i become keen on my actions because any slight touch to the mouth with the polish,  would unleash the semen of demons.  </li>
            <li> Within a week I feel less inclined to put my fingers in my mouth, and my nails are longer and stronger than I ever remember them.</li>
            <li> Took my daughter less than a week of having this on her thumb to stop.</li>
            <li> This ended it in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> it helps half the time,maybe it washes off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, my last resort is to have the dentist put an appliance in his mouth that will cost me 500.00, after insurance, to hope it will work.  </li>
            <li> Based on previous comments</li>
            <li> I then decided to put it on half his finger...</li>
            <li> She was about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does, and now we&#x27;re back to fighting about cutting finger nails!</li>
            <li> After her last dentist appointment, we decided it was time to get serious about getting her to stop sucking her thumb before she ruined her mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can give it less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> In less than a week, she stopped.</li>
            <li> it was crazy bitter as promised, and it really helped my stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Mavala stop him from sucking his thumb in less then one week.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks for ten bucks stop reading my review and buy some.</li>
            <li> For me, the worst was at night he would suck them LOUDLY in his sleep and the sound became like nails on a chalkboard for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;3)If you have a small child (3 or under), start with a small amount and assess the affect before jumping in and painting the entire fingernail.</li>
            <li> it says not recommend for less than 3 years</li>
            <li> we previously used &amp;#34;thum&amp;#34; from the drugstore which is a joke, dont even bother getting it.</li>
            <li> I have been a stress induced nail biter since I was a child, but after putting this stuff on for less than a week, I had not temptation to bite my nails anymore.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would be much more terrible tasting than the last product I tried</li>
            <li> We typically apply it once per week</li>
            <li> Two stars for vile flavor, but it&#x27;s not quick drying.</li>
            <li> but after using this just for less than a week it worked like a charm...highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> We applied as directed every 2 days for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> - Hidden??)</li>
            <li> , I waited until she was two and a half</li>
            <li> One of my children stopped biting his nails in less than a week.</li>
            <li> It is difinitely not a quick fix or majic.  </li>
            <li> You do get *slightly</li>
            <li> It has been over a month and a half now</li>
            <li> He started using this product and less than one week he broke the habit.</li>
            <li> I previously tried others, but this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> This product causes a lot of discomfort and this discomfort was what helped me stop bitting my nails in less than a month.</li>
            <li> and she looked at me with her big serious eyes and said &amp;</li>
            <li> The literature that comes with the medicine says to reapply every two days, but I found I had to do it every day and a half</li>
            <li> It definitely has a strong, bitter flavor that is really terrible!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Mavala didn&#x27;t help with  this particular problem.</li>
            <li> I told her this special polish taste bad</li>
            <li> We wouldn&#x27;t have really been concerned had he only sucked his thumb at home, but he was doing it at school and as a consequence was getting sick quite often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chewed my nails down to nubs since I was little.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my child&#x27;s thumb and she slowed down on sucking the thumb for a little while.</li>
            <li> The second pacifier tasted the same and both boys discarded the pacifiers themselves, the following days when they asked about the pacifier I just reminded them that it tasted bad and they had trow in the garbage.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> Her teeth were a mess from sucking.</li>
            <li> At the end of the week, I used nail polish remover and soap and water to remove the residue, so there would be no more bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> The taste is NASTY (which is great for reminding you to stop) and it lingers for a while on your lips and tongue afterward for at least a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The taste definitely lingers and it is not a good one...</li>
            <li> If you are a grown woman like me and have been biting your nails to the point that they bleed - no one is going to notice that your clear polish is not a brilliant</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t mess with it at all or try sucking until nap time rolled around.</li>
            <li> and he will be cutting them for the first time that he could remember in his life.</li>
            <li> Fried chicken, egg rolls, crisp brocolli--all tasted like the chemical.</li>
            <li> Works well, but you have to apply it at least every other day or the bitter taste that deters nail biting wears off.</li>
            <li> I found that I accidentally put my fingers in my mouth for other things (flossing and accidentally when eating chips and stuff) which kind of sucked because you have to deal with the awful taste when you&#x27;re not even trying to bite you</li>
            <li> But my little guy couldn&#x27;t have cared less.</li>
            <li> Each week I put a little less on their thumbs and by  the end I was just applying one strip on each thumb.  </li>
            <li> Each week I put a little less on their thumbs and by  the end I was just applying one strip on each thumb.  </li>
            <li> Going to try painting on a little less, see how that</li>
            <li> Our dentist suggested a thumb guard, but we wanted something a little less obvious(her preschool teacher thought it would draw attention at school).</li>
            <li> We started talking about how thumbs start to taste bad when you get too big to suck, and that it&#x27;s a sign your body gives you that you should stop sucking, a rite of passage of growing older like baby teeth falling out.</li>
            <li> When we started trying this product I was expecting it to take a while for my 3-year old (who is a serious thumb sucker) to give up that habit.  </li>
            <li> Our son was a serious thumb sucker who had gotten where he basically sucked his thumb whenever he wasn&#x27;t busy playing.  </li>
            <li> I held her tight and looked at her and said, \\&quot;You know what though?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the habit had been so deeply routed, she couldn&#x27;t stop biting - even with other bitter nail products.  </li>
            <li> This skeptical mom believes in your product and I encourage other moms of thumb suckers to give this a try it really does work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier to get it over with quickly than to try to avoid it on your lips--which made them lose moisture and chap badly.</li>
            <li> the bitter taste make him stop the bad habit after the first application.</li>
            <li> A quick coat of this product stopped that and got me away from the bad habit again.</li>
            <li> At night time he fell asleep quickly without even \\&quot;testing\\&quot; if the fingers still tasted bad.</li>
            <li> , otherwise you accidently get the really disgusting taste of the product which kind of ruins the taste of the food.</li>
            <li> (the first time i bit into a chicken wing, it had this flavor for a few hours)</li>
            <li> The first time we tried this it immediately prevented him from putting his thumb in his mouth (it really does taste terrible, I tried some on my fingernail) -</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it could only be purchased online, but I received it really fast</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t freak out or cry, though bedtime was a little difficult for a couple of days while he learned new ways of soothing himself to sleep.</li>
            <li> I applied on both thumbs just in case he would try to put the other one in, the negative to this product is it does have a very bitter taste and</li>
            <li> After all of that, my child went right back to sucking her thumb the following day after the product wore off -- she was so exhausted after losing 5 hours of sleep, not to mention after such a horrible experience, she needed her thumb to comfort and self-soothe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And after washing dishes twice and washing my hands I don&#x27;t know how many times, yuck, still bad!  </li>
            <li> Since the taste was so bad he was very aware of his habit.</li>
            <li> The Mavala Stop is the only product that gets me to stop biting my nails because the unpleasant, bitter taste is just off putting enough.</li>
            <li> works a little too well</li>
            <li> My little one also started to get a bruised thumb.</li>
            <li> I would recommend just putting on a little dab instead.  </li>
            <li> : Ballerina Sue]] works, but try a little reward reinforcement as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply a little unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone wanting to rid their little one from the habit.</li>
            <li> I had little hope for this product, but after going through a bottle, I don&#x27;t bite my nails anymore at all.</li>
            <li> We apply the product every 2 days, and plan to taper it off when it&#x27;s been a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I also told a friend and she ordered it for her little girl</li>
            <li> so you have to scrub a little, then wash their hands</li>
            <li> Just a little of the product on the finger nails will deter anyone from sucking thumbs/fingers as well as biting nails.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase and try on my little girl.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because he is the kid who will eat anything with any flavor.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle stopped them all.</li>
            <li> so it is a miracle in little jar.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve heard people have had problems with their little ones getting to sleep without sucking their thumbs, but there was no fussing or disruption in her sleep schedule at all.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery about using this product since I had read some reviews about children throwing up when they got the taste in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> All with little effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we tried one other brand - thum - and it was no better than water.  </li>
            <li> she just needed a little help.</li>
            <li> a little bit of juice would help take away the taste.  </li>
            <li> The price of the taste is somewhat overkill when all I need to a little slap on the wrist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past, but they did not deter me.  </li>
            <li> this stuff works a little too well.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d gnaw his little fingers to the bone and chew the pads of his fingers as well.</li>
            <li> Child wanted to quit sucking her thumb but needed a little reminder.  </li>
            <li> It has saved my little girl from infections, scars, and who knows what else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken a little longer, but she is no longer a nail biter.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was convinced this was for my little guy.  </li>
            <li> My little boy sucked his fingers.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery of the ingredients in this</li>
            <li> My little girl stopped sucking her fingers immediately after using this.</li>
            <li> do think that the price, $12.00 a bottle ,is a little over priced.</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone who has little ones sucking their fingers or thumbs.  </li>
            <li> It did break my heart a little because he no longer wanted his lovey anymore.</li>
            <li> I had couple of &amp;#34;relapses&amp;#34; when I started biting a little bit.</li>
            <li> it helped my little 2 year stop putting her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little scared this stuff is toxic, but it is working for my child.  </li>
            <li> I was getting worried beacuse my little one had been sucking her thumb since 6 months</li>
            <li> When the kids ate with their fingers if it got on their food even a little their food would taste bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When the kids ate with their fingers if it got on their food even a little their food would taste bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Caused my little one to throw up when she put her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I have twins at home that I battled with on the finger sucking issue until I found this little gem.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, there were constantly times throughout the day when it wasn&#x27;t on or not potent enough</li>
            <li> I am thankful to Mavala and he will also be when he grows up not to have all his teeth and jaw out of shape due to excessive thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> The stuff is a little glossy</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical but hopefull about the results I would get with this product.  </li>
            <li> My son stopped thankfully and I am still working on my little girl.</li>
            <li> let her saw that I put a little stuff on her thumb</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t deter my little one from biting.</li>
            <li> but I guess it will take little longer to kick the habit.  </li>
            <li> Mavala has a terrible taste wich really helps destroy this habit since first day ...  </li>
            <li> Long story short, she hated the taste so much that I didn&#x27;t even have to paint it on again</li>
            <li> Not useful because of this !</li>
            <li> She fussed a little in frustration and cried a bit.  </li>
            <li> And then she threw up a little.  </li>
            <li> She also had a little blankie she would hold while she sucked her thumb.  </li>
            <li> This product helped my little girls stop sucking their thumbs and my oldest from bitting her nails.</li>
            <li> My little boy couldn&#x27;t stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products that didn&#x27;t work at all, but this stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Just a little drop will do.</li>
            <li> My friend little girl was adduced to suckin her thumb for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Once we put it on, just a little bit, he tasted it once and has not sucked his thumb since that day.</li>
            <li> We now have a little girl who doesnt bite her nails.</li>
            <li> so I think I lost a little weight using this product as well.</li>
            <li> I tried it with little expectation.</li>
            <li> I will definately be using this on her younger brother who is also a thumb sucker!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s child sucks there thumb!</li>
            <li> The taste lingers in your mouth far too long and its quite annoying, but it is definitely stopping me and that is the goal.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a little over a month and have officially stopped sucking my thumb after all these years.</li>
            <li> Mavala stop has my little girl on her way to stop sucking her thumb before I used this product my daughter was sucking her thumb every day now</li>
            <li> She commensed to inserting her little lifeline thumb</li>
            <li> This product got him to stop sucking his thumb in just a little over one month.  </li>
            <li> And I am not talking about a little nibble here</li>
            <li> We have tried a variety of techniques and another brand of polish that did little to stop the problem.  </li>
            <li> Because of the horrible, bitter, lingering taste of Mavala Stop, I gradually became aware of what I was doing and could consciously think about my actions.</li>
            <li> Between the two, I found the Mavala tasted the worst, but it also washed off way too easily, so that I had to apply multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> His teeth were starting to slightly push out and before the problem got worse my husband</li>
            <li> Both kids still looked visibly disgusted the next day when their fingers touched their lips, and I assume it was because the product is so strong.</li>
            <li> And this stuff will bind to the cap like superglue, making it very hard to open after a while.</li>
            <li> It certainly tastes terrible and it certainly discouraged me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> I think it would be safer for a young adult than a child though, as children tend to put anything in their mouth and I am not sure this might make them sick.</li>
            <li> The first morning when he woke up just told me his thumb taste bad then every other night when i put it on</li>
            <li> Kidding about vomiting, but the taste seriously lingers for a long time.  </li>
            <li> To counter the smell, I let the Mavala dry for a few minutes and then apply some natural, scented lotion to my hands so shaking hands during business meetings won&#x27;t be awkward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I was doubtful Mavala Stop would work, since we had read that it&#x27;s not successful with everyone, but I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it worked like a charm for us.</li>
            <li> The other two children didn&#x27;t like the nasty taste and had a sharp decrease temporarily in how often their thumbs were in their mouths, but then they habituated and were right back where they started.  </li>
            <li> I bite my nails all the time, like down to raw sometimes.  </li>
            <li> He woke that morning, slightly upset, and told me that I was right, his thumb did start to rot and taste bad.</li>
            <li> His habit was so bad that his teeth are pulled forward and crooked, and his thumb is flat and has a callus or some strange bump on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like the punishment is maybe a little too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I did reward them also every few days with a little prize for doing so well..</li>
            <li> I would just apply a little to the tips of my nails and cuticles every few days.  </li>
            <li> and he woke up twice crying and gagging a little</li>
            <li> but I would think even younger kids should be fine as one taste of it and the nasty taste stays in your mouth forever.  </li>
            <li> He was trying really hard to remember, but it&#x27;s just like second nature, so was really hard.  </li>
            <li> money down the drain!</li>
            <li> She started staying awake very late and thus, not being rested the next</li>
            <li> It has a bitter taste and will certainly remind someone to stop a bad habit of nail biting.</li>
            <li> It was total waste of my money !!!</li>
            <li> and I recommend buying a sucker for licks after your little one puts their thumb in their mouth to curb the bitter taste.  </li>
            <li> My daughter sucked right through it! :(</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a little bitter, but it isn&#x27;t awful.</li>
            <li> (ps:  those first few days were VERY, VERY hard to get through for our son-- hard to sleep, hard when he was awake, lots of willpower-- my heart broke for him!)  </li>
            <li> you have a hard core thumb sucker, this is definitely the product to cure them!</li>
            <li> She does tell me sometimes when she&#x27;s eating finger foods that it tastes bad because her finger medicine got on it, but it&#x27;s so worth not having her suck her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> tasted bad enough that both my 6 yr old and 4 yr</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING in its ability to be ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> The bad taste has definitely helped to deter myself from putting my fingers near my mouth.</li>
            <li> I would say though be careful with children because it will be REALLY bad if they put their whole nail in their mouths without realizing it.</li>
            <li> I would say though be careful with children because it will be REALLY bad if they put their whole nail in their mouths without realizing it.</li>
            <li> It absolutely drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> It is the worst, most bitter thing I have ever tasted.</li>
            <li> Just the most awful taste, so incredibly bitter.</li>
            <li> The next day, the same thing, so I removed the w/finger nail polish remover before bedtime, because he was showing signs of having a cold.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money and shipping was expensive.</li>
            <li> We both hate dealing with that huge flea collar and slathering this stuff on his paw has kept him from bothering it while he is hanging with the family.</li>
            <li> and before she could get cozy with her thumb</li>
            <li> I was ready for desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I painted my nails with Mavala Stop and, after it dried, decided I just HAD to know what it tasted like...</li>
            <li> when he was easting a messy food, it changed the taste of the food.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Our daughter used this on her finger at night and it helped her stop sucking her finger in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> until just a few weeks ago, before she turned 4.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and the pricey shipping cost.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no need to apply but every few days</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work on my 3 yr old.  </li>
            <li> So i got it within few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally broken my habit after 18 years of biting (GROSS!).</li>
            <li> Then every few days.</li>
            <li> and it stays on there for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few periods where I&#x27;ve stopped for a week or two, but eventually just start up</li>
            <li> Forget about eating anything messy with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget about eating anything messy with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with anything else.</li>
            <li> Daughter stopped sucking her fingers within a few days</li>
            <li> Around midnight that night, they came wailing into my room, crying, screaming, rolling around on the floor saying they were in agony--</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d only suck her thumb when she was tired or going to sleep.</li>
            <li> We only used it once as we thought the cure was worse than what she was doing.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN PUTTING IT ON EVERYDAY FOR 2 WEEKS NOW</li>
            <li> However, I must say that when I put it on my own thumb to see what it was like, I thought it tasted horrible</li>
            <li> She woke up at 3am coughing, crying, and eventually puking.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d hoped after a few years and matured taste buds that we&#x27;d try a nail product again.</li>
            <li> She sat in my lap, crying and saying, \\&quot;throw that yucky stuff away, Mommy, throw it away, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It took one time in his mouth and he was crying \\&quot;help</li>
            <li> However, there are a few cons regarding</li>
            <li> I continued to paint it on her nails for an entire month just to ensure she had broken the habit.  </li>
            <li> The second night, I painted a thin stripe.</li>
            <li> He asks me to put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> I confess, I could not take the crying, so we took it off (lots of nail brushing).</li>
            <li> The effect lasts for few hours</li>
            <li> dead asleep</li>
            <li> Now, its a routine to her to put on the nail polish everyday, but she acknowledge that she puts in on to keep her nails, \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; and to help her stop biting.  </li>
            <li> The picture attached shows the difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of hiding my embarrassing nails and ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> and I stopped using it after a few days.....</li>
            <li> Stopped using it after a few Weeks</li>
            <li> My daughter was gagging and crying.</li>
            <li> He tried to wash it off and there was a lot of crying.  </li>
            <li> I will amend this review after using the product for a few weeks, to let you know how it worked.  </li>
            <li> We began Mavala and the habit was broken, with no need for further Mavala, in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> He has been biting for a few months, she for probably a year.</li>
            <li> taste is so bitter and long lasting that it makes flossing or eating some finger foods very difficult.  </li>
            <li> It does destroy finger foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amen</li>
            <li> No thumb sucking today, but did some crying.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I chose this product to help my daughters get their digits out of their mouths.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son unfortunately would suck his thumb even if I wel</li>
            <li> I will try Mavala again in a few months mabe</li>
            <li> When she tried this product for a few days, she just stopped.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and she would ask to paint her nails everyday</li>
            <li> she started crying, since then she has not put her fingers in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Then I saw this Mavala stop for a few dollars so decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This was an all day everyday habit for him.</li>
            <li> He tasted it a few times and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> He did taste it a few times but after that it worked like a charm and he was done.</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;d agree to it and then cry for a few nights at bedtime until it wore off.  </li>
            <li> a few minutes after I applied the product.</li>
            <li> (it was terrible) but am glad now that the whole thumb sucking stage is behind us!</li>
            <li> I have always hated that I do it but have never been able to stop, it seems that I do it when I&#x27;m idle (during movies, class etc).</li>
            <li> For a few nights she would cry herself to sleep because she would try to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> We also tried it on my 3 year old who just couldn&#x27;t help himself at night and unfortunately he threw up from it.  </li>
            <li> All of it was a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to put it on everyday to keep my daughter from biting her nails.</li>
            <li> you about it in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it rubs off into her food if she uses her fingers to eat which is irritating when your trying to get your kids to like their food.</li>
            <li> tip, don&#x27;t give them finger food within a few hours of painting it on their nails.</li>
            <li> If you licked a nail painted with Mavala Stop, it would take a few minutes to get the taste out.</li>
            <li> and she got a dose, accompanied by some crying.  </li>
            <li> We put it on for a few weeks just to reinforce things and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I want to recommend a few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff stopped a 3-year thumb sucking habit dead in it&#x27;s tracks.</li>
            <li> After it dried, he stuck his thumb in his mouth and immediately pulled it out with a yelp.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is not available at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t applied the product for a week now and just a few days ago</li>
            <li> We still put it on every few days, just to remind her.  </li>
            <li> and I cook everyday.  </li>
            <li> We applied it to both of our daughters thumbs and within a few days she had stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and used it for about a month on my nails, applying every few days.</li>
            <li> I like that this product stays on a for a few days like a nail polish, and can&#x27;t be wiped off, as some enterprising kids will try to do.  </li>
            <li> Now, With me I wash my hands a lot so everyday</li>
            <li> so I bought this product a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep reapplying it every few days or so.</li>
            <li> My four year old was having a difficult time with sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I think I will try again but apply everyday this time.</li>
            <li> So, she wore gloves to bed for a few days.  </li>
            <li> decided to go without reapplying for a few days to see.  </li>
            <li> We tried it on our almost 3 yr old son and unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It would have saved me from a lot of self-consciousness and probably a few colds.</li>
            <li> in all, I couldn&#x27;t believe two habits improved within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I stopped applying it a few days ago and the biting habit hasn&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> in all, I couldn&#x27;t believe two habits improved within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I stopped applying it a few days ago and the biting habit hasn&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> A few days of Mavala Stop</li>
            <li> I have to reapply every few days</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It works during the day because of the bitter taste, but she sucks it off at night while she&#x27;s sleeping.  </li>
            <li> my daughter, she doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, so it hasn&#x27;t helped her.....</li>
            <li> He would mainly only suck his thumb when he was tired so that probably helped with the transition away from it.</li>
            <li> Still, 8 bucks wasted.</li>
            <li> and then would end up in our room crying for a drink of water</li>
            <li> I took her into the bathroom to brush teeth and gargle a few times.  </li>
            <li> I apply it every few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read those addicted to cigarettes have a similar issue, the \\&quot;hand-to-mouth\\&quot; movement.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not stop my 3 yr old daughter from biting her nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know in a few months...</li>
            <li> but when I start to fall off the wagon, (when I&#x27;m stressed out about something) a few applications of this, spaced every 3-4 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know in a few months...</li>
            <li> but when I start to fall off the wagon, (when I&#x27;m stressed out about something) a few applications of this, spaced every 3-4 days</li>
            <li> Since day 1 he has not sucked his thumb once however he did have trouble napping and falling asleep in the evening because that was how he soothed himself to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Since that episode,  she only tried a few times, but she is no longer a thumb sucker, nor do we ever see her try as of late.  </li>
            <li> May just continue applying for a few weeks, just in case.  </li>
            <li> Predictably, she wouldn&#x27;t stop licking and chewing at the incision.  </li>
            <li> a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Painted it just before bedtime at 8:30 and when we checked on her at 11:30, the thumb was firmly embedded in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> The taste no longer bothers him - so for our family, it was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I found Mavala Stop a few years ago on Amazon</li>
            <li> Our daughter is 6 and about to be seven in a few months.</li>
            <li> My friends borrowed it from me few times.</li>
            <li> The taste is horrendous and will linger in mouth for a few hours even after using mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb at all.  </li>
            <li> The stuff does taste incredibly nasty and it&#x27;s effective when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> a nail is missing.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stay up with painting my nails everyday.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a few friends and it worked for them.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a few hours though, she was sucking her fingers again.  </li>
            <li> I think he had grown tired of us constantly telling him to take his thumb out of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> A few times that day too out of habit, like</li>
            <li> and sadly, I have returned to my old habits.  </li>
            <li> Every few days I would redo both thumbs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ginger was 4, it worked but she came to the bedroom crying saying, \\&quot;someone poisoned my thumb\\</li>
            <li> Within a few days he quit the habit.  </li>
            <li> Well, it worked for a few days (and I put it on every day)</li>
            <li> Used this for a few weeks and it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; them.  </li>
            <li> She did wake up that night crying that it tasted \\&quot;disgusting\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> few things to note though</li>
            <li> I had to reapply everyday because he somehow managed to peel it off while he was at camp.</li>
            <li> No licking your fingers or you will be in trouble.  </li>
            <li> The taste is &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; and it stays on for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of the paci AND a thumb sucker (aged 4) in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> He just turned 6 and is autistic.</li>
            <li> This worked for a few weeks on my daughter who sucked her thumb at night.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Applied ur on my kid &#x27;s fingers for a few nights and he has stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> She was screaming and crying she wanted to suck her thumb and begging me to wash it off,  </li>
            <li> lots of spitting, crying, and</li>
            <li> she kept crying out, mommy, please take it off, i wont suck my thumb, i wont... believe me, it broke my heart, and twice i wanted to give in..</li>
            <li> and it took a few minutes to get the taste out of her mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bitter, and it stays on your fingers for at least three days.</li>
            <li> Use the mavala stop when you have nothing going on and can deal with your child&#x27;s irritability during the day, and some restless sleep -or even crying at night.  </li>
            <li> I decided not to wait until three and used it a few months before then - trying to avoid those preschool germs.  </li>
            <li> It might even save me a few thousand dollars in Ortho visits if I caught it in time for her teeth to correct (which they do sometimes).</li>
            <li> He stopped thumb sucking altogether for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Must reapply every few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but sometimes when i ate chips i accidently tasted the product on my finger nails and it killed the food&#x27;s taste.</li>
            <li> Now, we use it every few days or if we see her stick it in her mouth which is seldom.</li>
            <li> I used this for just a few weeks</li>
            <li> it also lasted a few days.</li>
            <li> It was CONSTANT, not just for self soothing, when he was tired, upset, etc</li>
            <li> I just forget to reapply after a few days.</li>
            <li> After a few months of reminding her to stop and her continuing to do so, I decided to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> My 8 1/2 year old son, who has sucked his thumbs since he was a baby has successfully broken the habit!</li>
            <li> Just after a few days using this product I stopped.</li>
            <li> They were ALWAYS in there, especially when she was tired.  </li>
            <li> Even if I have forgotten to put it on for a couple days, every time I go to put my fingers in my mouth, some kind of reverse Pavlov&#x27;s dog effect happens and I just remember how NASTY this stuff tastes and how it lingers in your mouth</li>
            <li> My girl likes to suck on her middle fingers, while my boy is addicted to sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Until it wore off after a few days</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter was motivated to break the thumb sucking habit, unfortunately her thumb went into her mouth reflexively all the time</li>
            <li> complete fail for us.  </li>
            <li> The habit is broken and I only put it on once a week just as a reminder</li>
            <li> She tasted it a few times and that was it.</li>
            <li> I finally got so annoyed I started looking for something to put on his finger.</li>
            <li> Even though it says every two days, with the way she kept putting her thumb in  her mouth, I ended up having to put it on a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> and when I went to visit for a few weeks I figured I would stop her habit.</li>
            <li> I put it on a few hours before bed</li>
            <li> He stopped biting his nails for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It works, but must apply it once everyday.</li>
            <li> I would almost say I wasted my money since I got it delivered, opened it, put it on my son&#x27;s hand one time, and never used it again...</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;d wake up crying.</li>
            <li> A few days after he tasted the Mavala Stop, he mentioned something about missing his thumb and wondered when he could suck it again.</li>
            <li> Within hours she was screaming and crying and gagging.  </li>
            <li> We tucked it in the closet and will try again in a few months.</li>
            <li> There was a few days where he exhibited noticable frustration at the inability to put his thumbs in his mouth</li>
            <li> I think after a few weeks of this I will no longer have the urge to bite my nails ever again.</li>
            <li> and I could taste and smell it a few hours after I had taken a chomp.</li>
            <li> However, I did have to reapply everyday instead of every 2 days.</li>
            <li> The taste is harsh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So give up finger foods for a few weeks while you fight the habit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> waste your time with anything else</li>
            <li> My kids are still sucking there finger to the point I put it on their fingers everyday and still they continued.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only respectful to at least try a product that is given to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply... disgusting.</li>
            <li> I prepped my daughter a few days in advance before using the product...</li>
            <li> However, after a few times, she began to bite her nails anyway.  </li>
            <li> She agreed that she would stop sucking her thumb when she turned 4, but two weeks after her 4th birthday she was still having trouble stopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had her put her thumb in her mouth to taste it after it dried.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else.</li>
            <li> and it dried, they put their fingers in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> they both started crying and vomited.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for our 2 year old daughter&#x27;s random thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I applied this to his nails a few times a week and by week 3 his nails looked as if he never bit them before.</li>
            <li> Everyday, night and all the time...</li>
            <li> Only took three applications and he was completely broken of the habit.</li>
            <li> but I see a few of my nails longer than ever before.</li>
            <li> This product will stop you from either mindless or intentional biting.  </li>
            <li> The first day she complained that it tasted horrible and begged me to take it off, her exact words were, &amp;</li>
            <li> Looks like my daughter is one of the few that this didn&#x27;t work on.</li>
            <li> I told my son a few days ahead of time what we would do with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About 2 hours into his sleep, I heard him really crying.  </li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail about a week ago, but as soon as i painted my daughters nail with this product, she ended up sucking her thumb as soon as it dried, the taste of the nail polish did not faze her at all.</li>
            <li> that was a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I am what they call a mindless nail biter.</li>
            <li> This took care of the problm in few uses.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it broke the habit and she has never sucked her thumb again.</li>
            <li> In fact the stuff from our local chemist we&#x27;ve tried before was worse.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after I applied Mavala Stop once he stopped sucking his thumb completely.</li>
            <li> I have an autistic child who was bent on mutilating her nails by biting them until the bled, became infected, and hurt.  </li>
            <li> she did not suck her thumb for few days..</li>
            <li> 5:30am, I heard crying coming from her room.</li>
            <li> It may seem harsh</li>
            <li> It worked for a few weeks, than my daughter got used to the taste.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a few days before having to reapply.</li>
            <li> I did not tell her I was going to use this product I used it after she had fallen a sleep and applied a thin coating the next day</li>
            <li> A few hours after we put her to bed, she was sucking, and she woke up sucking.  </li>
            <li> So we&#x27;ve stopped putting it on him and will try again in a few months.  </li>
            <li> but I honestly didn&#x27;t want him to associate me with this horrible tasting stuff!</li>
            <li> She sucked when tired, when watching tv, walking through the house, constantly.</li>
            <li> She had a moment where she cried in my arms and said, \\&quot;mommy, I just want to suck my thumb!\\&quot; crying and crying.  </li>
            <li> so I can wane off it, and I so far have failed.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work , he gave up for few hours</li>
            <li> It is a flavor that is extremely difficult to unconsciously (or consciously) chew through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It work when it&#x27;s on there, I just have to apply another coat after a few days go by.</li>
            <li> It applies like nail polish and lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this to a few friends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After years of trying to do it myself, a few weeks of wearing this and it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the risk, I am not sure what&#x27;s made off because the ingredients are not listed on the container.</li>
            <li> My toddler stopped sucking on her fingers within a few days.</li>
            <li> He would wake up every hour complaining about the taste and crying.</li>
            <li> Paint on like polish and lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> I had tried a few products that I had heard worked for others - Thum, Bite It, and Barielle.</li>
            <li> it worked for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Child became used to deterrent and then the application was increased to everyday.</li>
            <li> My son stopped sucking his thumbs after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks of use every few days</li>
            <li> some times i forget and lick my fingers if im eating messy food</li>
            <li> He agrees that it tastes awful, but it wears off so fast that it hasn&#x27;t really stopped him.</li>
            <li> He hated the taste but it wasn&#x27;t harsh on him or anything, we just made sure we keep water with us in case he forgot and put his shirt in his mouth.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t completely broken the habit but we are seeing definite improvement, may even need to clip a few of his nails</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product it did not work for my  5 1/2 yr old daughter (thumb sucker)  </li>
            <li> people say this approach is cruel, but she really didn&#x27;t seem to suffer much, and it was probably way easier for her than having to listen to us nagging her for months about quitting.</li>
            <li> few months later, my daughter finger sucking got progressively worse.</li>
            <li> It is definitely unpleasant and bitter, and the taste is very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> A three year habit killed in less than a week!</li>
            <li> (the crying I think was due to the fact that he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb so he was having a hard time sleeping)</li>
            <li> Throughout my life I tried several different things to break the patterns, including other brands of paint-on stuff that tastes bad.</li>
            <li> and I mean bitter.  </li>
            <li> The taste was so bad that she stopped sucking right away</li>
            <li> My pediatrician recommended Mavala, and he was exactly right about it ending that bad habit.</li>
            <li> The first two nights were a little rough - she tried sucking her thumb and hated to bitter taste, so she kept begging for us to take it off</li>
            <li> Not able to use it since my child is less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Her pediatric dentist recommended this product and she stopped sucking her thumb all together in less than a month!  </li>
            <li> biting is getting less and less.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li> He stopped sucking his thumb in less then a week!</li>
            <li> Then I found this product and she stopped after about a day and a half!</li>
            <li> My son cave get past his fingers entering his mouth, much less bite his nails.  </li>
            <li> I typically put this on her before she went to bed at night, and usually had to reapply within two or three days.</li>
            <li> in less than 1 weeks time, my nails have improved beyond belief!  </li>
            <li> and now my daughter spends less time with her hands in her mouth!</li>
            <li> Less then a week my daughter stopped sucking her finger!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb because after several years of failed attempts of trying other tactics, nothing else worked.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty nasty stuff, but a three year old can conquer it!</li>
            <li> It forced him to acknowledge his subconscious habits, and the bitter taste was unpleasant enough to deter him from idly biting his nails.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews talked about it making their food taste bad, he has not complained of that, though he won&#x27;t like his fingers!</li>
            <li> The first night he woke up a few times crying because it tasted so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nail bite products that also were not effective.  </li>
            <li> I need to remember to put it on his nails at least every other day or he will take a nibble here and there.</li>
            <li> She was an extreme thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> You need to put it on at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews and would like to recommend it to anyone who has a thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> We need to apply it at least every other day but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> From other reviews, I was heavy-hearted about trying this, expecting her to vomit, gag, or develop negative food associations.  </li>
            <li> The biggest complaint is if eating a sandwich of other &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; type food, you end up tasting this when not even biting the nail.</li>
            <li> Must be applied at least every other day.</li>
            <li> The product does taste horrible but it doesnt last long, maybe a day depends on how much you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> And with the other product, whose thick coat never wore off until it chipped, that made me want to pick at it which was counterproductive.  </li>
            <li> my son (17 months) has (had) a very bad thumb sucking habit and we wanted to stop it before it goes on till hes much older, and probably ruin the natural dentistry of his teeth.</li>
            <li> Apparently the taste was so bad, he started gagging and ultimately vomited.  </li>
            <li> but they were not strong enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first tasted it, I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad and was worried my money had been wasted.</li>
            <li> The first few days he did notice a bad taste on his food</li>
            <li> On the downside, everything you touch with your bare hands becomes extremely bitter so I now have to eat things like a sandwich or chicken with gloves.</li>
            <li> At first, you&#x27;ll realize just how involuntary that action is, and eventually you&#x27;ll stop doing it because of the horrible taste.  </li>
            <li> Hello,  I&#x27;m an adult that had been trying to stop biting my nails cold turkey, with no success.</li>
            <li> it is a strong bitter soapy taste in conjunction with that horrible taste in your mouth after licking a few dozen envelopes.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4, and as active as she is it tends to rub off if not applied at least 2 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Later she slowly started to suck even after applying which  is not good.</li>
            <li> A week later we&#x27;ve stopped using it and the habit is broken, no more sucking.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s annoying, makes eating finger food (like potato chips, crisps, whatever you want to call them) not very much fun, but the results are worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is very strong and the taste is horrible.  </li>
            <li> The taste is awful and doesn&#x27;t come off your lips very easily.  </li>
            <li> the only down point about Mavala is that as a guy, in the Army, Shiny nails are not greatly approved of!  </li>
            <li> We are going to wait a little while before trying it again and in the meantime do the usual things to help him to stop.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products in the past that didn&#x27;t work and to my surprise this product delivers!  </li>
            <li> Be creative and give this product a try, you won&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> My daughter was a MAJOR thumbsucker - and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> mean to use this stuff, but we couldn&#x27;t solve the problem any other way</li>
            <li> the super annoying - two finger pump-sucker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabbie was 5, a serious two finger sucker, constantly, Some Malava at night</li>
            <li> so I can go and fight the real evil in this world, with all 10 fingers intact, and I like my skin again, which feels baby-soft and new and ready to shake hands again without the shame of war-torn fingers and</li>
            <li> I told him that as little boys get to be big boys, their thumbs would start to taste bad, and that is why big boys don&#x27;t suck their thumbs.</li>
            <li> And the worst part about it is that it lingers in your mouth for 30-60 seconds, and to me, that made me more or less think about my actions and not do it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue with this product is that if you go, say, for a month without using it, it becomes impossible to open.</li>
            <li> If you subconsciously try to bite your nails, you&#x27;ll get a quick, disgusting reminder to stop.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like nail polish, put a thin coat on the nail (as well as the surrounding skin), when you try and bite your nail, a really disgusting taste will STAY in your mouth, you&#x27;ll want to wash it out with gasoline or old milk... hard to describe the taste, it&#x27;s how I&#x27;d imagine french kissing the Queen of England would taste</li>
            <li> but it was pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> I warned her that if she put her fingers in her mouth that she was going to make a funny face because it will taste so bad.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how to describe exactly how badly that tasted.</li>
            <li> Be consistent, have the discipline to apply it every day, and correct yourself when you catch your bad behaviors.</li>
            <li> Be consistent, have the discipline to apply it every day, and correct yourself when you catch your bad behaviors.</li>
            <li> the first day at dinner while eating macaroni my son used his fingers and got the bad taste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the taste was so bad the first night I put it on my son he started to gag.</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The taste is pretty bad</li>
            <li> I applied it to my finger and it did taste that bad when it first arrived</li>
            <li> The taste is unpleasant, but not so much that I would call it child abuse by any means.  </li>
            <li> The first night was painful</li>
            <li> She hated it so much that we only used it a few times and mentioning it would stop her.  </li>
            <li> I personally feel that reapplying everyday is necessary if you have a really bad nail-biting habit like I did.  </li>
            <li> I was about ready to try one of those very expensive finger and thumb guards when my friend mentioned this product.</li>
            <li> the taste is totally awful ( confirmed by me, our inconsolably crying 5 y.o nail-biter and his over curious 11 y.o cousin who tried it &#x27;for sport).</li>
            <li> For years I was never able to cut her nails because she kept on biting them, after a few days of the application  </li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking!!Within a few days he was done with the thumb.</li>
            <li> However, unfortunately, it would appear that I&#x27;m not just a nail &amp;#34;biter&amp;#34; - apparently now that I&#x27;ve stopped biting my nails, and they&#x27;ve grown...</li>
            <li> I have put it on once in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have put it on once in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> A life long habit broken.</li>
            <li> It is just terrible enough to make my subconscious terrified of letting my hands anywhere near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even slow her down.  </li>
            <li> We could not believe that it didn&#x27;t help him to stop or even slow down.</li>
            <li> I did feel a little bad as he was spitting for about 10 minutes straight and told me the taste was yucky.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I had heard of others who used a similar product who told me this did not work for them.</li>
            <li> First few nights she woke up crying because of the nasty taste, and now, a week later she is finger sucking</li>
            <li> advice for success with this product: Just remember that any bad habit dies hard.</li>
            <li> the taste sucks, it is hard to remember to apply, just not reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used nail polish remover, just like the instruction booklet says, but it was not very effective.</li>
            <li> she just makes her skin raw and her thumb looks like its going to bleed.</li>
            <li> He had sucked them to the point of being literally raw and blistering.</li>
            <li> Because it hasn&#x27;t gotten raw or blistered again, we&#x27;ve let it be.</li>
            <li> If it does get raw again we may try the Mavala again since we still have the bottle, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her fingers were nearly raw and it seemed as if they would never lose the pruned looked one gets when they&#x27;ve been in the water too</li>
            <li> My son had been biting his nails for years to the point that all the skin around his fingers was raw.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always sucking her thump to the point of making it raw.</li>
            <li> My dog licked his front paws raw.  </li>
            <li> For the next several nights, we simply sat down with her and put the Mavala on her fingernails, let her know that this was the nasty tasting stuff, and she hasn&#x27;t put her fingers in her mouth again!  </li>
            <li> One was absolutely terrified, and said that its the worst thing he ever tried, the other one said the same think like me.</li>
            <li> , that was really tormenting her with a nasty tasting substance that mad her stop her favorite crutch.</li>
            <li> Shortly after my very first application, my mind wandered and I made the horrible mistake of putting my finger into my mouth to bite my nail as per usual.</li>
            <li> his finger nails are starting to turn very dark color, and it&#x27;s useless me telling him to stop biting, he just runs away laughing at me...</li>
            <li> of caution, be careful of using this product on the pads of the fingers as the taste will transfer to foods eaten with hands, learned this the hard way!</li>
            <li> I used I used on the pacifier, a drop, and told my boys just over 2 at the time that pacifiers taste bad for big boys and asked them if they wanted to trow it on the garbage, both boys asked for a different pacifier which they got.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that after the 3rd day, the bad taste went away.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s bad enough that it&#x27;ll make your subconscious stop biting your nails!</li>
            <li> He finally even says he lost the urge, since the bad taste actually makes him NOT want to suck his thumb anymore!  </li>
            <li> But being in my mid-20s now, I decided enough was enough and to kill this bad habit once and for all.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if you could make something similar that didn&#x27;t taste quite as bad and have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of how bad my nail biting is, two months ago I only had about 5 1/2 nails out of ten.  </li>
            <li> It took a few nights for him to get adjusted to falling asleep without sucking his thumb, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 and his nail biting got so bad and subconscious that there wasn&#x27;t a second that went by where his hands weren&#x27;t in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> Personally, the taste is bad enough that I don&#x27;t think I would have applied this product to a child that was under 2.5 or 3.  </li>
            <li> The second week I would put my hand up to bite but instantly remember that my nails taste bad before doing so.</li>
            <li> After a few applications and several distasteful experiences, she quit biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to re-apply it every couple of days because it looses some of its awful taste after a few washes.  </li>
            <li> When she put her thumb in her mouth a few minutes later it was obviously distasteful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong nail-biting habit broken in a few weeks with this product.</li>
            <li> So far it has really helped me not bite my nails because of the terrible taste.</li>
            <li> each day she complained less.</li>
            <li> After I inserted them, I noticed a steady stream of bitter, awful nauseating death-taste in the back of my throat.</li>
            <li> She hated the strong taste and even odor.  </li>
            <li> Super annoying.  </li>
            <li> This may work on your little ones, but not mine!</li>
            <li> But, my little one has stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> It worked from day two...day one, she tried to suck her thumb but gagged a little and wanted to drink some water to get the taste out!  </li>
            <li> It took us a little over a week of using Mavala 2 time a day and her habit is gone!  </li>
            <li> It works to help your little one stop biting nails, but I just wish it lasted longer!</li>
            <li> and he knew that if he accidently got the yucky taste in his mouth one little mint would fix it!</li>
            <li> I was beside myself with anxiety over how to stop my little one from thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> your little one&#x27;s sucking their thumbs!</li>
            <li> and I was afraid this would also not work, but by the end of the week she had completely stopped sucking her fingers!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews describing vomiting and extensive crying caused by the terrible taste, so I used as little as I could on my son&#x27;s thumb nail - very close to the cuticle so that he wouldn&#x27;t lick it off when holding finger foods.</li>
            <li> it has been 5 days since my first application which i reapply everyday to keep the taste as disgusting as possible.  </li>
            <li> We have had scraped knees, 2 new teeth, and a small cold WITH NO THUMB SUCKING.  </li>
            <li> I am going to continue putting it on his nails and just hope he finally gets sick of it sooner or later.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a tiny bit on my hands that I washed right away but still made my food taste horrible.  </li>
            <li> but when she very badly wanted to &amp; during nights, she could easily remove it &amp; start sucking, so that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> This product sure doesn&#x27;t taste like it smells, there is no strong smell, but the taste is just awful.</li>
            <li> I accidentally put a very little amount(more like a little dot!)</li>
            <li> It is really hard to eat with your fingers, and if you have it on while in the shower, the taste will get in your mouth a little.</li>
            <li> And he kept waking up in the night because he would go to suck his thumb like he always does, but the next day he only had a few \\&quot;nasty tastes\\&quot; and by the 3rd day, in time for school he was not sucking his thumb!!!!  </li>
            <li> taste is so foreign and bad, you can&#x27;t help but bring it to your conscious level of thought and notify yourself that you were about to bite your nails.  </li>
            <li> This stuff certainly tastes bad, but she would still be sucking her fingers in the morning.  </li>
            <li> (there is a large ugly callus on her thumb and her thumbnail is layered and peeling).&lt;br /&gt;We are going to continue to use it for two weeks, as recommended by our daughter&#x27;s dentist.</li>
            <li> I did a taste test on it myself and while it&#x27;s not the most horrible taste I&#x27;ve had in my mouth, it was nasty enough to make me want use nail polish to remove it right away.</li>
            <li> Buying this $10 bottle of nail polish will definately save me money in dental bills down the line!!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since i was very little, and i thought i could never stop.</li>
            <li> I couldn’t eat or touch anything with my hands even when I used very little of the product.</li>
            <li> to note if put on too thick little bubbles can appear.</li>
            <li> It is extremely BITTER!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 8yo daughter, with 2 thumb suckers, i was desperate to find something for her to quit sucking her thumb, my son who is a year older has permanent damage to his mouth and had to have a mouth piece put in.</li>
            <li> I will also admit that she was crying so hard that I almost did stop treatment.</li>
            <li> Then, in a few seconds, it came on hard.  </li>
            <li> My nail biters hate it and that is exactly what I wanted to hear from my little ones.</li>
            <li> I really felt bad.</li>
            <li> It really works the taste is so bad my kids don&#x27;t even think getting their fingers close to their mouth.</li>
            <li> I just told him his body will be getting ready to help him with his efforts in stopping this behavior by making his thumb taste bad.</li>
            <li> And it really does taste bad ...</li>
            <li> Just have a drink ready and the bad taste will eventually dissipate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve asked my daughter if she wants to see how bad mommy&#x27;s thumb tastes</li>
            <li> I know, because I put it on one of my nails just to see how bad it really was.  </li>
            <li> and I had a bad taste the whole night.</li>
            <li> Saving in case someone else obtains a bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give this stuff a try, it really works.</li>
            <li> Others we tried had to be applied several times per day which led to inconsistent negative response when biting, or didn&#x27;t taste bad enough.  </li>
            <li> This product is a nail polish type which is brushed on once a day and has a bitter, unpleasant taste but not harmful.</li>
            <li> Thum doesn&#x27;t last long at all - and it doesn&#x27;t even taste that bad.  </li>
            <li> I have covered my fingernails with band-aids, applied small hairbands around the tips of each finger, employed the rubber-band on the wrist technique, and even underwent psychotherapy for the issue.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied it every night for 3-4 days and she has not put her hand nor a finger in her mouth for the past month.</li>
            <li> I put Mavala on again that morning since she sucks her thumb all day and again after a few licks the taste was gone for her.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep on for any period of time, so we are constantly reapplying it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of the small size of the bottle compared to the price, but the bottle lasts months- we only had to buy one.  </li>
            <li> We painted a small amount on the tips of his fingernails every day and that did the trick.  </li>
            <li> It has now been 3 months since we bought the Mavala Stop, and he has not been biting for the past 2+ months.  </li>
            <li> None worked but this was a charm, after two weeks of applying it no more thumb sucking, I am ecstatic.</li>
            <li> Not sure what we are going to do...</li>
            <li> continue to apply the product to my daughter&#x27;s fingers for about a week when I started noticing that my daughter&#x27;s finger started showing redness and became harden with small bumps.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> We just put a small dab on each of her thumbs.  </li>
            <li> This product worked for a few days then my son must have gotten used to it because he continued to suck his thumb..even after twice a day applications!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle is fragile.  </li>
            <li> After a week, no more thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her finger to fall asleep, when she was bored, when she watched tv, and in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days, they are over their habit!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of any product for eliminating thumbsucking, especially when I was seeing thumb apparatus for stopping it.</li>
            <li> The cost of some are unbelievable (over $100)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews that say this does not work were usually for children under 2.  </li>
            <li> In 3 days, no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Its been a terribly compulsive habit that I was sure I could never break.</li>
            <li> I saw a piece I wanted to bite and thought, &amp;#34;one small bite can&#x27;t be but</li>
            <li> (sorry bout the grammar and spelling and such heeehee)</li>
            <li> The first week she tried taking her thumb to her mouth several times but when she realized the nasty stuff wasn&#x27;t coming off, she decided she might as well quit trying!</li>
            <li> Now I got a grip on reality, and can face my fears head on, no procrastination from nail biting or the ruminations of my childhood past.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this would work</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve got a determined thumb sucker this product might just be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> friend sent me this product as we were desperate to have our 5 year old stop sucking his fingers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WHich she usually needed about 6 am to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> My daughter has wanted to stop for the last year, but everything else failed (sock on the hand, thumbguard, band-aids, rewards, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> but it is a small price to pay to have un-bitten nails again.</li>
            <li> We were not sure what to do, and after reading the reviews we bought this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bite my nails, but I do occasionally put my nails in my mouth when I am bored or just sitting around</li>
            <li> My six year old quit cold turkey.  </li>
            <li> which is exactly what I want, because it has helped me grow out my fingernails like crazy!</li>
            <li> and he is no more doing that</li>
            <li> Before the Mavala had even dried, she was licking her fingers like they were popsicles!</li>
            <li> I usually remove it and reapply it every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> After that, no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> The kids walked around with a disgusted look on there face most of the time and there was spitting/drooling to deal</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nasty for sure.  </li>
            <li> It last for a couple of days, and sometimes I tasted it randomly, like if it accidentally touched the food I was eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure anything will work.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else I can do.  </li>
            <li> If you pick at your cheese with your painted nails it will taste horrible as well!  : )</li>
            <li> did not stop my small child from sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> It only took two weeks and the habits were broken!  </li>
            <li> We painted this on my almost 3 year old daughter and she stopped sucking her thumb cold turkey.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how many times my fingers were in my mouth until this nasty stuff was on.  </li>
            <li> However, I was desperate to get my 2 yr old to stop chewing his toe nails.  </li>
            <li> so no more BBQ.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fully confident that she is now done with the disgusting habit.  </li>
            <li> only reason you would fail with this product is if you can&#x27;t bring yourself to enforce it.</li>
            <li> only reason you would fail with this product is if you can&#x27;t bring yourself to enforce it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible it just didn&#x27;t work for us, but it was useless.</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> Stick with it--don&#x27;t skip a day because you&#x27;re tired of tasting bitter nail</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was actually a bit heartbreaking to see her so sad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and for the past few days I haven&#x27;t seen the thumb in his mouth!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a nail biter, cuticle chewer or have a thumb-sucking child past thumb-sucking age, this is the cure for you.</li>
            <li> I found two devices which are placed over the hand/thumb, and was having such a difficult time trying to choose one that I never got around to ordering either of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it worked, or if my daughter was just too traumatized to put her thumb in her mouth after that, but she didn&#x27;t gag or throw up again.</li>
            <li> It is very nasty and fowl tasting and will probably work for most, just not my stubborn child.</li>
            <li> For the past two months i have not bitten(i dare not)</li>
            <li> Most finger foods aren&#x27;t a problem but licking your fingers is terrible.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been putting Mavala Stop on both thumbs for two weeks now (just in case he decided to switch thumbs), and the habit is almost a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> A habit supposedly takes 21 days to break, but we didnt even make it past 4.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure I would pick this again although, not really sure there is another alternative.</li>
            <li> She hates the taste so it has been working for the past couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> she stopped within a few days!</li>
            <li> As suggested, we started with a small application on just the thumb area.</li>
            <li> I ordered and anxiously awaited its arrival.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am not sure it was the product itself that caused the change or just the idea of something being placed on the finger that would help the child not suck his thumb.  </li>
            <li> For guys, this can be a small issue.</li>
            <li> No tears, no vomit like some had reported, and no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> it was expensive and I would get it as a last resort.  </li>
            <li> During the night it is usually out.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 3 stars but only if everything else has failed</li>
            <li> While safe, it taste horrible and after five years of thumb sucking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever had a set of nails that hasn&#x27;t been an embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That way, she knows no better and does not put up a fight if she realized the root of the taste deterrent.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what it&#x27;s going to take to get him to stop sucking on his fingers.</li>
            <li> Although she may have actually stopped the first night (the taste is awful).</li>
            <li> We had tried Thum in the past.</li>
            <li> That advice was pointless before he was 20 months - but then seemed to be making progress.</li>
            <li> The first night of use be prepared to help them get the nasty taste out of their mouths so they can get back to bed.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has stopped me cold from putting my fingers anywhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li> And no more nail biting!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I keep using this stuff, I surely will break my awful nail biting habit in no time.</li>
            <li> , she doesn&#x27;t usually do it if we are out at stores or at the park.  </li>
            <li> , it is just a nasty nailpolish - which is OK for</li>
            <li> Usually, when I&#x27;m editing my writing on the computer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure that made sense but for those of you that have tasted</li>
            <li> the youngest can somehow get past it yet and suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li> but it loses potency after a few months.</li>
            <li> I would offer him a small drink after he tried and remind him to not do it.</li>
            <li> Day time finger sucking is a thing of the past now</li>
            <li> Another few weeks of Malava, and viola!</li>
            <li> no more sucking, never again</li>
            <li> The nasty flavor lasted more than a day and didn&#x27;t wash off.  </li>
            <li> In the past we just tried the mittens and she would pull her thumbs out before falling asleep and end up still sucking all night.  </li>
            <li> I did and this stuff tastes awful and took quite a while to get it off even after many washings.</li>
            <li> not sure how she can stand the taste</li>
            <li> All in all, a small price to pay for the end result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more er uh ...</li>
            <li> No more finger sucking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what started the problem but warnigs etc...</li>
            <li> and he was afraid to put his hand near his mouth.  </li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking during the day.</li>
            <li> We have tried different hot and nasty tasting things on her thumb that she would just wipe off, we tried bandaids that she would take off and we tried reminders, treats etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why she started doing it</li>
            <li> And her thumbs no more flatten.</li>
            <li> By day 3, no more thumb sucking or thumbsucking attempts (Not even as he slept).  </li>
            <li> Started as an anxious nervous habit.</li>
            <li> This provides the nasty taste when you actually bite your nails, but the extra layer of regular polish prevents finger foods or a brush of a nail across your lips from causing spasms of revulsion.</li>
            <li> No more nail biting.</li>
            <li> In just a few days I could tell there was a change!  </li>
            <li> I placed a small amount on my thumb, and then after about 5 seconds used a towel to try to wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> It makes most things that you eat with your hands taste terrible as well.</li>
            <li> I thought my only hope was to buy the thumbguard, but that is expensive</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I freaked out, and instantly started searching for something to help stop the thumb sucking once and for all.</li>
            <li> not sure how it will go over at mealtime.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s disgusting, but like so many kids some of them are also nose pickers.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for this because of past reviews</li>
            <li> No more knots in her hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then he would just move it past his cheek.  </li>
            <li> I tried And ill try again at a later time.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve started again, and I can&#x27;t get past that this will transfer to any food you might touch with your nail.</li>
            <li> We started with a small dot on each thumb and gradually increased it to a small swipe.</li>
            <li> No more nail biting, no hands in mouth...</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s gotten past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> No more nail biting for the time it was on the nails....need to buy it again.</li>
            <li> It took him one time to taste Mavala - and voila, no more sucking.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time with anything else!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this because I thought it would be cruel but after trying so many things, just decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> So, not sure if it will work well for everybody</li>
            <li> Then she trudged past the taste and kept sucking her fingers.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to help stop biting nails, but only if you can stick with it, which I was unable to do.</li>
            <li> No more nail biting in this house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I see him biting his nails, that usually means that I forgot to reapply it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The usual blackness of one of his claws was GONE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails my entire life and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> These were the only glance of hope we had that this formula would work in our favor, unfortunately</li>
            <li> and then she just seemed to get used to it :/</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve a 6.5 yr old daughter &amp; we&#x27;ve been trying desperately to stop her from sucking thumb.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it the past two weeks because I&#x27;ve lost the urge to bite.</li>
            <li> No More brand</li>
            <li> tried anything else in the past for this</li>
            <li> So I would not recommend this for infant and small children sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well this product works.</li>
            <li> It was the most horrible tasting polish I could ever imagine!</li>
            <li> Now that he doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb his tantrums seem to be bigger, and last a lot longer. :(</li>
            <li> 2 Weeks, no more thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading all the reviews (mostly describing how awful it tasted but that it worked).  </li>
            <li> it is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> It took about 4 weeks for me, and I  usually have to use it during finals week and things like that, so</li>
            <li> I tried eating the 6-year old&#x27;s leftover fried chicken (which he eats with his hands) while this stuff was on his nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to working well, this small bottle might as well be a lifetime supply.  </li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> Works for my 8 year old who likes to put his hands in his mouth and drives me crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I usually paint my daughters nails for play and girl time.</li>
            <li> Nasty taste for sure though.</li>
            <li> The box was wrapped carefully, but the inside bottle is broken.</li>
            <li> may like the bitterness of product.&amp;#34;  As I assume there are not many adults that suck their thumb, this product should probably just be for nail biting and not thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> No more cons.  </li>
            <li> But it does taste awful!  :)</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is, use it just like I did the others.</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t even sad since we had the &amp;#34;you&#x27;re a big boy now&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it is so disgusting and such a pain, you need to be devoted to personal change in order to force yourself to reapply it daily.  </li>
            <li> My daughter no longer had nails, she would bite them everyday!</li>
            <li> I have not bitten my nails or cuticles in the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no more thumb in our house.  </li>
            <li> If you even brush your fingers past your lips you can taste this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a VERY bitter!!!  </li>
            <li> My oldest actually vomitted as he has a very weak palate and does not like anything that has any taste, his diet is very plain.</li>
            <li> Within a few applications it did the trick, no more thumb sucking!  </li>
            <li> I have tried showing her pictures of infected nails, and telling her how sick she can get from continuing to bite, but that didn&#x27;t really work for her.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to be careful eating finger foods while using this product and my wife says, DO NOT floss after application--sticking your whole hand in your mouth leads to bad results!</li>
            <li> It has a very dull bitter like taste and will stay on the hand for at least a couple of days</li>
            <li> It was a tough day with several meltdowns and crying but it worked!!!</li>
            <li> She has gone 2 months with very few slip ups.</li>
            <li> so I feel that the three-star review was probably very harsh.  </li>
            <li> It was usually only at night or when she was very tired she would suck her thumb, so</li>
            <li> It works well for nail biting and defn has a TERRIBLE bitter taste but the only problem I have with this product is that you MUST reapply it daily, if you wash your hands a lot everyday, it tends to come off,</li>
            <li> She was very impatient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in the zillion positive reviews.</li>
            <li> You apply it like nail polish every other day until the habit is broken.  </li>
            <li> so considering the other reviews I have to question how it was stored/ if for some reason the effectiveness was decreased?</li>
            <li> It stays on longer and taste worse than other drops.</li>
            <li> He then tried the other; he was not happy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to love a product that tastes so nasty.</li>
            <li> Like other people said, it can make fingerfood mildly unpleasant, but the taste from eating fingerfood is nowhere near as unpleasant as actually biting into the stuff.</li>
            <li> It got so bad that his fingers would be pink, cracked, wrinkled, and swollen with several warts.  </li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t flavored bad but works on your taste buds in such a way that activates all your bitter tasting ability.</li>
            <li> I got this 4 days ago and the bitter taste is literally so bad that its enough to keep me from biting.</li>
            <li> So we finally told that wet thumbs taste bad when they don&#x27;t want to be sucked anymore.  </li>
            <li> The main downside is that you have to eat and if you touch your food with this on then your food will taste bad too.</li>
            <li> This really worked and finally got me to stop biting my nails because of its awful taste.</li>
            <li> It worked great because she could understand that it would taste awful and was afraid to put it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m really explaining it properly but whatever it was, it was disgusting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my six year old who had developed a terrible nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> The taste also lingers on your lips if you touch them (which is really disgusting while eating food), so be careful when you freshly apply the stuff.</li>
            <li> The taste also lingers on your lips if you touch them (which is really disgusting while eating food), so be careful when you freshly apply the stuff.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucks her thumb, and I am desperate to get her to stop.</li>
            <li> I put it on my son the next day, just on the 2 fingers he sucks, I told him it was medicine for his nails (which look ragged and thin because of all the sucking!)</li>
            <li> This stuff stays in your mouth and on your lips for at least 10 min after touching, and it is sufficiently disgusting.</li>
            <li> Since that awful experience he has also said to me several times, \\&quot;I really want to chew my nails now, but I&#x27;m not going to, because I know what will happen if I do.\\</li>
            <li> This absolutely tastes terrible and worked for a short time to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t bite from stress or anxiety -- it&#x27;s merely a habit when he&#x27;s bored or intensely focused.  </li>
            <li> and ofcourse a few minutes later ran to her bed and lay down saying she was sick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at appyling it to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had high hopes but eventually my daughter didn&#x27;t care that her nails tasted bad and still put her hand in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you practice the really bad habit of biting your nails...</li>
            <li> She never complained about her food tasting bad as others have talked about.</li>
            <li> And there is a disclaimer on the box that says that young children may have undeveloped taste buds and not find the taste unpleasant.</li>
            <li> As my wife and I later witnessed her post Mavala taste, I felt bad due to the look of disgust on her face.  </li>
            <li> Upon reading the reviews I was skeptical since my 4 year old had such a bad habit since she was born.  </li>
            <li> Unpleasant taste reminds my 12 yrs old when he is biting his nails.</li>
            <li> It would have been much nicer if it didn&#x27;t spread to food and it lasted longer... :(</li>
            <li> it took a day or two and hard-core finger sucker had no more interest in sucking her finger.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> Sorry for the long review</li>
            <li> but when he&#x27;s asleep he doesn&#x27;t even notice it and sucks his thumb as usual.</li>
            <li> When I was younger my parents tried all these nasty polishes and I just kept trying until the bitter taste finally subsided.</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed that I paid so much and now have this nail polish that didn&#x27;t solve my problem.</li>
            <li> and she sucks her thumb as usual.</li>
            <li> When the dentist told us that if she didn&#x27;t stop soon her jaw and teeth would be permanently malformed and recommended a dental device, we sought out another less expensive and less obstructive product.</li>
            <li> It tastes like garbage and broken down bicycles.</li>
            <li> Our little thumb sucker would not be refused!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It tastes terrible, like I imagine garden chemicals would taste, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.  </li>
            <li> Tastes strong and terrible.  </li>
            <li> The taste is disgusting and does not go away easily.  </li>
            <li> The polish does have a nasty taste to it, but it peels off too easily.</li>
            <li> I either contort my hands so my nails are hidden, or I find some way to put my hands behind my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having a very hard time trying to get my little 3 yr.</li>
            <li> old to stop sucking her thumps, and started to think that it was impossible.  </li>
            <li> I really hate it, super bad idea because everything you do with your hands got the nasty flavor  even when you eating,feeding your baby,making food that&#x27;s terrible,doing sex :p, etc</li>
            <li> my girlfriend kissing me and we taste a horrible taste in our mouths that can&#x27;t be so easily removed with water and soap.</li>
            <li> TWO, the taste is 2x worse than the previous product I used.</li>
            <li> I soon became aware as its a bitter, nasty taste you wont forget.</li>
            <li> It was an awful hour to calm him down but it worked.</li>
            <li> Oh, it does taste bad and prevents me completely from  biting my nails!  </li>
            <li> I tried other brands, but they didn&#x27;t stay on as long or taste as bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to break a habit when the source is permanently attached to you.  </li>
            <li> she rushed to the sink and spit, grabbed water and grabbed a hard candy to try and get rid of the taste.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t sucked their thumbs since, and they were hard core.  </li>
            <li> We worked hard on getting the taste out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t complain about the taste either, although I did warn him about it before he found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers stated that you shouldn&#x27;t use this if your kid eats with his/her fingers because they might get their finger in their mouth and you will have a hard time getting them to eat it again.</li>
            <li> We knew stopping this habit was going to be hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review after a while as I still find it hard to</li>
            <li> I was sure the horrible taste would wear out in a day or two, but it lasts for at least five days!  </li>
            <li> Just like any habit, though, it&#x27;s hard and you have to maintain your commitment to quitting.  </li>
            <li> their hard palate was changing b/c of it.  </li>
            <li> how hard we tried.  </li>
            <li> She sucked her thumb so hard that one of her front teeth was moving noticeably forward.</li>
            <li> It was a really hard habit for him to break.</li>
            <li> That is so hard for a mom to see.  </li>
            <li> The habit of sticking things in her mouth is a hard habit to break.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve realized that if your child has a dull pallet i.e.  likes to eat all sorts of veggies and stuff, then this will not work.  </li>
            <li> Plus my son who has a dull pallet loves, loves to suck his thumb.  </li>
            <li> The hard part is remembering to reapply.</li>
            <li> I find myself gnawing on my fingers whenever I am thinking hard on a problem or am stressed with a deadline.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to get a hold of too.</li>
            <li> She was ashamed, but habits are hard to break.</li>
            <li> Hard to floss</li>
            <li> The so called instruction sheet hardly has any details and</li>
            <li> We learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> it was hard to stop.</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t have to put hard wear in his mouth.</li>
            <li> My son had a hard time w taste</li>
            <li> Be warned... don&#x27;t eat ribs, I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Well, this disgusting stuff quickly brought it to my attention!</li>
            <li> The first day I painted it on my daughter&#x27;s nails she put them in her mouth and immediately started spitting due to the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to see him gag and</li>
            <li> I used it for 4 weeks and the bottle hardly looks touched.</li>
            <li> I also found another benefit; I have a conure that likes to give a hard bite when he doesn&#x27;t want to step-up, and sometimes he won&#x27;t let go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never was it stressful or hard.</li>
            <li> are hard to break.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It was hard for him to remember when watching tv or pre-nap.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is hard to believe that it works so well to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I suck on hard candy now when I need that sucking satisfaction.</li>
            <li> We tried really hard too.</li>
            <li> he got a sticker and after 3 weeks we took him out for a prize for accomplishing something that was really hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the taste since nothing I have ever tasted is like this.</li>
            <li> I put a little on both thumbs every nap &amp; night sleep time!!</li>
            <li> Mavala stop tastes very bitter and pretty awful and has some stayng power.</li>
            <li> I actually tasted it and it doesn&#x27;t burn their little mouths, it will just leave a bad taste in their mouths for a while.  </li>
            <li> She is 5.5 now and she sucks her thumb so hard her teeth are moving.</li>
            <li> The crying was a little difficult</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is a menace to nail biters, thumb suckers, and the poor sucker who accidentally gets a little too aggressive with their burrito.</li>
            <li> Even touching your lips is a bad, bad idea.  </li>
            <li> For any adult who is looking to stop their bad nail biting habit - this will work.</li>
            <li> the bad habit you&#x27;ve been conscious about for years will go away - almost instantaneously.  </li>
            <li> got this for my 3 year old who has a bad problem with sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> the taste is so bad, you develop a reflex when you absentmindedly put your fingers near your mouth.</li>
            <li> The taste gets on everything, and it gets so bad that if you bring your hand near your mouth, you can SMELL it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought this product for my 8 yr old son who had chewed his nails so bad and also chewed on the tips of his skin.</li>
            <li> My five year old had a bad habit of sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> My four year old was biting her nails so badly that she got infections and the ends of her fingers</li>
            <li> When my son was 3 years old, he sucked his thumbs so bad that they became infected.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s developed a bad habit of biting his nails and chewing the skin around his finger nails.</li>
            <li> I did try to use it on my 2½ year old who bites her nails, but she just kept putting her hands in her mouth to try to wipe the bad taste out and that ended up in a viscous cycle.  </li>
            <li> Well I was told by our dentist that this stuff would guarantee our 4 year old would stop sucking her thumb because this tasted so bad.</li>
            <li> an adult now studying to go into a law enforcement profession where bad nails can be a vector for infection and disease-transmission</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo bad tasting that it makes you conscious of what you&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son found Malava Stop repulsive and felt it made anything he ate by hand taste bad.</li>
            <li> I am truly relieved to have stopped these bad habits early on.</li>
            <li> My almost 3 year old was chewing his fingernails and toenails so badly that they would bleed.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son is a bad fingernail biter.</li>
            <li> and I think eventually the bad taste will remain in my mind that when my product is all finished I will not want to place my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> To me that is way to late to stop her from doing this.</li>
            <li> My friend&#x27;s 4-year-old was a bedtime sucker.  </li>
            <li> So I see this taking at least a month of applying the product every night, but I also am seeing results on the nights that we use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my thumb sucker (9 yr.</li>
            <li> My husband kept telling me that we had to stop him for at least a month to break the habit.  </li>
            <li> Creates a negative association with nail biting in your brain.</li>
            <li> It lingers on lips and tongue for at least twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> She no longer sucks her thumb.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t seem to be affected in the least.  </li>
            <li> However, she complained of her finger being sore, when asked what happened she admitted to sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> this is negative reinforcement at its finest...apply and let the gag factor do its thing.  </li>
            <li> But, as you know if you used to be a thumb sucker (and I was,)</li>
            <li> and it sucks didn&#x27;t even work at all.</li>
            <li> At least that was the way for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who is 9 and sucks his thumb when he sleeps.</li>
            <li> Would I have to put her in this while she was at school because I know she sucks her thumb when she&#x27;s there?</li>
            <li> Basically worked immediately for our 4-year-old thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> We were afraid that he would need extensive dental work (braces) if he were to continue sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> And he told me he didn&#x27;t think it would work because kids with ADHD commonly bite their nails.</li>
            <li> For persistant nail biters, finger suckers, and worriers this stuff works</li>
            <li> My daughter sucks her fingers a lot and this has helped her stop, been using it for about a month and the habit has almost disappeared...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve asked her if it bothers her or if is &#x27;icky&#x27; and she&#x27;s told me no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of them sucks her thumb and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any parent seeking to convert thumb suckers and nail biters.</li>
            <li> Our son started sucking his thumb late.</li>
            <li> She was a habitual sucker before</li>
            <li> At least my daughter vomited 3 times, before realizing she should do it.</li>
            <li> She sucks her fingers</li>
            <li> My son is a finger sucker.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I still can&#x27;t believe that she no longer sucks her fingers.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a thumb sucker till we used Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> so she wouldn&#x27;t taste the icky taste if she ate food with her fingers.  </li>
            <li> I have been telling everyone who has a child that sucks there thumb or fingers to try this stuff.</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker until age 6.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> She sucks on her fingers when she is watching tv.  </li>
            <li> The polish lasts on the fingernail for at least 3 days before needing a touch up.  </li>
            <li> I have not one but two children that have been chronic thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> One of my one-year-olds sucks his thumb vigorously that he started having severe bruises on his thumb.  </li>
            <li> This worked like a charm on two of my children - one was a thumb sucker and one sucked her fingers.  </li>
            <li> in my mouth i can taste that icky stuff.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to us by my 3 year olds dentist to try because she sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> It forced me to be conscious of my bad habit.</li>
            <li> I recommend carrying the bottle with you in a pocket or purse so that if you must do something to your nails, it can at least be a touch-up.</li>
            <li> I recommend carrying the bottle with you in a pocket or purse so that if you must do something to your nails, it can at least be a touch-up.</li>
            <li> He was a thumb sucker from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> She was a 24 hour a day thumb sucker too.</li>
            <li> this product b/c now my daughter no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> Sounds like common sense, I know.</li>
            <li> I can still sort of taste it if I lick my lips, and my girlfriend says that it really sucks to kiss me haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your child is a thumb sucker you need to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She has been a two-finger sucker since birth</li>
            <li> She complained all day about the \\&quot;yuckies\\</li>
            <li> After those weeks of regular use, he had become completely conditioned (read: disgusted) to stop biting his nails, even once we ceased applying the Mavala.</li>
            <li> my son is a thumb sucker</li>
            <li> My son was a compulsive thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> (Although, my hubby would give the taste a negative 5.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been sucking her thumb for 11 years and was desperate to stop before entering middle school.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm for my thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> He put it in his mouth once, spit it out and complained of how yucky it tasted.</li>
            <li> - you should at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I applied this product to the nails of the two fingers that he sucks.  </li>
            <li> I have taken a shower, done the dishes, &amp; washed my hands at least 6 times; the stuff is still coating my nails with taste still there haunting me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend muvalva stop to anyone with a preschooler who sucks their thumb.</li>
            <li> She was even afraid to eat using her left hand in fear of the taste when she wasn&#x27;t trying to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li> The snaps go over her butt, so cutting a hole there for toileting needs would be the same as not snapping it shut at all.  </li>
            <li> I will apply it and it works as a deterrent for about an hour, then he just sucks his thumb anyway, so I end up having to reapply it and the cycle begins all over again.</li>
            <li> It should work but if you have a STUBBORN thumb or finger sucker.</li>
            <li> My son who is 7 still sucks his thumb and this helped us break him of the habit.</li>
            <li> While she complained about the taste, it did not stop her from sucking.  </li>
            <li> Granted, this child likes the taste of vinegar, but it didn&#x27;t change her thumb sucking habits in the least.</li>
            <li> No clue what triggers it and a lot of the time I do not realize I do it until it is too late.</li>
            <li> and then he loses his appetite.</li>
            <li> He was not a day sucker</li>
            <li> My almost four year old had been a thumb sucker since in the womb, one application (I did two layers) along with telling him how nasty it tasted...he absent mindedly sucked, but only once!</li>
            <li> Well take that and times it by 20 at least and you have this stuff.</li>
            <li> My son still sucks his thumb with this stuff on his nails.</li>
            <li> I simply told her that she is almost 5yrs old and thumbs start to taste bad when you turn 5!!</li>
            <li> However, changing habits is a complex business</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use the bottle up at least.  </li>
            <li> My boys both complained of stomach aches after  continuing to bite nails after it was applied.</li>
            <li> I have been chewing on my cuticles for at least 10 years and have never had anything work like Mavala does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My daughter has been a thumb sucker from day one.  </li>
            <li> My sister used it on her daughter who was a thumb sucker about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> My son had been a thumb sucker since day one..</li>
            <li> This product leaves a beyond-description-horribly-nasty-vile-taste in your mouth for at least 5 to 10 minutes that NOTHING will take away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works also on my ten year old who er uh, needs to break some nasty habits.  </li>
            <li> icky booger swab to with &amp;</li>
            <li> He was an ambidextrous thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> wonder why isnt there negative rating</li>
            <li> My three-year-old sucks her fingers so aggressively that her fingers have persistent wounds.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Realistically, this product deserves five stars because it does the job, at least for me.</li>
            <li> He complained about putting the product on his thumb, but once he tasted the product on his thumb he would keep it out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> Also, this sucks if you eat a lot of finger food or even if you get some sort of pasta sauce or ketchup on your finger and instinctively lick it off.</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> and he bites his nails and sucks his finger</li>
            <li> I have a thumb sucker who also chews her nails and toe nails.</li>
            <li> My 5-yr-old was an incessant thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is a chronic thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> but now he sucks his finger</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t work if she sucks her thumb while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m washing dishes every day at least three times a day.  </li>
            <li> She would complain about the icky taste and whenever she had the urge to suck her thumb, she had another thing coming.</li>
            <li> At least, it does for me.</li>
            <li> Our son no longer sucks his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I would constantly try to quit cold turkey however within a week</li>
            <li> My daughter sucks her thumb</li>
            <li> if you have finger suckers...</li>
            <li> so if you know of another thumb sucker pass it along.</li>
            <li> od my stubborn thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews that said chronic finger suckers stopped in days.....</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone with a child who sucks their thumb.  </li>
            <li> I would defiantly recommend this for thumb sucker and nail biters.</li>
            <li> one application of this and she no longer sucks her thump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and my grandson no longer sucks his thumb.</li>
            <li> The bitterness persisted for at least five minutes after it touches my lips or tongue.  </li>
            <li> NO LONGER SUCKS HIS THUMB</li>
            <li> At the end of the week he was not longer a finger sucker.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our daughter who sucks on her fingers.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 3 days to disapper.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I am a minister and I would find myself regularly feeling insecure or embarrassed if someone noticed my nails...</li>
            <li> She sucks her fingers all the time.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it deterred her sometimes, but she seemed to just suck them anyway and complained of her stomach hurting.</li>
            <li> Product works like its supposed to, expensive in my opinion, but maybe she&#x27;s not ready to stop?</li>
            <li> I bought the Mavala Stop for my son who sucks his thumb.  </li>
            <li> So I tried a week later after the cold was gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that my daughter&#x27;s urge to suck her thumb or finger will dissipate over time, but at least we can help her control the behavior with Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> at least before I go to bed, and so I had to remove the nail polish with nail polish remover and then floss.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 y.o. who sucks his thumb.</li>
            <li> My five-year-old lifetime thumb sucker quit after one application.</li>
            <li> Mavala has such a horrible taste that he does not dare to put his fingers even near his mouth.</li>
            <li> No for thumbsucking, but 3 year old like to bite wrist when frustrated.  </li>
            <li> but she continue to sucks her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been putting Mavala all over his finger tips.</li>
            <li> After about a month..i caught him in bed and after another application, he was so longer a thumb sucker</li>
            <li> We stopped using it 4 months ago and he no longer sucks his fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 26 yo male here, desperately wanted to stop biting my nails.  </li>
            <li> totally recommend it to all of those who suffers from thumb-sucking</li>
            <li> Get in the habit of slobbing this stuff all over your fingers for at least three months.</li>
            <li> have a child who was a hardcore finger sucker until the age of five.</li>
            <li> She was constantly sucking her thumb, when she was tired, bored, scared, hungry, and all through the night.  </li>
            <li> He was a thumb sucker as well.</li>
            <li> Taste horrible and was totally sake for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only tastes awful, but it stays on through frequent hand washings.</li>
            <li> This is for desperate measures but obviously not for finger foods.</li>
            <li> Since my son mainly sucks his thumb at night or when he is tired,  I decided to apply it a few minutes before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for our 6yo daughter who still sucks her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I had a thumb sucker I never thought would ever quit.</li>
            <li> Cured thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> and she is no longer a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I painted it on his nails for a few weeks, the taste was so bad every time he put his fingers in his mouth that he finally stopped.  </li>
            <li> We have one child who sucks his fingers, and another who is a thumb-sucker.  </li>
            <li> Our son was a chronic thumb sucker and the dentist told us at 3</li>
            <li> i am 58 years old and my hands were so ugly.  </li>
            <li> She no longer sucks her thumb or bites her nails with this product</li>
            <li> i dont even know that I am doing it until it is to late.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I began putting sucks on her hands at night to keep her from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like she barely sucks it</li>
            <li> and she sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> It is a disappointment, back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker until the age of six.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had two thumb suckers.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, 3, was a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> This product only made my 3 1/2 year old make a disgusted face and then continued sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Even when we put it on she still sucks her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my child sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this stuff, my daughter no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> She still sucks her thumb and bites her nails.  </li>
            <li> - now she no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> But at least you have finger nails again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He did not like it at all and cried until him grandma forced me to take it off.</li>
            <li> , if I was a child and I was \\&quot;wanting to bite\\&quot; and forced myself to get used to it.</li>
            <li> After 4 days the product forced him to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> The taste is slow to develop.</li>
            <li> Tastes like crap really grabs your attention as to what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I have slowly started to wean him off it now, its been about 2 months</li>
            <li> It really makes you Hate what your doing, which think about that sentence</li>
            <li> It really makes you Hate what your doing, which think about that sentence</li>
            <li> The thumb sucking habit was broken in a few days.</li>
            <li> AND NOW MY SON DOESN&#x27;T HAVE BLOODY STUBS FOR FINGERTIPS, YAY, THANKS</li>
            <li> this really really works i put this on my nails and hate my self if i get my mouth close to them</li>
            <li> An 8 yr habit was broken in less than a week!</li>
            <li> I was happy that while the taste was displeasing it wasn&#x27;t so terrible that it made her sick or gag.</li>
            <li> It tasted awful and got me to stop biting right away, within just a few days.</li>
            <li> In the mean time, she started sucking on her hair, which she never did before, now she sucks her fingers and hair.  </li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my childrens Pediatrician because my son who is 4 years old started biting his nails and because of the frequency of his fingers being in his mouth he got sick...</li>
            <li> used to chew on my cuticles CONSTANTLY throughout the day, which left my fingers bleeding, raw, and horrible to look at by the end of every day.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Mavala also clings annoyingly for days while the other solutions are gone often within a day or the very next hand washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the first application onto my fingertips, then tried to eat a cracker -- bad idea!  </li>
            <li> I tried some of the other \\&quot;thumb sucking\\&quot; products on the market that you can purchase at the drugstore and they all failed.  </li>
            <li> I mean ) to keep fingers out of my boy mouth.</li>
            <li> no more licking food off your fingers!  </li>
            <li> We applied it once and poof - no more thumb sucking!  </li>
            <li> When I say sucked, I mean you could hear him from another room.  </li>
            <li> No more sucking at night, day or ever!</li>
            <li> And I mean NOTHING has worked.</li>
            <li> mean nothing would work with him!&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking for the kids!</li>
            <li> All our other attempts to break the habit failed.  </li>
            <li> I used this stuff and it stopped me dead in my tracks!!</li>
            <li> (even in small portions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not Look at the ingredients!</li>
            <li> though if I was really anxious I could overcome the taste and nibble away), but when I ran out of the product.. I became a nail biter again!</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> No more finger/thumb suckers here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products -- EXPENSIVE salon products -- and none of them have worked.</li>
            <li> i mean, it stays in your mouth for a bit but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> No finger sucking and no more painting!</li>
            <li> I mean).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months now and no more thumb-sucking!</li>
            <li> only a small amount is needed and the taste is not only horrible</li>
            <li> it know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you</li>
            <li> I mean I</li>
            <li> no more thumb sucking at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and no more thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> The habit is affecting his teeth, and our doctor unbelievably suggested putting duct tape on them!</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks using this and no more nail biting!</li>
            <li> my kid does not like this product so that must mean that it works.</li>
            <li> I think she may be immune to taste which mean it won&#x27;t work we shall see</li>
            <li> and I mean everything.</li>
            <li> Now no more biting!</li>
            <li> Before using this product, you may want to ask yourself whether you want your kids to be guinea pigs for the untested products of a foreign chemical company.tzerland, holding its makers accountable for any adverse effects that might occur would be difficult.  </li>
            <li> Our Doctor told us that it is a nervous condition that he will grow out of but in the mean time he will pick up germs and bugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking in this house!</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to go the route of the Mavala Stop; his habit was so soothing to him, I felt somewhat guilty taking away his calming mechanism and thought this could be too abrupt of an approach that might backfire on us.  </li>
            <li> No more fingers in the mouth!</li>
            <li> and I really mean never even put it in his mouth.</li>
            <li> then I painted it on his thumb while he was sleeping, which sounds really mean</li>
            <li> no more finger sucking!  </li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> At night after she would fall asleep, I&#x27;d sneak into her room and paint her thumbs with this stuff - a small dab is plenty!  </li>
            <li> Small price to pay to avoid the habit, if you ask me!</li>
            <li> no more thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> we tried thumb gards fake nails, scary picture of bad teeth possitive incouragement, but the habit was too strong to break.</li>
            <li> I felt bad due to the bitter taste but it worked in 0NE DAY!</li>
            <li> However, now she has learned she can get past the initial bad taste, and suck the product off.</li>
            <li> Find some other way to help your child break bad habits; ANY other way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today is the third day of applying the product and not sure how will it take my son to give up the bad habit, now I see that he raises his thumb to suck it</li>
            <li> (might be bad for small kids for put their hands in their mouth all the time, but works for big nail biters like me.)&lt;br /&gt;Dose</li>
            <li> She is a SERIOUS thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> and I had a serious finger sucker.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the awful taste was not enough to keep her from biting her nails.</li>
            <li> He would stop sucking for the moment, check to see if it was worn off after a few hours and go back to sucking again. :(</li>
            <li> She said it taste horrible, we did have to put it on her thumb everyday for the first week</li>
            <li> My three-year-old is a serious finger sucker.</li>
            <li> As recommended by another reviewer I just put a small amount on his thumbnail near the base of each nail to avoid getting the taste on his food, and eureka, it worked.  </li>
            <li> I thought the effort was another failure until the cat immediately went to her water bowl and drank a lot of water.  </li>
            <li> Put it mainly on the base of the nail, but it works</li>
            <li> , I thought the product was a failure.  </li>
            <li> So I guess I will leave a bad review as I see no other outlet for my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Then I realized it is a major bad habit.</li>
            <li> The first night we did it she gagged until she almost threw up and then cried for hours that she was sick, but no sucking!  </li>
            <li> and then all his fingers will taste bad, then he will eat less since food tastes so bitter with this on.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, smells horrible, tastes worse.  </li>
            <li> It does taste very bad - not enough to make you sick, but enough to make you stop biting and help remember not to bite next time.</li>
            <li> However, it is unpleasant enough to deter you from wanting to put a nail in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I only took 1 application, him making 2 attempts and couple of reminders that it will be unpleasant to stick them in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> The taste is slightly unpleasant, but this product didn&#x27;t result in sudden cessation of my nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> so far I was afraid they would get infected!  </li>
            <li> Poor guy woke up crying after sticking his fingers in his mouth!</li>
            <li> She hated it, and the first time we did it she cried.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, she hated it..  </li>
            <li> The nasty bitter taste stopped nail biting after only a few days.</li>
            <li> He hated it, so he quit sucking his thumb fast!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply VERY small amount (just a dot)</li>
            <li> On the 1st night we both tasted a very very very small amount.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive product for a short term effect.  </li>
            <li> At first she hated the taste and would suck her fingers instead.</li>
            <li> They hated it the first time, within a week they got rid of sucking habit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very small bottle</li>
            <li> well at first he hated it even threw up.</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is that it can rub off a little - like if you&#x27;re eating a sandwich some can get on your lips.  </li>
            <li> It is not pleasant, and I had a hard time getting the taste out of my mouth...</li>
            <li> I still carry it with me, because bad habits die hard, but after the initial 3 weeks, I haven&#x27;t had to use it.</li>
            <li> The stuff doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as most of the other reviewers have said---it is not the worst thing I have ever tasted.  </li>
            <li> The product definitely smells bad, but my daughter just rubs it off and then sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> and I must say that the stuff tasts awful and last for several days once you put it on.</li>
            <li> is a LOT LESS EXPENSIVE than costly thumb sucking devices, so</li>
            <li> I seriously had doubts, and guilt, over using a product to take away his method of self soothing.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it worked for my 3-year-old daughter.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely tastes horrible enough to stop you from biting your nails.</li>
            <li> It is so bitter and nasty there is no way I am putting my fingers near my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works.</li>
            <li> Seriously, did not make Any difference</li>
            <li> Seriously, I worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It was scary because his thumbs were slightly purple.</li>
            <li> anyone reading this review and thinking of this product to stop a serious, chronic habit-</li>
            <li> I was a serious biter/picker, too.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work, but with serious consequences for us...</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing the 1st time I ate french fries in public and got a taste of my awful polish I gagged and had to spit!</li>
            <li> Seriously??  </li>
            <li> I was a serious nail biter.  </li>
            <li> fact, the only downside to the product is that the day following an application, finger food is contaminated with this awful taste.  </li>
            <li> I have a ridiculous impulse to biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something less expensive before purchasing the $75 thumb guard</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I carry this stuff in my purse</li>
            <li> Seriously though, I carry this stuff in my purse</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> but it does the job well and is seriously helping.</li>
            <li> we got serious about trying to encourage her to stop.</li>
            <li> It works, it seriously works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious...</li>
            <li> her thumb became so sensitive, ugly and irritating</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> We decided before he was 6 that we had to get serious.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure we would need one of those horrible (and expensive) thumb guards, but</li>
            <li> The polish tastes terrible and can last up to several days and repeated hand washing.  </li>
            <li> Both my wife and I would rather use a less horrible solution, such as Thum than subject anyone to this taste.  </li>
            <li> Super disgusting</li>
            <li> she hated the taste (i tried it too, and it is DISGUSTING), but she loved sucking her thumb so much that she powered through the bad taste.</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried a number of different approaches including other polishes - some nasty, some spicy, and</li>
            <li> did feel a bit guilty the evening I put it on her two fingers and then throughout the night as I heard little wimpers from her bedroom.</li>
            <li> The product does what it should, but is a little flawed because it doesn&#x27;t stay just on your nails.</li>
            <li> Granted eating finger foods is a little difficult</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at how this would work, but based on the reviews, decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I found it very unpleasant, but not as bad as many reviewers have said.  </li>
            <li> I asked her the next morning if her thumb tasted bad</li>
            <li> whenever i TRIED to bite my nail, the taste is soooo bad, that it will last in my tongue for hours.</li>
            <li> My son bit his nails so bad he was actually peeling the nail layers.</li>
            <li> I prepared my son by explaining the consequences of thumb sucking, ESPECIALLY the part where his thumb will start to \\&quot;rot\\&quot; and taste bad.</li>
            <li> My son stuck his thumb in his mouth only a couple of times after we applied this, and it tasted so bad that it kept him from doing it again.</li>
            <li> Just one application lasted over a week (even with hand-washing and showers) and tasted bad enough to cure my son.  </li>
            <li> So my daughter essentially had a Pavlovian response to the bad taste.</li>
            <li> I put the product on his thumb while he was sleep and in the middle of the night he screamed out that his mouth tested bad.  </li>
            <li> and I can only imagine how bad it tastes for our kid.</li>
            <li> It smelled bad &amp; I put essential oil peppermint on his nose</li>
            <li> For someone who actually thought it tasted bad, I think this polish would work well.</li>
            <li> as a side note I tell my son that the bad taste is a reminder that he is a big kid now.</li>
            <li> I felt bad putting it on her thumb, especially after I tried it</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes bad enough</li>
            <li> We had tried another product and it did not work, it didn&#x27;t taste bad enough...</li>
            <li> It definitely tastes bad.</li>
            <li> hope when i stop, the bad habit will not comes back</li>
            <li> The only factor I did not calculator was when she is eating with hands, the bad taste transfers.</li>
            <li> He wanted to stop but it&#x27;s such a bad habit</li>
            <li> This time, however, she froze in mid-movement for a few seconds, seemed to remember the unpleasant experience of a few moments ago, and continued walking without licking or chewing the area again.  </li>
            <li> She did complain of a bad taste in her mouth in the morning, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to stop it when she was sleeping.</li>
            <li> Never thought telling someone how bad their product tastes would equal a compliment, but in this case it does.</li>
            <li> My daughter even said the taste is not enough to deter her from the bad habit.  </li>
            <li> but she said it didn&#x27;t taste bad enough.  </li>
            <li> I swear I would try to convince myself that it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but when you have the taste still on your lips for a while there is not way to deny that is it gross.</li>
            <li> If you can spare getting soap on your fingernails though the bad taste does seem to last but does get somewhat weaker over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I also taste it when I try to eat finger foods like fruit and sandwiches but its not too bad with food.</li>
            <li> It tasted bad- enough to make me pull my finger from my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Berenstain Bears book about the bad habit of nail biting, and told her that with this book and this &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; we could finally help her stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li> Bad enough that she won&#x27;t even lick her fingers after eating food with her hands anymore.  </li>
            <li> I will occasionally still try to bite my nails but the taste of this stuff is just bad enough to remind me to stop but not so bad that I&#x27;m gagging.</li>
            <li> My son is five, he was eating his nail so bad that he start bleeding, this product did the trick his nail are growing back</li>
            <li> I told her that she&#x27;s a big girl now and your fingers start to taste bad when you get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is bad enough that it gets you to stop biting the nails themselves.</li>
            <li> This product is not as bad tasting as the Stop Bite that you can get from the local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I would have with this product is that when she would eat things with her fingers she would taste it and think the food tasted bad and wouldnt eat it.  </li>
            <li> For teens and adults though it will definitely remind them to break a bad habit.</li>
            <li> The only bad side is that you have to apply every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bad habit of sucking her middle fingers and had for almost 3 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not spicey but just tastes bad enough that you won&#x27;t ever put your fingers in your mouth again.</li>
            <li> days later the bad taste remains on your finger nails.  </li>
            <li> Bad: It does get in the way of some daily activities.</li>
            <li> It will definitely help break bad habits.</li>
            <li> AND ITS NOT REALLY GOOD TO GIVE TO KIDS</li>
            <li> Does no good.</li>
            <li> Whenever he put his thumb in his mouth he immediately pulled it back out and made a really ugly face to show his disgust.  </li>
            <li> I am still shocked at how this instantly broke the habit.  </li>
            <li> Sad i wasted $13.00 on this.</li>
            <li> Well worth it for a month to break a nasty habit.</li>
            <li> And after using this product I noticed her hands are already dirty or bitter when shes putting her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> but it seems it&#x27;s not good for toddler age 4.</li>
            <li> Also flossing is difficult so just remember to remove the polish when flossing or when eating messy foods and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it was weird because I hadn&#x27;t even noticed he stopped sucking it until one day I just realized I had not seen him do it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> From what I know, the ingredients are not dangerous, but he literally had a horrible week because of it.</li>
            <li> not good-</li>
            <li> and it did NO good.</li>
            <li> We cut her of that habit before she could get addicted but somehow acquired a taste for the Mavala Stop and now sucks her thumb with or without it.</li>
            <li> No good.  </li>
            <li> But for me its totally worth it to kick this disgusting habit</li>
            <li> No longer red, irritated, infected, and painful from biting.</li>
            <li> ..seems like the powerful nasty taste was gone..</li>
            <li> It was darn bitter chicken.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy bitter-</li>
            <li> I bite so badly that it&#x27;s painful for me to use my fingertips (to type, to open Tupperware, to open zippers).  </li>
            <li> it was to painful to continue, then I would move onto the next finger.  </li>
            <li> I finally gave up using it because I became so frustrated trying to eat and prepare meals without making things taste poisonous.  </li>
            <li> but the horrible taste that would accompany that action makes it just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Whatever the manufacturers did to make this product to terrible tasting and long lasting...</li>
            <li> The stuff tastes extremely bitter and just terrible in general.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY horrible tasting, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate the product, it just didn&#x27;t work for a child that far up in age or habit.</li>
            <li> worked immediately--although our daughter did get sick one time in the middle of the night when she went to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> By very bad, I mean water is not strong enough to wash the taste out of my mouth....</li>
            <li> The other child, however, suffers through he grossness and continues to bite his skin and nails...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to get my child to stop, but stop she did!</li>
            <li> It was a hard week though!</li>
            <li> I was such a bad nail biter, I have actually broken two teeth.  </li>
            <li> My son has been biting his nails since he was about 2 yrs old, but now at age 7, it&#x27;s become a bad habit that was difficult to stop.  </li>
            <li> in mind that this was NOT pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried through discipline and cold shoulder dozens of times only to fail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it til you&#x27;ve broken the worst of the pattern.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that if you ever miss, you&#x27;ll have this disgusting bitter taste on your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to try to stop and this stuff is so disgusting that it only took me three tries to avoid putting my fingers in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would catch her about to suck her fingers and then suddenly stop, like a mental trigger went off in her head reminding her of the awful experience she had when she tasted the Mavala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The liquid tastes bitter and disgusting and is a constant reminder to stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> &quot; he tried to spit the bad taste onto his pillow, but the flavor was gone by then and he settled down for sleep with out any crying or finger attention at all!</li>
            <li> because for me, my nails have never even had the chance to grow past the fingertips and are very weak from the years of biting.</li>
            <li> It has a very bitter, unpleasant taste, though it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to make me want to vomit.</li>
            <li> Neither child minded very much, UNTIL they tried to bite their nails &amp; discovered the HORRIBLE taste!!  </li>
            <li> Although we hated to see the horrible look on our son&#x27;s face when he stuck his thumb in his mouth, it worked very effectively....</li>
            <li> The bitter taste was not too bad, but bad enough to make them pull their hands out of their mouths when they tasted it.</li>
            <li> The taste is extremely bitter and unpleasant, and quite long-lasting, so if I made the mistake of trying to pick a piece of food from my teeth or something, I&#x27;d pay for it for a while.</li>
            <li> have try it my self to check how long it takes to wash out and how bad the taste is after one day or two</li>
            <li> It was indeed awfully bitter and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> , I put it on when he sleeps now, and told him that his fingers taste bad because he sucked them for so long.</li>
            <li> I put it on and she does say it is bitter and unpleasant, but she feels the bitterness AFTER she has already pulled a piece of skin.</li>
            <li> and ive been biting my nails bad, to where they bleed for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> The taste is amazingly bad and it lingers for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> a weak stomach Mavala is probably not for you.  </li>
            <li> The taste is pretty awful and helps remind me not to bite.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to get something weak and figured I&#x27;d be looking around for something else soon.</li>
            <li> and she no longer sucks her thumb!</li>
            <li> It does smell terrible when you first put it on but as soon as it dries (a couple of minutes), the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> He seemed disappointed in himself for having sucked overnight and was initially resistant to reapplying the product.</li>
            <li> Tastes horrible and works extremely well when applied properly</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible, put thumb in mouth the first time and out it came.</li>
            <li> I got a bit in my mouth after applying it on my son, and I can attest to fact it taste really awful, but it isn&#x27;t harmful and it really works!  </li>
            <li> She says it disgusting and cried the first time i put it on.</li>
            <li> This product lasts at least 4-5 days, even through all that hand washing!</li>
            <li> so taste its pretty awful</li>
            <li> My husband I both tried it (put our mouth on our daughter&#x27;s thumb after application) and it was pretty nasty and the taste stays with you for a while</li>
            <li> within two weeks he had stopped putting his hands in his mouth and no longer sucks his thumb!</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter of at least 15 years, after one week of applying this stuff to my fingers I was cured!</li>
            <li> the first time we put it on his thumb, He made a terrible face.  </li>
            <li> Back to the drawing board :(</li>
            <li> She would literally suck her thumb while watching tv, while sleeping or anytime she became bored or anxious.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nasty tasting.  </li>
            <li> and she no longer sucks her thumb!  </li>
            <li> At first, if I instinctively put my fingers on my lips and then licked my lips, I tasted it - and it is AWFUL!</li>
            <li> The first night was awful, and nobody slept.</li>
            <li> At first I absent-mindedly put them in my mouth, this stuff in TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> For the first two days, I was overly cautious and never tasted the awful stuff.  </li>
            <li> No imagine constantly being shown videos of employees spiting in food, rats running around the kitchen, and a bunch of other disgusting things going on in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> First couple nights woke up in the night with the nasty taste in her mouth and had to get a drink of water....</li>
            <li> Yep, tastes pretty awful!</li>
            <li> The first time my son put his thumb in his mouth after application, he immediately pulled his thumb out, making a horrible face.  </li>
            <li> The taste is really nasty and if you touch your lips it really gets you!</li>
            <li> I put some on my finger with him the first time and it tasted TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> After the first time I applied it she did put her thumb in her mounth and made a horrible face.  </li>
            <li> It has been at least 3 months since my daughter stopped sucking her thumb!  </li>
            <li> my daughter i guess got amune to the taist, shes back to sucking her thumb :(</li>
            <li> She also complained about the flossing problem and stopped using it after one try!</li>
            <li> I painted his thumb liberally with it the first day telling him it was simply awful and not to have an accident.</li>
            <li> I have accidently put my finger in my mouth after applying this to my daughters thumb ad its gross but doesnt stop her :(</li>
            <li> the first two nights were miserable!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in June and decided I want to quit this disgusting habit once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to blame it on my nails being weak and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I will say though, that the taste must be awful; the first night my son used it he ended up throwing up because he kept sticking his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> It tastes AWFUL which is exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on myself first and it is disgusting!</li>
            <li> (My daughter dumped out the first one; the flavor is truly that awful!)  </li>
            <li> We were skeptical all the way until the small box was delivered on our doorstep.</li>
            <li> this stuff is kinda weak.</li>
            <li> I tried it first and can attest to its staying power and awful taste.  </li>
            <li> , that sucks!</li>
            <li> I always recommend this product to friends with kids who are thumb or finger suckers, or nail biters!</li>
            <li> annoying thing is that if I&#x27;m not careful with my fingers, the stuff might end up on my lips, and then my food.</li>
            <li> We put it on him on a Friday after dinner, he actually didn&#x27;t put his fingers in his mouth at all that evening because he was afraid of the taste- even though he hadn&#x27;t tasted it yet!  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I tasted a little bit and found it awful---so even with her palate this should have been at least unpleasant.</li>
            <li> but it was very hard and didn&#x27;t know how to stop.</li>
            <li> aggravation at ones self and painful awareness of ugly nails fails to be enough of a deterrent to actually stop biting, its time for drastic measures.</li>
            <li> We found out the hard way that the bad taste (and slight numbing sensation) lingers in your mouth for *hours.</li>
            <li> and wow does it taste bad!....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chemical, foreign, and entirely unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> now i just need a strengthener because my nails are a bit weak and have broken once already.</li>
            <li> She absolutely hated even having her hands anywhere near her mouth!</li>
            <li> It was hard because the bad taste made her not want to swallow, so she was a drooling mess.  </li>
            <li> Stopping nail biting is tough, but I can guarantee you that if you apply Mavala as directed you will not nail bite.</li>
            <li> tough</li>
            <li> It was tough breaking the habit.</li>
            <li> Either the product didn&#x27;t work or I just have a really tough and stubborn kid</li>
            <li> then the child it&#x27;s tough.</li>
            <li> That was tough.</li>
            <li> At the very least, it reminds you that your fingers are in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Its unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> We thought it was helping her to sooth herself, and it did, but after a certain point, it just becomes a nasty habit.</li>
            <li> We certainly had no point where we felt we needed to wash it off because it was too terrible.  </li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes he cried a little and complained about a bad taste.</li>
            <li> The taste of it is disgusting, which kept me from biting a little, but overall it did not stop me.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to get any on my fingers because it tastes sooo bad.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, after a few weeks, our son just put it in his mouth even with the bad taste and so, we stopped using it thinking the chemicals were bad for him to keep putting in his mouth.</li>
            <li> do not be fooled and compare this bitter taste to a lemon, lime or bad pickle.  </li>
            <li> It does taste horrible though and does last a few days.  </li>
            <li> In fact, he woke up in the middle of the night crying because he accidently stuck his thumb in his mouth while asleep, and swallowed the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old was a horrible thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was completly addicted to her pacifier.  </li>
            <li> and she was without her pacifier, saying that it was broken and tastes yucky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I chose this product because of how much people raved about the awful taste.</li>
            <li> Be warned - it tastes worse than anything you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product to help with it because I&#x27;m tired of it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeably worse in my high-stress career.  </li>
            <li> I have an autistic son and I was afraid this may not work for him.</li>
            <li> The taste is horrible, and lingers in your mouth for a while-it really discourages you from putting your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> At night, when she was tired, she tried to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate about it, is that if you eat anything with your hands (sandwich, cookies, etc) it tastes like this stuff</li>
            <li> AS THE MONTHS PROGRESSED IT BECAME WORSE AND WORSE.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything, including therapists, for our 7 year daughter, who sucks two fingers 4-6 hours a night, and when she is tired, hungry, upset or watching TV!  </li>
            <li> We only put it at the base of her thumb (by the cuticle).</li>
            <li> He also chews the sides of his fingers and although I can put this product on that area, the skin is broken and it stings like fire.  </li>
            <li> and I think she has finally broken the habit.  </li>
            <li> It really tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> I no longer wear bandages or take antibiotics because of this disfiguring, infantile habit.</li>
            <li> So, alas, it didn&#x27;t work for us.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this for about 3 weeks and the habit seems to be fully broken.  </li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for 15yrs and have tired every product imaginable.</li>
            <li> It tastes awful and dries fast.</li>
            <li> are still not 100% broken of the habbit, but we are 99% there!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It brings attention to them, which is unwanted because I am not proud of my fingernail biting habit.  </li>
            <li> alas, a solution.</li>
            <li> It really does taste awful, but within a week she was not sucking her thumb during the day.  </li>
            <li> I think the habit is broken, but I will keep it on them for a week or so now to make sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible, but is very unnoticeable as a nail polish, even for a guy.</li>
            <li> It took two week and our son is completely broken of his habit.</li>
            <li> The habit was broken immediately.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days her habit was broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been exhausting</li>
            <li> I was tired of asking him to get his hands out of his mouth, so I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> but after 3 applications or about a week...her habit was broken.  </li>
            <li> I managed to keep them that way for months (thanks to this disgusting stuff...</li>
            <li> I told her I bite my nails (I do, when one is broken)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my son still just sucks it off</li>
            <li> I applied one coat on the two finger nails of the fingers that she sucked and the habit was broken in 3 days.  </li>
            <li> The amazon reviews for these types of products are really frustrating.</li>
            <li> I think once we make it for 3 or 4 weeks then he will have broken the habit.  </li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it anymore and thinks its a game to try and stick her fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It tastes SO horrible but really helps.</li>
            <li> i have broken my 27 years nail biting habbit.</li>
            <li> It really does taste terrible though.</li>
            <li> Even when she is tired and zoning out and doing her playing-with-her-hair thing that always went with the thumb sucking . . .</li>
            <li> Some may be confused by my rating for this product, but let me explain...</li>
            <li> Additionally it leaves a horrible lingering taste on your tongue and lips that goes away on its time no matter how much you try and flush it with water.</li>
            <li> She was tired and said she still had the taste in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> It really does taste awful.  </li>
            <li> you bite the worse</li>
            <li> you bite the worse</li>
            <li> I guess I just have very stubborn children, because this stuff tastes so horrible and lingers forever in your mouth!</li>
            <li> My daughter hated it and won&#x27;t even go near the stuff.  </li>
            <li> He seemed like he wanted to stop, but couldn&#x27;t keep his hand away from his mouth every time he was tired, nervous, or just not thinking.</li>
            <li> He says it leaves a lingering taste behind as well.</li>
            <li> She does it throughout the day and when shes tired.  </li>
            <li> It really must taste awful.  </li>
            <li> By this point she had already broken the habit and was done sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Chose mavala to stop nail biting, works very well  tastes terrible (like it should!)</li>
            <li> it seemed to be worse</li>
            <li> really wish I had the willpower to stop biting my nails without the aid of a horrible tasting product</li>
            <li> She does not like the taste at all, and neither do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months I decreased the application to 1 - 2 times per week.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish tasts so nasty that it really works.</li>
            <li> and she is really tired and watching tv, riding in the car, etc.</li>
            <li> The fact that you have to reapply it every two days was frustrating and after some time my daughter got use to it.</li>
            <li> Works really well, does indeed taste horrible.</li>
            <li> and I just reminded her it was broken.</li>
            <li> I expect that after about a month or two of using this I&#x27;ll have broken the habit.  </li>
            <li> Any time she was tired or upset she would suck her thumb and twirl her hair.  </li>
            <li> The thumbsucking stopped immediately, and within 2 weeks the habit was permanently broken and the product wasn&#x27;t needed anymore.</li>
            <li> I have gone to the nail salon and got fake nails to see if that would work, I have forced my self to stop (for a week).</li>
            <li> while its a bit frustrating getting his permission to put it on, but once its done, the stuff lasts for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (you could see it and it was getting worse).</li>
            <li> it really taste awful!!!</li>
            <li> Nauseated after tasting it.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it gets worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this up for 60 days and see if the habit is broken.  </li>
            <li> Worse, it gets on my lip, and I taste it for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I was getting really tired of it</li>
            <li> she came straight to me and told me it was awful, but she didn&#x27;t do it again.  </li>
            <li> My four year son had been sucking is two fingers at night and when he was tired forever.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating.</li>
            <li> This stuff stays on for days at a time and really tastes terrible</li>
            <li> This is the absolute WORST tasting stuff there is...</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> My poor boyfriend made the mistake of kissing me on the cheek after I had scratched my face with my nails.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the polish irritating my eyes as I handled my contacts.</li>
            <li> After using this product for 2 weeks, he was totally broken of the habit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a filthy habit, but I could never stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes horrible, but has really helped me stop biting my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess they should have checked whether the bottle inside the box is broken or not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have been stressed lately and started biting again.</li>
            <li> Anyways, we stopped using it, it was just making his habit worse.</li>
            <li> The product works very well, but it is designed to taste awful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s terrible, and since that&#x27;s the whole point...</li>
            <li> Any time I would remind her not to, she thought it was a game and would stick all of her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I tested Mavala Stop on my nails and it really tasted terribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most horrible, nauseating, bitter, awful flavor I can imagine.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I am not saying I am cured yet, but I went from a highly addicted nail biter to now</li>
            <li> but alas, he got used to it and even after applying it to his thumbs, within minutes, he&#x27;d be sucking them again.  </li>
            <li> The thin amount I applied didn&#x27;t work, so I piled it on that thumb</li>
            <li> As a guy, it didn&#x27;t really sit well with my friends who were laughing hysterically.</li>
            <li> It has a really nasty bitter taste to it and you have to be careful Cus</li>
            <li> Of course, there are dental concerns - some people hate the idea of putting a liquid repellent on, but it&#x27;s better than saying over and over &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; and driving your kid nuts.  </li>
            <li> She woke up serveral times in the middle of the night asking me to wash her teeth (the only way the bad taste goes away) because she forgot and sucked her thumb, and the tast is very bad.</li>
            <li> The taste is just plain nasty, if you put your fingers in your mouth once or twice by accident it probably won&#x27;t happen a third time.  </li>
            <li> kids fingers were in very bad shape before using this polish making them self conscious and ashamed to have others look at them.</li>
            <li> My daughter quit sucking her thumbs in less than 3 days with this product!!!!  </li>
            <li> My 4-year-old out of nowhere developed this hardcore nail biting habit--so bad he would chew his fingers raw and bloody.  </li>
            <li> AND we are having a VERY DIFFICULT time with afternoon naps and slight difficulty with bedtime.  </li>
            <li> To the products credit, it is so nasty that it scares the heck out of the child, but they might loose weight like our daughter because they can&#x27;t keep anything down.</li>
            <li> The Boriele, on the other hand, will stay for days after 1 application, however it doesn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> I know that bad taste is the point, however, this seemed extreme.</li>
            <li> She had drooled a LOT due to the bad taste, we had to wash the blanket she was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We were frustrated with other products and with our daughter who kept sucking her finger.</li>
            <li> It tastes nasty to the point where within the first day, I already would stop myself before my finger was even near my mouth just remembering the disgusting taste.</li>
            <li> As awful as this tastes, our daughter, who is a major thumb sucker, said \\&quot;well, not too bad\\&quot; and kept rigth on sucking.  </li>
            <li> , so we tried everything (really, seriously, everything!)</li>
            <li> My daughter was going to need serious dental work done but its going to avoid us of that!</li>
            <li> Stop, seriously!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I painted her two thumbnails and got exactly what I was expecting, her on the verge of tears trying to wash her mouth out because it was nasty.</li>
            <li> I touched my tongue to her nail and the taste is truly awful, a sour acidic chemical taste that dulls the tip of the tongue</li>
            <li> unfortunately whatever they eat the first couple of times will have a horrible taste and they might not want to eat, but they will catch on if they don&#x27;t put their fingers in their mouth</li>
            <li> But as a person who chronically bit her nails for the past 25 years, I&#x27;m grateful for the extra motivation to kick this nasty habit!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The taste does not come out 100% with water, and leaves me with a slightly sick feeling if I cannot get it out of my mouth due to it tasting</li>
            <li> my other son doesn&#x27;t sick his thumb.</li>
            <li> I had read some other reviews about the kids getting sick from it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to help that nasty nail biting!</li>
            <li> He was hysterical, partially because this all occurred while he was half asleep.  </li>
            <li> We put it on at night before she went to bed, and she hated the flavor so much and complained that it still tasted bad in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually trust reviews but was desperate to do something to help my kids.  </li>
            <li> Having long nails is annoying if you&#x27;re not used to it.  </li>
            <li> That little amount made for a lot of bitter nasty taste!  </li>
            <li> Mavala helped our family stop three bad habits in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to resort to this, but I felt that the consequences of the sucking was worse that a few days of discomfort and bad taste.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think my child was being overly dramatic.</li>
            <li> I tried it for weeks and finally gave up because I was afraid it was bad for her.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how incredibly awful this polish tastes!</li>
            <li> and I was so fearful that she would be teased about this one day and that would make it even worse, not to mention the effect on her self esteem and the potential health hazards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste was horrific and it did not take but a few times of biting my nails out of habit to have my mouth in rough shape for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> Just before bed time, I painted it on your thumb nail only, and when she tried to suck her thumb, she complained of an awful taste in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Like very burnt horrible stale</li>
            <li> My son came down from his room complaining about feeling sick.  </li>
            <li> I followed the advice of other reviewers here after being disappointed with THUM.  </li>
            <li> They were horrible and now they&#x27;re fixed!</li>
            <li> NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> It only took that one application, I am SHOCKED!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala is rediculously disgusting, and I&#x27;ve tried a few other solutions.</li>
            <li> I was afraid when I picked my daughter up from school that she would be mad or tearful about having spent the day with it on her nails.</li>
            <li> leaves nails a little shiny but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Everyday, with the sight of him sucking his thumb, he would be reminded of the impending \\&quot;rotting and bad taste\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> only bad thing is if you plan on eating finger foods, be careful, as the product gets onto the food and it makes your mouth have the horrible flavor for hours.  </li>
            <li> crying from the bad taste.</li>
            <li> I suppose it will take a few months to change the bad habit, but this product does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad, but after that, she stopped crying and hasn&#x27;t cried since.</li>
            <li> and I know there are a few occasions where she has done it during the night because she will wake up saying that her mouth tastes bad.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using it for a few days and use nail polish remover to take it off and then have a discussion about bad habits with your child (unless it is yourself, then have a discussion with yourself).</li>
            <li> He woke up crying like he was in a painful nightmare.</li>
            <li> There have been times that she wakes up and forgets and puts her finger in her mouth and wakes up crying bc of the bad taste.</li>
            <li> They used to be just awful: bleeding, splintered, and completely ruined.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, it lingers and you don&#x27;t want it anywhere near your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is so disgusting tasting there is just no way you would want your fingers near your mouth.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and was one of the worst nail biters ever!  </li>
            <li> On second day, she hated and wanted me to take it off</li>
            <li> We tried sticker charts, socked hands, scare tactics of terrible adult teeth, even popsicle sticks.  </li>
            <li> I hate myself for being a nail bitter and using this product.  </li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 year old son has a horrible thumb sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a gloss finish, which is not ideal for me as a guy.  </li>
            <li> It is clear on the nails and has awful taste</li>
            <li> She hated the taste enough to stop.</li>
            <li> His nails and fingers were awful, and he had completely lost control over htis habit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m put my finger in my mouth without thinking and being surprised by the awful taste.</li>
            <li> And wow is it awful tasting.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to have resolved the problem.nt--just so a bit of the nasty taste would be there to stop her licking and chewing.  </li>
            <li> , you have no ideal</li>
            <li> For me, it is that it tastes so horrible and lingers in your mouth, that you don&#x27;t even want your hands anywhere near your face.</li>
            <li> and if you happen to touch the finger by accident you would have a nasty taste if it came anywhere near your mouth</li>
            <li> I got this for my 4 yr old son who chewed his nails something terrible.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old girl, has a shocking habit about thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old shoved her hands in a bowl of spaghetti noodles and then refused to eat the rest of them because just about all of them ended up tasting as terrible as the product.</li>
            <li> He still bites his nails terribly and I&#x27;ve given it nearly 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for about 25 yrs just bought this product and dont go near my nails, it tastes horrible</li>
            <li> I made the poor choice of having my fingernail scissors in a difficult to get to location.</li>
            <li> she HATED the taste, but we hung in there and by the second night she remembered what would happen.</li>
            <li> Our daughter hated the taste but found that if she washed her hands enough in a day, she could eventually tolerate the taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst tasting stuff when I am conscious of when Im about to bite my nails</li>
            <li> My 5-year old had a horrible nail biting problem-</li>
            <li> Wow, she made a terrible face.</li>
            <li> Got tired of fake nails</li>
            <li> She hated it, but she alternated between sucking her fingers and wiping her tongue on her shirt until the Mavala Stop finally wore off.</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting, works well on my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm when all other tactics failed!!</li>
            <li> taste is definitely unpleasant, but it definitely won&#x27;t make you sick.  </li>
            <li> and he was very frustrated because he could not ultimately stop.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just mean chicken nuggets.  </li>
            <li> It made her sick to her stomach but it worked in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t taste the nasty taste for about ten or fifteen seconds...too late!  </li>
            <li> Poor little guy! :(</li>
            <li> One unfortunate side effect was that it made his eating finger foods like chips and mozarella sticks, etc tough for him because he could still faintly taste the product on his food.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I got a bad bottle, but when I tried it on myself it does have a bad taste, just apparently not enough to stop my kid.</li>
            <li> Horrible and nasty, but effective.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was worried that my girlfriend&#x27;s monsterous child would become addicted to the awful taste, but it deterred her from biting her fingernails...and toe nails!  </li>
            <li> but if you lick your finger, touch your lips with your finger or bite your nail there is an incredibly horrible taste left behind.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than eating french fries and then being hit with this horrific taste that lasts and  lasts and lasts!  </li>
            <li> However, she no longer sucks her thumb!!</li>
            <li> I hated the fact that my toddler has been sucking her thumb since she was an infant, all I could constantly think about was her teeth, her hands always being wet and stinky or her always getting sick in school from having her fingers in her mouth!  </li>
            <li> It is VERY, VERY HARD TO WASH OFF!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bad habit with no redeeming qualities.  </li>
            <li> , I was reluctant because of the price (which is really not that bad, but if it did not work, I would have been mad).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what else to do besides leave a bad review.  </li>
            <li> Goes on like nail polish but apparently tastes horrible according to my son.</li>
            <li> even the worst nail biter (me) stop this terrible habit and the whole process became so mental that now I don&#x27;t even have the desire to bite anymore.</li>
            <li> It tastes so bad and that bad taste stay in your mouth way too long, you eventually stop.</li>
            <li> The first day we felt bad for him because I guess that taste was just awful, he kept complaining \\&quot;my</li>
            <li> It will terrorize your taste buds for at least 20 minutes and is nearly impossible to get the taste out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tough age to try to convince!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if to try again or what, as I did not want another episode of that again!!!  </li>
            <li> My daughter was not pleased to try this, but it worked wonders!!!  </li>
            <li> Awful chemical taste that lingered in my mouth for at least half an hour and lasts on the fingers for days.</li>
            <li> The only problem is if you eat anything with your hands (chicken fingers, sandwiches) its impossible not to get this in your mouth which basically makes the food taste really bad.</li>
            <li> But bad habits are hard to break.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT hot/spicy like pepper, and is hard to describe, but your reaction to it is immediate and visceral (\\&quot;UGGHHH that was a bad idea\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> (I think he has bad anxiety), and it&#x27;s been hard to get him to stop.</li>
            <li> he had a hard time he wanted to suck his fingers soo bad.</li>
            <li> This child sucked  her fingers so hard that they were cracked/red as a toddler, and she traumatized one of her baby teeth so bad that it didn&#x27;t even grow a root.</li>
            <li> Heard this worked for others but my 2 thumb suckers, age 7, just endured the bad taste until it was gone.</li>
            <li> She complained of the bad taste and sipped water to get rid of it</li>
            <li> ordered this Mavala stop as a last resort thinking it would be cruel</li>
            <li> /&gt;this has been useless for him.</li>
            <li> Only problem is when you touch your mouth without thinking, the taste is terrible.  </li>
            <li> It was nasty enough that I didn&#x27;t want to put my fingers in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Her thumb was always red, and the fingernail had stopped growing and looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I was browsing a random thread on Reddit.com when I came across the product.</li>
            <li> I personally think this stuff tastes nasty, but my daughter will still suck her fingers, even with this stuff on.  </li>
            <li> He was so angry with me.  </li>
            <li> I kept reapplying it all weekend and needless to say it was a restless 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say he didnt like the taste and the experience.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t bite her nails (and she was terrible at that) when this stuff is on, and when she finds herself starting to do it again, she puts this stuff on her nails and &#x27;nuff said!  </li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> A lifetime habbit broken in a couple of days!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say he did not want to put his fingers in his mounth with the polish on.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the usefulness of this product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too difficult now.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this product did not work.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to imagine anyone who would continue to nail bite after tasting Mavala.</li>
            <li> I kept putting it on every few days (just at the base of her nails) just in case, but it&#x27;s been over a month now</li>
            <li> The product came two days later, I explained to my son what it was for and told him it was going to taste nasty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So if everything else has failed, try this.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had different awful flavors.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, he was not phased by it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately ... my daughter has since started to bite her nails.  </li>
            <li> The disgusting taste of Malava is enough to make</li>
            <li> ; Wrong.</li>
            <li> I painted my nail to test it and the taste is nasty, though it is not physically harmful.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical about Mevala.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, aren&#x27;t we all?</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t totally terrible but it was enough to stop me from biting.  </li>
            <li> Even months later she&#x27;ll warn me that thumbs taste nasty.</li>
            <li> She did break the habit for a few days, but then her molars started cutting and she needed the soothing again and not even the bad taste could deter her.</li>
            <li> It really does taste disgusting and will stop any bad habits that you&#x27;re trying to break.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> Next morning she said she has the worst taste in her mouth ever.</li>
            <li> We started on a holiday weekend, in case it was a difficult transition, so that she wouldn&#x27;t be alone at school.</li>
            <li> A bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical that anything could make her stop.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for my son and his thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Holy molly.... why does it need to be this expensive? ?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, he keeps forgetting to put it on</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> My kids actually came close to vomiting because the taste was so terrible.</li>
            <li> so my system is flawed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 3 days, she returned to sucking her fingers.  </li>
            <li> Only cons of this product is if your toddler use their fingers to eat it will leave the nasty taste on their food and of course their mouth.</li>
            <li> He woke up 2 or 3 times in the middle of the night because he licked the nail and was disgusted - but didn&#x27;t cry.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want something embarrassing or uncomfortable for him.</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, we are now looking for another product.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by our family dentist who actually tried it and said it was the worst taste ever.  </li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately in my case not so.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks, she stopped asking for it and the habit that I thought would never be broken was gone like a flash!  </li>
            <li> Even after all of the failed attempts.  </li>
            <li> He said in 98% of the patients he told about Mavala Stop, it worked and their would be no need for an expensive device for the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> and they are unable to eat with their fingers during meals.</li>
            <li> She was unable to wash it off, even after a bath it was still on.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Thumb\\&quot; is totally useless and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything.</li>
            <li> And I would not put this on a child who cannot understand what is on their fingers and unable to talk fully with mommy or daddy.  </li>
            <li> Taste is disgusting enough to deter biting.</li>
            <li> I received this product about three weeks ago, skeptical about whether it would work.</li>
            <li> She raised it up to me as if to say, \\&quot;WTF?</li>
            <li> , that is all you, this is merely a product that reminds you to change your habits.</li>
            <li> Whenever I was bored I found myself biting my nails without even realizing it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for my son.</li>
            <li> and they have all failed..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the case for my child, but I am hopeful that something will work...</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> BLECH!!!!!!!!! That was enough to make me come home and immediately look up a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> Next morning, I think he forgot that horrible taste as he came out, laid on the carpet as he always does</li>
            <li> In fact it made it even worse!</li>
            <li> Several times I accidentally either grazed by nail on the food or touched it to my lip when I was eating and found a nasty surprise!</li>
            <li> Making you conscience of what you did &amp; are doing with a lingering disgusting aftermath depending on how big of a hangnail you got.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible so it definitely is a nail biting deterrent.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not work for my kid.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical before trying this product</li>
            <li> so it made me a bit wary as to why someone would do that.it wary as to why someone would do that.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes disgusting and as he pointed out, only comes off if you take a bath.</li>
            <li> But my 6 year unfortunately grew accustomed to the taste.  </li>
            <li> Well it definitely tastes nasty.</li>
            <li> It CONSTANTLY reminds you how nasty your nails are.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I dropped the bottle and it shattered.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product several months ago for my daughter who had a horrible finger sucking habit.  </li>
            <li> The taste is awful and enough to make him stop.  </li>
            <li> I had to stop using this stuff because it was too difficult to eat on the go with my hands and play my horn.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and was wary of trying a product that contained chemicals, but nothing else had worked to date.  </li>
            <li> and he was Not a happy dog all weekend!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> One of my sons picked up nail biting when he was bored.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all over the years and all others failed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, too.</li>
            <li> only difficult part is that when finger feeding, she&#x27;d get the awful taste in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Mavala tastes horrible, and truly stays on for two to three days with multiple hand washings.  </li>
            <li> You will have to stop because if you don&#x27;t you will become physically ill.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything including the expensive silicon thumb cover that promises to work.  </li>
            <li> I try everything under the sun and needless to say this product did the trick</li>
            <li> I think the habit is broken!</li>
            <li> This thing leaves such a horrible taste that she stopped sucking her two index fingers.</li>
            <li> two weeks before her 3rd birthday, i purchased mavala hoping this would get rid of this nasty habit..</li>
            <li> in all, if you want to stop biting your nails and mere will power just won&#x27;t cut it, buy Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> He cried and I felt so guilty</li>
            <li> overall, I found it to be ineffective and cruel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me- I won&#x27;t need this product because I don&#x27;t suck my thumb or bite my nails.</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking from my son from day 1 of putting this on!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s just something wrong with my child.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m experiencing the taste, I get so angry at myself for buying this product because it&#x27;s just THAT</li>
            <li> We kept the polish on for 2 weeks but after 3-4 days the habit was broken!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for us.  </li>
            <li> We tried thum, and it failed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately she cried and vomited for the taste</li>
            <li> and I immediately felt guilty.  </li>
            <li> 9 hours later (including a shower along with washing dishes, and scrubbing at it), my thumb still tastes VERY BAD!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my child continues to suck her thumb even with a freshly-applied coat of Mavala Stop.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it works as well and</li>
            <li> Now I almost feel guilty for putting it on her because I miss seeing her with her thumb in her mouth all the time.</li>
            <li> but they were all so expensive.</li>
            <li> my husband and I made the difficult decision to cut all of her hair off in order to break the habit.</li>
            <li> Maybe my kid is weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately he then decided he would just keep sucking his thumb until the stuff wore off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> This stays on for 4-5 days and definitely has a horrible taste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not make me stop biting.</li>
            <li> My food and especially when you&#x27;re washing your face, I hated that!</li>
            <li> My son bites his nails terribly and this is the only thing that stops him.</li>
            <li> tried lots of nasty tasting nail lotions from various drug</li>
            <li> We used it 4 weeks and now just at random to ensure compliance.</li>
            <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately, i&#x27;m going to have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about Mavala and ordered it with big hopes he will stop this terrible habit.</li>
            <li> She skeptically looked at me and didn&#x27;t fully understand until she tried to suck her thumb at nap time.</li>
            <li> I finally decided it was a nasty habit, and it was time to stop.</li>
            <li> I think this is finally going to help him break this nasty habit!!</li>
            <li> It has only been one week, but I haven&#x27;t seen fingers in the mouth, as this stuff is really nasty.</li>
            <li> Beware it is sad to see them have to go through it</li>
            <li> I was about to buy the expensive plastic glove thing, but ended up using this instead.</li>
            <li> I applied the product several times and she said it did indeed taste horrible.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, his 3-year-old sister had followed in his footsteps and had begun to bite HER fingernails.</li>
            <li> It worked for about a week, but I could not stop biting my nails since it is such a horrible habit.</li>
            <li> For the record, our son does not seem to have suffered any ill effects after 4 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because the product is made in Switzerland, holding its makers accountable for any adverse effects that might occur would be difficult.  </li>
            <li> I worried that she may protest and make it difficult to apply</li>
            <li> unfortunately we have to put the \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; on each nail because she just decides to switch fingers.</li>
            <li> I wanted to nip the problem in the bud before it got too difficult to deal with.</li>
            <li> to try something else unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took merely one-and-a-half weeks of before I got the message.</li>
            <li> Part of it is his personality, but a big part is whatever it was that made this stuff nasty and stay on his thumb.</li>
            <li> Eating foods with your fingers is tricky because this polish makes your entire finger taste something terrible.</li>
            <li> My nails look terrible and the front teeth are starting to wear from the years of bitting.</li>
            <li> so I was quite skeptical that this would work, but</li>
            <li> When she is bored, in the car, when she sleeps.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work then, but he also hadn&#x27;t had any taste buds he&#x27;d eat anything.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this includes when I am eating finger foods.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to watch.</li>
            <li> (I personally think it tastes awful, but I&#x27;m not the one with a nail biting problem.)</li>
            <li> He woke up several times because he put his thumb in his mouth and it tasted awful</li>
            <li> Sorry Mavala but just hasn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I found myself on the receiving end by accident at one point and it definitely taste horrible.</li>
            <li> Finally something that has helped me with the worst habit of mine!</li>
            <li> , I feel sorry for him to be resisting something</li>
            <li> I put some of the polish on my arm and the next time he bit me he hated it!</li>
            <li> They just weren&#x27;t awful enough.  </li>
            <li> bit my nails for years and years, but finally kicked the habit when I became a nurse and realized how disgusting a person&#x27;s hands can be.</li>
            <li> The taste then lingers in your mouth and is difficult to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> poor thing couldn&#x27;t even eat pizza!  </li>
            <li> Tastes truly awful, and takes a while to set completely, so only apply after a meal.  </li>
            <li> The taste of this is so disgusting that not only do I not bite my nails when it&#x27;s on them</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry for kids who have to suffer like this because of this habit</li>
            <li> The awful taste was enough to make him stop biting his nails and skin around them within days!</li>
            <li> He told me the next morning that he put his fingers in his mouth while he as asleep and the horrible taste woke him up</li>
            <li> Thumb sucking and nail biting are difficult habits to break.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical if this would help my son, who was finger sucking addict.  </li>
            <li> It was very tough</li>
            <li> b/c he usually sucks on his fingers to sooth him to sleep, and then said he was sick b/c of the stuff on his fingers.</li>
            <li> It was very unpleasant but did not make her gag or leave a unpleasant taste for so long it interfered with her  drinking or eating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and goes on like water, so you won&#x27;t go through a lot of it.</li>
            <li> it was hard to see him struggle :(</li>
            <li> Small price to pay to break an annoying habit.</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible so as long as you keep</li>
            <li> Often I taste it on my lips for a long, disgusting duration.</li>
            <li> It also gave me a terrible four day long stomach ache</li>
            <li> The taste is aweful and lingers long after the bite, making it truly awful and helping to kick the habit.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awful tasting and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and has a terrible long-lasting taste.  </li>
            <li> Not more than 10 hours after applying the product did I learn how horrible the taste is, and now I have to seriously consider how I&#x27;m going to floss at night.</li>
            <li> The full bottle is still sitting on my vanity, as a constant reminder of that horrible, terrifying, disgusting taste should I ever slip and bite my nails again.  </li>
            <li> Because it tastes so horrible and the taste lingers for a very long time..</li>
            <li> That stuff did not taste bad at all, however, Mavala Stop tasted horrible and immediately stopped my 3 year old daughter from suckking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> My fingers nails now taste so bad that I cant even get them near my lips with out tasting the nasty, lingering flavor.</li>
            <li> My husband has had a life-long habit of biting his knuckles...which not only drives me crazy, but his gnawing just leaves gateways for all those nasty germs that are out there to hop on in.  </li>
            <li> I swim everyday and even when I get out of the pool after an hours swim they still taste bad!</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old, and after 22 or so years of biting my nails, I was absolutely SICK of my disgusting, infected nails.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to eat finger foods, because when you eat all i can taste is the bitterness, its bad if you get hair in your mouth because you will also taste the nail polish trying to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> However, that being said, the improvement is dramatic!</li>
            <li> it is really not that bad, not pleasant, but not anything too terrible.  </li>
            <li> The taste stays on your tongue and is enough to make me gag a little, but it isn&#x27;t terrible and a drink will get rid of the worst of it.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the nasty taste removed any enjoyment or stress relief I got from biting my nails since it was so incredibly unpleasant.</li>
            <li> She hated it at first, and said it was the worst thing she&#x27;d ever tasted.</li>
            <li> The bitter taste was so awful that my 4yo didn&#x27;t dare try it again.  </li>
            <li> It is so bitter and nasty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mavala has a terrible, bitter taste and each application lasts for many&lt;br /&gt;days.  </li>
            <li> I was making a salad for lunch and the disgusting bitter, chemically taste of this product</li>
            <li> that I found annoying was that at least THUM lists the ingredients that it contains, for this product</li>
            <li> My son is a terrible nail bitter.</li>
            <li> It tastes disgusting and bitter, which is something you might expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe  the bitter, chemical like taste it has, it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is bitter and nasty.</li>
            <li> I put on my son who is a real bad nail bitter.  </li>
            <li> He said the taste is disgusting and a couple of times he accidentally got a taste of it while eating finger foods, so be careful when doing that.</li>
            <li> If you rub or touch your nails with your fingertips, when eating something that you picked up with your hands, you will get to taste the horrible bitter taste of this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awful bitter taste that lingers for what seems like hours.</li>
            <li> It does taste very bad, so it prevents me from mindlessly gnawing away while studying.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it makes eating any finger foods impossible because the taste stays on your fingers and when you lick your fingers it taste so nasty and the taste even stays on your lips.</li>
            <li> i recommend this to everyone out there that is just sick and tired of biting their nails</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t want to use any nasty tasting stuff on her fingers because we thought it would be so traumatic, but due to her age and the threat of swine flu, we decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Due to this nasty tasting side effect he has gotten to where he won&#x27;t use it all the time.</li>
            <li> makes finger foods taste nasty though when u use your fingers to eat with otherwise item works extremely well .</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t have an awful, gagging reaction like other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> The taste is awful, but not to the point of him ever gagging as I had read in other reviews before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very dramatic anyway</li>
            <li> She said it didn&#x27;t taste awful, but tasted bad enough to act as a reminder that she was biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> he wouldn&#x27;t want to suck the thumb bad enough to have that awful taste in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually get a taste of it until I forgot the stuff was on and put my fingers in my mouth and was shocked to how horrible it tastes.</li>
            <li> i must have one tough toddler.. :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an awful, bitter foul tasting - it makes you stop in your tracks!!  </li>
            <li> The taste is really bitter and unpleasant, but the worst part is that you can&#x27;t get it out of your mouth once you&#x27;ve touched your finger to your lips.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible and shocking at first, but I think if kids are stubborn they will keep doing it.  </li>
            <li> This polish tastes terrible and awful and yucky, but that is exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> And it is especially hard to try to make her stop when she has no desire to stop.</li>
            <li> My fingers periodically touched my lips while I was eating, and the nasty taste would rub off slightly.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks he used it, I could always tell when he tried to bite again, because I&#x27;d hear this awful \\&quot;AHHH!!\\&quot; as he&#x27;d be running to the bathroom to wash out his mouth--it tasted awful!</li>
            <li> Even weeks in, after I put my fingers in my mouth considerably less, I have a terribly sore throat.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, it taste nasty and whatever you touch with this thing on your nail, it will taste nasty too.</li>
            <li> This product is gr8, if you have a thumb sucker dont hesitate to buy it and apply it!!!</li>
            <li> a nutshell, Mavala Stop tastes so awful and so bitter that it&#x27;s impossible to bite your nails while it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing in this product to harm your child in any way (no burning or stinging, etc), just a very nasty taste that will keep their little fingers away from their mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I could put a little one through the experience of the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> My little boy had a terrible problem, we even had our dentist install an appliance in his mouth with no luck.</li>
            <li> Her baby teeth are a little flared from all the sucking; her 2 fingers looked terrible and she was always getting colds and viruses.</li>
            <li> Just when you think it has worn off, you&#x27;ll get a disgusting little surprise.  </li>
            <li> My little 3yr bites his nails terribly, and would even go at his toenails when he&#x27;s done with his finger nails.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get the horrific, bitter taste of this stuff in your mouth as often!!!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it, and unfortunately the bad habit kicked in yet again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately once she figured out what was causing her fingers to taste bad</li>
            <li> Just wiping your mouth can be dangerous.  </li>
            <li> After years of fidgeting with awkward appliances to put on my kids&#x27; hands to help them stop sucking their fingers/thumbs, I found this.  </li>
            <li> I licked my finger nail after the product had dried and it was AWFUL!</li>
            <li> then she went crazy after they were on and kept getting her thumb out</li>
            <li> but you you wont lick your fingers after eating chicken or chips.</li>
            <li> she STOPPED COLD.</li>
            <li> I was desperate</li>
            <li> So if you plan to use this, try not to eat things like fried chicken, tacos or chips.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;social\\&quot; situations, kinda awkward to explain to a chick what that taste is...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s BAD, bitter, nasty, not just spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was desperate to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I read a handful of  reviews and besides one unhappy parent.  </li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t expect her to go cold turkey after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> but when I say that it is nasty I REALLY want to emphasize just how nasty that it is.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid of what this was doing to his teeth, and bitting his nails</li>
            <li> If you try to take meat out of a cold meat container, you run the risk of contaminating the meat underneath.</li>
            <li> I now put it on about 1x a week and am regularly cutting her nails.</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;m afraid to use the product for fear of tampering or tainting.</li>
            <li> I wear disposable latex gloves when I&#x27;m cutting fruit/vegetables, making sandwiches, etc.  </li>
            <li> She is  afraid of what it will taste like.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing for me.  </li>
            <li> chicken nuggets and mac-n-cheese.  </li>
            <li> it has a horrible taste to it that lingers in the mouth and on the lips for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> For some inexplicable reason the vet used dissolvable stitches and told us not to let her lick them at all for TWO WEEKS.  </li>
            <li> I had tried cold turkey, fidgeting with toys, and even wearing gloves but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> He quit cold turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well my son was so afraid of tasting it that he never even tried.  </li>
            <li> i am afraid to bite them because of the taste of this product.</li>
            <li> and he is afraid of scarring.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated my hands because my hands looked boyish with my icky chewed nails.</li>
            <li> It REALLY REALLY REALLY Taste horrible, disgusting stuff.</li>
            <li> We did have a bit of trouble with her eating fruit etc with her fingers as some of the product would transfer onto the food and make it taste horrible</li>
            <li> She started crying about how nasty it was</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn their nose, like I was afraid it might, and they don&#x27;t dare put their fingers into their mouth.</li>
            <li> This stuff works--so would cutting your kids hands off.</li>
            <li> This product literally stopped his habit cold turkey.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something.  </li>
            <li> We were desperate and decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> Tastes dreadful and after a few &amp;#34;forgetful&amp;#34; tastes,</li>
            <li> Got my husband to stop cold turkey</li>
            <li> With her baby teeth falling out and permanent teeth coming in, we were desperate to help her break this habit.</li>
            <li> that the FDA official did not indicate that the product was necessarily dangerous.  </li>
            <li> BUT IN THE BEGINNING IT DID STOP HIM COLD.</li>
            <li> awkwardly, but still.  </li>
            <li> but it would make eating a disappointing as well.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on the taste lasts for a few days and what an awful taste it is.</li>
            <li> He has tubes in his ears as he suffers from recurrent ear infections.</li>
            <li> He gagged and salivated all day, so I gave him a washcloth to help him get the taste out and to absorb the crazy amount of saliva he was producing.</li>
            <li> I had chicken pizza, touched the pizza with my Mavala-coated fingers, ate the pizza, and guess what I tasted.</li>
            <li> Bad bitter disgusting after taste.</li>
            <li> i was desperate to find a product that would prevent me from putting my hands in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> stuff IS a desperate measure.  </li>
            <li> and we were desperate to stop the finger sucking before he ended up one of those kids who are always getting picked on.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, the thumb sucking has stopped, but for a week, I&#x27;ve felt like the mother of a sick newborn as she would wake up every 30 minutes gagging and screaming when she&#x27;d unconciously stuck her thumb in her mouth...</li>
            <li> This stuff taste terrible and I try to apply it every day - it definitely helped me stop my bad habit!</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be sorry you did!</li>
            <li> He was mad everytime</li>

            <li> he would suck his thumb as usual and just got used to the horrible taste ,,</li>
            <li> but this proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the chili powder experience, but after ONE application, he stopped!</li>
            <li> I just think he&#x27;s that dedicated and looks past the terrible taste.  </li>
            <li> She had a difficult time eating and sleeping!</li>
            <li> But that is a small price to pay to kick a habit that is disgusting and embarassing.</li>

            <li> I had seen some VERY expensive finger gaurds to prevent thumb/finger sucking</li>
            <li> He said it was horrible tasting and that he couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of his mouth for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; became a fairly common heard word when she would experience the nasty flavor of this stuff.</li>
            <li> this stuff tastes HORRIBLE and lasts for at least 2-3 days (if you&#x27;ve accidentally tasted earwax, imagine that but 100 times stronger).</li>

            <li> The flavor is really bad, not something I could get used to.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re not digging around in your food or licking your fingers, for some reason the bad taste doesn&#x27;t seem to restrict itself to my fingernail where I painted it on.  </li>
            <li> and it still tastes bad,</li>
            <li> making his food taste bad.  </li>
            <li> Stop tastes really bad.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s that bad, I can&#x27;t stop it</li>
            <li> if I knew how terrible this was I never would have put it on my poor girl</li>
            <li> I was shocked he let me paint it on.  </li>
            <li> grrr...</li>
            <li> This is terrible, acrid, worse than hell itself.</li>
            <li> I was shocked -</li>
            <li> Her Dad and I were shocked as were her teachers.</li>
            <li> My daughter was shocked when we put it on her tumb</li>
            <li> Looking at my hands and how ugly my fingers looked</li>
            <li> and I get the ugly taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hated it for years and been unable to stop.</li>
            <li> It was painful and looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tastes sufficiently awful, and she was broken of the habit within a month.  </li>
            <li> I  was shocked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely painful</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated not having nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;He sometimes does get frustrated with it at night and thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes AWFUL and you will be spitting and making an awful face trying to get the incredibly bitter taste out of your mouth for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t so bad that it&#x27;ll make you sick</li>
            <li> I checked on my daughter and she was sucking her thumb but not getting sick.  </li>
            <li> When she went to bed we did use a glove so she didn&#x27;t suck it in the night and get sick.</li>
            <li> My mom was so sick of my nail bitting that she even offered me rewards to quit.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want your child getting sick.  </li>
            <li> I reassured her and explained that the stop sucking polish could make her sick in her tummy if she put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> havent been sick again</li>
            <li> He loves to play in the sand box and we were concerned that he was going to get sick from the dirt on his hand.  </li>
            <li> The sucking was causing them to frequently be sick with colds.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t get sick and it didn&#x27;t bother him.</li>
            <li> Whatever it is made them sick</li>
            <li> but it does stink to know that you are the cause of making your child get sick.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this for me because he&#x27;s so sick of always seeing my picking at and biting my nails.</li>
            <li> youngest son just turned 3 and chewed and sucked his fingers continually and as a result was getting sick continuously.  </li>
            <li> I removed the Mavala once because I got sick of it messing with my snack food flavors</li>
            <li> Based on reviews of children getting sick, I wore the polish for 3 days and &amp;#34;tasted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had no issues with feeling sick after tasting the polish, nor did my daughter.  </li>
            <li> He was sick all day.</li>
            <li> He claims he is not deterred by this stuff, but he acts sick if he puts his hands in his mouth with this applied.</li>
            <li> We talked about how he was getting sick all the time in kindergarten</li>
            <li> I was sick of hearing my boyfriends man hand jokes.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they dont allow return :(</li>
            <li> It is nasty, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn or anything like that, just leaves you with a nasty taste in your month for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It may help you, but didn&#x27;t work for us :(</li>
            <li> It stopped him cold!</li>
            <li> My son said his fingers taste yucky but he was still biting his nails :(</li>
            <li> I put it on my son&#x27;s finger and it stopped him from sucking it for maybe 5 minutes :(</li>
            <li> She looks at me with defiance and starts sucking her fingers any way. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle, expired, or if the product was just crap, but this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Hope it works for you.  : (</li>
            <li> Does help in reducing the duration, but somehow I think she is getting to like the taste of it :-(</li>
            <li> I tried it when he was three and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> but I tend to forget to do it that often :(  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t even phase him :(</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her at all :(</li>
            <li> , i was disappointed  </li>
            <li> and it was a horrible taste, difficult to completly remove even with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that instead of biting i was picking my nails off instead :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li> It was crazy!  </li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I do have 2 complaints: it is expensive  and if you eat finger foods you can taste the horrible polish on the food.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed to find out</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, somehow the nasty taste got onto my floss!</li>
            <li> Ill admit it is very nasty</li>
            <li> Here is the amazon product link: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> but after that it was a no go. :-(</li>
            <li> He outsmarted me :(</li>
            <li> will have to look for another alternative :(</li>
            <li> Things were so bad that i no longer had nails in my hands, just bloody nailbeds.</li>
            <li> But remember it tastes terrible, I mean really terrible.</li>
            <li> So obviously I am very unhappy with this order and would not suggest anyone else order it.</li>
            <li> She became very distraught to the taste of the Mavala on her fingers</li>
            <li> this is my solution but was sadly mistaken!!  </li>
            <li> I have finally broken the habit!!!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!!</li>
            <li> Well I didn&#x27;t want that as the fact that she is really thin already, but eats like a horse!!!</li>
            <li> He hated the taste so bad that he would wash his mouth and rub a cloth on his tongue  to get the taste off.</li>
            <li> For years we stupidly trusted mommy blogs that encouraged readers to avoid polish methods for thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I feel so stupid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to stop you in your tracks and leave a lingering reminder to not be stupid and try and put your finger or thumb in your mouth again.  </li>
            <li> I figured holy crap look at the reviews, I got nothing to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The annoying part is that because i&#x27;m a guy, I never put on nailpolish and it kinda goes beyond my nails and the day i put i on, i have to avoid eating things with my hands.</li>
            <li> i got it and holy crap it taste like an onion on stararoids.</li>
            <li> It is worthless.</li>
            <li> makes eating finger food annoying while using it because the smallest amount seems to stay in your mouth for 10 or 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to see him ruin them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m almost afraid it&#x27;s TOO nasty...  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate putting my hands in my mouth with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> cause they will hate the flavor.</li>
            <li> Kids hate it.</li>
            <li> I look at my bloody cuticles &amp; remember why.</li>
            <li> My kids hate the taste and it lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> My kids hate this stuff -</li>
            <li> The kids hate the taste.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my reaction to tasting it was so violent that it has been 3 days</li>
            <li> But I hate getting acrylic nails</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll hate me for it, but your nails won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but his habit got worsened and annoying.</li>
            <li> (They put the acrylic liquid stuff at the base of your nail, where it has grown out.</li>
            <li> they hate the taste of this and complain about it always.</li>
            <li> I hate it in the sense of the taste.</li>
            <li> Taste like crap..  </li>
            <li> He has blisters and calouses at the base of his thumbs.  </li>
            <li> but that God-awful taste sent a shocking inexplicable surge.</li>
            <li> I hate biting my nails now.</li>
            <li> and I desperately wanted him to shake the disgusting habit.</li>
            <li> I suggest to just put it on the base of their thumb...</li>
            <li> and it lasted for hours - blech.</li>
            <li> It just became annoying.</li>
            <li> One annoying thing is that it wears off after a couple days, and I have to keep reapplying it, but that can&#x27;t be helped.</li>
            <li> They may hate you</li>
            <li> His teeth have gotten really bad and he has been getting horrible canker sores in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, its horrible to give you child something that tastes so bad.</li>
            <li> The taste is not so bad that I am miserable when i accidentally taste it when cooking, but it is a hassle if you like to cook.  </li>
            <li> I tried ti myself and it was TERRIBLE tasting, and I felt bad but the damage was done and it worked,</li>
            <li> and we hoped this would stop a bad and nasty habit.  </li>
            <li> She said it tasted bad but, would often just keep doing it with a disgusted look on her face.  </li>
            <li> Every time I put my hand up to my mouth without thinking about it I smell the horrible rancid smell and remember how Bad it&#x27;s gonna taste.</li>
            <li> Whatever the cause, his nails looked horrible, were painful for him and were bleeding.</li>
            <li> I felt bad, but that was the point of the product!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter stopped her bad habit!</li>
            <li> bad habit eliminated!</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have just given up trying to give up your bad habit, buy this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bad habit for 10+ years!</li>
            <li> I was so shocked!</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t get sick and she quit sucking her thumb!  </li>
            <li> she was already sucking her thumb, I asked if she hated the way her thumb tasted</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nasty and they hate it</li>
            <li> She describes the taste to what bug repellent imagines to taste like.</li>
            <li> But as a finger food eater, I hated it</li>
            <li> and i hated my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Initially he hated the taste.  </li>
            <li> She hated Mavala and her thumb sucking has subsided.</li>
            <li> She absolutely hated the taste.  </li>
            <li> He hated it, but didm&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I applied the product and she hated the taste</li>
            <li> I NEVER TASTED IT, BUT MY KIDDO HATED THE TASTE AND STOPPED THE BITING HABIT AFTER 2 WEEKS..</li>
            <li> My daughter hated the taste but continued to suck her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Its disgusting and annoying.</li>
            <li> I hated that my friend bit his nails.</li>
            <li> He hated the taste and begged for milk..</li>
            <li> It was horrifying.</li>
            <li> I hated having to try this on our daughter, but we had to do something because her thumb was getting blistered from her thumb-sucking when she slept.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated it but stopped sucking her thumb after 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> he hated the taste....</li>
            <li> I hated the way my hands looked and gave this a try.</li>
            <li> He hated it and demanded a drink to wash the taste away</li>
            <li> She hated it and was vomiting.</li>
            <li> She hated the taste which kept her thumb out of her mouth</li>
            <li> She hated the taste of this but didn&#x27;t mind me putting it on because it goes on as if you are putting nail polish on her fingers.  </li>
            <li> and he really hated the taste</li>
            <li> and it was getting very bad.  </li>
            <li> that if she put her fingers in, it would taste very bad.  </li>
            <li> So I knew that this stuff tasted VERY BAD</li>
            <li> The taste is VERY bad and helps remind me to keep my nails out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> But a very bad habit as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping my 9 year stop a very bad nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> It tastes very bad and keeps my 2 year son from Thumb Sucking.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my then three-year-old daughter, who had a very bad habit of sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I got some on my hands and it made my dinner taste very bad.</li>
            <li> (ouch!  very painful).  </li>
            <li> he no longer sucks his thumb!!!!!</li>
            <li> we had tried another product but, made her very sick.  </li>
            <li> Just disappointed!</li>
            <li> and you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed when as soon as the cast came off, the habit immediately continued.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> (2013 &amp; 2014)I was very disappointed because after a while of trying this every time that I would put it on she would keep sucking her finger or try to rub her fingers in the bed to take what I had put in her nail to take it off</li>
            <li> It has also helped with dieting - not intentionally, however it is difficult to finish eating a meal when you forgot and licked sauce off of your finger and YUK!!!</li>
            <li> Our daughter could suck her thumb with no problem and this stuff tastes NASTY!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> stuff tastes absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> When I was dating my wife, she had a terrible habit of biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: it tastes  horrible.</li>
            <li> Nasty</li>
            <li> just awful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nasty surprise when you&#x27;re eating chips or wings</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself because I have a terrible habit of biting my fingernails without even realizing it.</li>
            <li> She said it was nasty.  </li>
            <li> (I made that mistake once and it was awful).  </li>
            <li> It tastes awful!</li>
            <li> There was some drooling and gagging because it is some nasty tasting stuff</li>
            <li> but it does taste horrible.</li>
            <li> Man, this some seriously nasty stuff.  </li>
            <li> Worst part is, it DOES NOT leave your mouth.  </li>
            <li> but once I learned how horrible it tasted</li>
            <li> This product works miracles because it is so dang disgusting.</li>
            <li> I was so fed up with his nasty looking nails (or lack there of)</li>
            <li> The stuff is NASTY!!!!</li>
            <li> She freaked at how nasty the stuff was and cried and cried!!!</li>
            <li> It was so disgusting to her</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated the taste so she refused to let me put it on!</li>
            <li> sucked and the taste was horrible that she threw up.</li>
            <li> By contrast, Mavala maintains a nasty taste through the course of the day.  </li>
            <li> (I put some on my nail to test it out) and has a nasty after taste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails horribly for almost 30 years, and tried all sorts of habit-breaking tactics to try and quit.</li>
            <li> The product tastes horrible but I wsh</li>
            <li> the taste was horrible (he said it tasted like a mixtue of poop, sand and throw up)!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I tasted the product myself and it is terrible.</li>
            <li> Made this mom feel horrible for using it on his nails!</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible!  </li>
            <li> and she HATED it!  </li>
            <li> A very nasty metallic taste.&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
            <li> It taste TERRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t quite understand why because the taste is horrible!</li>
            <li> Taste horrible.</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible - and works!</li>
            <li> It has a very nasty taste that stays on the nail for days...  </li>
            <li> he makes the funniest face of disgust and tells me it is disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Our 6-year-old daughter just couldn&#x27;t seem to shake her awful thumb-sucking habit, until we found this product.  </li>
            <li> The thing I like, yet one that drives me so insane is.. that I always tend to bite my nails or smoke when I get hungry..</li>
            <li> I am eating the pizza now, with the horrible taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried everything to get him to stop this horrible habit:</li>
            <li> It tastes disgusting.  </li>
            <li> but it is awful tasting.</li>
            <li> the taste (which is awful) will go away and the habit will continue.</li>
            <li> I tried it and let me tell you, it is disgusting!  </li>
            <li> I guess he got used to the awful taste.  </li>
            <li> The immediate terrible and lingering taste would remind me what I was doing and allow me to stop it.  </li>
            <li> It works but my son learned be could just scrape the nasty taste off with his teeth.</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> The taste is awful!</li>
            <li> the taste was so horrible</li>
            <li> it was DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really really nasty and the taste does linger in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible you can&#x27;t eat with your hands like a sandwich without hating it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for 25 years, it is a disgusting habit that I wish to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> I have never tasted something so horrible.</li>
            <li> The stuff DOES taste NASTY.  </li>
            <li> DISGUSTING!!!</li>
            <li> It tastes awful!</li>
            <li> Because the nail doesn&#x27;t immediately touch the tongue, she doesn&#x27;t taste the nasty stuff until she removes her fingers and her tongue touches the roof of her mouth.</li>

            <li> I have never tasted anything so nasty</li>
            <li> About a month ago, after two days or REAL bad biting, I decided I needed to find a way to stop biting again.</li>

            <li> My wife was worried I was being cruel, so, I tried some.</li>
            <li> I do believe this product would work for any child that isn&#x27;t so insanely stubborn.  </li>
            <li> We have been using it for a week, applying liberally every 1-2 days and the kids hate the taste and thus do not bite or suck on their fingers!</li>
            <li> It does taste awful.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible.</li>

            <li> Talk about disgusting!!</li>
            <li> and she said it tastes terrible.</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you will end-up with a child who is both traumatized and on a hunger strike because of the horrible taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it was horrible</li>

            <li> The taste is simply awful, which is what is needed to help you stop biting your nails!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product, though applied properly, transferred to any food my son touched and he tried to quit eating for days because nothing tasted right. However it also didn&#x27;t stop him from the fingers in the mouth either.</li>
            <li> Helped my 4 year old daughter stop chewing her nails. I kept it on her for about a week but after she went back to biting. Applied it for an additional two weeks then stopped. We are not applying it anymore and have been about 3 weeks bite free. Works for my husband as well as long as I can get him to put it on.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 5 stars. We first tried using this on our 2.5 yr old for thumb sucking and it didn&#x27;t work. I realize it is not recommended for under 3 as their taste buds are not developed yet. Well, I guess that&#x27;s right. Our daughter could suck her thumb with no problem and this stuff tastes NASTY!!! I somehow have accidentally tasted it several times and needed gum to get rid of the taste. Now, our lovely 3.5 year still sucks her thumb. We continue to try to use this - but probably could be more consistent. She still manages to suck her thumb (although she doesn&#x27;t like the taste). We would need to do 2 coats and reapply several times throughout the day for it to hold its yucky power.  A lot of maintenance. I&#x27;m still giving this product 4 stars as we have tried several other products that really don&#x27;t work at all. This one does, but at least for us and our incredibly oral child, it still is not a perfect solution to end thumbsucking</li>
            <li> MEN: THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is extremely shiny--certainly as shiny as women&#x27;s nail polish. The fact that it&#x27;s transparent does not take away from the fact that any self-respecting man would be embarrassed to walk around with extremely shiny nails. Very disappointed. I&#x27;m returning this ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: THE TASTE GOES AWAY VERY QUICKLY. I tasted and it tasted moderately sharp and then went away quickly. If you were biting because of nervousness, I think you would easily overcome the bad taste and keep going. I&#x27;m so disappointed in the zillion positive reviews. Why did you not point these two things out?</li>
            <li> works a little too well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my almost 3 year old daughter. Worked perfect in 1 week. Soooooo glad it worked. Her thumb sucking has completely stopped. Very worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Helped both of my children stop sucking their thumbs. Would definitely recommend this product to everyone with a thumb-sucker.</li>
            <li> Did not deter my child from biting his nails.. the search continues....!</li>
            <li> My nails are longer than they&#x27;ve ever been after using this product for less than a month. Definitely works</li>
            <li> This product stopped my 4 year old;s nail biting habit in under a month. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help my seven year old stop thumb sucking- I wish I&#x27;d have done this YEARS ago!! It worked in 1 treatment!! I never tasted the stuff but my poor boy did mention that it was &#x27;icky&#x27; (which it&#x27;s obviously supposed to be ;)) nice product and definitely gets the job done</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes TERRIBLE. But since that&#x27;s the point and it has lasted 3 days through 2 showers and probably about 20 hand washings, I&#x27;m rating five stars. Haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since applying it. Took twice to learn that&#x27;s a bad idea with this stuff?</li>
            <li> Absolutely gray product.  My youngest old quit sucking her thumb Within two days of wearing it. My middle child is stubborn with biting his nails but we are getting there. My oldest stopped biting her nails within a couple days. Great.  Great.</li>
            <li> Great product it really works</li>
            <li> I am a mental health counselor in Phoenix, and for as long as I remember having teeth and fingernails, I have put the two together.  In the past I have tried a number of different approaches including other polishes - some nasty, some spicy, and some which served just as a reminder as the light reflected off my nails and into my eyes.  I have covered my fingernails with band-aids, applied small hairbands around the tips of each finger, employed the rubber-band on the wrist technique, and even underwent psychotherapy for the issue.  All to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having had no fewer than dozens of serious infections, two of which prompted my physician to emphasize the urgency of this matter - and after having removed the white part of my middle finger nail on my dominant hand (while leaving the remainder in tact) on two separate occasions, I thought I would give it one more try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that this is going to stop you from biting your nails - because the behavior exists for a reason, and until we either substitute a different behavior or remove the need for the behavior, we&#x27;re going to continue to pacitfy ourselves by ramming our fingers in between our teeth and gnawing as if we were ravenous dogs.  That being said, if you have the desire to quit and the will power to discontinue a behavior when it is brought to your attention, there is a chance that this product will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes absolutely horrible.  It is, quite simply, the most vile flavor I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth before.  I&#x27;m a bit of a glutton, though.  I painted my nails with Mavala Stop and, after it dried, decided I just HAD to know what it tasted like... so I licked my nail.  I sure won&#x27;t do that again.  Others have pointed out that this product rubs off on other things, and I definitely agree with that.  The taste found its way onto both my cup of water and my apple cider pancakes.  It certainly isn&#x27;t something I will intentional put anywhere near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to the greatest benefit of this product - self awareness.  There&#x27;s nothing to jolt me from a nice afternoon gnawing at my nails quite as well as the flavor of a bottle of nail polish concentrated on one fingernail.  While making those delicious apple-cider pancakes, a little batter got onto my finger.  Without thinking, I stuck my finger into my mouth.  It. was. horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two issues I see with the polish:  The first is that it relies upon user compliance with the application regimen.  The bottle suggests that it be re-applied every two days.  I know, though, that I&#x27;m not going to remember to do it every other day, and so I&#x27;m going to be doing it daily, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is the shine.  As you can see in the photo, this product has a shine comparable to that of other clear nail polishes.  It does not have a matte finish and is not a liquid which is simply absorbed into the nail... so this may draw unwanted attention to unsightly nails.  Really, though, I&#x27;d rather have the attention to pitted, cracked, and short nails, than I would to a swollen, red finger filled with some sort of infectious goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, if you are consistent in applying Mavala Stop to your finger nails, and you make an honest effort, this product will serve well as a tool to help you get the beautiful nails you deserve!/&gt;That brings me to the greatest benefit of this product - self awareness.

            <li> Broke my daughter&#x27;s sucking on the thumb habit in two days.</li>
            <li> i am one never to trust reviews or delve into gimmicks, this time i needed a product for my three year old to stop the thumb sucking. So it was eigther this or braces in the future. My little one also started to get a bruised thumb. This product did work three days and thats it. I even tried it and yes it does taste bad.</li>
            <li> It worked immediately. My two year old stopped sucking her thumb the whole weekend! But by monday morning i forgot to reapply and she started back. So...i reapplied and the taste no longer bothers her. I keep trying,but she continues. Almost! But you should try it and just know you should apply daily...</li>
            <li> When I was dating my wife, she had a terrible habit of biting her nails.  Since I wanted to put a ring on her finger and she was awfully conscious of her nails, I decided to buy this for her.  After a few applications and several distasteful experiences, she quit biting her nails.  The negative reinforcement was exactly what she needed.  She used so little of the product that she was able to give it to someone else who had a similar positive experience with it.  She hasn&#x27;t bit her nails in quite a while!</li>
            <li> Recieved order quickly but the bottle was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> My five year old started kindergarten this year! While I&#x27;m really enjoying watching her learn new things, I hate some of the behaviors she has picked up from other children! One of those said behaviors was sucking on her fingers. Yes all of her fingers not just her thumbs. This started off as a minor annoyance and swiftly turned into a truly obnoxious behavior. She would literally have her hands shoved in her mouth constantly she would even try to talk while sucking on her hand. Then two of her milk teeth became loose and fell out in which I realized that this habitual hand sucking habit could potentially alter the locations of her emerging adult teeth. So I began searching for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Mavala stop as a last resort thinking it would be cruel and now I wish I would have ordered it months prior. I explained to her what I was applying to her fingers and why I was doing it. After a brief discussion I put this on her nails (two coats) and seriously she stopped putting her hands in her mouth within an hour of application. I reapplied it every night for 3-4 days and she has not put her hand nor a finger in her mouth for the past month. I highly recommend this product if you have a little hand or thumb sucker in your life!</li>
            <li> We tried several different things to help our 3 year old stop sucking her thumb. Nothing really seemed to work. We tried for about 9 months and then decided to order Mavala Stop. We noticed within a couple days that she really wasn&#x27;t sucking her thumb anymore. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks now and we&#x27;ve stopped putting it on her thumbs!!! So glad we purchased it!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so bad.  My daughter bites her nails until they bleed.  We&#x27;ve tried so many things and when I saw everyone singing the praises of this product I thought, \\&quot;A ha.\\&quot;  But.........it honestly..........doesn&#x27;t even taste bad at all.  It tastes just like regular nail polish--maybe a hint stronger, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I have five year old twins.  Our dentist told them they must stop sucking their thumbs and offered us a $70 product (Thumbguard) to help them quit.  I decided to try this first especially since one of the twins sucks either thumb so I would need 3 Thumbguards!  It has only been a couple of weeks but it looks like it has worked beautifully.  I am still putting it on their thumbs just as a reminder.  Both of them are so proud of themselves for quitting!  We&#x27;ll see if I need to resort to anything else but so far, I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5 months later: Still no thumb sucking!  This stuff works.  I have only had one relapse and the Mavala cleared it up in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Up until my daughter was four years old, she loved sucking her finger. At night when she slept, she did not realize she was sucking her finger. We put the Mavalo on her fingernails and it worked like a charm. She is now six years old and she has not gone back to sucking her finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint - If you have a resistant child, who does not want the nail polish on their nails, you can put the Mavalo on their nails while they sleep.</li>
            <li> My twis finally stoped sucking their thumbs at the age of 5:)&lt;br /&gt;For my girl, it took three nights. She woke up serveral times in the middle of the night asking me to wash her teeth (the only way the bad taste goes away) because she forgot and sucked her thumb, and the tast is very bad. After that she completely stoped. For my boy, he tasted it only once, and never put his thumb in his mouth again with this thing on it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I had to explain it to them, and they agree they want to stop, and even it taste so bad we will put it every night.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, the boy forgot one day and suck his thumb again while sleeping, but I think maybe he felt unsecure that day for some reason. If he do it again I&#x27;ll start using this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: it tastes  horrible. One time it didn&#x27;t try well, and my kid touched it with his other hand, and it ended in my mouth when I kissed his hand:)&lt;br /&gt;Also when he was easting a messy food, it changed the taste of the food.&lt;br /&gt;But in the end it worth it. My twins teeth aleady don&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> When you are eating finger foods, you taste the product on your mouth.  It was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> Came quickly in great packaging, bought it for my mom who ha been bitting here nails for over 20 years and in 2 weeks she had completely stopped! i would have never thought something like this could have worked, but wow this stuff does! if you or anyone you know bites their nails buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective.  We are using in on our 9 year old.  I wish I had tried it years ago.</li>
            <li> This works very well!  My daughter was completly addicted to her pacifier.  From the first time i put some mavala stop on her paci, she spit it out and didnt want it again.  She tried one more time later that day but smae reaction.  It took 1 day and she was without her pacifier, saying that it was broken and tastes yucky.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes it to help her thumb sucking</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the perfect solution to my 3yr old&#x27;s disgusting habit of&lt;br /&gt;nail biting but it dries quickly ( a good thing) and she&#x27;s nibbling it off in no time.&lt;br /&gt;I guess she&#x27;s part of the percentage that this doesn&#x27;t work on.</li>
            <li> this really works, so far i haven&#x27;t seen my son put his fingers in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m floored with how well and quickly this worked for my 3 year old within one week what was a CHRONIC thumb sucking habit was completely gone. I actually only applied the product twice on my daughter&#x27;s thumb.her just thinking it was on there was enough to deter her. I also gave her a VERY SMALL taste of it before applying it to her thumb in fear that having her entire thumb coated in it and her not knowing would traumatize her if she put it in her mouth. I have Given the remains of the product to my father in law and it helped him to also stop chewing his fingernails!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! !!! I used it for myself and my 7 year old and it totally works. I use to bite my nails however the taste that this leaves in your mouths really reminds you (very abruptly) not to do it. The taste stays with you for days lingering on your lips. Nasty but it worked and I got long nails now.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter has (had) a finger sucking problem til we found this. It was actually deforming her front teeth. Really curbed her appetite .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my girls would ever stop sucking their thumb. So glad I found this wonderful product. It&#x27;s been 2 months now and no thumb sucking. You don&#x27;t hear me telling them too keep their thumb out of their mounts. Thanks goodness it was getting really old and I felt like a bad mom cause I was always yelling about it.</li>
            <li> Actually works! Tried on 6 year old&#x27;s thumb and it broke habit fast. Other things did not work but this did.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried for years (I know, I could have tried harder along the way, but was discouraged when nothing seemed to work) to get my daughter to quit sucking her fingers.  Nothing seemed to work and she would even comment that other products (Thum) didn&#x27;t taste like anything.  Put this on and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her fingers since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others mentioned that their child gagged.  That wasn&#x27;t the case with my daughter.  She just quit sucking without complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to reapply after baths.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my friend who has been biting his nails for as long as he can remember. This product took effect immediately. After the first day he was already discouraged from biting his nails, and within three weeks he has broken the habit completely. He no longer bites his nails and they are growing very well now. I highly recommend this product for anyone with a nail-biting habit.</li>
            <li> Followed the instruction and applied every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been more than two weeks now and I saw may be once or twice of a short duration relapse. Finger nails are growing back as stated in the instruction.</li>
            <li> We applied it once and my son stopped sucking his thumb.  We still apply it every once in a while so he does not forget, but he will not put his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Our daughter used this on her finger at night and it helped her stop sucking her finger in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After 32 years of nail biting I finally found something. I found it because my 3 yr old daughter was starting to put her hands in her mouth and I didn&#x27;t want her to get the germs at the store, school, etc. so I had to find a way to stop it. Other products didn&#x27;t work, this did so I tried it on myself....omgoodness if I knew how terrible this was I never would have put it on my poor girl BUT that being said..it will def stop anyone from putting their hands or nails in their mouth. You don&#x27;t taste it at first but 5 seconds later you can&#x27;t get the taste out of your mouth for anything, can&#x27;t describe it....just awful! now my nails are growing and I can&#x27;t bite them...awesome! :)</li>
            <li> My husband cannot taste bitter. It is said that 25% of the population can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;He took the genetic factor test (by taking swab test) and found out about this.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently my son took his genes and he too cannot taste the bitterness so&lt;br /&gt;this has been useless for him. I bought it for my son so he can stop biting his nails.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I DO taste bitter and we both practically gagged when we tried it.&lt;br /&gt;So I am thinking the poor reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work might be by their genetic&lt;br /&gt;factor of not being able to taste bitterness? Because this is the most horrible&lt;br /&gt;taste I have tasted in my entire life but both my husband and son was like it tastes&lt;br /&gt;weird but its not THAT bad.&lt;br /&gt;So people who can tolerate this taste probably will have a higher rate of getting a&lt;br /&gt;negative result in tasting bitter on the genetic factor test as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not the product but the tastebud.</li>
            <li> Oh, it does taste bad and prevents me completely from  biting my nails!  Bought one for my daughter too.  Only problem is when you touch your mouth without thinking, the taste is terrible.  My nails do look better!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and 9 year old daughter to help them stop biting their fingernails.  Both now have normal nails and were clear on how effective this was.  The taste, I&#x27;m told, is vile and it does last 2 days at a stretch, even with good hand-washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to be careful eating finger foods while using this product and my wife says, DO NOT floss after application--sticking your whole hand in your mouth leads to bad results!</li>
            <li> It worked the first day as my son was into trying to stop sucking his fingers and I had to keep applying and it did deter, but if we don&#x27;t keep applying, he would go back.  I can&#x27;t say the product didn&#x27;t work, I just didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Ugg&amp;#34; reaction that would keep him from sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for about 25 years now. I&#x27;ve tried so many things to stop and nothing has worked for me.  This did.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and my nails are long and strong.  I did use a nail strengthener with it too (highly recommended).  It was nasty enough that I didn&#x27;t want to put my fingers in my mouth.  I&#x27;ve gotten to the point that I don&#x27;t have it on all the time.  I just put it on when I break a nail and need some extra motivation not to bite it.  One downfall, is that you&#x27;ll be off finger foods while you have it on. It&#x27;s a nasty surprise when you&#x27;re eating chips or wings and you accidentally get a finger in your mouth...bleh!  All in all, I recommend this product for nail biting.</li>
            <li> This worked.  I would recommend just putting on a little dab instead.  My two year old stop after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop worked as advertised.  My three year old no longer sucks her thumb after using the product for about 2 weeks.  Now, here&#x27;s hoping the Dentist is right, and her teeth will correct on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, buy it - it works.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been sucking her index finger since she was in-utero. I had a 3-D ultrasound done when she was 4 months along, and it showed her sucking her finger. Because it was so important to her, we just let her go and didn&#x27;t force her to stop...until just a few weeks ago, before she turned 4. We figured it was time to intervene. Her teeth were already malshaped, and we just could not let it go any longer. So, my husband ordered this product after much research.  Just like what other reviewers said, it worked OVERNIGHT! After getting a good taste of this stuff, my daughter pretty much stopped sucking her finger.  It took her about a week of tossing and turning at night.  It broke my heart to see her having withdrawls, but we knew she was just going through this weening process. She is now completely freed of finger sucking. This is the best product and it truly works.  Just start out with a tiny bit on the nail.  Don&#x27;t use too much. In hindsight, I wished I stopped this habit when she was around two and a half.  Her dentist said it was okay to let it go until age 4, but now that I&#x27;ve gone through this, I would encourage fellow parents to stop their children with finger sucking MUCH sooner.  It really alters your teeth and face. It also misshapes your finger. I regret that I let her go too long.  We thought it was helping her to sooth herself, and it did, but after a certain point, it just becomes a nasty habit. Just teach them how to comfort themselves in other ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails so long that I can&#x27;t remember ever using clippers.  I wanted to break the habit because my nails look so bad.  They&#x27;re jagged, and the cuticles are ripped.  If you&#x27;re in a similar situation, definitely try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly like a clear nail polish.  Apply it to your whole nail if you want, or just the edges that you chew.  It will appear shiny for almost 12 hours while it dries.  For a man, I recommend applying it at night so you&#x27;re not shiny the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes terrible, like I imagine garden chemicals would taste, and it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.  If you subconsciously try to bite your nails, you&#x27;ll get a quick, disgusting reminder to stop.  The taste lasts about 60 seconds in your mouth.  It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that, if you&#x27;ve really got the habit, you might try to bite your nails in front of other people and make a ridiculous face when you hit the polish instead.  Remember, it&#x27;s not polite to spit, but you&#x27;ll want to.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my daughter and in three minutes flat she was already sucking her thumb, I asked if she hated the way her thumb tasted and she told me in was not bad! It might work for adults who eat their finger nails, but it does not work for the kids!</li>
            <li> I bought the product for all the goods reviews I read, however it did not work as expected for my 3 yrs old girl. The product did only work during the first night, but my daughter hasn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb thereafter...</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of other reviewers here after being disappointed with THUM.  I received Mavala Stop for my toddler last week.  And a week later, she is still sucking her fingers just as before.  I have tried to eliminate the habit only because she simultaneously pulls her hair out - creating pitiful bald spots on her beautiful head.  Don&#x27;t know what to do now.  But Mavala definitely doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and the pricey shipping cost.</li>
            <li> The product has helped me stop my bad habit. It took 4 months for my nails to completely regrow. They used to be just awful: bleeding, splintered, and completely ruined. This product literally helped me save my nails.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product for my 5 year-old daughter.  The first time it was applied we had great success.  Then, she realized she could just keep licking her finger until the yucky taste went away.  It does deter her for a while, so we will keep trying.  She will suck any of her fingers or thumbs, so this was our last resort before heading back to the pediatric dentist.</li>
            <li> My baby girl is almost three, she had a fit when i 1st put it on but four days later she stopped and has not sucked her thumb since. Its been 3 weeks with nothing on her finger and she wont even try. Thank God!!!</li>
            <li> After receiving rave reviews from friends that swear by this product and the positive feedback on Amazon I decided to give it a try.  I have a 5 year old son and a 3 year old daughter that are thumb suckers.  I put it on after school the other day and they both didn&#x27;t suck their thumbs when getting close to bedtime, so I had faith this was going to work.  I put them to bed and 1 hour later my son vomitted in bed.  He was still asleep and mumbling about the bad taste in his mouth.  I immediately took off the product with nail polish remover and he was fine for the rest of the night.  He complained the next morning it took all night to get that \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; taste out of his mouth.  I checked on my daughter and she was sucking her thumb but not getting sick.  I asked her the next morning if her thumb tasted bad and she said \\&quot; a little\\&quot;.  I put Mavala on again that morning since she sucks her thumb all day and again after a few licks the taste was gone for her.  This was my experience, maybe you will have better luck with this product but keep in mind if your child has a weak stomach Mavala is probably not for you.  If your child has a strong will to keep sucking, this product will probably not work either.</li>
            <li> I used this to help my 4 year old son stop sucking his thumb. I used it along with positive enforcement of the Berenstein bears book and letting him draw pictures on his fingernails with a nail art pen. The first night was no fun, we had to brush his teeth every time he tasted it but, after that he took about a week to gave it up. I would receommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This stuff works! It tastes horrible! My nails are growing! Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;Eating finger foods is a problem, the taste gets&lt;br /&gt;on the food! Oh well, it&#x27;s worth it to have&lt;br /&gt;pretty nails!</li>
            <li> I placed the product on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s thumb nails and told her to put her thumb in her mouth.  I wanted to know if it would work and it does!  Immediately she took her finger out of her mouth and has not put it back in to suck it.  Even if she puts her thumb in her mouth to get food off her fingers or because I tell her to she will not suck the thumb.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This product truly works.  I purchased it based on reviews from other parents, and it does exactly what was indicated.  The first time I put it on his thumb he must have forgot it was on and threw up a little, but after that he was fine.  Since the recommended age is 3 and over, and my son is only 2 and a half I was not using it every day, however since his birthday is around the corner I do use it more often.</li>
            <li> Tried Thum stuff and my daughter just licked it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Mavala stop tastes very bitter and pretty awful and has some stayng power. However, I did find that I had to reapply every night before bed, not every other as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a book called \\&quot;Thumbuddy to Love - Ballerina Sue\\&quot; here on Amazon as well ( there is a boy version too - Fireman Fred, I think). It comes with  a little story about a little ballerina conquering thumb sucking, a little ballerina doll ( I think it is meant to go on your finger somehow, but my daughter just cuddled it) AND the important thing is a little book of star reward stickers.  My five year old took great pride each night in putting her sticker on the little enclosed chart when she got through the day successfully. When she ahd a fully successful day ( no thumb sucking at all) she got a star sticker. In the first week, she had a day or two that she would say she forgot and put here finger in her mouth, but the Mavala reminded her to stop...so I would draw in a star for good effort and honesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chart has 21 or 28 days and she had stopped by 3 weeks and we went through the chart 2 times ( double stars on each block) just to be sure there was no bcaksliding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product[[ASIN:0615273645 Thumbuddy to Love: Ballerina Sue]] works, but try a little reward reinforcement as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck.</li>
            <li> It works.  My daughter is 4 and we have been trying to stop her from sucking her thumb for a while.  We applied the nail polish on friday evening while she was sleeping.  It is now Tuesday and she has stopped sucking her thumb completely. Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased to put on my daughter&#x27;s thumb when she was 3 to prevent thumb sucking and it works great.  It really stays on so there&#x27;s no need to apply but every few days and it did the trick.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Nothing else worked.  We tried everything to get our son to stop his thumb sucking habit.  He stopped in one day!  I am still applying the solution at night while he sleeps (every other night) just to make sure he doesn&#x27;t start up again.  I want to be sure we completely break the habit.  I would very highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> The instruction says: Not for under 3 years old. This information is not to be found anywhere although the reviews suggest that this product has worked for 18month old. Not able to use it since my child is less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> I am 19 and I&#x27;ve been a pretty hard core nail biter for about four or five years. I have tried painting my nails constantly but that doesn&#x27;t deter me. I have always been pretty skeptical of products like this but I decide to give it a shot after my cousin, who is worse than I am, found success. I&#x27;ve only been using the product now for about two weeks but the difference is amazing! I actually am starting to have nice nails for the first time that I can remember. I actually haven&#x27;t applied it now for three or four days and I&#x27;m still not biting my nails! The bitter taste really conditions you to not bite your nails. The only down fall of this product is that you really have to make sure to be careful when you are eating finger foods and stuff, otherwise you accidently get the really disgusting taste of the product which kind of ruins the taste of the food. Overall this product is wonderful and well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work on my 3 yr old.  At first, she found it bitter and made some funny faces, but after a couple of minutes, enough of the polish would be removed that it didn&#x27;t taste as bad anymore (we verified by tasting it ourselves).  We tried putting on two coats and letting each coat dry a few minutes, but the bitter taste did not last more than a few minutes.  We&#x27;ve stopped now for fear of her getting used to it.  We&#x27;ll perhaps try it again latter when she&#x27;s older and, hopefully, more sensitive to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> From the day my daughter was born she sucked her thumb. She is now 2 years old. The research says not to worry about your child sucking their thumb until around 5 years of age or when their adult teeth start coming in. To me that is way to late to stop her from doing this. I&#x27;ve purchased this product and another one called Thum. Neither of the two worked for my daughter. Thum makes the thumb have a hot taste which my daughter enjoyed. This product, Mavala, makes the thumb have a biter taste. Before applying both products on my daughter I did them to myself. I did not like either taste. I have not a clue why it did not affect my daughter. The Mavala does stay on the thumb nail for about 2 to 3 days, which impressed me. After seeing no results from either product I moved to putting her to time out. This has worked beautifully! It has been weeks now and no sucking of the thumb. My advice to parents with thumb suckers is to use the free methods before jumping into buying something. Try reminding them they are big boy or girl and do not need their thumb, rewarding them with a sticker and take away the sticker when they do suck thier thumb, or time out.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old that will bite his fingernails until they are sore. We bought Mavala. It was so entirely bitter, he wouldn&#x27;t try to bite his nails at all! It&#x27;s difficult to keep on for any period of time, so we are constantly reapplying it. It does work, but you have to stay attentive.</li>
            <li> I never review products but I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this one! I read all of the great reviews but remained skeptical since my 5yo daughter was an avid thumbsucker. She was ambivalent about giving up her thumb but knew it was part of growing up. She really didn&#x27;t believe she could stop since we had tried so many other things. We put it on the morning of May 1st and that was it! She accidentally put her thumb in her mouth twice that day but took it out right away. We have applied it every 2 days for 2 weeks. She no longer even mentions it. It could not have been easier for her or for me!</li>
            <li> For any adult who is looking to stop their bad nail biting habit - this will work. No questions asked. All you have to do is will yourself to apply it to your nails. If you&#x27;re reading about this for yourself, you obviously want to stop. All I can say is buy this and the bad habit you&#x27;ve been conscious about for years will go away - almost instantaneously.  Beware though - initially you will be ruining finger foods and the like - as others have attested to - however, you quickly learn how to work around this. Well worth it. It&#x27;s a beautiful feeling to look at healthy nails that are your own!</li>
            <li> Well my two year old wouldn&#x27;t get rid of her passifer I didn&#x27;t know what to do but my co-worker told me about this stuff... It&#x27;s really nasty and they hate it but they will stay away from it!! Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself because I have a terrible habit of biting my fingernails without even realizing it. I&#x27;ve been doing this on and off my whole life, and really need to quit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I chose this product because of how much people raved about the awful taste. But I have to say... it&#x27;s not that bad. For those who said they couldn&#x27;t eat finger food, or the taste made them want to vomit, I honestly wonder if they received the same product I did. Sure, it&#x27;s a little bitter, but it isn&#x27;t awful. It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;Oh, that tastes a little funky.\\&quot; I think it will still do the trick for me, since I really only need to be alerted to the fact that I&#x27;m chewing my nail so that I can tell myself to stop it. But the taste is definitely not sending me searching for mouthwash. It&#x27;s simply a little unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I swim in the mornings, which seems to wash the Mavala Stop off. Have to reapply each morning and evening (because by evening, hand-washings have taken a lot of it off too).</li>
            <li> My 2-year-old was a BIG thumb-sucker.  Her thumb was always red, and the fingernail had stopped growing and looked awful.  Her sucking was also affecting her teeth, and our dentist wanted her to quit sucking by her 3rd birthday.  I thought about buying a thumb guard because I didn&#x27;t think a liquid would work.  But rather than pay a lot of money for a guard, our dentist recommended Mavala Stop.  I applied one coat (not just to her nail, but over the whole thumb).  She put her thumb in her mouth once and immediately took it out and tried to wipe the taste off her tongue.  The desire to suck her thumb was GONE - no complaining.  I touched her thumb to my tongue a week later and could still taste the bitterness (from that ONE coat)!  I even tried to get her to suck her thumb again (just to see if she would), and she refused.  She said it was nasty.  My husband DID catch her a week later (2 weeks after the original application) sucking at bedtime.  So I put one more coat on, and she never did it again.  After a year, her thumb is normal, the nail is normal, and the dentist said her teeth are fine now too.  She&#x27;s forgotten that she ever sucked her thumb!&lt;br /&gt;  My friend&#x27;s 4-year-old was a bedtime sucker.  I gave the bottle to her a couple of weeks ago since I didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  Since it hadn&#x27;t been opened in a while, I warned her and her husband NOT to try to open the bottle with their teeth (I made that mistake once and it was awful).  Her husband couldn&#x27;t open it by hand and thought that the taste would be off the bottle after such a long time of not using it, so he used his teeth.  My friend called me in tears, laughing at her husband trying to wipe the taste out of his mouth!  Anyway, he got it open, they used it on their 4-year-old just one time, and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since!&lt;br /&gt;  Be warned - it tastes worse than anything you can imagine.  But it definitely works!  If you have a child who is a thumb-sucker or a nail-biter, this is the best deterrent out there.  And for $9 (plus shipping), the price can&#x27;t be beat!!!out there.  And for $9 (plus shipping), the price can&#x27;t be beat!!!</li>
            <li> This product completely stopped my 3 1/2 year old son from biting his nails in just a couple days. We continued to use it for about 2 weeks and now it&#x27;s been about a month without any nail biting.</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old was so grossed out with this that it only took two applications and she wouldn&#x27;t touch her thumb again.  Once it wore off the 1st time we caught her sneeking her thumb, put the stuff back on and by the time it wore off again so did her desire...3 weeks she was done :-)  She is so proud of herself now we are off to chuck e cheese to celebrate!!</li>
            <li> We tried a drugstore brand of polish to get my 4 year old to stop sucking his fingers...nothing worked.  Our pediatric dentist recommended this brand and my son put his finger in his mouth for a second and then stopped sucking it for several nights.  We still apply it every few nights to keep the success going.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my son&#x27;s nailbiting problem.  He said it tasted bad, but not bad enough for him to keep his fingers out of his mouth.  I&#x27;ve tried other nail bite products that also were not effective.  This one seems to have been a little more offensive than the last one we tried, but it&#x27;s not strong enough for a compulsive nail biter.</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala for my 9 year old who was still sucking her thumb.  Although the first couple of nights were rough on her, the Mavala did work.  My husband and I put it on our own fingers to support her and I must say that the stuff tasts awful and last for several days once you put it on.</li>
            <li> So yes, after 30 years of nail biting, i finally stopped. I really got tired of nail biting and the way my nails look, i mean, i got to some points where my nail length (starting from the root) was around 2 or 3 millimeters only.. they just looked really bad. I looked online for some products, and i saw this product, it had really good reviews from hundreds of people. so i decided to give it a try, after all it was just [ ... ]. So i got it within few days and i tried it, and oh boy! whenever i TRIED to bite my nail, the taste is soooo bad, that it will last in my tongue for hours. The only way to take it off is to eat something or chew a gum. After a week or so i started to have that YUCK taste feeling from my nails that i start to become aware whenever i try to bite it. That has been around 3 weeks already, today my nails are fully gown (about 5-6 millimeters) .. and just today i had my first nail trim to take off the sharp edges. Anyway, what i wanna say is that this product work, and u should give it a try, it only [ ... ]. Another thing, about people who are saying that their kids got used to the taste, thats actually true.. after few weeks i noticed that i don&#x27;t get the same first YUCK feeling that i got the first few days.. maybe it is the human body getting used to it or something, but still there is a yuck feeling that it will keep u off but not as strong as the first day... However, by the time its taste effect goes down u should be all in control with ur nail biting habit.. i probably have used 3% of the bottle., because i only needed that first week to break my habit, after that u should be in control.</li>
            <li> Daughter thumb-sucker since she was 5 months old.  At 3 1/2y.o., it took her 10 days to completely stop.  In the 3 months after that, we&#x27;ve only seen her suck her thumb twice, in which we&#x27;ll reapply occasionally.  Husband did it with her to make it fun.  It tastes awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult and I bite my nails, been doing it since I was a kid.  Bought this product to help with it because I&#x27;m tired of it... I don&#x27;t even know sometimes when I bite my nails anymore.  But with this product I have been able to slow it down, and actually recognize when I&#x27;m doing it.  The taste is pretty awful and helps remind me not to bite.  So I say this is working for me.</li>
            <li> Put one coat on my child&#x27;s thumb and after trying to put their thumb in their mouth 5-6 times the first day the thumb sucking stopped completely!!  I am pleasantly suprised at how well it worked!  Recommend to anyone with a stubborn thumb-sucker!</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter stopped sucking her thumb within 3 weeks but did not stop biting her nails. I was hoping that it would stop both, but the goal was stopping the thumb sucking and I am VERY pleased about that!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this. I love that it is applied ONLY ONCE every two days. And YES it does last that long. It is NOT harsh on the skin, nail, or mouth. My Daughter hasn&#x27;t even tried to suck her thumb after the first day.</li>
            <li> OMGOODNESS!!! This stuff is amazing! I had my doubts but purchased anyway and it made a believer out of me. My son has been sucking his thumb since day one as we saw on ultrasound picture. He is now almost 3 years and still going strong. I put the product on the first day and that was it, THUMBSUCKING HAS STOPPED! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. There was some drooling and gagging because it is some nasty tasting stuff but it has to be to make them stop. Now my problem is what am I&#x27;m going to do with the rest of the bottle? I used it once on his thumb and thumbsucking is OVER!! Yeh! Would recommend this product to anyone wanting to rid their little one from the habit.</li>
            <li> I read in the instruction booklet after receiving the product that it isn&#x27;t meant for children under 3 because their taste buds aren&#x27;t fully developed. I guess they are right because it didn&#x27;t work for us, my daughter is 2 and is still a finger sucker in spite of our attempts with this nail polish. I suppose we&#x27;ll try it again when she&#x27;s over 3 if the problem persists. The only problem is I can see her teeth are slowly starting to turn, I can only imagine what a year more of this habit may incur - thank goodness they are only baby teeth!</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old has been a thumb sucker for, well, ever. Her mouth shape was starting to change and her teeth were developing a gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Mavala. Even for an emotional, dramatic, sensitive girl, there were no tears or throwing up (as others mentioned). We started in the morning, so she could get used to it by bedtime. For the first night, it was rough. We gave her one of her baby sisters pacifiers to use and a special  stuffed bunny to squeeze if she needed to suck her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been over a week with no thumb sucking. She no longer carries around the bunny or uses the paci. I have reapplied it twice, just in case, but she never even seems to notice her thumb anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is totally worth the money. I wish I had done this 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this for both me and my 4 year old son. I have been biting my nails for over 30 years and noticed that he had recently started biting his too. I told him we would try this together and began using it on both of us. I was skeptical, but I was actually able to stop biting my nails and have not bitten them in 3 weeks! This is definitely a record for me. My son has also had success, with a couple of setbacks. I need to remember to put it on his nails at least every other day or he will take a nibble here and there. However, that being said, the improvement is dramatic! If he bites, it is only on one nail, so 9 of his fingernails have started to grow back. I cannot believe it. I would recommend this product to anyone, even those who have bitten their nails for years, like me. I am truly convinced that I have kicked the habit and am so excited to start getting manicures for the first time in my life! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I would recommended to any one!!!! Ive been biting my nails for 15 years!!!!! and thanks to this product, within a week, I have stopped this habit!!!!!</li>
            <li> Had to go through couple of bottles. But finally my son has given up thumb sucking. One important thing we had to do was, when he slept we put his mitts on. Because even with mavala on his thumb he sucked his thumb while sleeping.</li>
            <li> My son had been sucking his thumb for seven years. In two days, his habit was done!  This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My son [...]his thumb every minute of the day. He wanted to give up and asked for a solution for his nails. He is off his thumb 4 weeks day and night. It is brillant!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how incredibly awful this polish tastes! I never even realized JUST how much I bit my nails and cuticles until I started tasting that bitter taste ALL of the time. Instantly makes you stop! I&#x27;ve finally broken my habit after 18 years of biting (GROSS!). I really recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid nail and cuticle biter since I was 8 years old.  It&#x27;s a bad habit with no redeeming qualities.  I tried everything to stop.  Hypnosis didn&#x27;t work- that only hurt my wallet.  The rubber band trick didn&#x27;t work- it was supposed to stop me from biting, but after a while the snapping action just ended up sexually exciting me.  I had little hope for this product, but after going through a bottle, I don&#x27;t bite my nails anymore at all. How often does 10 bucks change a life long habit?</li>
            <li> Works great. Suggestion if using on kids put it on when they are sleeping for the first week or two, make sure to reapply every other day. Then every few days. My son bit his nails so bad he was actually peeling the nail layers. Its been a month and I had to actually cut his nails they had all grew back finally!</li>
            <li> tastes like nailpolish remover. very effective, but it didnt occur to me that i might want to be able to stick my fingers in my mouth on occasion when NOT biting at them, which proved to be an issue. and it stays on there for a few days.</li>
            <li> To the best of my knowledge I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my entire life.  I never really thought about it much until I became an adult, and since that point I&#x27;ve always wanted to stop.  I just didn&#x27;t have the willpower.  It&#x27;s hard to break a habit when the source is permanently attached to you.  I&#x27;ve had a few periods where I&#x27;ve stopped for a week or two, but eventually just start up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then somewhere I read about products like these, and picked this one off of Amazon based on all the positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve only applied it twice, which surprisingly enough works out to almost a week and a half of time, and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails once.  36 years worth of nail biting and I stopped immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes really bad.  It&#x27;s not a particular taste that I can liken to anything else I&#x27;ve ever had in my mouth.  It&#x27;s chemical, foreign, and entirely unpleasant.  What&#x27;s more, it lingers like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I&#x27;ve eaten my share of gross things over the years, and generally a quick rinse and a few spits and you&#x27;re fine.  I absentmindedly put one of my fingers in my mouth about three hours ago, I&#x27;ve since eaten dinner and showered, and I swear I can still taste it on my lips.  Once you experience this product in your mouth I doubt that your desire to chew your nails will overcome the thought of another dose of this touching your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also amazingly resilient.  Don&#x27;t worry about having to coat your fingers numerous times a day.  I put it on about three days ago and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I can do an entire hand with one dip of the brush, and as such, this 0.3 oz. is probably enough for a couple dozen people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is everything I just mentioned.  It&#x27;s awful, it lingers and you don&#x27;t want it anywhere near your mouth.  You&#x27;ll forget and try to pick out a stubborn piece of meat that got jammed between your teeth and will cringe when you taste the stuff on your nails.  Just wiping your mouth can be dangerous.  Forget about eating anything messy with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does it work?  Absolutely.  All you need is thirty seconds of willpower to get the stuff on and you&#x27;re good for at least two or three days.  I have no doubts I can keep up with not biting while I use this.  The real test will be if I can condition myself to keep my fingers out of my mouth so I can quit using it somewhere down the road..

            <li> My child has sucked his thumb since birth. At 8 years old it is affecting his permanent teeth and the shape of his mouth. My son only really sucks his thumb anymore in his sleep when he isn&#x27;t even aware of it. His dentist told me to get him to stop immediately or I would need to pay out large amounts of money for an appliance for his mouth now, and braces in a few years. I bought the Mavala Stop, and at first my son fought me on using it. I tried the bandaids on the thumb, a sock, the hand under the pillow...everything. The Mavala Stop is actually working. I have learned that I have to apply it to both thumbs as when I only put it on one he just switches in his sleep without realizing what he&#x27;s doing. I also have to apply it EVERY night. If I only apply it every other night, by the second night he is sucking his thumb again. So I see this taking at least a month of applying the product every night, but I also am seeing results on the nights that we use it. So happy and proud of my son! (He even reminds me to apply it now if I forget!)</li>
            <li> Our 3 1/2yo son had been biting his fingernails for about a year before I looked for a product to help him stop.  We tried Mavala Stop and within a week he was 95% cured of the habit!  It comes in a small bottle and has a brush that you apply the liquid with- much like a bottle of nail polish.  I was a bit skeptical of the small size of the bottle compared to the price, but the bottle lasts months- we only had to buy one.  We painted a small amount on the tips of his fingernails every day and that did the trick.  We also tasted it- it is really not that bad, not pleasant, but not anything too terrible.  We certainly had no point where we felt we needed to wash it off because it was too terrible.  You do have to be careful and remind the child not to put their fingers in their mouths while it is on their fingers- I encouraged only fork and spoon use for the week we were using it the most.  I tried to think of foods that he could use silverware with instead of finger foods.  We explained to him what it was for, and tried to make it positive- \\&quot;soon you won&#x27;t be biting anymore, that is so exciting!...\\&quot;  He liked that and was actually excited about using it.  After the first week, he had a couple relapses, and we just told him to tell us if he was getting the urge to bite and we could put some more on.  He would actually tell us and ask us to paint his fingernails, we would congratulate him for telling us he had the urge to bite, paint the nails for just one day, and then he would stop.  It has now been 3 months since we bought the Mavala Stop, and he has not been biting for the past 2+ months.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this with my 10 year old daughter to get him to stop nail biting. She stopped. But it rubbed off her fingers on to other parts of her hand face so she ended up tasting it even if she was not biting his nails. When that happened she refused to keep using it and who could blame her.</li>
            <li> I used this with both of my boys to get ride of their pacifier and it worked really well. My oldest actually vomitted as he has a very weak palate and does not like anything that has any taste, his diet is very plain. So I recommended that you use very little and try it first, I tried it and still felt comfortable using it on my boys but it does taste horrible. I would not use it on a toddler nail as they tend to eat with their finger and may relate the taste of the medication with the taste of the food and start avoiding such food.&lt;br /&gt;When I used I used on the pacifier, a drop, and told my boys just over 2 at the time that pacifiers taste bad for big boys and asked them if they wanted to trow it on the garbage, both boys asked for a different pacifier which they got. The second pacifier tasted the same and both boys discarded the pacifiers themselves, the following days when they asked about the pacifier I just reminded them that it tasted bad and they had trow in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this awesome product. It works so extremely well that my wife and I have passed it on to friends and family. No child has been able to withstand it&#x27;s power to kick a thumb sucking habit! THANK YOU! From not only my family but about 7 neighbors and 11 extend family members.</li>
            <li> I had been trying to get my 3 year old to give up thumb sucking with other methods. None worked but this was a charm, after two weeks of applying it no more thumb sucking, I am ecstatic. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Man, this some seriously nasty stuff.  I&#x27;m an adult with Tourette&#x27;s/OCD and have struggled with nail biting my whole life.  It&#x27;s noticeably worse in my high-stress career.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of polish and with one of them I actually grew used to the taste and bit right through it.  Not going to happen with Mavala Stop, this stuff is pure, absolute poison.  Worst part is, it DOES NOT leave your mouth.  You need to drink like a soda or something acidic to get the taste out.  Water doesn&#x27;t cut it.  It also comes off on everything.  I can&#x27;t cook with it on.  Half the time when I eat something I don&#x27;t even think I touched, if you get one molecule of this on something, you&#x27;ll know!  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any irritation to my eyes, luckily.  Nail biting is so ubiquitous to me that I&#x27;ll do it anyway, and it hits me.  I feel like the punishment is maybe a little too harsh.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll just close my eyes and go to town on my nails and and have like a shot of whiskey ready to get the taste out.  Either way, this is by far the most effective treatment I&#x27;ve tried and it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re serious about quitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it were cheaper though!</li>
            <li> I bit my nails for 15 years on a daily/hourly basis. I&#x27;d tried through discipline and cold shoulder dozens of times only to fail. I was browsing a random thread on Reddit.com when I came across the product. I found it and saw how cheap it was! I figured holy crap look at the reviews, I got nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item about 3 weeks ago. Even after it came it sat for a week before I was lazy enough to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 2 weeks and for the first time in my life I have nails! I had maybe 6-10 instances where I tried to bite my nails for the first 1-4 days. The taste is SO bitter that there was no way I was going to do it for long. After that, I have NO urge to bite my nails. In fact, to see my nails for the first time in 15 years and actually growing and actually looking healthy like I can do something is amazing. That itself - just seeing them there is so awesome that it&#x27;s a super motivator for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a self-perpetuating system - you don&#x27;t want to bite them because it&#x27;s so bitter, then you have nails, and it&#x27;s not the bitterness that stops you (since I haven&#x27;t had to put it on for several days now), it&#x27;s the fact that they look so good that I haven&#x27;t had a single bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I didn&#x27;t even use 2% of it it. It&#x27;s still filled to the brim, so it&#x27;s a lifetime supply if I ever need it again, which I doubt. All you need it to put a TINY DAB on each finger, no more than that is needed, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL - I got over a 15 year addition within 1 week. This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that made me hope this would be the cure for my 5 year old daughter from sucking her fingers.  I personally think this stuff tastes nasty, but my daughter will still suck her fingers, even with this stuff on.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to phase her.  We had also tried \\&quot;Thumb\\&quot; which also didn&#x27;t work.  Mavala seems very similar to Thumb.  We probably should have started trying this stuff when she was younger.  Thumb worked for two of my other kids when they were two year olds to wean them from their binkies.  It may help you, but didn&#x27;t work for us :(</li>
            <li> My daughter stopped sucking her fingers using this product&lt;br /&gt;We have tried other products without success&lt;br /&gt;This product is so bitter she could not continue to keep her fingers in her mouth&lt;br /&gt;She had sucked her fingers since she was a baby&lt;br /&gt;At 8 years old she has stopped!&lt;br /&gt;She is proud of this as much as we are</li>
            <li> I think we had to put the nail polish on her fingers 3 times; however, it cured my daughter (4 years old) of her thumb sucking habit.  I would highly recommend this product!  Of course, now my daughter doesn&#x27;t want to wear any nail polish what so ever now.  I&#x27;m fine with that though.</li>
            <li> My baby stopped putting hands in her mouth after 5 days. But needed to reapply every 2 days. She didn&#x27;t like taste of i, but also finger food tasted bad as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my thumb sucker (9 yr. old) and applied it every 2 days.  In two weeks, he had completely stopped sucking his thumb.  Wish I had known about this years ago!</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product to see if our results would be long lasting.  My 3-1/2 year old was a finger sucker day and night since about birth and had started to chew all his fingernails.  My husband kept telling me that we had to stop him for at least a month to break the habit.  It worked beautifully.  I just had to remember to apply the stuff.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I am surprised after comments that the product does not work at all. It has such mild unnoticeable taste FOR ME that I had to test it on two friends. One was absolutely terrified, and said that its the worst thing he ever tried, the other one said the same think like me. Nothing. He said it reminds him on jagermeister (both friends are not nail biterd, just for the record)  Its really strange. It seems some people (me and one of my friends included) are completely immune. At this point I would most rather get my money back, but I realize that its pointless (due to the price and the fact that I have opened it and used it). I have tried 4 products similar to this one and this is by far the most useless one for me. I&#x27;m giving it two stars (instead of one) only because it seems to work on one of my friends.</li>
            <li> just having it on made me stop for the most part but once I learned how horrible it tasted I never bite my nails with it on ever again. havnt broken the habbit completely been about a month.</li>
            <li> Worked great on stopping my daughter from sucking her thumb ...less than a week and she was done</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and this product is the only thing that stopped a student of mine from after her mother tried every product on the market as well as other products recommended by her doctor!</li>
            <li> Quote simply, this will stop you from biting your nails. Hell it&#x27;ll even stop you from putting your fingers near your mouth. The taste of this stuff is very bitter and gross. The annoying part is that because i&#x27;m a guy, I never put on nailpolish and it kinda goes beyond my nails and the day i put i on, i have to avoid eating things with my hands. Your sandwich or pizza will taste bitter unless you&#x27;re careful to make sure your nails dont go anywhere near your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 64 yr old dad who has also been biting his nails his whole life stopped after using Mavala. Don&#x27;t waste your money with anything else. The junk you get at the local pharmacy is just lemon juice and cayanne pepper and is only useful for babies. DO NOT GIVE THIS TO YOUR Toddler. Its wayy to strong for little children, but perfect for adults.</li>
            <li> Despite the nasty tasting product, my 8 yo dd still sucks her thumb. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the product&#x27;s fault, as much as it is my dd&#x27;s stubborn determination to suck her thumb. If this didn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t have much hope for anything else.</li>
            <li> Works great. Daughter stopped sucking her fingers within a few days</li>
            <li> Well, it works. I haven&#x27;t even licked my fingers since I put it on. It lingers in your mouth for a solid minute, making it a lot harder to &#x27;want&#x27; to bite your nails.</li>
            <li> This formula is awesome!  After years of fidgeting with awkward appliances to put on my kids&#x27; hands to help them stop sucking their fingers/thumbs, I found this.  It worked in one day!  The bitter taste was so awful that my 4yo didn&#x27;t dare try it again.  And to top it all off, it is light on the pocket.  This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my 10 year old still sucking her thumb.  Tried everything else.  Tried this product and it worked almost overnight.  I am writing this review more than a year after buying the product and she has never gone back.  If you not having luck with other products give this one a try.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucks her thumb. She was whinning the first day a couple of times, thne each day she complained less. By the 5th days she was good. We only applied it one. She did break down crying each of the 5 days , especially when she was ready to sleep for about 10 minutes. My advice is to keep them awake as long as possible so they are extremely tired then they will go to sleep easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are please with the results and it works better than expected, with the minor annoyances of your child crying for little bits.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for 30yrs and decide it was time to stop. The pepper nail polish flavor tasted good and I bit right through it. With Malva Stop I stopped biting my nails in 3 weeks. The stuff is gross. It has a numbing taste that I can&#x27;t explain until you try it. It does get on finger food. So if I know I am going to be eating with my fingers I would remove it with nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you want to stop biting your nails. I could not imagine what a kid must think if it is used to stop thumb sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT....If I could give it 100 stars I would.</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic nail biter for most of my life. Probably over 20+ years. I&#x27;ve tried it all: acrylic nails, nail polish, cold-turkey... and none of it worked. I would go back to biting my nails; sometimes to the point where I would make my nails bleed (yep, I would bite them that low).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that has ALL STOPPED! I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve yet to bite my nails. This product works miracles because it is so dang disgusting. You don&#x27;t realize how OFTEN you put your nails in or near your mouth until you have this stuff on your nails. It&#x27;s like tasting nail polish remover times 10. This is not a taste you get used to over time either; it will continue to be one of the most bitter tasting flavors you can imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how it would not work with children because after tasting it, I doubt they would allow you to put it on them again. However, if you&#x27;re an adult and dedicated to breaking the habit, I would highly recommend this product. You have to apply it pretty consistently ever 2-3 days because it does wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have long feminine nails!! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! I&#x27;m really quite surprised at how well this product works! My son who is 8 yrs has been biting his nails since he was 18mo. I was so fed up with his nasty looking nails (or lack there of) that I decided to find a product to help him stop. After reading all the great reviews for this one, I decided to give it a try. The stuff is NASTY!!!! Really, I tried it on myself and it&#x27;s gross. Very bitter taste! I was expecting to get something weak and figured I&#x27;d be looking around for something else soon. But from day one my son hasn&#x27;t been able to bite his nails!!! I haven&#x27;t seen his nails grow in years. Amazing!!! He&#x27;s really proud of himself too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tried this on my 3 yr old daughter who is a thumb sucker. Let&#x27;s just say, unless you&#x27;re really ready for them to stop sucking their thumb then don&#x27;t try it! She freaked at how nasty the stuff was and cried and cried!!! She&#x27;s very dramatic anyway so that doesn&#x27;t help. But really this is the thing to get when you&#x27;re ready!!! I may wait a little while till \\&quot;I&#x27;M\\&quot; mentally prepared to handle her trying to sleep without her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around GREAT product! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> it really work so well. I used only two times per week and worked well</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for pretty much my whole 29 year life.  Mavala Stop has been the only thing that I&#x27;ve tried that has successfully gotten me to stop putting my fingers in my mouth.  Now I have nice, long, ladylike nails that I love!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now, and still plan on using it from time to time if I find myself trying to put my fingers in my mouth again.  DEFINITELY worth the price.  Only drawback is that you can&#x27;t really eat finger foods that easily without getting some of the taste in your mouth.  Worth it though!</li>
            <li> Creates a negative association with nail biting in your brain. Stays on for over a week. Goes on glossy. Careful about finger foods and cooking when you&#x27;re wearing this product. I made the mistake of making guacamole with my bare hands...gross.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my almost four year old son who had been sucking his two fingers since he was four months old.  It got so bad that his fingers would be pink, cracked, wrinkled, and swollen with several warts.  It also affected his two front teeth.  I tried everything to get him to stop but nothing worked.  Then when I put this nail polish on his fingers it worked immediately!  He was so angry with me.  He told me, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t you ever put that medicine on my fingers again!\\&quot;  I put the nail polish on every night (while he was sleeping) instead of every other day (like the directions say) because he kept trying to take the polish off.  I only needed to use it for a week and no more finger sucking!  My son went almost two months without sucking his fingers. His fingers look so much better and so do his teeth!  I thank God for this stuff!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how great this produce is! We had tried everything to get our son to stop sucking, his speech therapists and dentist were really stressing the negative impact of this habit. He had pretty much stopped during the day but still sucked to go to sleep and at night. We started talking about how thumbs start to taste bad when you get too big to suck, and that it&#x27;s a sign your body gives you that you should stop sucking, a rite of passage of growing older like baby teeth falling out. We did this for about two weeks, and then started applying a TINY bit on his thumb after he fell asleep-- I thought doing it this way would make it less of a control issue between us and also thought the bedtime suck would be the hardest to fade so didn&#x27;t want to start there. He woke up once the first night crying, and I went in and explained that he must be getting to be a bigger boy and congratulations! After this first night, he never woke crying again. We did this for three days and by day two he had stopped sucking altogether. We then did every other day for about two weeks and have stopped completely for ten days now.  I think for our son he just needed to break the habit for 1-2 days, he has never looked back and is so proud of himself! We make a big deal each morning of using a pumice stone to get rid of the callus on his thumb. My only regret is not doing it a year earlier!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My pediatrician&#x27;s office recommended it.  My son is an avid thumb-sucker, so this was our last resort.  It works great.  My only regret is that we did not use it earlier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a nail chewing problem. This was the highest reviewed problem so I thought I would give it a try. When it arrived I applied it to her fingers right away. I put some on my own finger nail because I didn&#x27;t want to expose her to something that I was not willing to do to myself. I licked my finger nail after the product had dried and it was AWFUL! And the taste didn&#x27;t go away for hours no matter what I ate or drank. So I thought this would be great and she would break the habit of finger nail chewing right away. A couple days later she informed me that she kind of liked the taste though.  Overall I would recommend this product because, for any normal person, it will be a great deterrent to putting fingers in the mouth. If your kid is some kind of mutant like mine, I guess it will be money wasted.</li>
            <li> It work for a little bit than she&#x27;s back sucking her thumb againg.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 5 and just could not stop sucking her thumb. I really wanted to break this habit before she started getting her adult teeth in. This stuff is amazing! It was so disgusting to her she felt she was going to throw up. It only took her putting it in twice to realize she didn&#x27;t want to do that again. I used it for a week and she no longer sucks her thumb!</li>
            <li> This worked great! I had not cut my 5 year old nails in at least 2 years as he would eat them down to nothing. He stopped biting his nails after the first time we used it. I put in on every few days and after just 3 weeks, he stopped bitting his nails all together, even if I skip using the product for several days. Last night I had to cut his nails for the very fist time since he was 3! It does smell terrible when you first put it on but as soon as it dries (a couple of minutes), the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> We used it twice and it worked like a charm! My son is 6 yrs old figured out very quickly that it tasted bad. The next time I put it on he asked why and stated I&#x27;m not putting that in my mouth. We had tried everything else so this was our last option. I wish I would have know about this 2 yrs ago because it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> We HAD a 4 year old thumb sucker (emphasis on HAD).  This product does exactly what it claims.  After applying the product on the thumb nails, she tried it one time and that was it!  We have found that after swimming in the pool, it needs to be re-applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  The thumb sucking was really holding our girl back from doing a lot of things...she couldn&#x27;t even participate her dance class because she was too busy with her thumb in her mouth.  Well, those days are gone, along with stinky thumbs!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> WORKS THE REASON I GAVE IT A 4 STARS IS BECAUSE I DID MORE RESEARCH AFTER I RECEIVED IT AND ITS NOT REALLY GOOD TO GIVE TO KIDS</li>
            <li> Bought this anti-nail biting polish for my daughter who wanted to stop biting her nails. She has been biting them for 13 years and she is 13 years old. She had made several attempts recently to try and stop biting her nails and nothing worked. I saw this product on line and thought we would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The first time she put her hands in her mouth she rushed to the sink and spit, grabbed water and grabbed a hard candy to try and get rid of the taste. Since then she tries her best to not absent mindedly put her hands near her mouth because the taste is so bad and it lingers. It is now day four and she has not bitten her nails at all and they are starting to get longer! She describes the taste to what bug repellent imagines to taste like. It lingers on lips and tongue for at least twenty minutes. Great deterrant for nail biting. Good idea to keep lozengers on hand to get rid of the taste if you should accidently taste it.&lt;br /&gt;Highy recommend for good results!</li>
            <li> WOW! My son has been sucking his thumb for 9 years. We tried EVERYTHING to get him to stop... bribes, thumb sleeves, other paint-on products. This one WORKED! It tastes terrible. (We had to try it too :-) )It&#x27;s been a solid month without the thumb.</li>
            <li> The first couple days it was a deterrent and then the taste must not be too bad because he went right back to the biting. It says to do every other day - I did it daily and it still didn&#x27;t stop him. Not sure what we are going to do...</li>
            <li> My daughter hated the taste so she refused to let me put it on! I also bought a thumb guard, what a waist!  After trying many things, I bought a kit at [...]  IT WORKED.  She no longer sucks her thumb.  On their website they say that there is going to be a new kit for nail biting.  It&#x27;s positive reinforcement rather than negative and she had a desire to stop.  She feels like such a big girl now!</li>
            <li> My daughter was thumb sucking until last week . She is turning 6 next month. We tried everything including Dental Device. Once we put Mavala stop on she thumb sucked and the taste was horrible that she threw up. Now she is scared of bringing her thumb anywhere near her mouth. Just two applications and that is it. Maybe the most effective product invented ever.</li>
            <li> After months of encouraging/pestering our son to stop sucking his thumb (he is four), we finally decided to use a product to help. After doing some research, this one stood out as the most effective. Our son agreed that it was hard to stop on his own, and agreed to \\&quot;extra help.\\&quot; The results are amazing. It has been 3 weeks, and he essentially stopped sucking after the first application. Now I think the urge/habit is really out of his system. We apply the product every 2 days, and plan to taper it off when it&#x27;s been a little longer. One setback occurred when we had not applied it for 3 days (the bitter taste had dissipated), and he woke up and announced that he had sucked his thumb overnight. He seemed disappointed in himself for having sucked overnight and was initially resistant to reapplying the product. My recommendation is to be very regular in applying it during the crucial early phase when they need the most help. I am so glad we bought this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our pediatrician bec. it worked for his son. I hought it and tried it on my 2 boys. I was surprised when my 2nd son (5-1/2 years old) stopped sucking his 2 middle fingers in 2 DAYS!! My 4-yr-old stopped after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a bit hesitant bec. I have an autistic son and I was afraid this may not work for him. But to my sruprise, he stopped sucking after 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs this. It really, really works!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember, and it seems like I have tried everything out there to help me quit-this product is the only thing that worked for me. I put it on my nails every 3 days or so. The taste is horrible, and lingers in your mouth for a while-it really discourages you from putting your fingers in your mouth. I recommend it to anyone who needs to stop biting their nails.</li>
            <li> I tried this product myself before I planned to try it on my daughter&#x27;s binkie. It definitely has a strong, bitter flavor that is really terrible! After reading the ingredients, however, I won&#x27;t be giving it to my daughter. The first ingredient is Ethyl Acetate, and another ingredient is Isopropyl Alcohol. It recommends use for children over 3, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a good product for anyone!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old bites her nails down to nothing.  I read the reviews thinking this is my solution but was sadly mistaken!!  I paint her nails every morning and by lunch the polish is off and my daughter is asking me to paint again.  She actually likes the taste!!  This may work on your little ones, but not mine!</li>
            <li> My two-year old sucked her thumb consistently while sleeping and it was causing her teeth to move.  In fact, her bite was affected dramatically.  I tried some of the other \\&quot;thumb sucking\\&quot; products on the market that you can purchase at the drugstore and they all failed.  She didn&#x27;t seem to be affected in the least.  I also tried the old methods of lemon juice, etc....yeah, right!  When I first tried Mavala Stop on her (I painted the entire thumb nail), I realized that when she would pick up her food with her fingers (as toddler&#x27;s usually eat---picking up a green bean, whatever..) she would get the bad taste in her mouth and stop eating.  To alleviate this problem, I began to paint only a small part of her nail, right over the cuticle and onto the finger itself.  A tiny tiny bit!  This worked because when she would use her fingers to eat, she would not put that much of her thumb in her mouth to taste the cuticle area.  However, when thumb sucking, that part of the thumb does enter the mouth.  The only thing is that with lots of hand-washing, you may need to apply it more often (maybe each night) because it washes off more easily.  Also, if you have painted the entire nail and you wish to remove it, acetone will remove Mavala Stop--you just might have to work at it with several cotton balls and then wash hands VERY WELL to remove the acetone taste.  My daughter stopped sucking her thumb immediately.  I kept up the Mavala for about a month just to prevent her from picking up the habit again.  A last note, her teeth moved back into correct position in about 6 weeks and her bite is perfect.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 1/2 year old little girl who sucked her thumb and twirled her hair all thoughtout the day. I received it on a Saturday and started that night. I do have to say she didn&#x27;t like the taste on that first night and even made herself throw up, but that was the only night she did that. When she went to bed we did use a glove so she didn&#x27;t suck it in the night and get sick. It has been 1 month and we are thumb free and don&#x27;t even twirl her hair any more. This stuff is the Best and I also told a friend and she ordered it for her little girl and it worked for her too. Now the only bad thing is that I have a full bottle of the stuff left.</li>
            <li> I gave my 7 and 10 year old (yes, 10) sons the chance to quit their thumb sucking on their own with the threat of ordering this stuff if they didn&#x27;t.  They pretty much laughed at me.  When it came in the mail, I snuck into their room that night and applied it.  Around midnight that night, they came wailing into my room, crying, screaming, rolling around on the floor saying they were in agony-- my sons are drama queens.  It has worked like a charm.  They haven&#x27;t sucked their thumbs since, and they were hard core.  It&#x27;s been months now, and we are a thumb-free family now.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my daughter, who&#x27;s 23 months old. She has the habit of sucking her fingers to go to sleep since she was a few months old. It works the very first night. I tried it myself. It is very bitter and lingers in my mouth for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to apply the product to my daughter&#x27;s fingers for about a week when I started noticing that my daughter&#x27;s finger started showing redness and became harden with small bumps. I have stopped applying the product immediately. After a trip to the doctor&#x27;s office, it seems my daughter has an allergic reaction to the product that applying 1% hydrocrotizine might help. We&#x27;ve done the hydrocrotizine regimen for two days now, it seems to have lessened the overall effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just a word of caution that some people might develope an reaction to this otherwise wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I was able to get my 8-year-old son to stop nail-biting entirely after only three applications. Try it!</li>
            <li> My 4year old bit his nails non-stop. I told him the mavala was a special magic potion.  I was shocked he let me paint it on.  It only took a few times putting his fingers in his mouth before he stopped.  He didn&#x27;t even complain about the horrendous taste. My one year old accidently got some on his tongue and it made him vomit. A few weeks later I saw my 4year old try biting his nails again and i painted on the malvala and he hasn&#x27;t put his fingers in his mouth again.  It really truely worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff ..  just not that good ( or bad ..  taste I mean ) to keep fingers out of my boy mouth.</li>
            <li> My 9 yr. old daughter sucks her thumb in her sleep. We&#x27;ve tried everything till our Orthodontist recommended this product to try.  It seems to work so far.  Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> Our 3 year old only sucked her thumb when going to sleep, but our dentist insisted she stop. When I told her that I bought medicine to help her stop sucking her thumb, she got upset with me. We put the Mavala Stop on her thumbs, all it took was one time sucking her thumb and she stop because of the bitter taste. However, she complained of her finger being sore, when asked what happened she admitted to sucking her fingers. Now we put the Mavala Stop on all of her fingers and she even reminds me to apply it after baths.</li>
            <li> My 2-year-old daughter started sucking her thumb when she was 4 months old, after I stopped breastfeeding. She&#x27;d only suck her thumb when she was tired or going to sleep. She has a big callous on her thumb because of it. I ordered this product and got it. I put it on her thumb nail during the day so she was aware of what I was doing. When she was eating some snacks with her hands, her thumb nail touched her mouth and she spitted all the food out because of the taste. But this product works. At night, when she was tired, she tried to suck her thumb and I told her it was &#x27;foochi&#x27; and she understood. She did move around a lot trying to fall asleep without her thumb but then she did. The next day, for her nap and again at night, she didn&#x27;t even try to suck her thumb. Its been 5 days now, and no thumb sucking. I have been reapplying every 2 days just to make sure there is no relapse.</li>
            <li> My child is 4 1/2 and she stopped sucking her thumb the second I put this on.  I made her aware of how it would taste.  I only had to reapply it 2 times and she is done!</li>
            <li> Mary had one experience with the taste and has not sucked her thumb or any other finger since we started using it.  The effectiveness lasts through the day and she has had a couple of bad experiences - finding out that the taste is still there.  So, if your child will be eating finger food, wash well before turning them loose for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products from the drugstore did NOT stop our 5 year old Mary.  Mavala does quite effectively.  I&#x27;d recommend the product.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old has sucked her thumb since she was 6 months.  I started using this product on Fri. Oct 5 and when she got her first taste of it she had a major fall out.  I kept reapplying it all weekend and needless to say it was a restless 3 days.  By Wed. of the next week she had figured out a way to suck her thumb without it touching her tongue.  (she would hold her thumb in between her teeth and slob all over herself)  I almost got discouraged stopped using it because even though she knew it was there she wouldn&#x27;t stop trying to suck her thumb.  (Mostly it was at night just out of habit)  But I started putting the polish on her entire thumb and that&#x27;s when I started seeing results.  She didn&#x27;t want to put her thumb even near her mouth.  This went on for about 2 more weeks until she broke the habit of putting it in her mouth while sleeping.  I stopped using it Fri. Oct 26 and all is well.  The knot on the back of her thumb is starting to heal and she feels like she is a big girl!!!!!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived within 4 days. We got it for our 9 year old son who has had a constant habit of putting his thumb in his mouth. We encouraged him to apply it, so he was excited when it arrived. He applied the nail polish look-a-like product. When he put his thumb in mouth, he found the taste disguisting and tried to spit out the taste and water it down. Needless to say he didnt like the taste and the experience. He kept at it for 3-4 days and we would occasionally hear him during his sleep. BUT believe it or not, he has now completely stopped it. Once in a while, he himelf will let us know that he wants to apply it. We let him to do it, so that he is comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;We strongly recommend this product. This was told by our doctor.</li>
            <li> Tastes horrible and works extremely well when applied properly</li>
            <li> This stuff actually WORKS --unlike other nail biting \\&quot;cures\\&quot;.  My daughter and I both use it and it lasts for DAYS even when you bathe or wash your hands... tastes AWEFUL too.  The only thing that takes the taste away is nail polish remover.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t bite her nails (and she was terrible at that) when this stuff is on, and when she finds herself starting to do it again, she puts this stuff on her nails and &#x27;nuff said!  The only thing I hate about it, is that if you eat anything with your hands (sandwich, cookies, etc) it tastes like this stuff and it&#x27;s nauseating--- but it WILL stop the nailbiting or putting your fingers in your mouth--all it takes is once or twice of \\&quot;forgetting\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll stop!</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this product so I thought it was worth a shot.  Amazing stuff!!  We set my daughter up by telling her someday her thumbs wouldn&#x27;t taste good.  A couple of nights later we put Mavala on her thumbs while she was sleeping.  She awoke the next morning telling us \\&quot;She was done sucking her thumb, it taste horrible!\\&quot;  We continued the nightly application for a week just for good measure.  Wow this has to be the best money I&#x27;ve spent!&lt;br /&gt;It does taste horrid, being the kind of Mom I am I gave it a try.  YUCK!  I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well for those that bite their nails.</li>
            <li> This product is great! My 9 year old daughter finally has good looking nails again. It is very effective!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff that you can get to paint on your child&#x27;s fingernails to deter thumb-sucking or nail biting.  It&#x27;s much better than [[ASIN:B000T0SZXA Thum Liquid Stops thumb sucking and nail biting - 0.2 Oz / Pack, 3 Packs]], which wore off quickly and had to be constantly reapplied.  By contrast, Mavala maintains a nasty taste through the course of the day.  Reapplying first thing in the morning, and possibly right before bed, should be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, success depends on the child.  We used this product simultaneously on 3 children: an 8.5 year old that puts his thumb in his mouth (not actually sucking) when he reads,  a 6.5 year old who bit her nails until the white was all gone with occasional bleeding, and a 2.5 year old who sucks both thumbs when sleepy/bored.  We only had success with one child, the 6.5 year old nail biter.  A few days and the habit was broken, and her nails are nice and long.  The other two children didn&#x27;t like the nasty taste and had a sharp decrease temporarily in how often their thumbs were in their mouths, but then they habituated and were right back where they started.  When I pointed out her thumb-sucking, my 2.5 year old would say it had worn off, but I&#x27;d taste her thumb and it was still nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to try a paint-on solution, this is what I&#x27;d recommend.  But, it may very well not work for your child.  It only worked for one of our three.  I guess we&#x27;d have to try a thumb guard or some type of restraint with the other two if we wanted to break the habits.</li>
            <li> me and my husband were excited to get this product because of the wild reviews saying how strong it was. wrong. my daughter sucked the very bitter flavor off her thumb soon enough and is back to her merry thumb-sucking ways. wish us luck saving up for ortho costs years from now.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptic at first, but with this it took just 1 week for my 5-year-old to stop sucking her thumb. We kept on using it for a few more weeks, but now we do not even need to do that.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 MAVALA Stop for Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 7 year old and a 3 year old. Both were thumbsuckers until I used this product on them. My daughter has been wanting to stop but just did&#x27;nt know how so she was happy when I told her about this. My 3 year old son was not to happy but we tried anyway. They both did very well. My son woke up in the middle of the night once for the first few nights, but after that he was fine. It took about 1 week and they both have successfully stopped thumbsucking. I did reward them also every few days with a little prize for doing so well..they loved that! This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Our four year old bites the skin around her nails and her nails when she is nervous. The first time we used Mavala Stop it tasted so bad she almost threw up. The taste also got on her finger foods and made her not want to eat. We only used it once as we thought the cure was worse than what she was doing. Maybe had we continued she would have stopped putting her fingers in her mouth, but at what cost? Making her nauseous is not worth it.</li>
            <li> MY SON IS 21 MONTHS OLD AND HE HAS SUCKED BOTH OF HIS THUMBS SINCE HE WAS 5 MONTHS OLD. HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMFORTED BY SUCKING HIS THUMBS, SO AS THE MONTHS PROGRESSED IT BECAME WORSE AND WORSE. HE BEGIN TEETHING EARLY SO I BECAME WORRIED AND THEN ONE DAY I NOTICED THAT MY SONS TEETH STARTED TO BUCK OUT A BIT. I WENT ONLINE AND CAME ACROSS THIS PRODUCT AND AS SOON AS I RECIEVED IT IN THE MAIL I OPENED IT AND PUT IT ON BOTH OF HIS THUMBS. THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!! AS SOON AS HE PUT HIS THUMB IN HIS MOUTH HE IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT OUT. I HAVE BEEN PUTTING IT ON EVERYDAY FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND MY SON HAS NOT SUCKED HIS THUMB. HOWEVER, AT NIGHT WHILE HE IS SLEEPING I HAVE NOTICED HIM SUCKING IT, ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS SLEEPING AND DID NOT NOTICE THE TASTE...I ASSUME. THEREFORE, I MAKE SURE THAT I  CONTINUE TO PUT SOCKS ON HIS HANDS AT NIGHT SO THAT HE WON&#x27;T MAKE THAT MISTAKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS SO WORTH IT. THE FIRST WEEK WAS VERRRYYY ROUGH BECAUSE HE WENT THROUGH WITHDRAWALS. IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE TAKING A BABY&#x27;S BOTTLE OR PACIFIER AWAY, YOU JUST HAVE TO STICK WITH IT. THIS PRODUCT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR YOUR THUMB SUCKER. IT BEATS SPENDING THOUSANDS ON BRACES IN THE YEARS TO COME.</li>
            <li> Very effective solution. My daughter (4 years old) successfully quit nail biting in one week.</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old girl was a chronic thumb sucker. When this arrived, she pouted and fussed, but using this product over the course of 2 days, my daughter is not sucking her thumb anymore. It goes on and stays on a long time. It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> product says it stops nail biting and it does.  this is negative reinforcement at its finest...apply and let the gag factor do its thing.  the results are worth the effort and cost of the product.</li>
            <li> This did not work for either of my two 20 month old boys.  However, I must say that when I put it on my own thumb to see what it was like, I thought it tasted horrible and it lasted for days.  It may just be that my boys wanted their thumbs enough to ignore the taste, but it didn&#x27;t even make them flinch.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was and that it works!  My daughter is 4 and I have been [[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 Mavala Stop-Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking Prevention, 10ml]]trying to discourage the thumb sucking for months.  I tried an inexpensive thumb guard and she just pulled it off.  This product was inexpensive (compared to thumb guards) and seemed to work from the first application.  The taste is very bitter (I put some on my nail to test it out) and has a nasty after taste.  It can transfer to finger foods, so be cautious.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s doing the trick and I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails horribly for almost 30 years, and tried all sorts of habit-breaking tactics to try and quit. At the point of giving up I thought I would give this a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks now since I first started putting this on, and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a few things about this that surprised me. One, it lasts and lasts, and also soaks into the skin around your fingertip so that if you bite or pull at your cuticles, this will effect that as well. One coat (I brush it over the end of the nail and on the skin around the nail as well) lasts almost 4-5 days. The taste is really bitter and unpleasant, but the worst part is that you can&#x27;t get it out of your mouth once you&#x27;ve touched your finger to your lips. The other thing I noticed is that it is so powerful, that if you&#x27;re even eating chips or other finger food, the taste will rub off on what you&#x27;re eating - even if you&#x27;re very careful! I&#x27;ve also learned to be careful about touching my lips with any part of my fingertips as it rubs off then too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been so effective that I have been using it less and less, and still managing to be deterred from the thought of bringing my hands to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister is now using this with her daughter for thumbsucking as it worked so well for me!</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased this product based on the reviews that we read.  We have a 6 year old son who has sucked his thumb from day 1 of life.  We figured 6 was past time to stop sucking his thumb and tried various ways of having him stop.  But, as you know if you used to be a thumb sucker (and I was,) it&#x27;s a habit that is hard to break - especially when you pop that thumb in your mouth while you&#x27;re asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one night of using this product I would say that my son stopped even subconciously sucking his thumb.  The first night was painful - I&#x27;m not going to lie - every time he tried to suck his thumb (rather if awake or asleep) he was in our room waking us up and wanting to get the taste out of his mouth.  Ever since that one night we weren&#x27;t awakened anymore and I would say that after one week of using it he doesn&#x27;t want to, or try to, suck his thumb at all.  Last night we didn&#x27;t put the product on his thumb and checked on him often.  No thumb in his mouth that we saw.  We would even let him put the product on his thumb to encourage active participation in this endeavor - he was very proud to use it and I think is happy that he&#x27;s not doing this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to use this in the summer while school is out based on the length of time it may take your child to stop sucking their thumb.  Better to have a restless night sleep during the summer than on a school night.  Thanks and good luck!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! It has a bitter taste and just 1 application lasts for 3-4 days on the nails. I purchased it because my child would not stop sucking her thumb. I tried everything from garlic, to hot sauce, rubbing aloe vera plant on thumb, to the THUM nail polish (sold at drug stores) and these did not work at all. Finally a hygentist told me about \\&quot;Mavala Stop\\&quot; but that I had to order it online. Well Mavala Stop worked the first time! My child could not stand the taste of the nail polish, she kept spitting and spitting trying to get it out of her mouth. I advise you to re-apply after 2-3 days just to keep the taste very strong. I continued to re-apply for 2 weeks just to be sure my child knew the taste was still there. She quickly understood that this did not taste good and no longer has a desire to suck her thumb. I put it on my niece also for nail bitting and it also helped her. This product is a WINNER!!</li>
            <li> Mavala works miracles!  My 7 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumb immediately after the first application.  She didn&#x27;t want to quit and cried the first night with the Mavala on. Now, two week later, she&#x27;s so proud of herself and even asks me to reapply the Mavala every couple of days.  I&#x27;m so happy that I don&#x27;t have to constantly nag her anymore and that she has now found a new confidence in herself.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable product. My 10 year old daughter had bitten her nails until they bled. I tried bribery, other products, you name it. STOP worked instantly! Within a few days she actually had visible nail growth. She is so  proud of them she now applies STOP on her own.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS! But it is so potent I think one bottle would last long enough to treat about 100 people. We used it to help our 3 year old daughter stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews unless a product really is impressive and this stuff is awesome!! My daughter is seven and had been sucking her fingers since she was born. 2 weeks of this stuff and she is cured! I am very impressed! I would caution people that it is strong so less is more.</li>
            <li> I have used everything possible to help my 4 year old stop biting her nails.  She would bite so bad that her fingers would bleed.  The other products we have used were OK but after a while she got used to the taste and continued to bite her nails.  Mavala Stop is so great because it is so nasty that my little girl just doesnt stick her fingers in her mouth.  It doesnt peel off like some other brands.  I do put it on her every day because i dont want the taste to wear off.  JUST IN CASE! I love it.  I can actually see some white on her nails and it has been about a month!</li>
            <li> this is a great product and so simple to use! It really is like nail polish. Paint it on and it last for several days. Taste bitter so they truly wont suck thier thumb! If you need to take it off use nail polish remover but its pretty stubborn so you have to scrub a little, then wash their hands and they are back to normal.</li>
            <li> The product tastes horrible but I wsh it lasted longer so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put it on every other day. The other downside is that the product gives your nail a feminine shine and I don&#x27;t like that because I&#x27;m a guy and people ask questions. Other that that, the product does what it says.</li>
            <li> We purchased Mavala Stop to get our two year old to stop sucking her thumb.  My husband and I both painted it on our thumbs first so we&#x27;d know what she would be experiencing.  We just put a small dab on each of her thumbs.  When she tried to put her thumb in her mouth, she instantly pulled it out, made a face and said this is icky.  She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since!</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb nothing seemed to work. we tried thumb gards fake nails, scary picture of bad teeth possitive incouragement, but the habit was too strong to break. we finally boughtthis and it worked like a charm. I even tasted it yuck!, I would stop too.</li>
            <li> It all had started the summer before my 7 year old son went into second grade.  He always had sucked two fingers at night but he started to suck them during the day.  Two weeks before school started I was at my wits end and tried EVERYTHING.  I heard about this and decided to buy it.  It was well worth the money for us.  He would not let me put it on during the day so I did it while he was sleeping (if you choose to do this you will be up all night) the taste was horrible (he said it tasted like a mixtue of poop, sand and throw up)!!!!!  Two weeks into school he has not sucked his fingers day or night!  I am so glad we gave it a try - it does not work for everyone - but when you are desprite it is worth a try!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked for a few days then my son must have gotten used to it because he continued to suck his thumb..even after twice a day applications!</li>
            <li> This helped my 4 year old daughter stop sucking her thumb inside 24 hrs. I put it on her thumbs about two hours before bed. She understood why I put it on and wouldn&#x27;t put her thumb in her mouth at all. Well here is where the traumatic event happened. I believe she naturally put her thumb in her mouth while sleeping and left it there. She woke up at 3am coughing, crying, and eventually puking. We worked hard on getting the taste out of her mouth. Water, crackers, and scrubbing with a toothbrush. Eventually she went back to sleep and hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since. She even comes up to me a couple times a day to brag on how she&#x27;s not sucking her thumb anymore. Mavala Stop works, but prepare yourself for the traumatic first steps!</li>
            <li> I bought this for 3 people in my family: DH 36 (nail biting), DS 6 y.o.(thumb sucking) and DS 3 y.o. (finger sucking).&lt;br /&gt;DH has been biting his nails as long as he can remember; we&#x27;ve been married 10 years and I&#x27;ve NEVER seen him have to cut his nails!  He used this ONE time.  He said he didn&#x27;t think it would work and didn&#x27;t want to use it again because of the \\&quot;girly\\&quot; nail polish look ;) (NOTE: This is a clear NAIL POLISH and has a clear but very shiny gloss to it like regular nail polish.) HOWEVER, he has not bitten his fingernails since; it was enough to make him stop and think every time he goes to bite his nails. A lifetime habbit broken in a couple of days!  He actually had to get his nails trimmed this week, and his nails and fingers look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This has also motivated DS 6 to stop his thumb sucking, and he pretty much stopped after a couple of weeks and only a few applications.&lt;br /&gt;DS 3 has been a little harder, and we have found we do have to be more consistent with reapplying the polish with him; however, with the polish on, he does avoid sucking his fingers much better.&lt;br /&gt;This is a LOT LESS EXPENSIVE than costly thumb sucking devices, so I would highly recommend trying this first.</li>
            <li> After the flu started going around I thought it was really important that my 3 year old son stop sucking his thumb.  I put Mavala on his nails and he tried once only to taste the bitters and stopped.  It does wear off after a day or two, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product indicates that children under 3 can&#x27;t use this (or won&#x27;t be able to taste the undesirable taste)...that&#x27;s not true.  I&#x27;d gotten fed up with my 5 year olds new \\&quot;finger chewing\\&quot; habit and ordered this.  I waited a few weeks until I tried it on him because we never happened to be near the bottle when I saw him with his fingers in his mouth.  When I saw BOTH of my kids with their hands in their mouths one evening, I slathered it on my 5 year olds fingernails AND my 22 month old daughter&#x27;s thumb nails (we&#x27;d recently taken away her pacifier and she&#x27;d quickly replaced it with her thumb...YUCK!)  It didn&#x27;t seem to deter my son at ALL, but it apparently tasted so bad to my 2 year old that she gagged and threw up repeatedly for the next 3 DAYS!!!  Needless to say, the thumb sucking has stopped, but for a week, I&#x27;ve felt like the mother of a sick newborn as she would wake up every 30 minutes gagging and screaming when she&#x27;d unconciously stuck her thumb in her mouth...it does NOT wash off!!!</li>
            <li> Helped my daughter stop her thumb sucking habit better than the retainer that was put in her mouth by the orthodontist.</li>
            <li> We bought Mavala stop last week for my 2 years 3 months old daughter who has been sucking her thumb since she was 3 months old. What a miracle product Mavala stop is..it worked rightaway. She completly stopped her thumb sucking habit. Since she is only 2 years old, initially we were concerned about the safety of Mavala but it is not a problem. We did try Thum but she started relishing rightaway. Mavala is a great product.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  We have used it before for our six-year-old who is trying to stop sucking his thumb.  Unfortunately, the bottle is fragile.  We just received one today, and my curious 3-year-old dropped it out of the box, and the glass bottle broke at the neck, and the contents spilled all over the floor.  So I&#x27;m back to order another...grrr...</li>
            <li> My daughter is 7 years old and had sucked her thumb since birth. She could do without sucking her finger during the day but couldn&#x27;t stop at bedtime. So she was ready to stop but couldn&#x27;t stop the habit. I purchased this item on a friends recommendation, and applied it nightly for about 25 days (some nights we forgot). After that my daugher has stopped sucking her thumb. I think this product is a useful tool when the child is ready.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son to prevent him from sucking his fingers. As soon as he put it in his mouth, he noticed the taste. I tested it out on my pinky finger to make sure it wasnt too much for him. He did not like it at all and cried until him grandma forced me to take it off. Needless to say he did not want to put his fingers in his mounth with the polish on. Ill give him some more time to giv eup the habit. However, if he abuses his baby ways...i&#x27;ll put the polish on.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her 2 middle fingers for years and we had tried all kinds of things to get her to stop.....our pediatric dentist recommended this product and it actually worked....and worked quick!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000N2JL1E Mavala - Mavala Stop Nail Biting Deterrent - .3 fl. oz.]]</li>
            <li> My child quit sucking her thumb in 2 days!  She was an extreme thumb sucker.  Not anymore.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought, could it really be that easy and simple?  The answer is YES!!!  I was skeptical about the usefulness of this product.  After trying thumb covers, etc, nothing had worked. Before I went to the dentist for a costly orthodonic tool, I decided to try.  The first night, success!  This works so well.  I only had to re-apply twice, especially if child takes a bath.  After a week, no more thumb sucking.  My child is cured after 7 years of trying, this worked as soon as applied, and only had to use for a week!  WOW!  You HAVE to give this a try!</li>
            <li> In my case, this did not work for my 11 year old son. We&#x27;d tried several other products over the years also to no avail. We&#x27;d hoped after a few years and matured taste buds that we&#x27;d try a nail product again. His dentists and doctors kept saying he&#x27;d quit &#x27;when he was ready&#x27; but it&#x27;s too difficult now. We thought this might help. It took him one day to get used to the taste. He&#x27;s hardcore! We&#x27;ll be moving on to the dental appliance now...</li>
            <li> This product is great it works excellent for helping children stop sucking their thumb. I tried Thum first and it sucks didn&#x27;t even work at all. Bought this and worked like a charm. I even tried it on myself and it stop me from nail biteing if you buy anything but this product.</li>
            <li> As awful as this tastes, our daughter, who is a major thumb sucker, said \\&quot;well, not too bad\\&quot; and kept rigth on sucking.  It doesn&#x27;t even slow her down.  It does taste horrible though and does last a few days.  Just didn&#x27;t help habit...at all....</li>
            <li> My 4-yr old sucks his ring and middle finger and has a lisp because of it. Our speech therapist recommended this and it definantly makes him stop putting his fingers in his mouth.  We can&#x27;t use it per instructions because he got used to the taste and actually liked it!  It works wonders if I don&#x27;t reapply it for about a week. So far, he is still trying to suck his fingers any chance he gets...</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for nearly 30 years.  When I noticed my 6 year old biting hers just like I had all my life, I decided it was time to stop and that we would do it together.  I shopped around and saw this product was highly rated so I decided to try it.  It has been one of the greatest products I have ever purchased.  It is the PERFECT amount of discouragement, especially for those of us who bite unconsciously.  I am so proud of my hands now, I show them off.  We used it steady as directed for about a month and a half.  Now I only use it occasionally.  We have not bitten our nails since putting it on.  It tastes TERRIBLE and the taste lingers in your mouth, which is great to train yourself not to bite.  Now my daughter and I give ourselves a manicure every week to reward ourselves.  :)  I recommend this highly for anyone who wants to quit.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had a finger sucking habit since birth. I had tried many other technigues to stop the habit, but nothing worked until Mavala Stop. I stared using this product about 2 weeks ago, and my daugther has stopped sucking her finger. I tasted the product myself and it is terrible. I am using this in combination with a reward chart, and we are making great progess.</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world.  It took only 3-4 weeks for the habit to stop.  This was for a 5 year old who really loved his thumb.  An easy move, just paint the thumbnail once a week with the clear polish.  It tastes horrible, put thumb in mouth the first time and out it came. From then on when awake it would make it to just before his mouth then he would put the thumb down.  Once at night while asleep it popped in woke him up saying yuck.  Wonderful item.[[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 Mavala Stop-Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking Prevention, 10ml]]</li>
            <li> Within a week my daughter had stopped sucking her thumb!!</li>
            <li> Our daughter is 2 and-a-half and loved to suck her thumb.  All of the time, especially when going to sleep.  My wife and I didn&#x27;t have any concern (given how young she is, we figured she would grow out of it), but our dentist said that her teeth were getting out of position and that we should try to get her to stop.  We looked at thumb guards, but they looked so bulky for a toddler, so we bought this product after a recommendation from a friend.  For about a week, we tried to get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb by encouragement and rewards, but she was too young for that to work and said that stopping sucking her thumb would make her feel \\&quot;sad.\\&quot;  You know, she would say \\&quot;go away,\\&quot; and then she would suck her thumb.  So, we bought Mavala and explained to her that this would help her stop sucking her thumb.  At first, she didn&#x27;t want it, but then she said she wanted to stop sucking her thumb and wanted to try it.  We put one coat on her left thumb, and immediately were told, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like that,\\&quot; and \\&quot;wash that off\\&quot; and \\&quot;I don&#x27;t like that taste.\\&quot;  Heard it many times and each time, we tried to change the subject.  And, guess what -- she STOPPED sucking her thumb.  At night, this girl who always fell asleep with her thumb in her mouth stopped as well.  It wasn&#x27;t the easiest night, but the next day and night things were so much better.  We are on day 3 and we reapplied a coat to make sure we don&#x27;t lose any of the gains, but so far, this is working like a charm and, as a parent, have to say it has been relatively painless.  Sure, it was cute when her thumb was in her mouth and she was sleeping.  But it wouldn&#x27;t be cute when in a few years her teeth would be all misaligned and we would be paying substantial orthodontic bills.  In short, if you are considering this product even for someone as young as two and a half, as long as he or she can somewhat understand what is going on, then this product could not be more recommended.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old stopped thumb sucking in less than 2 weeks. Had no problems, no vomiting, no complaints; she just simply stopped. Told all my friends about it. Wish i knew about this product earlier...</li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;bite no more\\&quot; nail polish from Sally&#x27;s here in town to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb. It started to work, she didn&#x27;t like the taste, but after about a week she realized if she just sucked through the bad taste for a minute or so it would go away. Or if she washed her hands it would go away. It just wasn&#x27;t working. So I decided to go with Mavala. I ordered it here on Amazon and was really hoping it would work since it was so much more expensive than the other stuff. We tried it and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since!! She JUST turned 3, but she tells me, mommy I don&#x27;t suck my thumb anymore! She&#x27;s proud of herself and I&#x27;m so happy I decided to purchase this. It tastes REALLY bad and it DOESN&#x27;T come off by washing hands, or anything else that I&#x27;ve noticed but time. It says to reapply every 2 days, but we made it part of our bedtime ritual to apply every night. (bath, lotion, pjs, nail stuff.) She does tell me sometimes when she&#x27;s eating finger foods that it tastes bad because her finger medicine got on it, but it&#x27;s so worth not having her suck her thumb anymore. She was VERY into her thumb. Actually one of her ultrasound pictures she was sucking her thumb...so it was a total comfort habit for her from day one. I highly highly recommend this product. We&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and sometimes now we don&#x27;t put it on for days and she&#x27;s still not sucking her thumb. Thank you so much!!! Buying this $10 bottle of nail polish will definately save me money in dental bills down the line!!</li>
            <li> I bit my nails for nearly 20 years.  Finally, about a year ago, I bought this product, and I was finally able to stop.  I had tried everything I could think of - just focusing on not biting, rubber bands on my wrist, and other random stuff that really just did not work.  This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You paint it on your nails.  It looks like clear polish.  It coats on pretty thin.  I&#x27;m female, but I think as a man it&#x27;s subtle enough wearing it wouldn&#x27;t be too bad.  It adds some shine, so it&#x27;s not invisible.  Anyway, you will notice anytime you put your hands on or in your mouth.  I thought I just had my hands near my mouth when biting my nails, but I realized I put them near my mouth other times as well, such as when eating foods with my fingers.  You&#x27;ll find you want to use silverware or eat a lot more carefully - no more licking food off your fingers!  Anyway, for a chronic nailbiter, you&#x27;ve probably already started before you notice, and you don&#x27;t want to leave a hangnail after that.  At least that was the way for me.  With this stuff, you&#x27;ll stop immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is definitely unpleasant, but it definitely won&#x27;t make you sick.  The best part was, despite nearly 20 years of biting, after using this stuff for 2 or 3 weeks, I stopped using it, and I didn&#x27;t start biting again. The habit had just disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To not relapse, I recommend keeping your nails fairly short.  Having long nails is annoying if you&#x27;re not used to it.  Also, at the first sign of relapse, use the polish again.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s online catalog information doesn&#x27;t say that it is only for 3+ years but the label on the box says so. I still tried to use it for my 1 yr old daughter, looks like she is having a real strong intent of \\&quot;thumb sucking\\&quot;.. so, mavala helped to stop a bit but we could not use it full fledged as the box says \\&quot;only for 3+ yrs\\&quot;... need to wait for 2 more years and give a try if my daughter continues her thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> I had an 11 year old thumb sucker.  She would often do it in her sleep at night, completely unaware that she was even doing it. We&#x27;d tried all the tricks.  Mittens, THUM nail paint, bandages, lectures from the dentist, a visit to the orthodontist for a lecture, rewards, consequenses, I even crocheted her a thumb cover to wear.  Nothing worked. She just did not want to give up her habit badly enough.  I came to amazon.com and searched for thumb sucking remedies and saw the terrific reviews for Mavala Stop, saw the reasonable price, and thought what the heck...  Our son also bites his knuckles and constantly has his hands near his mouth - not a good thing when flu season is upon us.  I painted the stuff on my daughter&#x27;s thumbnails and also on my son&#x27;s fingernails.  That night they both made the mistake of putting their fingers in their mouth.  My son came down from his room complaining about feeling sick.  My daughter said she almost ran to the bathroom to throw up.  What a wakeup!  Neither of them has had their hands in their mouths in over 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve barely even used the contents in the bottles.  There should be enough in there to share with someone else once we&#x27;re certain that we&#x27;re finished with it for good. Our kids have learned to eat finger foods carefully so that their nails don&#x27;t touch their food or their mouths.  This stuff has worked wonders and I would highly recommend it to anyone else who might be dealing with finger-to-mouth habits.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son who is 9 and sucks his thumb when he sleeps. We used it ONE time. He kept complaining about still having the taste in his mouth shortly after going to bed. Apparently he put his thumb in his mouth as he was falling asleep and the taste got him up out of the bed. Complained of a stomach ache and was drooling and gagging and very shortly vomited from the taste. Made this mom feel horrible for using it on his nails! Used nail polish remover to get it off of his fingers. This was the one and only time is has been or will be used. I suppose if you think the vomiting is a good enough deterrent for the child it would be a successful product for you to use. The side effects for my child greatly outweighed the possible benefits.</li>
            <li> got this for my 3 year old who has a bad problem with sucking her thumb. product works, just have to re-apply every other day or so</li>
            <li> I kept my fingers FAR away from my mouth.  It tastes horrible!  I&#x27;ve been a nail chewer for most of my life and haven&#x27;t bitten them since using this product.</li>
            <li> Working well with my 6 year old nail biter.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter when she was six and she HATED it!  Just a little of the product on the finger nails will deter anyone from sucking thumbs/fingers as well as biting nails.  The taste of Mavala Stop is beyond what I can describe - kind of a cross between sucking batteries and chewing old tin foil.  A very nasty metallic taste.&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution, be careful of using this product on the pads of the fingers as the taste will transfer to foods eaten with hands, learned this the hard way!</li>
            <li> I am 17 years old, and I&#x27;ve been biting my nails since before I can remember. My mom was so sick of my nail bitting that she even offered me rewards to quit. I seriously thought I would never be able to break the habit since it was so ingrained in my mind. I was sometimes able to quit for a couple of weeks, but I always feel back into the habit. But so far with Mavala, I haven&#x27;t even nibbled my nails!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great because it tastes awful; it&#x27;s very bitter. My problem with bitting my nails is that I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m doing it. But since I have painted Mavala on them, I realize what I&#x27;m doing and being punished, too. Nail bitting isn&#x27;t an anxiety reliefer anymore since the taste ruined any enjoyment I had in bitting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this product is that if I eat foods with my hands, I sometimes accidently taste the Mavala. That sucks, but I must say it&#x27;s worth it to have long nails. I regret not finding this stuff sooner! I&#x27;d recommend this product to ANYONE who wants to quit a habit.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. My (recently turned) four year old had been sucking his thumb sinc he was in utero and it was quite a bad habit. We started him off with a seven day period that he had to stop and then we would give him a cheap toy that he really wanted. He tried but really struggled when he was distracted (like watching a movie) or when he was going to bed. BUT this product helped him to remember! He immediately did it! He went seven days without sucking his thumb and he got a special toy. We are taking him to Chuck E Cheese&#x27;s tonight to celebrate that he has gone 22 days!!! This product is awesome! I apply it every day to every other day and my son doesn&#x27;t complain. Thank you Mavala!!!</li>
            <li> We tried Mavala Stop at the recommendation of the pediatrician and dentist.  It worked for about 2 weeks then she was back to sucking her fingers again.  I have to admit, if it was me, I would stop, but my daughter is strong willed and would rather put up with the aweful taste then stop sucking her fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product will work for most, but not for the extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li> My wife and I purchased this for our 2 1/2 yr son... hoping that it would stop him from sucking his thumb. Please note that the bottle recommends not giving this to any child under 3, but my wife and I were desperate :) The product works! I applied it once and my son has never sucked his thumb again. I recommend that you use it with caution and not put on too much like I did. I thought that I only put on a little, but my son&#x27;s digestive system has a difference of opinion. After sucking his thumb (while the polish was on) for approx. 30 seconds he took it out and complained about his mouth feeling funny. 20 seconds later his lunch from earlier that day was on the floor (this is the clean version).  Ever since the puke incident, he has never sucked his thumb again.</li>
            <li> This only took one application for my 3 and a half year old son.  He won&#x27;t stick his thumbs in his mouth at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 5 (almost 6) year old girl is a little more stubborn.  I&#x27;m confident that this will speed up the end of her finger sucking.  She is sucking it less.  For her, she needs a fresh application right before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two children had different sucking styles.  My son would suck his thumb to fall asleep and then out the thumb would fall.  My daughter sucked her finger to fall asleep, when she was bored, when she watched tv, and in the middle of the night.  She now only sucks it in the middle of the night, but not for very long.  So, I&#x27;m optimistic this will work.  We&#x27;ll see how long it takes.</li>
            <li> Long story short... I have a 3 1/2 year-old who was a constant CONSTANT thumb sucker...  Tried \\&quot;Thum\\&quot; product and he actually liked the flavor... tried reminding him constantly, putting tape on his thumbs, bribing him, etc.  I used Mavala Stop ONCE on the thumbs.  As recommended by another reviewer I just put a small amount on his thumbnail near the base of each nail to avoid getting the taste on his food, and eureka, it worked.  He was a little sad for the first few hours, but quickly got over it and I&#x27;m so happy I tried this.  He has really opened up without that thumb in his mouth all the time!  He chats constantly and seems to enjoy his newfound thumb-freedom!  I have not had to reapply it, which amazes me because he ALWAYS had that thumb in his mouth and I thought I&#x27;d never get him to quit, let alone so easily.  Wish I had found this product sooner, but I would recommend it to anyone with a similar problem.  Best ten dollars spent ever!</li>
            <li> This stuff works excellent! I have used it with 2 of my kids to get them to stop sucking their thumbs. Within a few days, they are over their habit! I have recommended this to several friends and they have all had the same result. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> This item worked great, I only had to reapply it once and the thumb-sucking habit was kicked in a week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of any product for eliminating thumbsucking, especially when I was seeing thumb apparatus for stopping it. I had my questions: how would she eat, hold a fork or pencil? Would I have to put her in this while she was at school because I know she sucks her thumb when she&#x27;s there? Wow! The cost of some are unbelievable (over $100)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews for Mavala were so great and cost was minimal compared to the other options, I figured why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been explaining to her that she is a big girl and needs to stop sucking her thumb. She would suck while watching TV, riding in a car, listening to a story, the park, the grocery store, basically anywhere her hands weren&#x27;t occupied. She finally agreed to stopping and I told her we were getting her some nailpolish to help her stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was excited to put it on because it is nailpolish but the first time she put her thumb in her mouth she started to gag; not the \\&quot;I&#x27;m going to get sick\\&quot; gag but the \\&quot;Holy cow, what did I just put in my mouth\\&quot; gag. I will admit that she did cry a few days later when I wanted to put more on. She sat in my lap, crying and saying, \\&quot;throw that yucky stuff away, Mommy, throw it away, it&#x27;s so yucky.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will also admit that she was crying so hard that I almost did stop treatment. I held her tight and looked at her and said, \\&quot;You know what though? You&#x27;re doing such a great job with not sucking your thumb! Have you noticed that you don&#x27;t suck your thumb anymore? You&#x27;re getting to be such a big girl like your sisters!!\\&quot; And that little bit of encouragement made the tears stop and made her hold her thumb out and say, \\&quot;OK, Mommy, you can put it on again.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is grand and I recommend it to everyone who has a thumbsucker or who bites their nails. I put some on my thumb to show my daughter that I can wear it too. Later that night I brush my thumb passed my lips and started gagging like my daughter! haha. This stuff is awful but very effective. It works! And hopefully we can stave off braces!ffective. It works! And hopefully we can stave off braces!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different methods to stop biting my nails including other &#x27;bad tasting&#x27; products.  This product by far is the most disgusting and the taste lingers for days on my nails (even with several hand washings, showers, etc.).  I highly recommend this product to anyone with a nail biting problem. *blah*</li>
            <li> For 18 years I had sucked my thumb. I always thought, I could quit whenever I was ready but somehow could never stop. I was embarrassed for so long because it caused my teeth to poke out. Then one day, I saw this product on amazon and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. Within a week I quit an 18 year old habit and could not believe it. If this product can work for me then it can work for any one.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical when I ordered it. My kids, ages 4 and 6, both were sucking thumbs and we tried over the last couple of years would get them to stop. After applying \\&quot;MAVALA Stop for Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking\\&quot; on their thumb nails, my 6 years old stopped sucking her thumb immediately. The thumb did not taste good anymore. My 4 year old tried sucking her thumb a few more times, drinking a couple cups of water every time she tried, to wash the bad taste out of her mouth. After about a week of painting their thumb nails with MAVALA, my kids do not suck their thumbs anymore. I wish I tried this years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that stops my daughter from putting her fingers and thumb in her mouth. I give it 10 stars!!</li>
            <li> unfortunately this product did not work.  my 2.5 year old daughter actually LIKED the taste and requested it be put on her finger so she could enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  we tried this again when my daughter was 4.5.  this time it did work - 2 weeks later, no more nail biting!  had to re-apply every night (and promise a entire princess outfit when nails grew out) but it did work</li>
            <li> This product works a wonder. My three year old would not stop sucking her thumb regardless of our effort to keep it out of her mouth. We tried the product together with positive reinforcement, highlighting that the liquid in her finger is \\&quot;just to remind her not to suck her thumb\\&quot;. It took her just one unconscious try to notice that the finger now tasted REALLY BAD. I highly advice this product, along with so much needed positive feedback to help the baby break the habit. P.S. make sure your baby does not associate it with a punishment or threat.[[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 MAVALA Stop for Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking]]</li>
            <li> My son is almost 5. He has sucked his thumb since he was in the womb. I seriously had doubts, and guilt, over using a product to take away his method of self soothing. I decided the benefits would greatly out weigh the negatives when we were all continuously sick this past year. Santa brought this product to my son as an early gift with the promise of a big reward on christmas morning if he was successful and committed to changing this behavior. It literally took two days. He was so proud of himself too. We all really love this product, my husband even started using it on his nails. It has been two months and every now and again he puts his thumb in his mouth, but we are diligent in putting the stuff on it whenever we notice him sucking, which is maybe 3 times in the last month. He doesn&#x27;t fight it either, he actually sticks his thumb out so we can apply it. The best part? We have all been healthy for the past 2 months!</li>
            <li> **Important to know**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that a child&#x27;s taste buds are not fully developed before 2 years old.  The reviews that say this does not work were usually for children under 2.  Your child needs to be able to TASTE this for it to work.  Just something to be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used this for my son that sucked his thumb all the time, in the car, watching tv, all night, everywhere.  We tried a lot of things...  It took ONE application and he stopped completely.</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old son has been biting his nails since he was old enough to bring his fingers to his mouth and no amount of reminding, begging, rewards, removal of favorite toys or other creative solutions would stop him from biting his nails past the quick.... and he would even gnaw his cuticles.  We tried Thumb, which may as well have been candy for as good as it worked.  I was at my wits ends because his cuticles were getting swollen with infection.  I finally saw Mavala Stop and the reviews, and hoped it would work for us.  We have used it for 4 days, and already he is growing nails!  It took one time in his mouth and he was crying \\&quot;help, there is a bad taste in my mouth, ahhhhhh\\&quot; and I took that opportunity to tell him that was because he bit his nails.  He has not bitten them once since then, and even he is proud and gets a big smile when I show him he has white on his nails now.  I will keep using it for awhile to make sure the habit is broken but I am a believer.  I got a bit in my mouth after applying it on my son, and I can attest to fact it taste really awful, but it isn&#x27;t harmful and it really works!  It is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Day 1 - My almost 3yr old cried when she tasted this on her thumb.  It was upsetting to see her that upset and I questioned my decision to actually buy and use this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2- \\&quot;I like the way this tastes.  Let me put it on\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that was it.</li>
            <li> really worked!!! tasted bad enough that both my 6 yr old and 4 yr old stopped sucking their thumbs! loved it. (the organic cayenne pepper one didn&#x27;t work, too easy to suck it off)</li>
            <li> My daughter did not love this option but it worked very effectively. She is 6 and just enjoys her thumb at night. She didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d be able to fall asleep without it. The first 2 nights were tough but she did it. After 2 weeks, we no longer needed to apply it. She was done!</li>
            <li> It worked the first day! My son is 5 and has been sucking his 2 middle fingers all these years and nothing else worked. Try it and you won&#x27;t be sorry you did! Less than a month and he is finger sucking free! IT&#x27;S AWESOME and best of all IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> My 3 year ond&#x27;s dentist reccomended this to stop thumb sucking and it did not work at all. It taste TERRIBLE!!! but he will just sit there and suck it all off. It actually made him suck his thumb more because it made him focused on it. I think the best thing is just to ignote it until he gets old enough to want to stop. He is actually doing better with this approach.</li>
            <li> Used just a tiny dab on my son&#x27;s (3 1/2 years old) thumb nails once every other day for a week. I did both so he wouldn&#x27;t just start sucking on the other thumb instead. Eventually I forgot to keep applying because he stopped sucking his thumb! Very effective. He didn&#x27;t complain about the taste either, although I did warn him about it before he found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> It is great 3 applications and my daughter stop sucking her thum</li>
            <li> I have 3 1/2 years old daughter.  she never bite her nail until 5-6 month ago she start to bite her nail.  I heard from my cousin said about this product.  I decided to purchase and try on my little girl. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it work on her.  Now her finger nail start growing back like normal.  I would recommend this product for all the mother who has the children bite their finger nail.</li>
            <li> Which I guess it is supposed to be since it helps you stop putting your fingers in your mouth...</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has been biting his nails for about a year. For some reason, the Mavala just doesn&#x27;t stop him. Can&#x27;t quite understand why because the taste is horrible! Usually, he puts up a fight during application but after a few hours, he&#x27;s back at it. Now I find myself searching for another product that&#x27;ll stop his nail biting.</li>
            <li> Stopping nail biting is tough, but I can guarantee you that if you apply Mavala as directed you will not nail bite. It is a powerful formula with an incredibly bitter taste which stopped me dead. It is difficult to imagine anyone who would continue to nail bite after tasting Mavala. The key, of course, is that you have to use it religiously. If you do, it will work.</li>
            <li> I had a 5 1/2 year old thumb sucker and 3 1/2 year old finger sucker. At our last dental visit the dentist commented that both of them had dental issues that would continue if the thumb and finger sucking continued. It was also a little exasperating to see my beautiful daughter at her ballet class doing lovely dance moves with great posture, pointed toes and.....her fingers in her mouth. I was about ready to try one of those very expensive finger and thumb guards when my friend mentioned this product. I applied it to the kids favorite fingers as soon as the Mavala Stop came in the mail. Each of them got it in their mouth a couple of times the first day. They had to take a quick drink of water or juice to get rid of the taste. They learned really quickly though and now, one week later, they have both stopped. There was no agony, reminding, pleading or bribing. They just quit. I love this and have already got two more friends using it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a friend recommended it to me. I was a little skeptical because I had heard of others who used a similar product who told me this did not work for them. My six year old was willing to try and the first day she accidentally put her thumb in her mouth 3 times. She definitely did not like the taste. I only put&lt;br /&gt;it on her nails. After that first day she did not suck her thumb again. I reapplied it every 2 days for about 2 weeks. She never complained about her food tasting bad as others have talked about. She was careful not to lick her fingers but she did eat snacks with her hands and was fine. She has been about 4 weeks without sucking her thumb at all. This product definitely worked for us. I do think you have to be consistent about putting it on their fingers. I can see how it is better on older children.</li>
            <li> I am 36 years old and have bitten my fingernails my entire life.  I have a 5 year old son who sucks his thumb and bites his nails.  So I have tried a lot of stuff for both of us and nothing worked until I bought Mavala.  This stuff is so disgusting tasting there is just no way you would want your fingers near your mouth. I used it for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had to use it since and I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails a single time.  My five year old has stopped sucking his thumb completely and now we are working on all his nails and so far so good.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works.  Taste horrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely does the job!! However, there are a few cons regarding the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you eat a lot of finger food be prepared to constantly taste this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you rub your eyes prepare to feel a burning sensation. It rubbed off a little easier than I anticipated, even with a clear coat over it!&lt;br /&gt;3. If you use this to stop a child from sucking his or her thumb I would be careful to only use a small amount. This stuff is strong and I imagine it will cause a gag reflex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product did its job! I had a bad nail biting habit and this product did the trick in a matter of 2 1/2 months. It doesn&#x27;t take much (I still have 3/4 of a bottle left) and depending on how bad your habit is will determine how long you should use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think ANYTHING was going to get my six year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, but this worked in only 1 application.  I kept putting it on every few days (just at the base of her nails) just in case, but it&#x27;s been over a month now and she seems to have completely forgotten the habit!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son has been biting his nails to the point that since he was about one year old I NEVER could clip his finger nails. It got so bad to the extent that he was chewing his fingers and they were sore and getting infected. I tried any remedy from pharmacies even tried cayenne pepper, he would simply wash the them off. I ordered this one bc of seeing over 500 + review. It only took him one week of application. I am so thankful and recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> Helps, but no product is the answer for the underlying issue - good supplemental.</li>
            <li> After trying the THUMB nail solution, band-aids, gloves on hands and everything else I had heard of, I had almost given up on finding a solution that would work for my 23 month old daughter.  She has very dry skin and sucked her two middle fingers.  It was causing her skin to crack and our doctor recommended we try to get her to stop sucking even though she was so young. I was so happy to find Mavala Stop with all of it&#x27;s promising reviews.  The first day, my daughter was not happy with the taste but decided it was worth to keep sucking her fingers and crying that they were \\&quot;yucky\\&quot;.  This continued for a couple days and I was afraid this would also not work, but by the end of the week she had completely stopped sucking her fingers! I continued to paint it on her nails for an entire month just to ensure she had broken the habit.  I only used an 8th of the bottle and my neighbors and friends come over to put it on their kid&#x27;s (ages 3-5) nails.  I would recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> I am so, so happy to find out that this was the push my 6 year old needed to stop sucking her thumb. She didn&#x27;t just suck her thumb at night, she sucked it through the day as well. We were looking into thumb guards and other expensive contraptions, but came across a review for this product and are so glad we gave it a shot. For us, this worked. I only wish we did this sooner. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 yr. old daughter started biting her nails. They were getting very low and I did&#x27;nt know how to make her stop. Then I came across MAVALA. I got it in 2 days of ordering it and I thought that was great. Then the test came to see if it worked. I told my daughter if you bite your nails below a certain point they are gonna start to taste funny. \\&quot;due to Mavala bitter taste\\&quot;. I polished her nail with a color first and put Mavala on as a top coat. I then had her polish mine with Mavala so she did&#x27;nt think any thing was different. Well....with-in a day she STOPED biting her nails. She would bite her nails and say mommy my nails taste funny and run to get her drink. I felt bad due to the bitter taste but it worked in 0NE DAY! I tasted it to cause I wanted to know what she was gonna experience. It was bitterly gross. This works!!!</li>
            <li> The box says it doesn&#x27;t work for kids under three because of undeveloped taste buds but the online description does not (my kid is three-and-a-half).  The serum is supposed to work for two days, but 24 hours later my kid is unaffected.  I tasted it and it is just like wet nail polish.  Maybe this will work on her next year...bummer.</li>
            <li> Basically worked immediately for our 4-year-old thumb sucker. I took the advice of some other reviewers and told her that she is a big girl and that the thumb fairy would probably soon come and sprinkle fairy dust on her thumb, signalling to her that it&#x27;s time for her to stop.  Applied the first night while asleep-- she coughed and gagged mildly a couple of times, but that was it; has barely put her thumb in her mouth since then (5 days later), and she was a frequent thumb-sucker.  She wasn&#x27;t upset about it either, just took it in stride.  Of note, it says to apply every other day, but after a long day in the swimming pool, I think the taste had dissipated and therefore have applied it daily for this reason.  Also, please note, the package insert says that it likely WILL NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN 3 AND UNDER as their taste buds don&#x27;t have the same sensitivity to the bitter taste.  Many people who found this product ineffective had children under 3, although some were lucky enough that it worked despite the younger age of their children.  Keep this in mind if you&#x27;re ordering for a younger child.</li>
            <li> we used this for about 3 weeks before our kid stopped sucking his thumb.  He was mad everytime we put it on .  Hehehehe</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My five year old son was biting his nails until they bled.  Out of desperation I ordered Mavala and applied a tiny dot on each finger.  I didn&#x27;t want to overwhelm him with the taste so I only put a little bit on at first.  Three days later I checked his nails and they were all growing back wonderfully.  We did another light application after that and again, he did not bite them!  We have gone a couple weeks without an application and he hasn&#x27;t chewed his nails down since.  He is now proud to show me how well his nails are growing!  I&#x27;m so happy we were able to tackle this habit while he is young!  I occasionally bite my nails too and it has helped remind me not to.  It tastes terrible - and works!</li>
            <li> Product worked soo good it prevented our boy from eating finger foods. Due to this product our sons fingers are no longer dry, cracked, &amp; sore.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, there&#x27;s just one problem you can no longer eat food that involves your hands. Or prepare food for that matter. But if that&#x27;s what it takes! This stuff lasts through multiple hand washes and leaves a horrid bitter taste in your mouth that lingers</li>
            <li> Our 2 1/2 year old has been sucking his thumb since birth.  We were afraid that he would need extensive dental work (braces) if he were to continue sucking his thumb.  We ordered this as a last resort and boy oh boy - this should have been our first choice!  We applied it once and poof - no more thumb sucking!  It has a very nasty taste that stays on the nail for days...  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my three year old son who did not want to stop sucking his fingers.  I was a little hesitant because he is the kid who will eat anything with any flavor.  We joke that he does not have taste buds, but apparently he does.  He does not like this product at all.  When he forgets that it is on his fingers (and I had to paint them all)  he makes the funniest face of disgust and tells me it is disgusting.  I tried it one time to see what taste could make him stop and the closest I can describe it as is a really strong dandelion stem taste.  Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Our 6-year-old daughter just couldn&#x27;t seem to shake her awful thumb-sucking habit, until we found this product.  After just a week and a half, she has completely stopped sucking her thumb.  We didn&#x27;t even make it to the three-week mark, as we didn&#x27;t need to.  Now, about 1 month later, she has shown no signs of thumb sucking again.  Thank goodness.  My only recommendation is to use it in small quantities on the offending digit, as we originally put excess amounts on all of her fingers and then she complained about eating, etc., as mentioned by another poster above.  Once we dialed back the dosage to just the target thumb and only applied a small amount near the tip, all seemed to work well for us.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It only worked for 1 day, then my 3yr old got used to it and started thumb sucking again.</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala Stop for my three year old that was sucking her thumb.  The first time I put it on her thumb, I put too much on and she got sick.  I waited a couple of weeks and tried again.  I only put a TINY dab on the end of her thumb the second time around.  She didn&#x27;t get sick and she quit sucking her thumb!  She was a major thumb sucker before we used this product, so I was a little skeptical, but it really did work.  I was very pleased with the results.  Just make sure to not use too much.  You don&#x27;t want your child getting sick.  This product is very strong, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID WONDERS TO MY CHILDS FINGER NAILS.  SHE HAD BEEN BITTING THEM SINCE SHE WAS 3 AND AFTER 7 YEARS FINALLY HAS FINGER NAIL TIPS.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t altogether work for us like it did for so many of the reviews that I read before purchasing it. My son is very persistent and stubborn so when we are met with behavior that needs changing it is always difficult to find the solution. It somewhat deterred him, mostly because of the idea of it I think, but I had to reapply it daily and two weeks into the whole process he is still biting his fingers and nails albeit not quite as often as prior to our using Mavala. I think that it would work on other kids who are not as willful.</li>
            <li> While waiting for it to arrive in the mail. (Less than a week via USPS priority to Hawaii) I prepared my son by explaining the consequences of thumb sucking, ESPECIALLY the part where his thumb will start to \\&quot;rot\\&quot; and taste bad. (Yes, I know it&#x27;s a lie, but it&#x27;s a little white one. Besides, he recently lost 4 front teeth.) Everyday, with the sight of him sucking his thumb, he would be reminded of the impending \\&quot;rotting and bad taste\\&quot;. The Mavala Stop arrived and I painted his whole thumb nail early the following morning while he was still asleep. That morning, he was upset that his thumb went from really delicious to really nasty in one night. I really felt bad. So bad, that I cleaned the \\&quot;rot\\&quot; off. (In hind sight, I should have painted a thin stripe the first night and increased the coverage over the next 3-4 nights.) The second night, I painted a thin stripe. He woke that morning, slightly upset, and told me that I was right, his thumb did start to rot and taste bad. I increased the coverage since and reapplied about every 3 days. Within 2 weeks of starting this my little boy broke this habit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are some kids where other thumb sucking remedies do work. For the ones that are resistant those other remedies there is Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  Because it tastes so horrible and the taste lingers for a very long time.. it reminds me not to bite my nails.  The thing I like, yet one that drives me so insane is.. that I always tend to bite my nails or smoke when I get hungry.. meaning right before eating.  I got this awesome 5 star pizza, and right before eating.. i bit my nail forgetting I have it on.  Big mistake.  I am eating the pizza now, with the horrible taste in my mouth.  Ruined my dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month now since I&#x27;ve been using it.. and I&#x27;ve never had my finger nails this long.  It is kinda gross but, I&#x27;m 29, and I&#x27;ve stopped using nail clippers when I was like 14 and I just recently started using them.  I see reviews talking about how it does not work on kids, and I can see why.  It tastes horrible and shocking at first, but I think if kids are stubborn they will keep doing it.  The things is.. I actually wanted to stop (since I&#x27;m nearing 30 and I was still biting my nails).  This worked as a shock reminder every time i bit my nail because I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;try\\&quot; to bite my nails, only to stop the biting without thinking.  So perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t have worked for me either, if I was a child and I was \\&quot;wanting to bite\\&quot; and forced myself to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Since my now 4-year-old son was three months old, he&#x27;s sucked his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rare that we can find a photo of him without his thumb being in the vicinity of his mouth; not always in but definitely nearby at the ready!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have tried everything to get him to stop this horrible habit: promises of rewards, pepper, Tabasco sauce....you name it, we tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking into consideration that my now 13-year-old sucked his two middle fingers until he was three (stopping on his own), we even tried waiting it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after doing plenty of research, I learned it is an absolute must that children stop sucking their thumb by time their permanent front teeth are coming in; which is typically around the age of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention that I really didn&#x27;t want to send a kid off to kindergarten still sucking his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of our other efforts appeared to be fruitless, I decided to give some \\&quot;reminder fluid\\&quot; a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching all of the information out there on \\&quot;reminder fluids\\&quot; and reading personal reviews on each product, I opted for the Mavala Stop for Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Is this stuff amazing! Hindsight makes me wish I&#x27;d saved all the trial and error and started at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just minutes after applying the first coat, I saw a streak of little person running to the refrigerator to grab some water. It tasted that horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the first time I applied the stuff to his thumb, he&#x27;s never sucked it again. Just to ensure the breaking of this orally unhealthy habit, I applied it a few more times but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Stop is easy to use: paint on thumb as you would nail polish, dries clear within seconds. Although the smell and taste is horrendous, it is non-toxic and safe for consumption.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I purchased Mavala because I have a 7 year old with ADHD who bites his nails down so far I was afraid they would get infected!  I told his pediatrician I&#x27;d bought this to help him stop. And he told me he didn&#x27;t think it would work because kids with ADHD commonly bite their nails. The product came two days later, I explained to my son what it was for and told him it was going to taste nasty.  He doesn&#x27;t bite his nails anymore. He asks me to put it on everyday. His nails are long now. So again this product REALLY works...  Thanks Stacey Oakland,CA</li>
            <li> the taste is so bad, you develop a reflex when you absentmindedly put your fingers near your mouth.</li>
            <li> My two year old son stopped sucking his thumb immediately, I just put it on in the morning and before he went to bed. I didn&#x27;t have to use it anymore after two days.</li>
            <li> My little guy decided to rebel against the bad taste and daddy telling him not to bite, so he immediately put all four fingers right to the back of his throat !!! then emptied his stomach out ! This is going to take time, but with this stuff I think i can get him to break the habit young.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and was one of the worst nail biters ever!  I had bitten my nails my entire life and tried just about every product out there.  Mavala Stop is the ONLY product with a taste bitter enough to get me to stop biting my nails. i swear by this product highly recommend it to anyone who has problems with nail biting. I have been using this product for well over a month now and have not had my fingers in my mouth once since the day I started using it.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything, including therapists, for our 7 year daughter, who sucks two fingers 4-6 hours a night, and when she is tired, hungry, upset or watching TV!  She can&#x27;t fall asleep without sucking her fingers, and because it started when she was in a Russian orphanage, and was literally starving due to reflux, her two fingers were all she had for compfort.  We didn&#x27;t want to use any nasty tasting stuff on her fingers because we thought it would be so traumatic, but due to her age and the threat of swine flu, we decided to try it.  Well, maybe she was just ready for this, but after the first night, when we put it on after she was asleep, (she woke at 4am complaining about the taste) she hasn&#x27;t sucked her fingers once and except for complaining twice for about 10 seconds, she has been happier and doesn&#x27;t even seem to notice that she is not sucking her fingers anymore.</li>
            <li> Mavala was recommended me by our pediatrician. Well, it does work  - the taste is totally awful ( confirmed by me, our inconsolably crying 5 y.o nail-biter and his over curious 11 y.o cousin who tried it &#x27;for sport). I confess, I could not take the crying, so we took it off (lots of nail brushing). The nail biting somehow faded over the course of few month, mostly under a threat of Mavala:), so credit goes to them anyway:)</li>
            <li> We were frustrated with other products and with our daughter who kept sucking her finger. Nacala stop really worked fast and we were so impressed, we should have started here first</li>
            <li> This. Stuff. Works.&lt;br /&gt;When aggravation at ones self and painful awareness of ugly nails fails to be enough of a deterrent to actually stop biting, its time for drastic measures. I&#x27;m 22 years old and have been chewing my nails since before I can remember. My problem is that I&#x27;m an absent-minded chewer - I don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m doing it! I need a reminder and a deterrent! So I turned to Mavala Stop, mostly because I&#x27;m cheap and its really not expensive. When it got here, I applied some. Of course I had to take a sample taste, just to see if it would really work. Yeah. It does. I was spitting and grimacing for a minute or two, trying to get the taste out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks since I started using it, and I&#x27;m enjoying watching my nails grow! All I have to do is apply it once every three days.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to stop biting your nails for good, THIS IS YOUR STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to the guys: This will make your nails glossy and shiny for about a day, but don&#x27;t let that put you off! This stuff works!</li>
            <li> For persistant nail biters, finger suckers, and worriers this stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER FINGER FOODS WILL BE AFFECTED IF YOU HAVE THIS ON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my daughter (4 1/2 yr old) who loved the taste of Thum and chewed off the Orly No Bite.  She gagged at this.  One week of continuous use and she was done chewing her nails. When I painted it on her fingers i could \\&quot;taste\\&quot; the stuff, it&#x27;s that pungent.  Luckily she didn&#x27;t eat much finger foods because it does linger.  My daughter licked the Cheetos dust off her fingers, and she was done.  It took Kool-aid and flavored applesauce to get the taste out of her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as a parent I love this product, no more nail biting!  But as a finger food eater, I hated it (I had to try after the Cheetos incident).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if everything else has failed, try this.  It&#x27;s expensive, but I doubt you&#x27;d use the whole bottle, or you have a more stubborn child than I do.</li>
            <li> My daughter was five years old and still sucking her thumb constantly.  Nothing else we tried had worked and the dentist wanted us to buy a $350 appliance that \\&quot;sometimes helped.\\&quot;  We put Mavala on her thumbS (she was ambi-suckerous) and from day 1 she never sucked again.  The best part is that she is SO proud of herself, the worst part is we have to buy her that trampoline now that we&#x27;ve been bribing her with for the last two years!</li>
            <li> effective to stop nail biting as it leaves bitter taste. The effect lasts for few hours then it needs reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for kids and adults to stop nail biting.&lt;br /&gt;Boston, MA</li>
            <li> WORKED SO WELL!!! Boyfriend has bitten his nails down to nearly nothing left for 35 years and hasn&#x27;t in the month since this arrived! HIGHLY Reccommend</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 2 year old. He stopped sucking his thumb after using this for just two nights!</li>
            <li> This worked for my 4 year old. Two days and the kid was done with it. He&#x27;s a good boy and had a hard time letting go of the thumb sucking. He let me put it on (doesn&#x27;t dry immediately but it was fast) and freaked out when he put his thumb in his mouth. I explained that he shouldn&#x27;t suck his thumb and kept reminding him. By day two he was done and I never had to reapply. Tasted the stuff myself... Horrible and nasty, but effective. Some reviewers stated that you shouldn&#x27;t use this if your kid eats with his/her fingers because they might get their finger in their mouth and you will have a hard time getting them to eat it again. I agree to a degree, but my child was easy to reason with and I told him to use a fork and the issue was gone. So maybe you just have to consider why you need this product and whether or not your kid will listen.</li>
            <li> My 4.5 yr old son was a thumb sucker. 6 months of positive reinforcement and constant reminders along the the incentive of a new big boy bike didn&#x27;t make a dent. This worked in 2 days. Amazing. I did not use very much, less than an M&amp;M size spot on his thumb. No vomiting for my son, just a lot of trips to the sink to rinse out his mouth. Now three months later and he has not started again. Wish I had done this sooner.</li>
            <li> We have an ultrasound of our daughter sucking her thumb. We knew stopping this habit was going to be hard. Boy was I wrong. In 3 days, no more thumb sucking. The first night was rough since she put her thumb in her mouth dead asleep and it woke her up. On the 3rd night she did put her thumb in her mouth but we didn&#x27;t know until morning. We left Kool-Aid on her nightstand. She took a drink and went back to sleep. We still apply it occasionally but she really doesn&#x27;t need it. I think it helps her remember to not put her thumb in her mouth. She has gone 2 months with very few slip ups. We are so proud of her because she did this as much as the product. We also think she was ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How we used it. From reviews we read we don&#x27;t put much on. We only put it at the base of her thumb (by the cuticle). We never went farther up than 1/2 way up her thumb. This is important since the taste will last on the her thumb for a couple of days and every time she would eat a snack she could taste it. When she swims we do put it on every night. But other than the first week we realized we didn&#x27;t need it everyday. Also for the first week we had a cup of kool-aid for her to drink if she did taste it. We weren&#x27;t trying to punish her for sucking her thumb just make her aware of sucking her thumb. This was the first remedy tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the interesting part. I am sure the manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t indorse this. My sister has a 7 year old son that can stick his tongue half way up his nose. What turned into a cool trick is now a gross problem. He isn&#x27;t aware of even doing it. He was actually disrupting his class when he was at school. He was unaware he was using his tongue &amp; if an another kid saw it they would laugh. My sister had tried everything. When she heard I bought this she decided to try it. She washed under his nose &amp; then put lotion under his nose. She then applied a dab (doesn&#x27;t even brush it on). It did the trick. If he starts it up, she just puts a dab. It works. Mavala has made him aware when he is sticking his tongue upward. I asked my nephew if it burned and said it only did once because my sister didn&#x27;t put the lotion first. But otherwise no. He said it works too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the last part was more than people wanted to know but the product really works.Mavala has made him aware when he is sticking his tongue upward.

            <li> This really works! My daughter wouldn&#x27;t dare to bite her nails again after the first application. For years I was never able to cut her nails because she kept on biting them, after a few days of the application  her nails grew long and I was finally able to cut her nails. It felt like it was the first time! Lol..</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails for over 20 years.  I tried this for the first time last week and not bitten my nails since.  It tastes disgusting.  The only annoying thing is that it can rub off a little - like if you&#x27;re eating a sandwich some can get on your lips.  Small price to pay to break an annoying habit.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Stopped my son almost overnight. His nail is growing back thicker that is how attached he was. We have used it on nieces who have been doing this for years. We even used it on a friends kiddo who was about to have the dentist do some kind of \\&quot;cure all\\&quot; that was very expensive. This little bottle stopped them all. I tried it on myself, I personally have no gag reflex but it is awful tasting. Little ones, as stated above, watch because finger foods might be contaminated if they eat with their hands. Overall I can&#x27;t stop singing this products success. My wife and I have counted over five kids whose parents have tried it with an absolute 100% success rate</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 6 year old daughter who was still sucking her thumb as well as biting her nails.  The product smells exactly like nail polish remover which for the first application stopped our daughter from bringing her fingers any where near her nose, let alone her mouth.  But after a day, she went right back to sucking her thumb even with nightly applications.</li>
            <li> My daughter is now finished thumb sucking thanks to this product.  We had to put it on maybe four times and she is done.  So happy my dentist recommended this to us.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully as long as you apply it every two days or else the taste (which is awful) will go away and the habit will continue. This has been the best thing ever to stop thumb sucking with my kids and Ive tried everything, even a $500 mouth brace the dentist recommended for stopping thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> My son hiding this away proves that it works as advertised!</li>
            <li> To begin, I typically never write reviews, but for this I have to.  My 4 yo son has sucked his thumb since he was 3 mos old. When I say sucked, I mean you could hear him from another room.  My problem is that he LOVED to suck his thumb!  We tried everything to get him to stop!? His habit was so bad that his teeth are pulled forward and crooked, and his thumb is flat and has a callus or some strange bump on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked!!! FINALLY!!!!!!  It stopped him cold! I tried it and let me tell you, it is disgusting!  I will have to apply it daily for the unforeseen future, but I have no problem with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala!</li>
            <li> WORKED LIKE A CHARM! I was expecting a battle, so what actually transpired was not how I was imagining this whole thing would go, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier, that&#x27;s for certain! Our daughters, ages 2.5 years and 4.5 years, have sucked their pointer and middle fingers since about the age of 6 months. My husband and I reserached several options (behavior modification kits and finger guards), and eventually decided to go the cheapest route and try the Mavala Stop polish. If it didn&#x27;t work, we would have only wasted $15 compared to $75+ (finger guard). We started it on Monday, March 1st, 2010. Of course, that first day they both put their fingers in their mouth of out habit and were not AT ALL pleased with the flavor. My youngest daughter gagged so hard from the first taste that she threw up a little bit, but since day #2, they have not sucked their fingers! There was no battle, no fighting, no crying... they are even bragging *TO ME* that they aren&#x27;t sucking their fingers anymore. I haven&#x27;t reapplied the polish in a good week and the habit has not come back, not even at night. Last time I did put it on, my oldest daughter came *TO ME* and asked me to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such an affordable price, why not try it? If it winds up that your child is one of the few that it doesn&#x27;t work on, you&#x27;re only out about $15. From the looks of it, Mavala Stop is very effective! We are definitely satisfied customers and proud parents of two little girls that no longer suck their fingers! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Product worked fast and was immediately effective in stopping my daughter from sucking her finger. AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old son who had quite a thumb sucking addiction. After hearing finding this product online and reading product reviews, I decided to give it a try. It was so easy...just apply a thin layer of this clear nail-polish like liquid on the thumbs, and it worked like a charm. My son stuck his thumb in his mouth only a couple of times after we applied this, and it tasted so bad that it kept him from doing it again. It also stays on for several days, so it only needs re-applied every 3-4 days. After about 5 applications, it had done the trick. No more thumb sucking. And my son is pretty proud of that too!</li>
            <li> My daughter quit using her pacifier the minute she had a taste of Mavala Stop!  I can&#x27;t believe that she even threw her paci away immediately! She has used the paci for over 3 years and is now paci free for 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical at first, but when I finally saw nails of my son after one week of applying Mavala, my scepticism disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, this stuff works and works exactly the way it is described. Just apply it generously on finger tops, including nails. Do it every other night and in a week you would see a result. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes this product works like a charm.I gave a shot at thumb guard  , didn&#x27;t help.This product is awesome, was skeptical about the product initially as I didn&#x27;t want my kid to be tasting the chemical stuff ,but they don&#x27;t after 1 or 2 trials, yep that bitter..so thats nothing at all to me.It took less than a week for her to stop the habit totally.aim the happiest mom, feeling proud to have found this product that works for real.Not just that I have stopped my  35 years nailing biting habit.....so it is a miracle in little jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who was still sucking her thumb at 3 1/2 years old.  I was prepared for a battle to just get the Mavala on her thumbnails because she&#x27;d say, \\&quot;I love to suck my thumb.\\&quot;  However, she accepted it, and almost immediately stopped.  It was really that easy.  Also, I&#x27;ve heard people have had problems with their little ones getting to sleep without sucking their thumbs, but there was no fussing or disruption in her sleep schedule at all.  We are so pleased with the results and are kicking ourselves because we didn&#x27;t try this sooner.</li>
            <li> I feel bad giving this a 2 star because if it were me, I wouldn&#x27;t put my finger in my mouth with this stuff on.  My 3 year old son is a thumb sucker.  I am trying to stop his habit now before it messes up his teeth.  I bought this stuff because of the reviews.  It worked for about a week and a half.  I thought it was great and recommended it to my sister in law.  Right after that, he started sucking it again.  I guess he got used to the awful taste.  It is so bad and stays on so good that if he touched my lips with his thumb, I could taste it for a good 15 min.  I would still recommend this product.  It is worth the money to see if it works for you.  I just wish they had different awful flavors..... Now we use bandaids and that is working....</li>
            <li> Seriously, it worked for my 3-year-old daughter.  We try every way to make her stop, because she will keep nibbling until it bleeds.  For the first day, I put it on her, she try to nibble before it dried, and she vomited.  We put it on about 3 times a week, and we noticed for 3 months, her nails are growing and we haven&#x27;t seen her nibbling her nails.  Now, its a routine to her to put on the nail polish everyday, but she acknowledge that she puts in on to keep her nails, \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; and to help her stop biting.  I love it, so much, I highly recommend to a lot of mommies, who are going through the same situation as I am.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I expect this stuff to stick on - but, after hand washings (which little boys do all day long) the polish wears off.  Must re-apply daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 3 yr old son that sucks his thumb. Unfortunately, he was not phased by it. Myself and my daughter tried it on ourselves and the taste was unbearable. We could not believe that it didn&#x27;t help him to stop or even slow down.</li>
            <li> My 5 1/2 year old has sucked her finger for years.  We&#x27;ve tried band-aids, tape and other brush-on things to make her finger less appealing.  My dentist recommended Mavala Stop.  After the first night of using it, I noticed she kept her finger out of her mouth the following day (I didn&#x27;t reapply it, just the once the night before).  I applied it again on night two and her finger has been out of her mouth since.  I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li> Being a nail biter for pretty much most of my life I was excited to find out you can add flavoring to spice up a lifetime habit. I applied the malva (strange flavor name) to my nails and were dry about an hour later, after that it was off to the races. Tastes pretty strange, mostly like tonic water and chemicals but adds a new type of excitement every time you go for a chew. Overall if you are looking for a way to spice up those neutral tasting nails Id suggest you invest in this product.</li>
            <li> I just would like to say Thank YOu for whomever made this product. My son has been sucking his thumb for 9 years. He stopped sucking his thumb in two days from using Maval Stop.... Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I think the key to me quitting was realizing what I was doing before I got started.  I would put my fingers to my mouth without thinking about it when I was stressed for the first two weeks.  The immediate terrible and lingering taste would remind me what I was doing and allow me to stop it.  It will definitely make you wary of putting a finger near your mouth.  I licked some sauce off my finger when I was cooking one night.  BIG MISTAKE.  This stuff is truly foul.  I didn&#x27;t paint my whole nails with it.  I would just apply a little to the tips of my nails and cuticles every few days.  It is a little shiny, but it looks a lot better than having mangled nails from biting.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old that suck their thumb. I tried many other polishes with my 5 year old that didn&#x27;t work. This one seems to be working on both kids. The only downside is that now they have a hard time falling asleep since they can&#x27;t suck their thumb.</li>
            <li> It works but my son learned be could just scrape the nasty taste off with his teeth.</li>
            <li> Stopped my 2 YO from sucking her fingers within two applications. This stuff is magic. It tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> I am 38 and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember!  I was such a bad nail biter, I have actually broken two teeth.  7 months ago I noticed my 9 year old twins were both biting their nails down to the nailbeds and beyond!  So I decided it was time!  I purchased Mavala Stop through Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails, and both kids nails.  In the beginning I did very good not even putting my fingers to my mouth.  The kids told me how bad it was, so I resisted.  Well, it didn&#x27;t take long to be eating BBQ and accidentally lick my fingers!  AAACCCKKK!  Now I know what they are talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 7 months.  I have only bit a nail 2 or 3 times.  Once the pain and \\&quot;itch\\&quot; goes away it becomes easier!  My kids are doing excellent also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on shinny, but dulls in a day or two.  I recommend re-coating every 3 or 4 days.  (especially during pool season)  Also, make sure your nails stay trimmed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 months later and I&#x27;m a believer!  I have been embalming for 18 years and that never kept me from biting my nails....  THIS HAS!!  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Originally I was given this product by a friend of mine.  He, along with me and 3 other Preschool parents, had girls who sucked their thumbs. We had tried just about everything there is to make them stop sucking their thumbs. Then he ordered the Mavala Stop and said it worked in 2 days. I was astounded but had my reservations. Once I used it ... my daughter stopped sucking her thumb in 3 days! That was over 2 yrs ago. Unfortunately ... my daughter has since started to bite her nails.  Once again, I am using the Mavala Stop and within 3 days she has nails on her fingers again! Love this product:)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say.  It worked for us. My four year old was an avid thumb sucker. The first time we tried this stuff, she was not happy about it one bit. But it did the trick. If she slips up and is tempted to start sucking her thumb again, she even asks for it.</li>
            <li> Just needed 3 applications over 6 days and it stopped my 3 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking habit!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have been a nail biter my entire life. Its been a terribly compulsive habit that I was sure I could never break. I have tried other \\&quot;no bite\\&quot; polishes before, but my determination to constantly bite my nails beat out any other product. Then I started using Malava. Its been almost 3 weeks and for the first time in my life, I can actually see the \\&quot;whites\\&quot; of my nails growing. The disgusting taste of Malava is enough to make even the worst nail biter (me) stop this terrible habit and the whole process became so mental that now I don&#x27;t even have the desire to bite anymore. I would recommend combining this treatment with a nail strengthening polish as well...because for me, my nails have never even had the chance to grow past the fingertips and are very weak from the years of biting. As I said, I really believed there was nothing out there that could help me to break this habit...and finally this seems to be working wonders.</li>
            <li> It works great. I have to keep painting my daughter&#x27;s nails. Once I stop painting she started biting again. I&#x27;m using the the third bottle now. I love this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and really wanted to stop sucking her thumb before she turned 4. We tried putting mittens and socks on at bedtime but they would get pulled off and thumb in the mouth. I bought this and put one application on both thumbs, she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb again and that was 2 months ago!! She didn&#x27;t have any of the issues that the other reviewers mentioned about finger foods tasting gross or vomiting from the taste. She did accidently put her thumb in her mouth and said it was &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; and I gave her some water and she was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Great product, but only needed a tiny dab and now have a full jar of it left.</li>
            <li> This product definitely tastes horrible enough to stop you from biting your nails. It isn&#x27;t a flavor that you&#x27;re just going to get used to.. and it lasts. Product comes with instructions in English and pretty much every other language :) If you&#x27;re like me though, and habitually just touch your face a lot and eat many foods with your hands.. you may be making a lot of bitter-mouthed faces during meal times. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price to not just grow out your nails but break the entire habit.. just pay attention to what you eat :)</li>
            <li> It really work if you stick to it! The taste is awful! I really wanted to stop my 3 y.o from sucking her thumb, but she would cry every time she tried to place food in her mouth and her thumb would hit her lips and she would taste it, so I stopped it after 2 days although it definitely was working! It has a bitter taste like nail polish and grapefruit mixed together</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING in its ability to be ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. It works well, however, you cannot eat finger foods AT ALL when you use it. Just FYI. lol</li>
            <li> this is a product that i was very skeptical about.  I&#x27;ve tried many products in the past and had no success (even tried crazy glue). so, i put this on and after 35 years of biting my nails, i am no longer a nail biter.  the taste was so horrible, that i stopped biting.  i have nails for the first time and its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing is if you plan on eating finger foods, be careful, as the product gets onto the food and it makes your mouth have the horrible flavor for hours.  (the first time i bit into a chicken wing, it had this flavor for a few hours)</li>
            <li> It definitely works. It has a bitter taste to it, so it discourages nail biting. I have been biting my nails for about 6-7 years and finally stopped. However, when I would touch my lip or eat with my hands, I would sometimes be eating the taste. The taste sometimes doesn&#x27;t go away from you&#x27;re mouth unless you brush your teeth. On the plus side, my nails are growing strong. The picture attached shows the difference in a few weeks. I think 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> It really works !!! My only regret is why I did not try this before. My 4 year-old was never ready to give up the habit of thumb-sucking, but we started using Mavala Stop 4 days ago, and she has not attempted to do this ever since... Great product ! I&#x27;ll update this review after a while as I still find it hard to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating the review after almost a month. This has worked amazingly well for my child - Miracle continues !</li>
            <li> I got this for my 8-year-old daughter&#x27;s nail-biting habit.  Not only is it fabulous for discouraging nail-biting, but it also helps if your little one tends to eat their noodles (or other fork-worthy foods) with their fingers.  Nobody likes bitter noodles!  Yuck!</li>
            <li> Used on my 4 yo who wouldn&#x27;t stop sucking her fingers. I only had to apply once and she has never sucked her fingers again.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dentist. It works very well although it does come off so you need to apply it several times sometimes. My daughter sucks her fingers a lot and this has helped her stop, been using it for about a month and the habit has almost disappeared...fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> This definitely keeps my sons fingers out of his mouth and away from his face!</li>
            <li> Product works wonderfully!  I wish I knew about this years ago.  I have been biting and picking my nails for years and this product has finally helped me kick the habit!  Now I have nice manicured fingernails! The bad taste has definitely helped to deter myself from putting my fingers near my mouth. I apply it every other day on top of my regular nail polish.  Highly recommend!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My son is 16 years old and he ALWAYS chews his nails. His nails are pretty much gone. you only see fingers w a huge head :)  This helps him to not to chew his nails bc of its taste, but when he doesnt have it on, he has his fingers in his mouth.  I just bought the 2nd bottle.  He may, probably, needs to be hypnotized to stop chewing his big headed fingers...  :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was hoping to break my 2-1/2 year old of her finger sucking habit.  We&#x27;d tried cod liver oil on the advice of her pediatrician but all she did was suck it off.  Mavala stop  worked in one application!  She was clearly disturbed by the taste of the product and within a few days, she had completely stopped sucking or trying to suck her fingers! It&#x27;s been 2 months since we first used mavala stop and she no longer sucks her fingers.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> First we tried \\&quot;THUM,\\&quot; which my 3 1/2 year old just sucked off.  What a waste.  I was considering ordering a thumb guard when I came across a review for Mavala.  I am so glad I did!  The first night we tried Mavala he was up a lot during the night, crying because he needed his thumb to fall asleep (he said).  Every night after that, he slept just fine.  We went to the Pediatric Dentist today, and just found out that they recommend this product as well.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would keep my 4 yr old from bitting his fingers.  First few days he was warry of putting his fingers in his mouth,but he quickly got over the bad taste and did it anyway no matter how often applied.</li>
            <li> Our son just turned three and the dentist said once he turned three it was time to stop sucking his thumb. He would suck either one day or night so just telling him to stop was not enough. He has had this habit since birth even though we tried several pacifiers. But we got this and painted it on his nails and he looked at it smelled it and at one point got some on his lips. He didn&#x27;t suck his thumb again until after a few days when it began to wear off and we just reapplied, It was so cool to see him understand what it was for and that it was to help him. He would keep his thumbs away from his mouth and he never cried about it. This was just what he needed to help him stop. I wish we would have used it sooner but probably good we didn&#x27;t because it says ages three and up. Parents must be persistent in using it, consistent in reapplying it, and  don&#x27;t give up even if they cry because you are doing a good thing. We gave him a lot of encouragement about being a big boy and we were so proud of him and it made him happy to have it put on. I hope we are saved from costly braces now. so worth the money</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic nail biter for as long as I can remember.  The longest I&#x27;ve ever gone without biting my nails is a few months and it was only because I was pregnant and for some reason didn&#x27;t have the urge.  I used to get acrylic nails put on and after a week would start biting those off as well (ouch!  very painful).  I finally got tired of hiding my embarrassing nails and ordered this product.  I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they get used to the taste and bite on through the nastiness.  I have no idea how they can stand the taste.  It is so bitter and nasty there is no way I am putting my fingers near my mouth.  I put a coat on once every 3 days or so.  The taste lasts through multiple showers and hand washings.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this product is that you can&#x27;t really eat with your fingers without tasting it (forget trying to pick something out of your teeth...gag).  It really does work though.  It&#x27;s been three weeks and I am finally starting to see the white parts of my nail.  I have a habit of biting the skin around my nails too and I&#x27;ve been putting this product on that area as well.  I feel like one bottle is going to last me a long time even though I use it every so many days.  I&#x27;m happy I found this product and would recommend it to anyone trying to stop biting.</li>
            <li> If you found this product searching for something to help you child stop sucking their thumb or biting their nails, just stop reading now and click BUY and have it shipped overnight!  I had a 10 year old thumb sucker and a 9 year old nail bighter - You heard me right - 10 year old thumb sucker, we tried EVERYTHING even a myotherapist and NOTHING worked until this!  He has now gone 14 days without a single slip up after 8 years over daily thumbsucking.  This was such an awesome find and the reviews from other parents were instrumental in my purchase decision so I am writing my first ever product feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click buy, have your children be responsible for applying it, and move on to the next challenge as a parent ;).</li>
            <li> This defintely helped my little nail biter be more aware of his habit. In most cases he would bite his nails without even realizing he was doing so,this product helped him become more aware. Since the taste was so bad he was very aware of his habit.</li>
            <li> Worked well to help a someone younger to stop biting their nails.</li>
            <li> I would have never guessed I would be able to break the habit of biting my nails.  But thanks to this stuff I was able too.  It really does make you stop, the second you start to move your hand near your mouth your brain starts screaming to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part that sucks is it does rub off on your food.  So stay away from anything you might eat without silverware while using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery about using this product since I had read some reviews about children throwing up when they got the taste in their mouth.  My daughter has thrown up before when she has had a yucky taste in her mouth so I could see her having this response.  We never had any problems.  She sucked her thumb ALL THE TIME before, and would twirl her hair at the same time, sometimes until it would fall out.  She&#x27;s almost four and I was starting to get really concerned about the constant thumb sucking and hair twirling.  My pediatrician recommended Mavala Stop and it has worked so great.  We put it on every day for the first week, and now we just put it on every other day.  She&#x27;s been using it for almost five weeks and has completely stopped sucking her thumb (and twirling her hair).  I think she was ready to quit and just needed a little help since it was such an ingrained habit for her.  (My son also sucked his thumb but was able to quit on his own, and had already really cut down on the amount of thumb sucking he did by the time he was her age.)  We are planning on putting it on for another week or so and then seeing how she does.  I have already recommended this to several friends, it worked so well.</li>
            <li> So far so good no thumb sucking for a whole day. 👍</li>
            <li> This stuff does work and I tried it on my 4 year old but until he wanted to quit sucking his thumb nothing worked. If you are an adult who bites their nails then this will work for you i would think.</li>
            <li> Yes it stoped thumb sucking. Within 4 days she stop putting her thumb in her mouth. Its been a month and she&#x27;s doing great. I would of never believed it if my pediatrician was not so pushy. He kept saying I have so many parents say it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works unbelievably well, the bitter taste is so strong you definitely will not be able to bite through it! I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> My 13 y/o son has been biting his nails for years and  would like to stop.  This product does the trick however it goes on looking like clear nail polish and stays shiny which sort of bothered him.  He also chews the sides of his fingers and although I can put this product on that area, the skin is broken and it stings like fire.  For a normal nail biter who doesn&#x27;t mind the glossy look it works well.  He couldn&#x27;t stand the taste of it and it has curbed his biting for sure.  The only other downside is that it seems to transfer its taste onto finger foods.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 7 years old and has sucked her thumb constantly for 5 years.  We&#x27;ve tried everything to get her to stop, including other bitter extracts.  I put this product on one time and she has completely stopped with minimal complaining.  It&#x27;s been a week so far and I think she has finally broken the habit.  Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nail-biting problem for 15 years and tried several similar products to help me quit. I finally found this stuff, and this is it. I&#x27;ve gone a solid two weeks without biting now! I had a few minor tastes (from the product rubbing off while eating or something) before I got a full blast. I saw a piece I wanted to bite and thought, &amp;#34;one small bite can&#x27;t be but so bad.&amp;#34; Wrong. I regretted that decision with a good 15 minutes of bitterness in my mouth and throat.</li>
            <li> Just remember that it has to be re-applied every 2 days.</li>
            <li> well. I bit finger nails like nobody&#x27;s business. i bit them allll the time. SO, my orthodontist initially gave me a bottle little thingy of this stuff. (im 14) i painted my fingers whatever color i wanted (if i wanted),then applied Mavala Stop as a top coat. it was DISGUSTING. and im pretty sure it made my tongue numb as the taste was sosososososososooooooooooooo bad. BUT, that is the point of the product. i quit. i quit biting my finger nails and now i have healthy, long nails. I would recommmend this product to ANY nail biter seeking a cure to their gross, unattractive habit.  (sorry bout the grammar and spelling and such heeehee)</li>
            <li> i have been a nail-biter all my life and now my nails look so beautiful after only a week of using this \\&quot;wonder\\&quot; product! i use it on my little toddler woow great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered Mavala for my daughter who has been sucking her thumb since birth. She is now five and we have tried many different methods to stop her habit. This stuff smells and looks like clear nail polish, but tastes so bad that it deters her from putting any of her fingers near her mouth. I painted my nail to test it and the taste is nasty, though it is not physically harmful. It has been hard for her, but after only 3 applications and two weeks she is thumb sucking free! It truly works!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical about Mevala. By pediatric dentist recommended it. So, I took the advice and ordered it. After about 1 week, my 6 year old daughter quit sucking her thumb. She was a hardcore thumbsucker and has quit completely. I was amazed and would have paid more for this product. It made her sick to her stomach but it worked in just a few days. It has been about 3 weeks now and I stopped using it after a few days.....and she is still NOT sucking her thumb! Great product and well worth the $$$. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This worked from Day 1!!! We have pictures of her sucking her thumb in utero and sucked for 5 years after that! Her teeth were a mess from sucking. 1st day of application and the following week, did another dad on her thumb nail. She was done. No more sucking at night, day or ever! Her teeth took about 2-3 months and her smile is out of control beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mavala Stop!!&lt;br /&gt;PS did share it with the neighbors and they all stopped too! Plenty more for my 2nd thumb sucker in a year or so!&lt;br /&gt;It is really really nasty and the taste does linger in your mouth. Its much stronger that \\&quot;Bite Free\\&quot; or other products like it. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My son has been biting his nails since he was about 2 yrs old, but now at age 7, it&#x27;s become a bad habit that was difficult to stop.  I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.  Since I applied it, my son has not put his fingers in his mouth and his nails have gotten long enough for me to cut!  I will continue to use it until I&#x27;m finished with the product and I know that my son has \\&quot;kicked the habit!\\&quot;  I wish this product had been around years ago when I was a kid....</li>
            <li> This product is terrible you can&#x27;t eat with your hands like a sandwich without hating it!!!! It only lasts for a couple days and if you don&#x27;t remember to put another application on you&#x27;ll start biting again! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! It would have been much nicer if it didn&#x27;t spread to food and it lasted longer... :(</li>
            <li> This worked for a while, but soon DD just bit right through the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for 25 years, it is a disgusting habit that I wish to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application seemed to last me about 4-5 days, more or less dependent on how often I washed my hands. It gives a slight shine to your nails which isn&#x27;t terribly noticeable, but it was a little concerning to me at first as I am a guy with what looked liked gloss nail polish on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely helped while I was using it to stop biting my nails, I actually purchased a second bottle once the first was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it helped me stop biting when it was on my nails.  After 2 bottles worth it may have been wasted money, as it did not help in the long run of breaking my old habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have no nails due to biting them off, maybe I&#x27;m just stubborn.</li>
            <li> Worked great.  We originally had bought thum at a local pharmacy and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  4 yr  old apparently liked the taste.  This stuff, however, worked like a charm.  He pretty much stopped chewing his nails within a day our two.  Stopped using it after a few Weeks and everything worked out great.highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We were almost certain nothing would help our 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.  We didn&#x27;t want to buy one of those $80 thumb appliances for fear it wouldn&#x27;t work. We thought it would be a long struggle. We found Mavala Stop online and decided to try it. We painted it on our 3 year old thumbs the first night and it has been 3 weeks and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since. I was curious to see what it tastes like so I painted it on my nail too!  Gross!  All I can say is that this product WORKS!!  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would work for my 2 1/2 year old son. My son keeps sucking his tumb and I have tried everything. This was my last thing I have not tried. I have tried several nail polish stoppers and just like the rest this did not work. Save your money and just use baby orgel.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes horrible. My daughter was gagging and crying. However, she no longer sucks her thumb!! This is the only thing that worked and I will be using it with my 3 year old thumb sucker when I think he is ready.</li>
            <li> My little girl is 7 years old and still loved that thumb!  We had tried to get her to stop but nothing we tried worked. I researched and found Mavala Stop and it had good reviews so I ordered it!  Its been a little over a month now and my girl has completely stopped using her thumb!  The first week she tried taking her thumb to her mouth several times but when she realized the nasty stuff wasn&#x27;t coming off, she decided she might as well quit trying! I am so proud of her, and I am a firm believer in Mavala Stop!  If it could stop my daughter&#x27;s thumbsucking, it can stop most anybody&#x27;s thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> I have never tasted something so horrible. The polish is alarmingly foul enough to make me realize what I&#x27;m doing and I never got used to the taste. Downsides are ruining any kind of finger food, and if you inadvertently lick your fingers after a chip or something, you&#x27;re in for a ruined snack. Longevity seems good, although I got in the habit of painting daily just to do it. It puts a bit of shine on, but not overly noticeable.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully to get my 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb. It really tastes horrible! My only complaint is the bottle is too big! We only had to use it for a week (3 applications) and now I have almost the entire bottle left. Kind of a waste of money in that sense...</li>
            <li> I try many things with my child to stop sucking her thumb but it doesn&#x27;t work. I buy Mavala Stop and it was amazing. She stop sucking from the first day and until now.I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my almost 5 yr old daughter who&#x27;s been sucking her thumb since she was in utero. She is a SERIOUS thumb sucker. NOTHING! And I mean NOTHING has worked. Tried it all. I wanted her to stop before she lost her baby teeth and her permanent ones came in. Her bite has been effected by this habit. Well, this WORKED!!!! I was skeptical, aren&#x27;t we all? It worked for her! I am so relieved and thankful. No trama, and it really did go a lot smoother than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I used this item to try stop my child from sucking&lt;br /&gt;Her thumb. Well on the first day it worked wonders, she wouldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;place her hands no way near her mouth but then by the second day I&lt;br /&gt;reapplied it over and over again, but to avail nothing worked the 5 year&lt;br /&gt;old began sucking her thumb again non stop with Mavala Stop on it.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for over 12 years.  I am a guy so this product was not too appealing to me at first.  The whole painting your nails thing is worth it though.  After two weeks of using it, I am more aware than ever when I bite my nail.  This is because of the bitter taste and also the coating feels different than regular nail since it is a varnish of sorts.  People do not really notice that your nails are more shiny, and also I let the coating dry till its sticky then I touch my finger to it so then the surface so then it ruins the shiny finish.  Also if people notice, you just tell them it is so you stop biting your nails and they are very understanding.  This product works well and the bottle will last extremely long with 1 application a day.  I am applying it consistently for around 90 days because that is the amount of time I have heard that is required for breaking habits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for 23 years, and if you keep applying this stuff correctly it definitely works. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> OMG! This is terrible, acrid, worse than hell itself. The question is not if you taste this product, but WHEN. This product is a masochist&#x27;s dream, a sadist&#x27;s delight. Mavala Stop demonstrates exactly how often we put our filthy hands directly in our mouth! This product not only lasts through hand-washing, soap or acetone, but weeks later it remains, so be prepared to give up french fries, potato chips, hor d&#x27; hoerves, sandwiches, fudge, and god help those who eat something prepared by your Mavala hands. It will surely be the last time they dine with YOU. This product has cured me of fingernail biting, chewing my fingers, picking cuticles and if you try to tear off the skin any other way, through clippers, the skin is also pretty terrible and tainted, so good luck with that method. I no longer wear bandages or take antibiotics because of this disfiguring, infantile habit. Now I got a grip on reality, and can face my fears head on, no procrastination from nail biting or the ruminations of my childhood past. Mavala Stop is my hero so I can go and fight the real evil in this world, with all 10 fingers intact, and I like my skin again, which feels baby-soft and new and ready to shake hands again without the shame of war-torn fingers and the act of auto-cannibalism, which I am sure is surely a sin in most of the world. So, thank you Mavala Stop for the taste of hell, it made me well!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle! I&#x27;d tried everything with my 2 girls. My older girl had a habit of biting her nails, and my younger one, age 3, sucked her thumb from infancy. Tried everything but nothing worked, and then their pediatrician and pediatric dentist recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this only once: my 3 yr old had a belly ache, threw up 2 times, and has not put her thumb in her mouth again (I had to wrap her thumb nail in bandaids for about a week so she wouldn&#x27;t subconsciously put it in her mouth, especially in her sleep). My older one got scared watching her and has stopped biting her nails. They don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;special nail polish,&amp;#34; but mommy doesn&#x27;t know how to take it off :).</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes, but to no avail.  Our 3 year-old quickly figured out how to take a suck at her thumb and then take a drink repeatedly until the mavala was sucked off and she had rinsed the taste from her mouth.  So, alas, it didn&#x27;t work for us.  However, I&#x27;ve heard great stories of success from others.  Bottom line, the stuff isn&#x27;t that expensive and much cheaper than other methods to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs.  It&#x27;s worth a shot.  Maybe it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note.  The stuff DOES taste NASTY.  My 3 year old (for whom this was purchased), climbed to get the mavala stop on a shelf in the kitchen and then painted ALL of her baby sisters&#x27; fingers (baby sister was 9 months and a finger-sucker).  We tried to get the mavala stop off of baby sister&#x27;s fingers, but she still threw-up from sucking her fingers.  LESSON TO BE LEARNED:  be SURE the mavala stop is out of reach of even the most crafty toddler.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, my son used it for one week, after that, he  doesn&#x27;t want to bite his nails again! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My son had the habit of sucking his middle and ring fingers. We ordered this hoping to break the habit after noticing his fingernails were being affected.  Within one week he had completely forgotten about sucking his fingers all together.  He never really complained about the taste, but the look on his face with the first few attempts were all telling. This product works!</li>
            <li> I start using this product for one of my kids and she stop eating her nails at the moments. Now it&#x27;s being 3 weeks and her nails are growing. Its goos.</li>
            <li> I started biting my nails when I was young, probably around 5.  I tried everything from fake nails to hot peppers.  This worked!  I have been using Mavala Stop for a month and my nails are growing, I am seeing white nail for the first time in my life.  The taste isn&#x27;t totally terrible but it was enough to stop me from biting.  I know I will have to keep putting this stuff on my nails for 3-6 months so I can stop the habit but the $14 I spent on it should last me at least 6 months.  You need to put it on at least every other day.  I try to remember to put it on every day.  It dries quick so I do it at my desk just before starting work each day.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong nail polish smell so it doesn&#x27;t bother people around me.  Place it somewhere you&#x27;ll remember to use it and you&#x27;ll see great results in about 2 weeks.  I love my new nails and can&#x27;t wait to go for my first manicure!</li>
            <li> We tried threats, rewards, everything we could think of to get my 3.5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. I painted her thumbnails with this one time ... and she quit!! I caught her with her thumb one more time after that and painted it once more. It&#x27;s been over a month now and she has not done it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does easily get on food if she eats with it on her fingers. She helped me fix her daddy a plate and he spit out his food when he got to the cucumber she had touched!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I loaned this to my friend, who was trying to break her 2.5 year old of the habit. She was leery because she had already tried a similar (different brand) product at the drugstore that had not worked. Again, magic! Her daughter hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. My 4 month old is already a thumbsucker, so we&#x27;ll be pulling out the bottle again in a couple of years. :)</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to work.  When I first put it on, the bitter taste wasn&#x27;t really that strong.  However, it seems like the effect is cumulative and anything you touch begins to taste like bitter, rotten fish.  My nails are long and pretty now because I&#x27;m so afraid I will have to use this product again.  It is sitting in a drawer in case I have a relapse... but I don&#x27;t see that happening.  When I think about Mavala Stop, I shudder.  I guess that means it did its job!</li>
            <li> after doing everything possible for over 5 years to get my 11 yr old to stop biting her nails, this finally worked.  hallelujah.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheaper versions of this type product and they never work. My coworker told me about this product and it works!! He doesnt suck his thumbs anymore. Worth It</li>
            <li> This really worked and finally got me to stop biting my nails because of its awful taste.</li>
            <li> got my boyfriend to stop chewing his nails!</li>
            <li> My 11 years old daughter suck her thumb since birth, tried everything even the dentist cage instrument was inserted in her mouth for one year to help her stop sucking her thumb but did not work. with Mavala she stoped sucking her thumb after 2 weeks. it was a big releave for me.</li>
            <li> after months of biting my nails down to the root and trying every product out there but i decided to one day ask my parents if i could purchase this to try another 1. at first they said no cuz nothing worked before but long story short i got it and holy crap it taste like an onion on stararoids. DISGUSTING!!! but hey it may be totally gross but im glad to say it has worked so far im so excited! thank you!  i rlly recommend tryin this product!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> We have been trying to get our 3 year old to stop sucking his thumb.. it was affecting his speech and he was sucking it until it was blistering.  We tried the &amp;#34;Dr. Thumb&amp;#34; thumb guard first and he managed to break it so it wouldn&#x27;t stay on anymore.  We purchased the Mavala after reading reviews and it worked!  It was a struggle for a couple of nights but after that he stopped.  It is great stuff!  Don&#x27;t try the other brands that are in the stores, they don&#x27;t work.  This one does!</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended it for my daughter . It worked great!!</li>
            <li> I originally got this product for my son thinking that it will curb his nail biting habit for good.  It works. It really does, but only when it&#x27;s applied every 2-3 days.  Just when I think I can phase out of applying regularly, I find myself getting back to the 2-3 day application schedule because my son is biting his nails again.  At this point a phase out seems distant and the only other thing that will keep my son from biting his nails would be if he didn&#x27;t have any nails.  Also, after months of use, my son has gotten used to the bitter/pungent taste of the polish and doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it as much.  He&#x27;s even started to eat with his hands again.  I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it works, but taking a star off because the effects are very temporary.</li>
            <li> My 4-yr-old bites her fingernails and toenails.  I bought Mavala, put it on her fingers and toes, and she goes right on biting, even 2 minutes after I apply it.  It is worthless.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it worked with in 4 days and I had a serious finger sucker.  The only thing you have to be careful about is once you put it on the finger nails don&#x27;t let your child eat w/ fingers to much try to use fork or spoon, if they put their fingers in their mouth while they are eating they will NOT like it.  I was not sure if this would work but it did!!</li>
            <li> I tried a few other products (topical and a hand guard) with no success on my  6 year old.  This works very well.  He stopped thumb sucking within 1-2 days.  Periodically he starts again a week later and I reapply.  I&#x27;ve done this for about 3 weeks and the habit seems to be fully broken.  Be careful not to apply too much however...it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> tasted so gross! which was great for my nail biter</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works. You learn very quickly not to put your hands anywhere near your mouth and to handle your food carefully. The taste gets on everything, and it gets so bad that if you bring your hand near your mouth, you can SMELL it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that if you get any of it around the rim of the bottle or put the bottle on it&#x27;s side, it dries and basically seals the bottle shut. I have 2 bottles that I cannot get open, no matter what I try, and I&#x27;m about to order another.</li>
            <li> My daughter is nearly 5 and with kindergarten imminent, and flu season in high swing we decided it was time to help her kick her thumb sucking habit. I ordered Mavala Stop with high hopes based on the reviews. The first day it seemed like it might be the magic charm. She put her thumb in her mouth, immediately withdrew it and ran to the water fountain yelling \\&quot;disgusting\\&quot;. Great eh? Not so much. Apparently the taste grew on her as it hasn&#x27;t deterred her since. It&#x27;s as though there is nothing on her nail. She doesn&#x27;t even mention the taste. Just happily sucks her thumb same as ever. I even took to painting it on more than once a day. Still nothing. I am disappointed as I wanted to stop the daytime thumb sucking more so even than the night time sucking. Now not sure what to try next. Good luck to others but if you&#x27;ve got a determined thumb sucker this product might just be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for 15yrs and have tired every product imaginable. This product is wonderful! The taste lingers until you wash out your mouth. I used it for 3months, and completely stopped biting. I grew beautiful nails, but as soon as I stopped using it, I went right back to biting. I know I will have to use this product probably for the rest of my life, but I&#x27;m okay with that. It is really hard to eat with your fingers, and if you have it on while in the shower, the taste will get in your mouth a little.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my son stop sucking his thumb. We only had to apply it three times and he was done!</li>
            <li> This is my third product to stop me from biting my nails. This product makes your nails dry. Its really easy to transfer to food. You can&#x27;t wash it off to eat and if you pick at your nails. You will notice its really easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared if your kid vommits. It will happen for 2-3 days and then he will stop his thumb-sucking habit. I tried this for my 3.5 years son and he has almost stopped his thumb-sucking habit.</li>
            <li> Had used this once before and ordered it again for some three and four year olds in my care. They all stopped sucking their thumbs after two weeks of continuous use. Other products do not work as well.</li>
            <li> It tastes awful and dries fast. It&#x27;s perfectly clear and shiny. Mavala was referred to me by an Occupational Therapist who works with my daughter and it worked for her nail biting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and it definitely helps him stop biting his nails - however he felt like he could tasted it in his food as well and it got onto his pen (which he shouldn&#x27;t be chewing on anyway).  It doesn&#x27;t seem like it should transfer so easily.  Should just stay on the nails so you stop biting them - but not ruin meals!  It also was still on his nails several days later - even after washing his hands many times.  Not sure if that&#x27;s a positive or negative.</li>
            <li> Excellent for stop the bite nails and baby finger</li>
            <li> Baby got used to taste after a while</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh. Mavala is great. We could not get our three year old to give up the thumb. She wanted to quit, but just too much of a habit. We tried the THUM paint on stuff for a while and it would come off with simple handwashing then the thumb was back in her mouth! Mavala was recommended by a friend and we were willing to try anything. Mavala lasts for 2 days and survives bathtime and handwashing. We applied it for 2 weeks, but my child did not suck her thumb after the first application. She is so proud of herself and we are so happy not be repeating \\&quot;Get your thumb out of your mouth!\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> My son (who turned 7 this year) has been sucking his right thumb since he was 6 months old.  His sucking got worse as he got older.  If he wasn&#x27;t talking and eating, he was sucking his thumb.  Well I finally had enough of it and was worried about his teeth coming it so bucked that I had to do something.  I bought this product and put it on his finger one night.  He tried to suck it off and had to brush his teeth to get the taste out his mouth.  He tried to wash it off and there was a lot of crying.  It was a LONG night but he did it.  The next day, I promised him a new toy if he could go 3 days without crying about not sucking his thumb.  I put the product on his finger morning and nigt for the next 3 days and he did GREAT!!! On the 5th day, he even asked for me to put it on because he said he was getting the urge to suck his thumb - I was so happy!&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, he officially stopped sucking his thumb in less than 2 weeks!  I never thought I would see the day when he would not be sucking his thumb.  This is the BEST $9 I&#x27;ve EVER spent!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 20 years and this product really helps! It tastes awful! After about 4 or 5 weeks, it had me out of the habit and I was able to reduce my use</li>
            <li> Successfully helped me to stop bite my nails. I have been a nail biter for over 20 years. The other reviews are accurate - it goes on like clear nail polish and tastes horrible!</li>
            <li> tastes like s*** so that sorta works. makes eating finger food annoying while using it because the smallest amount seems to stay in your mouth for 10 or 15 minutes</li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful! friend sent me this product as we were desperate to have our 5 year old stop sucking his fingers!&lt;br /&gt;I mean nothing would work with him!&lt;br /&gt;we are still not 100% broken of the habbit, but we are 99% there!&lt;br /&gt;this product truly works! or it did for my son anyway!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Two words-- Instant Success&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our son could not break the thumb habit for eight years-- we were facing orthodotic intervention.  We got a second orthodontic opinion, and the doctor recommended Mavala Stop.  Ordered it, applied it to the thumb, he tasted it once, and that was the END of the THUMB!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been three months now since we used Mavala Stop.  I don&#x27;t think I applied it after the first few days.  (ps:  those first few days were VERY, VERY hard to get through for our son-- hard to sleep, hard when he was awake, lots of willpower-- my heart broke for him!)  But after that, we&#x27;ve never looked back-- not one relapse-- it&#x27;s over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wishing you the same success--</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a cheaper way to help our daughter stop sucking her thumb.  After the first couple of nights.  the flavor wasn&#x27;t enough to stop her.  On to the next suggestion.</li>
            <li> This item came highly recommended to me by other experienced parents. I hesitated because of the price and tried a few other remedies. My 3 year old sucked her thumb so much her front teeth are already curved/crooked and her 2 year old sister sucks her two middle fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a little on my own finger before I subjected them to it. The taste stays on your tongue and is enough to make me gag a little, but it isn&#x27;t terrible and a drink will get rid of the worst of it. It stayed on my finger for awhile. Days later I&#x27;d nibble at my thumbnail (my own bad habit) and get a mouthful of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3 year old learned quickly to stop sticking her thumb in her mouth when we tried this. Even months later she&#x27;ll warn me that thumbs taste nasty. Put it on her thumb first thing in the morning and by bed time she was done and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did have a small issue with my finger sucking 2 year old. Because the nail doesn&#x27;t immediately touch the tongue, she doesn&#x27;t taste the nasty stuff until she removes her fingers and her tongue touches the roof of her mouth. It makes it a much stronger taste (yes, I tested this as well). She did break the habit for a few days, but then her molars started cutting and she needed the soothing again and not even the bad taste could deter her. We&#x27;ll try it again when all 4 molars are through.</li>
            <li> We tried the (expensive) thumb guards which our daughter was actually excited to get until we put them on her then she went crazy after they were on and kept getting her thumb out so we decided to try this and of course, the cheaper thing worked best!  When we put it on and she was stubborn enough to try and suck it despite and tasted it she had a fit again but still asked for it when it started wearing off.  Anyway, this worked really great and I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone looking to help their child stop sucking their thumb/fingers.</li>
            <li> It worked with the first use.  The bottle gets stuck when trying to reopen...worse than any of my nail polish bottles.  But, my little one has stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> My  newly 4 year old daughter sucked her thumb to sleep and calm down.  The problem was she would suck it ALL night with no break. Every morning she woke up with a white soggy thumb. She did try to stop on her own and agreed to bandaids on her thumb but eventhough she would fall asleep without thumb sucking, while she was asleep she would pick the habit back up without even realizing it.  She would wake up thinking she earned a prize from the prize box for not sucking her thumb but I knew she had sucked her thumb from checking in on her at night (bandaid and all).&lt;br /&gt;The first time she acidentally tasted the polish on her thumb from eating (my one complaint about the product) she realized she did not want to do that again. It must have stuck on a subconcious level because it has been 3 days already and she has continued to go the whole night with not one attempt at sucking her thumb. I will keep this up for the rest of the month but I really believe she is over it now.</li>
            <li> I used this product to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb and after the first use, she has never sucked her thumb since.  My husband tried it on his thumb and said it has a horrible taste to it, which is what deters the kids from thumbsucking.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it works for me. I have been biting my nails since I was 3 I guess and this product helped me to stop it. I noticed that everytime I would bite my nails it would be kind of a unsconcious act, so when I taste the bitterness of the nail polish, I realized what I am doing and stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just watch when you are eating with your hands...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It really does taste disgusting and will stop any bad habits that you&#x27;re trying to break.</li>
            <li> First time in recent memory that I have quit \\&quot;chewen\\&quot; my nails for over a month.  (I&#x27;m 69 and a life long chewer).  Thanks, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After 4 yrs My daughter stopped sucking her fingers from the day we used mavala stop. There may be vomitting when tasted but its worth it. Go for it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the product</li>
            <li> For over a year my son has struggled with sucking his fingers non stop.  Nothing in the stores worked!  Nothing worked until I bought mavala stop.  It took two days and he has not sucked his fingers in weeks!!!!  Might not work for every kid but I wish someone would have told me about this years ago, that&#x27;s why I am writing this review.  Please try it.</li>
            <li> We put this on our daughter&#x27;s thumbnails and sucking stopped immediately.  Needs reapplication every other day, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old woman who has been biting her nails for as long as she can remember. I tried New Years resolutions, hypnosis, and \\&quot;No Bite\\&quot; (similar to this product) and none of them worked. (No Bite is similar but you have to reapply every time you wash your hands and that does not work for me.) This stuff, you put on every other day or so. When I 1st started, I put it on every day, but now I only put it on every few days. Its been almost two months since I bought this product(and I still have over half the bottle) and I actually have nails and dont bite them. Don&#x27;t get me wrong... I want to bite them... they look delicious... but the horrible taste that would accompany that action makes it just not worth it. This product works... you cant even THINK about biting your nails without this stuff getting in your mouth. Not only that, but you you wont lick your fingers after eating chicken or chips. This product is horrible! Well... I guess its great since it does what its supposed to do. It is NOT MADE FOR KIDS UNDER 5, so if you read some of the 1 star reviews, you will see a lot of those folks cannot follow directions. I will recommend this product. Its horrible and wonderful at the same time... now I can get a manicure without being embarrased about my chewed nails.</li>
            <li> It does work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Works well, but you have to apply it at least every other day or the bitter taste that deters nail biting wears off.</li>
            <li> God... it looks like women&#x27;s nail polish.  Smells like nail polish.  As a guy it kills me to have my nails look like they are perpetually wet.  It brings attention to them, which is unwanted because I am not proud of my fingernail biting habit.  I just hope this stuff works.  4 stars because this product is rough for guys to use, when guys are supposedly the majority of nail biters.  I will amend this review after using the product for a few weeks, to let you know how it worked.  I haven&#x27;t tasted it yet, as I want the taste only to be associated with nail biting.  I will let you know once I slip up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Tastes strong and terrible.  I stop everything I&#x27;m doing to spit when I slip up, which doesn&#x27;t happen from trying to bite my nails anymore, but for things like scraping a tooth, or contamination while eating finger foods.  The stuff works.  I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in over a week, and they have grown longer than they&#x27;ve ever been (which isn&#x27;t all that far, haha).  For fellow guys, you will want acetone to remove layers before applying new ones.  I just kept reapplying it every other day, and it started to build up a texture on my nail.  I&#x27;m not very good at appyling it to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m moving my rating up to 5/5 from 4/5.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my almost four year old son, who has been a thumbsucker since he was 6 months old.  He was ready to stop sucking his thumb, but admitted he couldn&#x27;t do it on his own.  After reading the reviews for Mavala Stop we thought this would be the best and most cost effective attempt at \\&quot;quitting.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied the Mavala on his thumbs, and the smell was less than appetizing.  We were all confident (my son included) this was going to do the trick.  I will mention that he only sucks his thumb at night and during naps.  Well he subconsciously put his thumb in his mouth while sleeping.  Apparently the taste was so bad, he started gagging and ultimately vomited.  He was hysterical, partially because this all occurred while he was half asleep.  It took 15 minutes to get the taste out of his mouth after brushing his teeth/tongue twice, giving him three child size cups of water, and finally giving him a piece of chocolate.  He didn&#x27;t suck his thumb for about 3 days after this incident, for fear the Mavala flavor would still be there, but once he realized it was gone the thumb sucking came back full force.  If his thumsucking habits were different (not during sleep), I would absolutely use this.  However, I can&#x27;t expect him to not suck his thumb when he is sound asleep and the thumb is a constant topic of conversation, therefore constantly on his mind.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucks any of his fingers all day. So I put this stuff on and warned him he listened to me and didn&#x27;t put this thumb in his mouth again because of my warning for about 15minutes. Then while watching TV his habit kicked in and he put his fingers in his mouth. I was watching with my wife to see his reaction. At first he kept sucking his finger then while sucking he was making a strange cringe with his eyebrows. After the cringe removed his finger and tried another. Same thing, but not the third it must of hit him a little harder cause he took out his tounge for like 5 minutes drooling while watching tv. Not once did he stop watching tv. My wife and I were laughing so hard and that his older brother came to see him and he started laughing too. Thats when noticed something is up and he came running to me with his tongue out trying to talk. Made me laugh harder. So I gave him water and he stopped with the tongue out  thing. 10 minutes later he  put his finger in his mouth again and he vomited everywhere. Another 30 mins later he sucked his finger again and threw up again. Then he ate some finger food and 5 minutes into eating threw up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was that last day he sucked his fingers for about 2 months. Started again, but then again we only did it once. We cured him after 2 weeks by adding it the back 1/2 part of his nail. That way he can eat finger food without it mixing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Also good for practical joke. Put a tiny bit on my wife&#x27;s  lower lip when she slept. Next morning she said she has the worst taste in her mouth ever. I used it on myself for my nail biting. This thing taste horrific. My nails are beautiful now. :)</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes like paint thinner. Noone will try to ouch thier nails with this stuff on. No more thumb sucking for the kids!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old won&#x27;t stop sucking on her index finger..we&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different products to stop thumb sucking and fingernail biting. All with little effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this and another product similar to it and I swear she LIKES the taste of it. I&#x27;ve asked her if it bothers her or if is &#x27;icky&#x27; and she&#x27;s told me no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say this helped at all, i&#x27;d like to find something nice to say about it (okay, it came nicely packaged) but thats about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d turn somewhere else to find a truely effective product to stop these habits.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old was having issues with nail biting. I put this on his nails and he would scrape it off with his teeth then continue to bite his nails. When I caught him doing it, he told me he liked the taste of it. I now have an ineffective product and a kid who likes eating gross things...</li>
            <li> My pediatric dentist recommended this product for my six and a half year old daughter who is beginning to get her adult teeth and is experiencing movement of her teeth due to the thumb sucking. She has been completely addicted to her thumb since she was eight weeks old. Other motivators did not work because it was a subconscious act for her. Thanks to the other reviews we knew to put it just on the top of her nail and thumb, so it would not affect the taste of her food. We started on a holiday weekend, in case it was a difficult transition, so that she wouldn&#x27;t be alone at school. It started working immediately. She knew it was a bad taste she didn&#x27;t want in her mouth. She accidentally sucked it a few times, especially  at night and the taste was traumatic for her, she had to drink a lot of milk to get rid of the taste. She was so used to sucking her thumb to go to sleep we had to give her lots of extra TLC to help her go to sleep the first night. After that, it was easy. It&#x27;s only 7 days in, but I definitely would recommend this product as my daughter won&#x27;t suck her thumb when the Mavala is on and now she sleeps differently to accommodate for not having her thumb to suck on and she sits differently when she watches TV (another time she sucked her thumb a lot). It&#x27;s changing her habits and I have no doubt after the 33 recommended days, she will have kicked the habit. If she starts sucking it again, I will start using it again. I was amazed by the fast results!!</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old female who has been biting my nails since 2nd grade and I love this product. I&#x27;ve been able to quit on and off throughout my life but for the most part I&#x27;m extremely addicted to nail biting. This product does not smell or look funny, so it&#x27;s very easy to just put on top of nail polish or on bare nails. I carry it in my purse so that I can reapply it every other day and never have an excuse for accidentally biting them. You have to apply GENEROUSLY. It&#x27;s not like putting on nailpolish where you put on a normal amount of liquid and spread nicely. You have to really slosh it on or else it might not be strong enough. I highly recommend this product to help stop nail biting. I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t been \\&quot;cured,\\&quot; but I think that in time I will basically &#x27;forget&#x27; to bite my nails after not doing it for so long. The taste is sooo gross and it stays in your mouth for an extra minute, so you really get punished and learn your lesson! I keep my fingers out of my mouth now!</li>
            <li> The taste is a good deterrent from nail biting. We also purchased to keep our 6 year old from putting her hands in her mouth so much in hopes of reducing the number of viruses she&#x27;s constantly catching from school. She agrees it tastes nasty! My primary complaint though is if you have to wash your hands a lot, which in working in the healthcare field I do, plan to use two coats and apply at least every other day, if not daily. I found if I only use one coat it doesn&#x27;t take long at all for it to thin and wear off. Usually by the end of the day I can barely see it on my nails, so doing an extra coat helps it last longer.</li>
            <li> I have a five year old who has sucked his thumb since infancy.  I have tried everything, positive reinforcement and rewards, hugs and one over the counter pharmacy product (containing cayenne pepper which he enjoyed) but to no avail.  I read about the product reviews and could not believe the reponses, it sounded far too easy. Well, the thumb sucking habit ended in just ONE DAY! This product is a nail polish type which is brushed on once a day and has a bitter, unpleasant taste but not harmful. I tried it on myself first to make sure.  I continued to use Mavala Stop on him for one week just in case there was a relapse. At the end of the week, I used nail polish remover and soap and water to remove the residue, so there would be no more bitter taste.  He has not sucked his thumb since.  Effective results!</li>
            <li> best product to help kids stop sucking on their fingers!</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing! My daughter who is 2 1/2 would not stop sucking her ring and middle finger. We bought this product and put it on her like nail polish before bed. She loves nail polish, so there was no foolery about it. We had worked her up to it telling her that if she didn&#x27;t stop sucking her fingers they were going to start to taste bad. Sure enough she came out the next morning telling me that her fingers tasted bad because she had tried to suck them.... within the week she had stopped even trying. She even was asking for me to paint her nails before bed! She is now 3 years old and still hasn&#x27;t gone back to sucking her fingers!!! This product is amazing! We had tried tape and bandaids on her fingers before... nothing helped. Thanks for such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Our son was pretty much born with his thumb in his mouth, where it stayed until he was 3-1/2 years old and we became concerned with his increasingly buck teeth.  All our other attempts to break the habit failed.  We began Mavala and the habit was broken, with no need for further Mavala, in a couple of days.  Just vanished like it never existed.</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala Stop on the recommmendation of our pediatric dentist. I have a daughter that just turned 9 today and was an ambidextrious (sp) thumbsucker. As soon as we would pull one thumb out the other would go in. Now I have to share some of the blame (as I shamefully look away)on her being a thumbsucker. When she was born she refused to take a binky and my pinky was becoming a shriveled mess. I, then introduced her to her thumb... alas, a solution. Who knew it would last this long.&lt;br /&gt;Along comes Mavala Stop. It arrived very, very quickly BUT it sat on my counter for over a week as it came in the same packaging as my medication and just assumed it was that. Imagine my excitement when I did finally open it.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter is a dual thumbsucker, me, a lifelong nail biter and a sweet boy who likes to snack on (dare I say it) his boogies. g.r.o.s.s!  I put it on all of our fingers (1 coat) and within minutes I was already hearing gagging, spitting and begging cries to get it off. heeheee.. I knew this would be coming. The only thing is that I wish I didnt start on Sunday night as both kids have school the next day. Fastforward a week or two  later and my 9 y/o is no longer sucking her thumb. I&#x27;ll check on her at various times during pm/am and there is NO THUMB in her mouth. For me, the nailbiter, I do need a bit more assistance with the Mavala Stop, which I will continue using. My nails though are starting to look fab! As for my boogie snacker, he still needs it as he&#x27;s been able to manuever around the Mavala Stop a bit. I&#x27;m also hoping this will prevent him from eating food with his fingers so much. (He&#x27;s 6). I&#x27;ve been applying Mavala Stop very lightly. I&#x27;ll have to apply more liberally next time.&lt;br /&gt;This is a polish, so it just doesnt \\&quot;wash off\\&quot; wHich is great as it will last thru 2 - 3 days of handwashing. It does taste awful. I got it into my mouth while eating sushi. My daughter would keep a cup of water &amp; orange slices by her bed. WHich she usually needed about 6 am to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried different methods to get our daughter to stop. The Thumb Guard, bandaids, bribery, etc. I&#x27;m so impressed with this stuff and soooo happy I found it. I still keep an eye on her, but it was just the thing our daughter needed to stop. HALLELUJAH!!!about 6 am to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried different methods to get our daughter to stop. The Thumb Guard, bandaids, bribery, etc. I&#x27;m so impressed with this stuff and soooo happy I found it. I still keep an eye on her, but it was just the thing our daughter needed to stop. HALLELUJAH!!!</li>
            <li> My son is 4 1/2 and sucked his thumb.  Our dentist recommended we try Mavala Stop and it worked the first night.  He tasted it once and did not like it and he never put his thumbs in his mouth again.  It has been one week.  I am suprised that it worked so fast.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old picked up the habit of sticking his fingers in his mouth as we went to sleep and at times he would make himself gag.  We wanted to stop this habit (bad for forming teeth) and after a lot of research decided to try this.  After 2 nights using this my son stopped sticking his fingers in his mouth.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> i never do reviews.  for this one, i had to take the time, and hopefully help other parents.  my 5-year-old sucked her finger mostly at night - she didn&#x27;t even know she was doing it in her sleep.  we tried one other brand - thum - and it was no better than water.  we tried mavala and it worked perfectly.  it took a day or two and hard-core finger sucker had no more interest in sucking her finger.  she was so proud.  she just needed a little help.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I purchased it for my daughters.  One of them sucks her thumb and the other bites her nails.  After 7 days or so, my youngest is no longer sucking her thumb and my oldest actually has nails.  I would recommend this product to any parent seeking to convert thumb suckers and nail biters.</li>
            <li> If you wash your hands or use antibacterial stuff, it comes off so you must reapply about every other day. Worked for nail biting. Be careful with putting the lid back on---it stuck and my husband finally got it back open with pliers. So I just don&#x27;t screw it back on completely. A bit too expensive. Will not repurchase.  Found some similar stuff at Walmart for like $3.</li>
            <li> This product stopped our 6 year old habitual nail biter and 4 year old thumb sucker. It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> We used this to get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb and it worked!  She was about 3 1/2 years old when we used it and she hasn&#x27;t resumed the habit in 2 years.</li>
            <li> Mavala stop worked for my six year old to stop sucking her thumb at bed time. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> had high hopes but eventually my daughter didn&#x27;t care that her nails tasted bad and still put her hand in her mouth.  but she takes a lot of oral meds that taste bad so it&#x27;s probably just her.</li>
            <li> We tried several off the shelf products as well as devices but this worked the best.  This was recommended to me by a friend who swore that that this was the only product that worked for her.  The taste is disgusting and does not go away easily.  We used it every night for about one month and after the initial protests the finger sucking went away.  I can&#x27;t thank my friend enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this after an unsuccessful attempt with Thum. I was hopeful this would work as it did for my niece. But, my 3 year old went ahead in the middle of the night and sucked his thumb even with Mavala on it. Perhaps he doesn&#x27;t taste it when he is asleep??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend if your child only sucks their thumb while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I bought it again because it did great achievements with my 3y daughter regarding her the thumb sucking habit, BUT  we had a kind of relapse which is my fault that didn&#x27;t use it regularly, SO here we are again with more commandment.</li>
            <li> She is a tenacious five year old who sucked her fingers everywhere. The sucking was so severe it caused a slight speech delay (only because she would prefer to suck her fingers instead of talking!) and an open bite. I had to try something! First I purchased Thum, which she had her fingers back in her mouth that evening. She thought it was funny when I was all hyped up about her \\&quot;stop sucking\\&quot; polish because I made a big deal about the bad taste of Thum and she evidently disagreed! Back to the drawing board. I ordered Mavala Stop on Amazon and the first time I applied it she STOPPED COLD. She hates the taste of it, as it leaves a bitter aftertaste that lingers on after the sucking is done. One night I think she had a relapse and sucked, because she said she went to the bathroom and threw up. I never saw it but she said she did. I reassured her and explained that the stop sucking polish could make her sick in her tummy if she put her fingers in her mouth. I don&#x27;t think she tried that again! We are three weeks free of finger sucking and she is suprisingly much more vocal with her needs. She is definately speaking more and much better enunciation! The dentist said as long as we stopped her before her permanent teeth errupted at age 6 or so that the damage to her bite would be minimal. Thank GOD for this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails my whole life.  I put this on and tasted this one time. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since. It lingers and conditions you quickly to avoid biting your nails.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  My daughters (3 yrs old and 7 yrs old) bit on their nails for years and I could not get them to stop.  This product did it for them!</li>
            <li> A friend and I both purchased this product for our daughters about a month ago.  They are both close to five years old.  We have seen great success.  Both have kicked the habit.  My daughter has wanted to stop for the last year, but everything else failed (sock on the hand, thumbguard, band-aids, rewards, etc.).  I decided for only $7, I&#x27;d glady try this.  It was a challenge the first couple of days.  It really does taste awful, but within a week she was not sucking her thumb during the day.  After about 2 weeks, she quit sucking it at night, as well.  I am THRILLED and her dentist will be, too.</li>
            <li> Just one application lasted over a week (even with hand-washing and showers) and tasted bad enough to cure my son.  He DID complain that he could taste it on his food (like chips) and didn&#x27;t lick his fingers during that time.  Small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I have always had the bad habit of biting my nails, AND I&#x27;M 21!!! Pretty embarrassing and I really just wanted to go get mani&#x27;s:) I really liked this product. It really does taste bitter. It also smells horrible, but once I applied it, it doesn&#x27;t smell. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about the smell. You just have to be careful eating finger foods like burgers and fries or else you&#x27;ll get that nasty taste. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that after the 3rd day, the bad taste went away. I just re-applied it so it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal. It&#x27;s about the size of any other nail polish so I know it will last. It has really helped with my nail biting. Hopefully, soon, I&#x27;ll stop all together. But even so, I would buy this product again if I ran out. IT REALLY HELPS!!!</li>
            <li> Almost works too well! I tried it too so I knew what my son had on his fingers. Only problem...I couldn&#x27;t eat anything with my hands for 4 days without  tasting it. The stuff tastes AWEFUL! My son had to taste it as well for 4 days. We tried everything to get it off...had to let 4 days of bathing, washing hands, and using nail polish remover work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my sixties who has been biting my nails constantly for at least fifty years.  I had never really tried to stop before now. I was motivated by running across this product on Amazon, and thinking that it might work for me.  Well the good news is that it did work!!!  The stuff doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as most of the other reviewers have said---it is not the worst thing I have ever tasted.  However, it is unpleasant enough to deter you from wanting to put a nail in your mouth.  I used the stuff for about two weeks until I was confident that I had broken the habit.  Yesterday I trimmed my finger nails with a nail clipper for the first time in fifty years or so!!!!  If Mavala worked for me, it can work for anybody!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor drawback is that you can indeed taste it a little bit if you pick up food with your fingers. But that is a minor inconvenience considering that  you only have to put up with it for a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three-tenths of an ounce doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but it&#x27;s more than enough to cure everyone in your extended family, as well as everyone on your block for that matter.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter bites her nails and I bought this to help her stop. I have been very pleased with this product. She does not bite her nails at all. I do apply it daily as well to keep the taste strong.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny because it makes you very aware of what you are doing.  If I have a hangnail, Mavala made me stop picking at it because of the unpleasant taste.  It forces you to grab a nail file and be done with it.  The taste lingers for a minute or two, and it&#x27;s enough to make you stop.  Perhaps now I&#x27;ll have longer nails than ever now!</li>
            <li> We tried every behavior modification we could think of, then tried ones we read about, then consulted a dentist.  Nothing worked, be it positive-only reinforcement or otherwise.  Our 4 year old daughter couldn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we are usually quite skeptical of simple sounding remedies, I can honestly say this is the closest thing to a miracle drug I&#x27;ve seen.  Overnight it stopped.  She cried once when she didn&#x27;t think about it and put her thumb in her mouth.  That was it.  We are going on 4 weeks now.  Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My 5 1/2 year old sucked his thumb form birth and we tried many different behavior modifications.  I thought putting this on his thumb was cruel but when his dentist told me it was starting to have detrimental effects on his teeth and jaw (and YES it can and does have an effect on their mouth, I saw the x rays),  I ordered Mavala.  Within one week, he broke his habit!!  It has been over two months now and we are so proud of him and more importantly, he is so proud of himself!!  Some tips.....we talked to him, planted the idea in his head over months and HE decided he was ready to stop, the product cinched the deal!  We let him put it on himself (with help) so that he felt in control of the situation.  I agreed to give up a habit using Mavala too...cursing.  Whenever I cursed (a horrible habit!!)  I put this stuff on my tounge!  GAG!  It is AWFUL  and it worked! My son was more willing to do it when he saw I would too!  My potty mouth has improved dramatically!  THANK YOU MAVALA for saving me thousands at the orthodontist and for making me a better role model for my #@$#@#!% kids!  Oops Mavala time...</li>
            <li> 1. I was charged for this product immediately, then emailed that it was backordered. It did finally arrive, took about 3 weeks total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It WORKS. I have 2 children, a boy almost 5, and a girl almost 7. He has been biting for a few months, she for probably a year. They both had absolutely NO nails left and also were biting the skin around the nail. I would tell them to stop when watching tv, etc, but could not stop them while they were at school, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It WORKS! They actually have nails! I put it on Wednesday afternoon for the first time. I reapplied inconsistently (it does wear off) - you could reapply twice a day or every couple days, depending on how much you need. By Monday afternoon, I could see decent nail growth on both children. My son did try to bite (more than my daughter) - and would then go get a drink to wash the taste out. It does taste very bad - not enough to make you sick, but enough to make you stop biting and help remember not to bite next time. I think the habit is broken, but I will keep it on them for a week or so now to make sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are a couple different listings on Amazon for this same product.</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking his thumb for years and we couldn&#x27;t find any other products to stop him. After 4 days the product forced him to stop sucking his thumb. He hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb in about 3 weeks, so I really believe that he has overcome this habit. Thanks Mavala because you saved me thousands of dollars for braces. I would recommend this product to anyone that is having thumb sucking or finger sucking issue.</li>
            <li> Great, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> must taste really nasty my daughter has quit biting nails. i know it must taste really bad. when she eats chips and starts licking her fingers she goes eeewww and stops licking her fingers. she now has finger nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19-year-old male who has had the horrible nervous habit of biting my nails and cuticles for pretty much my whole life! I must tell you the taste of this is HORRIBLE so you won&#x27;t be able to eat much with your fingers, so use utensils while you have it on your nails. I think after about a week, I started to actually recognize when I was about to bite my nails and I could fight the urge. It worked so well that after about 2 weeks, it actually weird to want to bite my nails! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Long-time Amazon buyer, first Amazon review!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked GREAT on my just-turned 4 year old boy who was biting his nails. He had been doing it for over a year and we had no idea why. I prepared him by telling him we were going to be painting some stuff on his nails to help them grow longer and he was all for it. I painted, carefully, just his nails and blew on them to dry them. He got a couple tastes of it and of course needed to drink water and wipe his mouth but really didn&#x27;t throw much of a fit. For sure put it on daily or every 2 days. I can&#x27;t remember exactly, but we did it for about 2 weeks and his nails started growing! I made a BIG deal of his nails and he was very proud to show me his little hands every day to see how long his nails were. I kind of stopped when I thought he was over the nail biting, but we had a couple \\&quot;relapses\\&quot; where he would bite one of them and it ended up getting kind of short. So we started again for another week or so and that&#x27;s all I needed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I realized, in the end, that it ended up being more of a \\&quot;realization\\&quot; for my son rather than the taste when he put his nails in his mouth. The process of painting them I think helped him realize what we were trying and I think he remembered it when he was about to put his hands in his mouth. Not each time, but very often.&lt;br /&gt;But however it happened - it worked!!! He now never bites his nails. And, like others said, I should&#x27;ve done it sooner. Only about 3 weeks of this and he&#x27;s rid of a horrible habit that he could&#x27;ve had for life.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Yes, you will need about 1/8 of that bottle. So team up and share with someone else or another mom who might be able to use it!</li>
            <li> I think each child&#x27;s dependency on needing to sooth is different and requires different interventions at different times. Our son started sucking his thumb late. But fractured his knee and became more depended at six. Our orthodontist recommended mavala stop. It has mitigated the behavior to just bedtime. Which I believe is ideal. His teeth have straightened since using it. It Is recommended by mavala stop not to use it earlier than 3yrs because taste buds are not fully developed. We have found that to be true because we tried a nail biting inhibitor when he was around three and sucked his thumb anyway. When we used mavala stop after turning six we got the results that was explained before.</li>
            <li> Do you want to stop biting your nails or want your kid to stop!  Well this will do it- the taste is awful!  My son bit his so bad that they would bleed - not anymore - I just have to show his the bottle if he even thinks of biting - Worked well for us!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my 2 year old daughter who sucks her fingers. She didn&#x27;t care about the bitter taste and continued to suck.  So I thought I&#x27;d try it on my seven-year-old son because he is a nailbiter and it worked perfectly for him!!.  He&#x27;s already picky with the foods and different textures so it worked.  He hated the taste so bad that he would wash his mouth and rub a cloth on his tongue  to get the taste off. Lol. I only gave it four stars because the jar dries out from opening and closing it constantly and I wasn&#x27;t able to use all of the contents in the jar because it was dried shut.</li>
            <li> It works right from the get go.  Be aware that it leaves a nasty taste in your child&#x27;s mouth which make effect how food tastes after they try to suck there thumb when you first use it.</li>
            <li> It worked only on the first day and then started swolling this from the next day.. no use.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old preschooler had always sucked his thumb. I tried lots of things to get him to stop. This was another thing I decided to try. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work but after 3 days of putting it on his thumbnail. He stopped!!! He doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb anymore. I cannot believe it! He whined the first 2 days about it but he doesn&#x27;t think about it anymore. YEA!!!</li>
            <li> This polish tastes terrible and awful and yucky, but that is exactly what it is supposed to do.  It lasts about 2-3 days on my fingers even after showers, doing dishes, and washing my hands.  Keep that in mind if you know that you are going to eat finger foods anytime soon.  It has helped me realize that I was about to bite my nails before I did it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend after reviewing what was out there.  He&#x27;s been chewing his fingernails for at least 20 years by his own account.  I tried this on my nails (although I&#x27;m not a biter) and it tastes AWFUL!  I can&#x27;t imagine getting used to the taste...and if I ever did, I&#x27;d have bigger problems than nail biting (laugh)!  And it lasts, so you&#x27;re not constantly re-applying.  I was sure the horrible taste would wear out in a day or two, but it lasts for at least five days!  Sure, it leaves a \\&quot;polish\\&quot; on your nails (like clear nail polish).  But that&#x27;s where the flavor is...where they keep the \\&quot;magic\\&quot;, if you will.  And hey, you actually HAVE nails!  For some, it&#x27;s not a  vanity issue at all.  Some people are actually ruining their teeth by biting their nails.  What a shame!  And my friend has lovely teeth.  I&#x27;d hate to see him ruin them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any self-administered aversion therapy, you have to be committed.  And he is.  Just like any habit, though, it&#x27;s hard and you have to maintain your commitment to quitting.  I am an ex-smoker and can thoroughly feel for what he&#x27;s going through.  It&#x27;s an excellent aid to the committed quitter.  We&#x27;ll keep you posted, but I guarantee, if any taste-aversion therapy is going to work, this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product really works!  We used it to help our almost 3-year-old break the thumbsucking habit during the day.  However, I would NOT recommend it for night time, because if she accidentally puts her thumb in her mouth at night, she will get that AWFUL taste and probably cry.  I would recommend some sort of &amp;#34;special shirt&amp;#34; (closed off hands) or thumb guard for night time, and then mavala during the day, when it is more of a battle of wills or a conscious decision to suck.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I ordered Mavala to stop my four year old from sucking her thumb. It has worked wonderfully! She also had a habit of biting nails/putting fingers in her mouth. She now grows her nails out and does not put her fingers in her mouth. This has to aid in less germs and sicknesses. Product is excellent. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not only did this stuff stop my kid from biting his nails- I loaned it to friends, and their twins stopped sucking their thumbs in 3 days! It actually works, and i&#x27;ll tell you why. Curiosity got the best of me, and so I dabbed my tongue on the applicator: UUUGGGGHH!!! That taste stayed in my mouth for about 10 minutes! It is so bitter and nasty, there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re kid won&#x27;t stop! I still have a bunch left, so this is a good deal!</li>
            <li> I have 7 yr. old twin boys that both suck their thumbs. I did not think it was going to work. Within 3 weeks, they both had completely stopped sucking their thumbs! I was so shocked! This stuff really and truly works!</li>
            <li> It does work I thought it was a miracle!!! My son is now 4 yrs old and loves to suck on his fingers. Just apply nail polish Mavala it will do the job..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for close to 20 yrs, and this product has allowed me to almost completely break the habit in about a week.  Ive tried other products and nothing has worked this well.  the only down point about Mavala is that as a guy, in the Army, Shiny nails are not greatly approved of!  but it is a small price to pay to have un-bitten nails again.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, my 5 year old has been struggling with this and we had tried everything!  It only took a week!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend. Had this issue for many years starting from the age of three. After eight years and a month ago found this on amazon, read reviews and bough - and first time for many years we can shorten nails for our kid. Can not be happier.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to get my 2 year old to stop sucking his thumb. However, my 4 year old did not mind the taste and continues to bite his nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and has pretty much been sucking her thumb sice she was a month old and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked until I ordered this product. The first day she stopped! She tried sucking her thumb twice that day and both times said \\&quot;nasty\\&quot; since then I haven&#x27;t had to reapply or anything, she has completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks and it actually works! I&#x27;m a life-long nail biter, so this is a big deal for me. The taste isn&#x27;t so bad it makes me throw up or anything, it is just unpleasant (warning: be careful when you eat popcorn because you may get the bitter taste when you start getting salt all over your hands!) I&#x27;m attaching before and after photos because you can definitely see the difference!</li>
            <li> After I read the reviews I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive the product. My 8-year-old son needed to stop sucking his thumb. I was desperate so I spent the $12 hoping this would be the answer. I started to see him sucking his thumb less in the first week but by week two it didn&#x27;t even seem to phase him. Either he got used to the awful taste or he found a way to remove it. I used it myself to help me stop biting my nails, and I haven&#x27;t bitten them since, but the rest of the family suffered for it. The taste of MALVA Stop gets into food, if you prepare it with your hands. Not only does it ruin the taste of your nails, it ruins the taste of the food you eat with your hands. So if you plan to use this, try not to eat things like fried chicken, tacos or chips. Also it seems to wear off rather easily.</li>
            <li> Only had to apply 1 time and my 2 1/2 year old stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> After rave reviews online and watching the success with another child (5yr) at school, we had plans to stop our daughter&#x27;s (3.5yr) thumb sucking in one long weekend. Following the advise, I applied just a little to her thumbnails to start. We checked on her, and there she was fast asleep, thumb in mouth, so before nap the next day I applied a little more. She didn&#x27;t nap. That night I applied a little more on both thumbs. We were wondering why she wasn&#x27;t waking in the night, until we found her in the morning sucking on her thumb like it wasn&#x27;t covered in the most bitter foul tasting nail polish ever. We told her we would take her to Chuck E Cheese if she could make it through the weekend. What do you do when your child can&#x27;t taste in their sleep? Can anyone taste in their sleep?  She wants to stop, but as soon as the lights are out a robot takes over her arm and guides that thing straight to her mouth.  Her teeth are messed up and she can&#x27;t pronounce the &#x27;k&#x27; sound. Since we&#x27;ve tried band-aids, I don&#x27;t think any type of removable guard would work either.</li>
            <li> Cured my daughter of thumb sucking in 3 days.  3 DAYS.  After months of cajoling, bribes, etc.  We used it as a &#x27;reminder,&#x27; not a punishment, however, and my daughter was grateful for it.  (And her teeth straightened back in  a week!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for as long as I can remember (I&#x27;m 22) and after using this I finally have stopped!  I have been using it over the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t had to reapply it the last few days and have had no urge to bite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is so bitter and long lasting that it makes flossing or eating some finger foods very difficult.  But, I just toughed it out and flossed anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala for making such a wonderful product!  I never thought I&#x27;d be able to stop biting my nails.  Only problem now is that I have long nails and don&#x27;t know what to do with them!</li>
            <li> This was the second such product that we tried and this one worked like a charm.  It does not need to be applied every day and it broke my daughter of her finger sucking withing a week!</li>
            <li> Worked amazingly well to help my son to stop biting his nails</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful this was going to work after reading all the other reviews.  Our 3-year old bites her fingernails and toenails until they bleed and we are worried about her health.  We applied this liberally and every day (despite the claim that the product should be applied every other day), but she would pick it off and kept on biting.  We&#x27;re hopeful we&#x27;ll find something that works, but this didn&#x27;t do it for us.</li>
            <li> This helped my son stop sucking his thumb in a few short days.</li>
            <li> It really works! I applied the product to my younger brother, and he stop biting since the nail taste bitter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 1/2 yr old to stop his thumb sucking habit and it worked like a charm!!!  But beware it tastes awful.  My son use to fall asleep with his thumb and then unconsiously stick them in his mouth later in the night.  It took a few nights for him to not put them in his mouth in the middle of the night and woke up to get a drink to wash his mouth out but the falling asleep habit went away right away!!!  Works Great, he is even excited to put it on now (we are continuing the use till we are certain the habit is gone)!!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 7. I&#x27;ve tried everything...no bite, acrylic nails, etc. and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop. Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...I stopped bitting my nails on day 1. I don&#x27;t know what is in it but it tastes utterly disgusting. Awful chemical taste that lingered in my mouth for at least half an hour and lasts on the fingers for days. Completely ruined finger foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here we are, 5 weeks later, and my nails are longer than I&#x27;ve seen them in years. I stopped using Mavala about 2 weeks ago and have not wanted to bite my nails since. that is big! But as a safety, I keep the bottle in my purse just in case I get an inkling to bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for my 8 yr old son who had chewed his nails so bad and also chewed on the tips of his skin. This product worked amazingly. It took a good week or two but he has kicked the habit. He was doing it so bad that we put it on everyday for the first 5 days or so then cut back to every other day and then as needed. Defiinitely recommend this product for nailbiters of all ages :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 1/2 year old who sucks his thumb. It worked for about 4 days until he got used to the taste then he was right back to sucking. We have held off re-applying it in hopes he will dislike the taste the next time i apply it, which will be very soon. Overall i was very impressed with the initial results.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading reviews. My 4 yr old was a stubborn thumb sucker and her jaw and teeth are suffering because of it. We have tried everything under the sun to get her to stop. I cam across this stuff on a search and decided to try it. After the first night she has not even attempted to stick her thumb in her mouth. She says it disgusting and cried the first time i put it on. I will def recommend this to anyone with the same problem as me!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my one-year old and did not realize this is for older kids... much older! Beware, this staff smells like nail polish. It is very very strong! I would highly discourage using this on smaller children; thus, I have yet to use this. Maybe if she is 5 and still sucking her thumb :)</li>
            <li> This product does what is says. My 8 year old stop sucking her thumb in 2 weeks and is now proud of herself. My 5 year old has stop sucking too but I still apply it to her thumbs as she sometimes puts the finger in her mouth to test if it still has a bad taste. My 9 month old will get his thumb painted when he gets a little older. Both girls cried the first week, but I had to practice tough love. I stayed with them at nights and held their hands to help them to fall asleep and explained to them that I was doing this to protect their teeth and smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on myself and co-workers. It is awful, the taste lingers for a while and I did not put my finger near my mouth for days. It does destroy finger foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amen Mavala&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kingston Jamaica</li>
            <li> On day 3 of my 2.5 year old being thumb sucking free.  Put it on her fingers 4 days ago and she tried sucking it twice the first day and gagged, following that only tried 2 or 3 times and stopped immediately.  She was a habitual sucker before so I didn&#x27;t think it would stop so fast.  Good Luck&lt;br /&gt;11</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult thumb sucker. It has taken it&#x27;s toll on my teeth and I now want braces, but the dentist told me that I have to stop sucking my thumb for six months. It is hard to do, especially @ night when I unconsciously suck my thumb in my sleep. I would even make little castes out of toilet tissue and wrap it on my thumb, but it would fall off and I&#x27;d wake up with my thumb in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;This Product has really helped me. I&#x27;ll wake up in the middle of the night running to the bathroom washing my mouth out because of the taste. I&#x27;ve stop sucking, but I still have the urge to. The only thing is that I just have to have the will power to keep applying Mavala until my urges stop.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product. Get it!</li>
            <li> If they use it, it works great. They sure don&#x27;t like the taste of it.</li>
            <li> I have 3 children who suck their fingers and/or thumb. (Ages 6, 5, and 3).  My dentist told me they needed to stop b/c their hard palate was changing b/c of it.  This product, thumb sucking weekly sticker chart and weekly treats did it!  They have all been 100% successful now for 4 weeks! I am so grateful for this product!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for about 20 years now and I finally got fed up with it. The moment I put the Mavala Stop on my fingers I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails once! My fingers nails now taste so bad that I cant even get them near my lips with out tasting the nasty, lingering flavor. I have tried many other products similar to this one but the others are tolerable or flake off easily. I swim everyday and even when I get out of the pool after an hours swim they still taste bad! I am thoroughly impressed with this product and would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 3 years old and had sucked her thumb since 4 months. We were not sure what to do, and after reading the reviews we bought this product. We had told our daughter that if she kept sucking her thumb it was going to start tasting \\&quot;bad\\&quot;. One day I told her I was going to paint her nails, only 2, because little girls don&#x27;t paint her nails, but I wanted to see how her nails will look like when she grows up. She didn&#x27;t suspe4ct a thing, and I only had to apply it once. BUT you must be prepared for some vomiting. At least my daughter vomited 3 times, before realizing she should do it. Our biggest fear, bed/nap time. She did it great since the beginning. Get this product and forget about trying anything else. This one works!!!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product, it really helped my brother stop biting his nails which was a great accomplishment! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday with the hope that I could use it to stop my 2.5 year old&#x27;s pacifier use.  Our Pediatrician suggested we use this so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It arrived yesterday and I figured I better try it on myself before I give it to her to see what I should expect, but I&#x27;m confused because it doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything.  It just tastes like really strong fingernail polish, but not horrible or disgusting as others have posted.  I don&#x27;t bite my nails, but I do occasionally put my nails in my mouth when I am bored or just sitting around and I just realized I had the nail I painted in my mouth and it really didn&#x27;t have any affect on me whatsoever, it just started tasting a tiny bit bitter and that is how I remembered that it had the polish on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad/old batch, or if different taste buds perceive the taste differently.  I will update when I&#x27;ve tried it on my daughter to see if she has a different reaction.</li>
            <li> Been biting my nails for 30 years. I don&#x27;t anymore. It tastes horrible, but is very unnoticeable as a nail polish, even for a guy. Much better than the CVS product that looks similar.</li>
            <li> Worked for me!!! I tried everything in the world (including &#x27;being patient&#x27;) to stop my daughter&#x27;s thumb sucking habit. Nothing worked and I almost lost hope till I found this product&#x27;s review just a day before her 3rd b&#x27;day. I got it for her bday, like a gift from god.&lt;br /&gt;This is how it worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: applied once and let it dry. this has a real yucky taste, my daughter just kept spitting if she dare suck anytime.&lt;br /&gt;I promised her that she will get the birthday gifts if she stop thumb sucking. No thumb sucking today, but did some crying. won the first bday gift from me.&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: no need to apply, the liquid&#x27;s effect still continued. no thumb sucking. got second bday gift. some crying in the night (need some compromise on your sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: tried to thumbsuck one time, just to be sure I applied again. thats the end of a 2 year long habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Days followed...</li>
            <li> 3 1/2 yr old sucked her thumb a lot. with in 2 wks she stopped. First four days she would wake up or start to go to sleep with the taste in her mouth a little bit of juice would help take away the taste.  She never cried about it she just would say I have the yucky taste in my mouth and we would take care of it.  I explained to her before using it what it was and what would happen if she sucked her thumb.  very quick and effective.</li>
            <li> This product recommended by the doctor works well-baby girl doesn&#x27;t like the taste &amp; keeps her thumb out of her mouth!</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and cant remember a time when I had nails. I used this stuff and it stopped me dead in my tracks!! Im still fighting with the habit but when I know Im starting again I paint it on and BAM stops me instantly. This stuff tastes terrible.....It does present problems in.....\\&quot;social\\&quot; situations, kinda awkward to explain to a chick what that taste is...Specially when its a huge mood changed haha. Other then that WORKS GREAT!!! Ive had mine for a few months and its gotten gummy, Im reordered a new bottle and hope to beat the habit soon!</li>
            <li> My daughter is turning 5 so I bought this to help stop her thumb sucking. Needless to say I painted her two thumbnails and got exactly what I was expecting, her on the verge of tears trying to wash her mouth out because it was nasty. She thought she was going to be smart and wash her hands with soap and water, only to find out later that it was still on her thumbs. I have no doubt that this will work and will gladly post an update in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 07/17/2015&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has completely stopped sucking her thumbs and fairly quickly, and I now have a full bottle left and Ive used it myself. I&#x27;m now consciously aware of when i put my fingers in my mouth and i have stopped biting my finger nails. my mom says i don&#x27;t look like i have crack head hands now.</li>
            <li> I have 6 year old twins who has sucked their thumbs since infancy.  I struggled to get them to stop. No matter how many deals we made to get them a new toy or throw them a party they couldn&#x27;t kick the habit.  I got this product and waited until they were sleeping and put it on their fingernails.  They woke up the next morning complaining of a yucky taste in their mouths and from then on one of them stopped completely.  The other won&#x27;t if she knows I put it on her nails but still struggles only because I am not consistantly putting it on.  It does what it says it works!</li>
            <li> Good, but the taste sucks, it is hard to remember to apply, just not reasonable. Find other means to stop biting your fingers! Unless you use this for kids, then it might be useful. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My husband and I cannot believe how fast this product worked for our child! No more thumb sucking!!Within a few days he was done with the thumb. We are just amazed.Definately worth purchasing if you have a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sucked her thumb her whole life, I even have a Ultrasound of her sucking in womb. She is 5.5 now and she sucks her thumb so hard her teeth are moving. She sucked day and night and I couldn&#x27;t even bribe her to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on her thumb and she stopped and never even looked back. She actually got into it and reminded me to put her thumb medicine on. It only took one week before we didn&#x27;t have to use it anymore. She is a happy young girl who does not suck her thumb any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that anything could make her stop. She seemed to enjoy it so much.</li>
            <li> The product works, even for my 3-year old. The only down side is that you can taste it when eating finger foods, etc. It is definitely worth it for the money and I would suggest it to anyone who has a nail biting problem. I have never been happier with my nails and thank God for introducing me to Mavala!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and was very excited.  My 3.5 yr kid puts his fingers in his mouth constantly.  I put this on his nails and it didn&#x27;t make any difference at all.  I put it on my hands and it tastes gross, but didn&#x27;t make any difference to him.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, he didn&#x27;t like the taste, but within a few hours the thumb was back in the mouth.  It seems my child must love the taste as he will ask me to put it on his thumb.  I have come to realize my son loves to suck his thumb and will have to stop on his own terms.  Unfortunately, this did not work for my son and his thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 yr. old son was ready to stop sucking his thumb, but it was too difficult, being a habit he&#x27;d started before he was born--we have it on an ultrasound pic! We started using a band-aid on his thumb each night, which worked for almost 2 weeks. Then he started taking them off. We tried a couple other home remedies to no avail. The Mavala was recommended to me by another parent...it is working wonderfully. My son tells us that it helps remind him not to suck. The taste is bad, but it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything. (I got it on my finger and absent-mindedly tried to chew a hangnail a COUPLE DAYS later...yuck!!) It is not pleasant, and I had a hard time getting the taste out of my mouth...a very good deterrant!&lt;br /&gt;We have used it a couple weeks, and continue to reapply about every 3rd or 4th day..it lasts that long!I think we&#x27;ll have to use it for a while longer just because it is such an ingrained habit for my son, but the product is definitely doing the trick!</li>
            <li> I tried the product on my own hand, it&#x27;s very bitter.  But no matter how much I applied the product to my son&#x27;s trumb, it didn&#x27;t stop him from sucking.  He&#x27;s not afraid of the taste, he even asked me to put on \\&quot;yikie\\&quot; for him.  I wish there is another flavor like spicy because my son is afraid of spicy, more than bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Our daughter sucked on her two fingers for several years. Mavala Stop was recommended by my sister-in-law and it worked the first night!&lt;br /&gt;We applied it on her two nails and applied it again a few nights later. That is all we had to do! She sucks her fingers no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala Stop!!</li>
            <li> We had a 4 year old that would not quit sucking her fingers - no mater how hard we tried.  Socks, mittens, and every other cover-up we tried were no match for her desire to suck her fingers while she was sleeping.  We used the Mavala Stop product ONE TIME, and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her fingers since!  The first night she did put her fingers in her mouth out of habit - and the bad taste of this stuff was enough to wake her up and make her get up and take a drink of water to wash the taste out.  For the next several nights, we simply sat down with her and put the Mavala on her fingernails, let her know that this was the nasty tasting stuff, and she hasn&#x27;t put her fingers in her mouth again!  Great product and THANK YOU!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good: It works- I accidentally put a very little amount(more like a little dot!) on my finger when I was paint this over my kids fingernails when they were sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, man- even that little dot tasted SOOOOOOOOOO bitter- that I shuddered like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:It&#x27;s super expensive- Holy molly.... why does it need to be this expensive? ? especially you don&#x27;t even need the whole bottle!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and another thing....&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, as soon as I put this on her fingernails, she stopped biting/sucking her fingernails for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;BUT- a little later, She started sucking on OTHER part of her hands.... like licking on the back of her hand, or sucking/biting on her knuckles or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, I can&#x27;t put this shiny nail-polish-looking thing on her knuckle or her whole back of her hand, can I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway-&lt;br /&gt;This product, itself is a great one! but I think it&#x27;s over priced.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews I chose this product to help my daughters get their digits out of their mouths. I had worked on them for months about being big girls and they let me put it on. I only had to apply it twice the first week and once a week later. WOW! I should have researched it sooner and not had years of pictures with hands attached to faces. Thanks, Mavala.&lt;br /&gt; As one reviewer noted, try to only put it on the nails or else it will get into their food. It doesn&#x27;t require much and could even come in a smaller size!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter since I was a child and never could stop, not even for my wedding. Yes before Acrylic Nails! Be careful to only paint the very very tips of your nails... a little gos a LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> This worked great on my 6 year old.  However, I did try it when she was younger (around 4) and it did not work!  I think it was easier when she was older and had the will to do it.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it claims to do. My six year old quit cold turkey.  One caveat though --  we let her decide when and one day she said, I guess you should order the nail polish.  She really had been trying to quit for months.  I wonder if the people who did not have a good experience were perhaps doing it before their children were ready.  I would highly recommend this to any family whose child wants to stop.  My child would too! She is really proud of herself and we are really impressed by the product.  One more suggestion:  pick your time carefully.  She was pretty emotional for a while - like someone quitting any bad habit that had comforted them. I would not try it before a vacation or an important family event.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great,  it will last all day when I put it on my daughters fingers in the morning.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I&#x27;d read numerous reviews as to its effectiveness so I was confident that it would work for us.  Our daughter, nearing four years of age, has been a habitual finger-sucker (pinky and ring fingers together) ever since we weaned her off the pacifier at about 6 months.  I was expecting the use of Mavala Stop to be an emotional battle that might take a week or so to win.  But, this stuff literally worked OVERNIGHT!  After perhaps a couple of brief fusses following attempts to put her fingers in her mouth, she was trained.  Two days later we applied it once more just to be safe, but I don&#x27;t think she ever tried again.  This stuff is nothing short of miraculous!</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes DISGUSTING which is exactly what I want, because it has helped me grow out my fingernails like crazy!</li>
            <li> ***update - this works a mircle for stopping our cat from chewing on electrical cords! We only used it for a few days with our daughter and we could have stopped at one day - she never puts her hands near her mouth anymore!. So, we hung onto it but our son never sucked his thumb so we didn&#x27;t have to use it for him. Now we have this cat... I only wish I&#x27;d tried this before having to replace a cell phone charger and my snakelight. Live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this product as a last resort for our three year old daughter. She sucked her thumb so hard that one of her front teeth was moving noticeably forward. After having tried behavior modification/positive reinforcement techniques we decided to use Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;We asked our daughter if she would like to have some help to stop sucking her thumb, and she said yes, so we introduced her to this product and allowed her to hold the box and instruction pamphlet while I first painted some on my own thumbnail and then hers. We used it after her evening routine, which I would NOT recommend. She cried (and drooled) for three hours and fidgeted all night long, so she did not get a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;It did, however, work wonders for her! We started treatment the night before last, and yesterday while driving home from a play date, I looked at her in the mirror of my car and she was fast asleep WITHOUT her thumb in her mouth!&lt;br /&gt;She is very proud of herself since her thumb is no longer constantly wet, and she feels that her \\&quot;boo boo thumb\\&quot; is getting better (there is a large ugly callus on her thumb and her thumbnail is layered and peeling).&lt;br /&gt;We are going to continue to use it for two weeks, as recommended by our daughter&#x27;s dentist. So far, the results are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter - did the trick!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband to stop biting his damn nails. This stuff is the only thing that works. Unfortunately, he keeps forgetting to put it on so he still hasn&#x27;t kicked the habit, but it&#x27;s not too glossy for him to wear. In fact, no one notices it at all. I highly recommend this for adults!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is 2 years and 9 months old he has a bad habit of thumb sucking while watching tv and when falling asleep so much so that i notice an overbite starting to form- i used Mavala Stop it has been 24 hrs he has learned not to put his thumb in the mouth--- first few hrs were filled with tears and mommy giving him OJ to wash away the taste but now i can say he has not had any such outbursts today ---NO MORE THUMB at least so far :)</li>
            <li> This is really amazing, my kid stopped thumb sucking within 1 week and he is no more doing that and also he stopped nail biting.</li>
            <li> I never thought that my 6 year-old would stop sucking her thumb.  Mavala STOP is a miracle.  Truly.  It really works, plus it&#x27;s made in Switzerland and is safe for kids.  The reason it works is that it is non-water soluble and so stays on for about 2 days, and the taste is unbelievably bitter and foul.  The bad taste in fact lingers in your mouth for hours. So my daughter essentially had a Pavlovian response to the bad taste. She put her thumb in her mouth by accident once (at night) - and almost gagged because of the bad taste - and she never stuck it in again.  However, they recommend continuing to apply the product for 30 days, which I agree with.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> We used this on our 2 1/2 year old for thumb sucking.  It was hard because the bad taste made her not want to swallow, so she was a drooling mess.  But after 6 hours, she remembered to stop trying to suck her thumb, and she hasn&#x27;t sucked since.  I re-applied a couple more times to be sure, but now it&#x27;s been a couple weeks since the last application and she still doesn&#x27;t suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had to do this because her one front tooth was starting to look funny, and it&#x27;s already looking almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> This does the trick.  My daughter stopped sucking her thumb right away, especially at night when we had the hardest time with it.  She picked it back up as soon as we stopped using it, but that&#x27;s just her.  As soon as it goes on, she won&#x27;t stick her thumb in her mouth for anything.</li>
            <li> My son is a finger sucker.  I wouldn&#x27;t care so much if he&#x27;d keep it in the privacy of home...  but he&#x27;s 6 now, he does it in school, the other kids tease him - so it&#x27;s time to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried Thum.  Thum doesn&#x27;t last long at all - and it doesn&#x27;t even taste that bad.  Spicy, but with all the Thai food I ate when I was pregnant with my him, really, spicy probably doesn&#x27;t phase him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then someone on a parenting board I read mentioned this and we bought some.  Good God.  This stuff is FOUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were sitting downstairs playing video games and my son stuck his fingers in his mouth, then ran upstairs to get a drink of juice to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some on my own thumb, to see how bad it is.  It&#x27;s bad.  And after washing dishes twice and washing my hands I don&#x27;t know how many times, yuck, still bad!  And it&#x27;s BAD, bitter, nasty, not just spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got high hopes for this.  We just started using it today but if any sort of flavored deterrant is going to do it, this stuff will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost afraid it&#x27;s TOO nasty...  You don&#x27;t realize how much you inadvertantly stick your fingers in your mouth till there&#x27;s something like this on them.  I did it a couple times during dinner.  Yuck!  It&#x27;s really, really nasty!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossing my fingers - so far I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/25/10 - updating to say he totally kicked his habit in a very short time.  I would reccomend this to anyone with a finger/thumb sucking/buting habit.  Money very well spent!!!</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth. To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers. The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth.  The next night, I found her sucking those fingers. The third night, after my daughter&#x27;s bath, I coated her fingers again.  Before the Mavala had even dried, she was licking her fingers like they were popsicles! So, it may be a great product for successful results with other customers, but Mavala Stop is not for us.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 1/2 and has been sucking her thumb and index fingers including their knuckles since she was 3 months old. She did so mostly when she was trying to relax, ie. at night, watching television, in the car. And, because she had such a large area of her hand in her mouth, it caused some serious pallette issues. When asked if she was ready to stop sucking her fingers, she would reply in the negative, so I didn&#x27;t think she was ready for the product... Well, I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel a bit guilty the evening I put it on her two fingers and then throughout the night as I heard little wimpers from her bedroom. However, she completely stopped sucking her fingers in one day. She remembered the horrible taste and said she was done. It has been two months now, and she really is cured. Amazing. My husband and I still can&#x27;t believe that she no longer sucks her fingers. We just wish we would have found this product sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon and Mavala! I am recommending this product to all of my personal friends, too.</li>
            <li> Mavala works - but, takes awhile to work.  Not too happy about the shippng charges - costs more than the actual product.  But, I couldn&#x27;t find it in a store near me.</li>
            <li> Everyone told me that my 3 year old son would stop sucking his thumb when he was ready and that it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  Being that my son is in daycare and around other children I was concerned about him picking up germs by always sucking his thumb.  I put the product on his thumb while he was sleep and in the middle of the night he screamed out that his mouth tested bad.  I felt horrible that I had taken his comfort away from him.  He told me that someone put something bad on his thumb and I told him it was medicine so he didn&#x27;t have to suck his thumb anymore.  My son no longer sucks his thumb and it worked right away!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My five year old had a bad habit of sucking his thumb. My husband and I had tried everything we could to get him to stop. You name it, we tried it. In desperation I bought this product. That night we snuck in to his room and applied it to his thumb. In the middle of the night, we could hear him gagging and crying. In the morning, he told us that his thumb tasted like oil. That day, he tried everything to take it of off his thumb. He must of washed his hand 20 times. Nothing worked. It took two week and our son is completely broken of his habit. I would recomend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t get their child to stop sucking there thumb.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old daughter quit sucking her thumb in just a few days after someone recommended this product to me.  We still put it on for a while afterward, because she would wake up with her thumb in her mouth and be very distressed.  She really wanted to stop, and was proud of herself!  I&#x27;ve loaned it out to several friends, who&#x27;ve also had success with it.</li>
            <li> We tried this on our 3-year old and the first 2 days he did not like it at all and stopped sucking his fingers. After the second day, however, he went right back to sucking like there was nothing on his fingers. One week after, we are still putting the Mavala on his fingers but he is still sucking away. Any suggestions on other products?</li>
            <li> i thought this might worked for my 10 month old because she has eczema and sucks her thumb, which sucking her thumb doesn&#x27;t make it easier. she just makes her skin raw and her thumb looks like its going to bleed. but i just wanted to try it and see if it might helped somewhat. but it didn&#x27;t i guess the little ones are to young to care about the taste to even stop sucking. my husband tried it on his thumb to see if it worked lol, which it did. he forgot he had it on and he washed his hands several times and he could still taste it. but i guess my daughter didn&#x27;t really care for the taste as long as she could suck her thumb. maybe if she was older like 3 years old i would try it again, hopefully she wont need it. but they should really state that is for children 3 and up because it didnt say on the site for what age.</li>
            <li> We thought we had tried everything to help my five year old to stop sucking his thumb.  He was getting really discouraged that he kept failing with everything he tried.  It was a really hard habit for him to break. His teeth have gotten really bad and he has been getting horrible canker sores in his mouth. So finally we made an appointment to have an appliance placed in his mouth.  The dentist couldn&#x27;t get us in for four months so I scheduled the appointment but decided to check the internet one last time.  We have tried other paint on products but he just sucked them off so I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful, but this product got good reviews so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it has worked like a charm.  It is really nasty so sucking it off hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  He has also tried washing it off but that doesn&#x27;t work either.  It hasn&#x27;t been easy for him.  Sometimes he is so proud of himself for going five days without sucking and then other times he gets really frustrated.  Once when he had had a hard day at school and wanted to suck his thumb to relieve the stress he cried and exclaimed \\&quot;The worst day of my life was the day that stuff came in the mail.\\&quot;  It is a bit heartbreaking to watch him struggle, but I think in the long run it is for the best.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will take before he stops wishing he could suck his thumb, but I have to say this is a very effective product.  It saved us $275.00 in dental fees.  I would definately give this a try if a gentler approach doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say.  This product is amazing.  I have been biting my nails for 28 years and finally a product that has stopped me.  Thanks so much and May God Bless You!!!</li>
            <li> My four year old was biting her nails so badly that she got infections and the ends of her fingers were always sore. She even started asking me to put bandaids on them frequently. It tastes AWFUL and stays in you mouth for awhile. It only took a couple of days and she quit. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Right now I am looking for a nail-biting-deterrent polish.  This polish seems to have high reviews but I would beware of this product. The product contains Methyl alcohol, which is highly toxic! (even in small portions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not Look at the ingredients! It definitely does not seem suitable for young children with developing brains!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment away if you have some expertise to add to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be a consumer advocate!</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son&#x27;s dentist recommended this product to get him to quit sucking his thumb.  You apply it like nail polish every other day until the habit is broken.  It took about a week for him to quit...we were very impressed.  It tastes TERRIBLE and doesn&#x27;t wash off! LOL</li>
            <li> trust me this works real good. I tried and probably wouldnt recommend this  for young kids because i almost gag.</li>
            <li> MY daughter is almost 6 years old and we have had SUCH a hard time trying to get her to stop sucking her thumb. I finally ordered this and after the first time i put it on her thumb, she hasn&#x27;t sucked it since! not even once! She has no desire! Even after the taste wore off, she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb! What a great product! It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son bit all 10 of his finger nails to the point of bleeding for the last 7 years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and methods to no avail.  He was very motivated to stop biting fingers because he was starting to notice the social stigma and of course, his fingers hurt!  So, after a dicussion of how putting this MAVALA product on his fingers was just a reminder, not punishment, he agreed to give it a try.  The first day, he had to brush his teeth 5 times because he bit his fingers forgetfully.  The next day, and now almost 3 months later, he hadn&#x27;t bitten his fingers once.  We reward him for each time we clip all 10 of his finger nails to reinforce the good habit of not biting fingers.  Just to be on the safe side, he is still applying the product on his nails every week, and we encourage that so he won&#x27;t slip back to his bad habits.  After all, he bit his fingers for most of his life!</li>
            <li> This product worked on my wife(nail biter for over 20 years)and my 4  year old daughter , even my 6 year old son stopped sucking their thumbs. My 3 year old son unfortunately would suck his thumb even if I wel i dont know what will stop him. I will try Mavala again in a few months mabe it will stop him then 8).</li>
            <li> Mavala works like a magic. We saw results in 1 day. but as the product description says it will not work till the kid reaches ~3yrs old.</li>
            <li> This stuff is bitter and I mean bitter.  Our oldest daughter has a bad habit of sucking on her fingers.  We have talked to her and she has agreed to try this stuff to help her, it works well.  I will say this though it has to be put on every night it will wash off in the bath or shower, but it tends to stay on all day.  Now if only we were able to keep her from spitting when she puts her fingers in her mouth out of habit lol.</li>
            <li> Okay the day that i got it and i open it up it smelled like nail remover and then i said \\&quot;this to work\\&quot; then went to bit my nail and tasted bad like really bad it was like the bad favor spread all around my tongue its really bad.And it works trust your never goin to bite your nail/thumps again.</li>
            <li> My son had been biting his nails for almost 3 years (he just turned 7). We had tried several different behavioral techniques to try and get him to stop, but nothing worked. A friend of ours told us about this product so figured we&#x27;d give it a try. WOW!!! Within 2 weeks he had completely stopped biting his nails! I actually got to cut them again! He said that the bitter taste of the product was too much for him to handle. One unfortunate side effect was that it made his eating finger foods like chips and mozarella sticks, etc tough for him because he could still faintly taste the product on his food. But that was a small price to pay for a short period of time. We used it for 4 weeks total and he&#x27;s been off the product now for 6 weeks and still not biting. This worked wonders for us!</li>
            <li> Our almost-seven-year-old daughter was still thumbsucking almost every evening and at bedtime.  (She knows better than to do so at school).  We gave her fair warning that this product was coming, and when it arrived (about 6 weeks ago) we let her apply it onto her own thumb.  Apparently she was \\&quot;ready\\&quot; to give up the thumb, becuase we haven&#x27;t had a problem since then.  She re-applies it as needed at bedtime, and surprisingly she hasn&#x27;t complained much at all.  She does report that sometimes she accidentally gets a taste of this stuff while eating a sandwich or some other finger food, but it&#x27;s not often, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected her appetite.  I&#x27;m optimistic that we can stop using it altogether pretty soon.</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty well for my 5 yr old son, although I think pool water (chlorine or something) makes it come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure, today, that he knocked it off the kitchen counter on purpose.  After cleaning it up, I have had the horrible stuff on my hands.  You have NO IDEA how many times your hands touch your mouth, or touch something that goes in your mouth.  Wow.  It is horrible tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him not to worry, I&#x27;d be ordering more, TODAY!</li>
            <li> This broke my habit. I now have nice nails and when I catch myself with my hands in my mouth I stop. I still carry it with me, because bad habits die hard, but after the initial 3 weeks, I haven&#x27;t had to use it. I feel proud to shake hands now. It&#x27;s worth noting though that my friend tried it and the taste did not deter him from biting his nails, so this may not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> We bought for our 5 year old son to help him to stop sucking his thumb and biting his nails...it didn&#x27;t work for us. He was sucking his thumb and biting his nails as before.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb. I heard about Mavala and decided to try it.  I was amazed at how effective this product was.  The taste was so bad that she stopped sucking right away and it only took about 2 full days for her to stop completly. Boy am I glad I got Mavala!</li>
            <li> It helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb in one week.  She was four years old and been sucking her thumb as long as I can remember.  I made a deal with her that I would get her a pink nail polish (the ones for kids) if she would wear this for a week.  She loved it on first day because it looked like nail polish and made her nail shiny.  On second day, she hated and wanted me to take it off but I reminded her about the pink nail polish. After few more reminders and encouragements, she was able to forget about thumb sucking within a week.</li>
            <li> My son quit biting his nails the moment this shipped from Amazon so I had to find another use. Turns out he really likes to pick his nose, like a lot, like if we pumped his stomach it would look like that slime stuff Nickelodeon. Let&#x27;s me completely honest, dumping slime of someone was just an opportunity for show producers to have a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; friendly wet t-shirt contest, but that&#x27;s not my point. My point is that I tried this for his nose picking issue. I put it on his index finger and that would eventually end up in his nose. Didn&#x27;t work for that application and now I fear for my sons safety.</li>
            <li> First off, let me give my complaint - there is way too much of this stuff. Why? Because you only have to apply it two or three times then you&#x27;re done. I put this on my 2 year old who liked to suck two fingers. I first did it in his sleep so I wouldn&#x27;t have to fight with him. Poor guy woke up crying after sticking his fingers in his mouth! Second day we put in on with him watching. It was interesting to see him go to stick his fingers in his mouth out of habit, stop, look at them and say \\&quot;Gross on fingers.\\&quot; Day 3 he asked me to put it on for him. Weird. Anyway, the habit is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews i&#x27;ve read; is the reason I bought this. As a nail biter all my life so far this stuff works (as long as you put it on). It tastes so bad and that bad taste stay in your mouth way too long, you eventually stop.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a thumb sucker till we used Mavala Stop. She is 4 yrs old. I would apply Mavala to her thumbs at night while she was sleeping. She kept saying that her thumbs didn&#x27;t taste good anymore. I never shared with her that I was applying the product. Within 4 days she had completely stopped sucking her thumbs. We loved this product!!! It has been a month now and I haven&#x27;t used the product in about two weeks and she still does not try to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> OMG! As a dentist, especially a Pediatric Dentist, you dream of helping every child not suck their thumb or bite their fingernails. Well it has come true. I am so thankful for this product! My own son was a nailbiter and from the moment I put it on he would not go near his mouth. The habit was broken immediately. Me and all my patients thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product! My daughter is 6yrs. old, have been biting her nails. When she tried this product for a few days, she just stopped. This is awesome!</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dentist recommended this product in hopes we can get her to stop sucking her thumb, and even if I do not apply it every night, i have noticed that she has infact stopped.</li>
            <li> This helped two people in the family stop biting their nails and is still being used. i love this polish and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> We purchased multiple items hoping to rid our 4 year old of her thumb sucking habit. This worked immediately. Within 3 days her habit was broken. I only applied this product a few times and she no longer needs the &amp;#34;reminder&amp;#34; not to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> This was my second bottle.  First bottle worked great for me for not biting my fingernails. However, didn&#x27;t work very well for my 6 yr old to stop sucking her thumb.  Put it on 2 times and both times we stayed up all night because she couldn&#x27;t sleep without her thumb.  Additionally, the second bottle was not nearly as strong a taste as the first bottle.  Actually, the taste of the second bottle was not a deterrent at all.</li>
            <li> Just received this today. Hopefully it works out well. I will update my review after some time of using this.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding! We tried everything possible to help our preschooler stop thumb sucking. Nothing worked.  We heard of a product called Thum. It&#x27;s applied on the finger nail and deters thumb sucking. Do not buy Thum. It is incredibly mild and had no impact on breaking my childs habit.  Its made with Cayenne pepper and actually tastes good! Mavala Stop is applied the same way as Thum, however it literally stopped our child&#x27;s thumb sucking habit on the spot. It the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and I can only imagine how bad it tastes for our kid. Just to be sure the habit was gone, we applied a new coat every two or three days for about a month.  Buy this product if you have a toddler or preschooler with a thumb sucking problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 7 and 4 year old children. Both kids are nail biters and despite my best efforts to get them to stop, nothing worked. That is, until I bought this nail polish. After the first application it began its magic and after only a week of applying it (and that&#x27;s only been two applications because you paint it on once every two days) the nail biting is all but gone. I have to tell you, I tried it myself and the taste is absolutely terrible. It goes in mild but after a second it is repulsive and depending on how long the finger was in your mouth it tends to stay with you. A drink of water and washing the lips gets rid of the taste though, but I have to admit, it is a powerful deterrent--and no amount of hand washing gets rid of it on the fingers! My kids actually came close to vomiting because the taste was so terrible. The only downside comes when eating, especially with my 4 year old because her fingers sometimes go into her mouth by accident. You could count that as a positive though if you are picky about table manners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids fingers were in very bad shape before using this polish making them self conscious and ashamed to have others look at them. Now the nails are actually starting to grow and the ragged appearance is starting to go away. They are now proud to show off their shiny nails and that is worth much more to me than any price this polish could possibly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to go ahead and get this polish if your own kids need help with nail biting or thumb sucking and are at an age to appreciate the help. I&#x27;ve told mine that the polish is there to help make their nails all better and they love getting their \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; to make their nails shiny. This stuff works and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My daughter told her father about this and it has done wonders to make him stop biting his nails.  He likes it so much that he bought some and gave to a person in our neighborhood.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and it worked like a charm. the other reviews were correct in indicating you only need a tiny drop for it to work as it is very strong. I&#x27;m so happy the thumb sucking is finally over.</li>
            <li> It certainly tastes terrible and it certainly discouraged me from biting my nails. However, I wound up tasting it ALL THE TIME -- anytime my fingers came in contact with my mouth, during routine activities like flossing or eating finger foods. The taste is extremely bitter and unpleasant, and quite long-lasting, so if I made the mistake of trying to pick a piece of food from my teeth or something, I&#x27;d pay for it for a while. It also seems to be transferable -- that is, if I touch my lip, my lip will keep the offensive taste long afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it works, and maybe if purchased for children who need a stronger deterrent, it&#x27;s the right product. For myself, if I ever needed to buy another bottle (hopefully not) I might look for something that provides a less intense reminder to not bite my nails. The price of the taste is somewhat overkill when all I need to a little slap on the wrist.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son has been sucking his thumb for as long as I can remember. My husband and I have tried everything but with no success. We used Mavala Stop 2 weeks ago and he hasn&#x27;t sucked on his thumb since. You should give this product a try. My husband would also bite onhis finger nails from time to time while @ work and decided to give it a try as well. He has stopped as well! Go Mavaala</li>
            <li> My daughter is 15 months old and stopped thumb sucking after using this mavala stop.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son was chewing his nails when he went to bed every night out of boredom for a year and this stopped him doing it in 4 days.  It was amazing and worked perfectly for us.</li>
            <li> Painted this product onto my 3yo son&#x27;s thumb and he never even flinched!  Seriously, did not make Any difference what-so-ever in his thumb sucking.  Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 year old son started sucking on his finger after we took his binky away around 2. We put this on his finger ONE time and he hasnt sucked his finger ever since.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old son has been bitting his nails for about 2 years.  This summer, i applied this &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; and in a couple of days he broke the habit.  I still apply once in a while once he forgets.  His fingernails are looking much nicer.</li>
            <li> Okay so i ordered this product hoping it would help my 2yr old and 4yr old with sucking there thumbs and bitting her nails so very disappointed because my 2yr has gotten used to the taste and now she still sucks her thumb i don&#x27;t know what to do. the first day it worked great and after that it was over just simply hopeless i guess.</li>
            <li> Well, this product was effective on our 4-year-old son.  We only applied it twice.  Unfortunately, it made his fingertips peel all the way down to his first knuckles!  Once we stopped using it, the fingertips healed up just fine.  Don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction, or if he just has a sensitivity to the chemical, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on small children with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because my kids have voiced out how &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; it tastes and that they&#x27;ll have to remember not to get their fingers anywhere near their mouthes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have the desire to quit munching on their fingernails and an aid such as Mavala helps as a deterrent.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for all three of my kids to stop nail biting - My 13 year old has pretty nails for the first time since we can&#x27;t remember when!  It only took about two days - and now we&#x27;re just using STOP! every once in a while to make sure to keep the habit gone!  Worked when nothing else had.  Also helped make sure that thumb sucking was DONE in my 5 year old.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon before, but feel that if you have a child who can&#x27;t stop sucking his/her thumb: read this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My six year old daughter sucked her thumb very often.  She could not be stopped: in the car, watching t.v., at bedtime.  Basically, if she wasn&#x27;t talking or using her hands, her thumb was in her mouth.  We tried bribery, we tried a band aid, we tried a glove.  Then I brought a product called Thum that I saw at the drugstore.  This is also painted onto the fingernail.  She could wash it off (and did so at school) and it faded quickly so the spicy cayenne pepper taste would lessen and she could tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ready to order a hypnosis CD to assist with breaking the habit, via Amazon, when I found a link to Mavala.  I read a handful of  reviews and besides one unhappy parent.  It seemed this might be the product that worked.  My dentist said once her permanent teeth started coming in she would need to cease the sucking.  We had considered having a retainer-like instrument put in her mouth that blocks the thumb from fitting in, though my dentist even described it as \\&quot;cruel\\&quot; and \\&quot;a last resort\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product to my daughter&#x27;s thumb and she struggled emotionally when she realized, after tasting it, that she could no longer suck.  A few tantrums occurred which we assist her through by distracting her with book reading, a bubble bath and lots of love and encouragement.  She insisted that she couldn&#x27;t have her blanket because it gave her the desire to suck even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste: I touched my tongue to her nail and the taste is truly awful, a sour acidic chemical taste that dulls the tip of the tongue and then the taste shoots down both sides of the tongue.  It lingers for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of another reviewer and kept a glass of water by her bedside,  When she would unconsciously suck her thumb while sleeping the putrid taste would wake her up and she would drink the water and fall back to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is day 6 and my daughter is doing fantastic.  She doesn&#x27;t like to talk about it, but her confidence is visible and my husband and I are overjoyed! I know first hand the difficulties thumb sucking can cause, I sucked my thumb until I was 12, so the desire I know, is strong.  I went through braces, neck gear and needed to be re-taught how to swallow properly via a speech therapist.  Try this product!

            <li> Effective while on the nails, I found myself reapplying to my 4 year old&#x27;s fingers nightly.  The directions indicate to reapply every 48 hours, but I would catch my little guy sucking the second night if I didn&#x27;t reapply.  Needing to remember to apply nightly is challenging.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hopeful that it would taste so yucky that my daughter would stop sucking! Super simple to apply it is just like nail polish. And it works!!!! I have licked it myself just to see how yucky it is and man it is a bitter taste that you would not want to lick over and over again! We have now been applying it for several weeks and of cource she still wants to suck her thumb but we put it on every night and will until the urge to suck is gone! I would hightly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have three daughters, all of whom suck their thumb/fingers.  Their ages are 7,6 &amp; 3 1/2.  We had tried everything, taping fingers with medical tape, taping on a mitten, paying money, offering to go to Sea World, offering to go to Target to buy a new toy, etc.  The older girls had stopped at one point for like 2 weeks, but all of the sudden started again and started doing it worse than they ever did before.  We bought this product about a month ago, two weeks later, bought a second bottle and we&#x27;ve been done with the finger sucking since day one!  Even the first night, the taste woke the girls up and they immediately took their thumb/fingers out of their mouths.  I even let the girls paint my nails, because I bite my finger nails.  It&#x27;s working!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, gf still bites her nails. Oh well!</li>
            <li> i had used the thum stuff and it did not work. so i looked for something else. i saw this had really good reviews on amazon so i figured i would give it a try.  it really worked right away! my 3 1/2 year old stopped sucking her thumb/fingers and hasn&#x27;t gone back.</li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 year old daughter still sucks her thumb at night and a recent bribing effort by her grandma failed to get her to stop sucking her thumb, so I decided to try something different.  I purchased this and, based on reading some other reviews, I carefully put it on the bottom portion of her thumb nail so she wouldn&#x27;t taste the icky taste if she ate food with her fingers.  I put it on while she was sleeping and the first time she tried to put her thumb in her mouth, she got a very strange look on her face.  She wouldn&#x27;t go back to sucking that thumb even after several days when I was sure it had worn off and I hadn&#x27;t reapplied it.  My husband is going to give it a shot because he bites his nails.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters thumb sucking. It worked for the first two weeks but after that she got used to the taste.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop was recommended by our daughter&#x27;s orthodontists.  It is amazing.  I have tried the thumb guards, Thum, and everything out there to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb.  Within two weeks of using Mavala Stop, she stopped completely!  It is a wonderful product and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  We have been thumb sucking free for two months and going strong!  I have been telling everyone who has a child that sucks there thumb or fingers to try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old son for his nail bitting habbit. We put the polish on 3 times a day but no effect. He kept bitting the nails and some times he even said \\&quot;yum-yum\\&quot;... Not working for him..</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker until age 6. Wish we would have bought this when he was 3! Thumb sucking has slightly changed the shape of his bite and teeth. Once applied he&#x27;s never put his thumb in his mouth again! Really like how it applies like a polish and stays on for a couple of days! Good Stuff, it broke his habit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chewed my nails down to nubs since I was little. This stuff is fantastic. I like that it doesn&#x27;t wash off (the two days it says stays on really does stay on!). My son (8) chews his cuticles and it has stopped him from ruining his skin. The taste is a cross between gasoline and puke and if you accidently put them in your mouth it leaves a 10 min aftertaste. Disgusting. It has been 3 weeks now and we have not chewed our nails. Watch out though. If you eat hot wings wear gloves! :)</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my 5yr old son. he started kindergarten and i thought that it was time for him to let it go!! he&#x27;s been sucking his fingers simce he was about 14 months, right after i had my 2nd son and took his binki away!! i used this product for 2-3 days and he had stopped!!! i mean completely stopped!!! even at night, on naps, and t.v. time(his fav.) i couldn&#x27;t be pleased. i applied it 2 times a day (b4 school and b4 bed) and by day 3 he had completely stopped..</li>
            <li> This product really works for toddlers. We had to apply it just twice to break the thumb sucking habit of our two year old (but we continued to apply it for a week to be sure). It could not have been simpler.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew this product before, it really worked. My 6 1/2 year old daughter used to suck her two right hand fingers all night and also in the day time. I was skeptical about trying this product but tried it after reading lots of good reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  I applied nail paint on her fingers and put a coat of mavala stop on top it. Before applying it on her fingers I tasted it and it was really yuck. On first night she tried to suck her fingers and she found out that it was too bitter and yucky, she even tried to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;  The product worked from day one and she never sucked her fingers again. Its been more then 2 weeks and looks like she gave up on sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Yes, it does taste and smell really bad but it does the job.  It has been the only thing that has stopped my three year old daughter from sucking her thumb.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to use this on my 3 year old and basically kept just telling her if she didn&#x27;t stop biting her nails off I&#x27;d put \\&quot;yucky stuff\\&quot; on them.  One day she said, ok, put it on.  I applied a little but at the cuticle every other day for a couple of days and she&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb or bitten her nails.  She&#x27;ll go to bite them, think about it and then say \\&quot;mommy I need the yucky stuff again.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My daughter had a seemingly unbreakable habit of biting her pointer finger nails.  It was so bad that we thought she might lose the nails.  The Mavala Stop did the trick!  Her nails have grown in and she is so proud of the way they look she hasn&#x27;t started to bite them again!</li>
            <li> bought sth else from Walgreen and it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Just one drop of Mavala, my daughter stopped sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> Worked extremely well, my granddaughter completly quit sucking her thumb. However, I will not get rid of the product to soon because this was her second try. The first time she we tried Mavala she stop sucking her thumb but we gave the bottle to a friend about a month after she quit. She started to suck her thumb again. We will keep the new bottle on hand for a lot longer this time.</li>
            <li> Well I can not think of a word to describe how thankful I am for this product. I have a 3 year old daughter that has sucked her thumb from the time she was a baby. About a year ago she started doing this thing where she sucked her thumb and when she would do it she would blow her nose, so therefore she was blowing snot out of her nose and then she would get it on her hands. Forever now her dad and I have been trying to get her to stop. Well I recieved this product on Friday night and I applied it to her thumb nail. I told her that if she sucked her thumb it was going to taste REALLY bad. She sat there watching tv for a while and didn&#x27;t do it. Then all of a sudden she sat up and got this really worried look on her face. Her dad said did you suck you thumb and she stuck her tounge out and said YUCK! DRINK DRINK!! The amazing thing is that she has not sucked her thumb from that point on and it has been 3 days now. She doesn&#x27;t even act like she thinks about it. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a thumb sucker. IT IS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been sucking her thumb since before she was born (sonogram picture proves it).  We&#x27;ve been trying to encourage her to break the habit since age 3 (just turned 5)because her speach was starting to be affected and her teeth were becoming bucked!!!! We followed the dentists&#x27; advise and bought an $80 thumb guard which she fought us everytime we put it on.  Although she stopped for a couple of days, she would start sucking her thumb again.  It&#x27;s been exhausting so I FINALLY ordered mavala stop and put it on her immediately.  It worked from day two...day one, she tried to suck her thumb but gagged a little and wanted to drink some water to get the taste out!  From that point on, she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb or cried!  I wish I had done this first, it would have saved alot of tears and money.  It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Really great for helping a child stop sucking his thumb.  You have to stay consistent and use it all the time.  But it is a great deterrant.  I say it works!</li>
            <li> We have been at our wits end to end a thumbsucking problem in a 6 year old.  We tried sticker charts, socked hands, scare tactics of terrible adult teeth, even popsicle sticks.  Nothing worked...until now.  I found this product quite by accident and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  From day 1, the thumbsucking stopped and now at day 9, there isn&#x27;t even a hint that they desire to suck their thumb.  This includes during the day when certain events would trigger it.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  I am amazed that more people don&#x27;t know about this.</li>
            <li> We saw the reviews and we weren&#x27;t getting anywhere trying to persuade our four year old daughter from sucking her middle two fingers (and causing her teeth to grow outwards), so we went ahead and ordered some! She knew she wasn&#x27;t supposed to suck her fingers and was ok with us putting this on her fingers - we just put a couple of small dabs since it is quite strong and bitter. It worked like magic, one taste and the fingers never went near her mouth again, and we didn&#x27;t even get any complaints about it. We saw her sucking her fingers about 3 or 4 days later and so we did a second application and since then (it&#x27;s been over a week now) I haven&#x27;t seen anything so can almost say she has been cured. This stuff is way more effective than anything else we have tried, and I highly recommend it. Better to do this than to spend thousands on orthodontists fees when your child is older!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I painted my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s nail when she was asleep. One night I painted 1 coat &amp; another night I painted 3.  Neither made a difference. I&#x27;m going to stop wasting my money and pay the orthodontist down the road.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and finally decided to buy it for my four old thumb sucker.  I applied the product on a Friday before school.  When I went to pick her up from preschool the teacher said that she had not seen her sucking her thumb all day.  I have not noticed her sucking her thumb since.  Thank you Mavala!  Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> My three year old is autistic and she has a huge problem biting her nails so I took a gander on these and decided to try them out.  I gave it a taste first and it reminded me of what finger nail polish would taste like but it was pretty bad.  My three year old at first didn&#x27;t like the taste but a day later she became immune to it and it had no effect.  I am sure this product would work for some people just not for me or my daughter.  Nail biting is a habit for me and I never noticed the taste since it was such a habit I didn&#x27;t think about when I did it.  I have found a new method in which I chew gum a lot but I can&#x27;t chew all the time so my system is flawed.</li>
            <li> Works great. But I do have to reapply every couple of days or my 4 year old starts sucking on his fingers again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my 4 year old daughter stop sucking her thumb.  I read all the rave reviews from people who used the product but still had my doubts. I applied the product to my daughters thumb nail before bed every other day.  I was amazed at how quickly and easily it worked.  Four years of habitual thumb sucking literally stopped in one day.  I have continued to apply the product regularly for the past few weeks just to be sure she does not relapse but have not seen her thumb in her mouth once since we started using it.  We also plan on using it with my younger daughter in the near future.  It is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> We purchased this after months and months of trying to get our 8 year old son to stop sucking his middle fingers. The first night, he stuck his fingers in his mouth and cried for about 30 minutes. He hasn&#x27;t stuck them in his mouth again in over a week. This stuff has a horrible taste but it works like a charm. We&#x27;ve only applied it once. I would recommend it to anyone with an older child. Not sure I would use it on a young child under 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> this product worked for the first 30 minutes then my daughter started sucking her thumb again, i am not sure if it was her age since she was three or that she is too stubborn i would advise the product not be used on children younger than seven or eight.</li>
            <li> i think this is a great product, but as others have said- if your kid is smart or stubborn, they&#x27;ll find a way around it. mine resisted for a couple of days, then shrugged his shoulders and said &amp;#34;i figured out i can just lick my sleeve to get rid of the taste, and still bite them&amp;#34;. brat! lol.</li>
            <li> My daughter stop sucking her thumb the moment I put it on and she would ask to paint her nails everyday so I would say it worked in an instant with only a minimum of discomfort she had completely stopped with compaining and all in 3 days. I have since stopped using the product and she has not started the habit back up again. I would recommend thus product 20 times over to any and everyone.</li>
            <li> Delivered in time, as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been a \\&quot;nail bitter\\&quot; for 30+ years now and I&#x27;m so ready to finally stop.  But bad habits are hard to break.  I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past, but they did not deter me.  I&#x27;ve been using this now for 4 weeks and it&#x27;s great.  The taste is bitter and it stays on your fingernails even after washing your hands over and over.  I usually remove it and reapply it every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my baby to stop taking breast milk. This was pediatrician&#x27;s suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;It just great. worked exactly what we expected. My son stopped completely after first use.</li>
            <li> The polish does have a nasty taste to it, but it peels off too easily. If you are busy doing alot of cleaning (washing clothes, dishes, etc) it will NOT stay on very good!!! It did not help me kick my old habit at all. Currently searching for something else...</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this product.  My 3 year old girl sucked her middle 2 fingers everyday when she was tired (going to bed, watching TV, etc).  At same time she would twirl her hair and cause terriable knots.  After using this prodcut 1 time, I repeat 1 time, she never sucked her fingers OR twirled her hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review before, but I feel this strongly about this product</li>
            <li> We tried other products (like Thum) to help our 3-year old daughter&lt;br /&gt;stop sucking her thumb but they were not strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;Mavala has a terrible, bitter taste and each application lasts for many&lt;br /&gt;days.  She does not want a thing to do with her thumb with Mavala on it and she has not sucked her thumb since we started using it (about 3 weeks ago)!</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son has (had) sucked his thumb since the age of 3 months. He started speech therapy this year, which he likely in part needed due to the thumb sucking. His speech therapist recommended this product to me. My son mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime, and during the night. The first night was hard, as he woke up every time he put his thumb in his mostly asleep mouth...crying from the bad taste. However, he either didn&#x27;t wake up the second night, or once. After that, no more thumb sucking. Even asleep. Its been close to 2 months now,and I only had to use this product  once. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product lasts at least 4-5 days, even through all that hand washing! Fast &amp; easy to apply. Tastes gross so my daughter wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near her mouth. Much better than the stuff in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> Okay after trying the hand deal for my 4yr son...he still sucked his thumb even worst, during the day, on the way to school, when he was said, &amp; just made him feel safe.  It was easy to pull it out of the hand brace to suck.  Now this stuff wow...&amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34;. My 4yr son Ethan cried and cried 1st evening I put it on both thumbs cause he was determined to suck the other one. It smelled bad &amp; I put essential oil peppermint on his nose so he&#x27;d smell that instead.  We are on day 2 and he still has not sucked his thumb because of this bad tasting stuff says, Ethan.  This stuff works!! I&#x27;m glad I tried it. I put a little on both thumbs every nap &amp; night sleep time!!</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old found out that if she scrapes the stuff off, she could still suck on her fingers. In the end, it had reduced the sucking tremendously and I only catch her every now and then when she is sleeping.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my 5 yr old.  We spoke prior to ordering the product and he agreed that it was time for him to stop.  After getting the product I asked him if he would like to apply it to his thumbs and he did.  It was all his idea just my suggestion.  I applied it every 2 days but had to switch to everyday because it did not last 2 days.  It has now been 3 weeks and has not sucked his thumbs and now have nails on his thumbs. Another good thing is that his appetite has increased significantly!  I have recommended it to several other people and will continue to do so. Love it!</li>
            <li> If Thumb-it didn&#x27;t work, Mavala Stop will.  The first day was a little rough on the kids and parents.  The kids walked around with a disgusted look on there face most of the time and there was spitting/drooling to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;By day 3 my daughter stopped eating with her hands and started using her fork again, an unexpected result since I bought the product to stop her nail biting (which it has).  It&lt;br /&gt;The stuff stays on the nails like nail polish.  Even after baths and swimming in the pool it stays put on the fingernails.  The instructions say to use fingernail polish remover to take it off.  Otherwise, it wears away on its own.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 17 year old daughter who has bitten her nails her whole life. Now she doesn&#x27;t bite her nails! It worked very quickly for her.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 yr old and this product broke his thumb sucking habit in to weeks. Actually, it probably took a week. He just did not like the bitter taste at all. The not on his thumb has heeled and his nails are growing now, because he use to bite his nails all the back. So this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This product has made it possible to break my 6 year old from sucking on his thumb. I have tried multiple products that claim to do so, but this is the only one that has actually worked.</li>
            <li> does the job. but I dont think it is no harm to human</li>
            <li> This stuff works! Our daughter would suck her thumb in the night- but not with this stuff! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I read the negative reviews about it being too strong, I thought, this is exactly what I need! We have been trying to get our now almost 7 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb for forever. We have seen so many negative things happening to our daughter (teeth being moved, marks on face from where she rests her nonsucking hand, etc), but it is hard for a little girl to understand that these long term affects are because she sucks her thumb. And it is especially hard to try to make her stop when she has no desire to stop. This is exactly what we needed to jump start her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night she was super upset and after putting her thumb in her mouth she said her tummy hurt and spit in a bowl for quite a while. She learned fast not to do that anymore!! It has almost been a month now, and I love to see her so excited about not sucking her thumb! She just needed something to help her to know that she could do it. Now she is excited that she is not sucking her thumb anymore. We will probably continue to use this for a long time because her habit has been for so long, but this bottle is really lasting long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this 10 stars if I could!!!!</li>
            <li> Tried everything to get my teenager to stop biting his nails. It had been a problem for TEN YEARS. Finally tried this after being recommended it by his dentist, and VOILA - it worked! I had tried similar products to no avail, but this finally worked!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she does both such her fingers and bite all her nails.  As soon as I got it yesterday (1/24/2011) I put it on all her fingers.  I warned her about the bitter taste if she puts her fingers in her mouth.  Later she came out of her room crying and I found out she put her fingers in her mouth and because it was so bad she started crying, since then she has not put her fingers in her mouth.  I bathed her today and reapplied.  so far so good.</li>
            <li> Helped my daughter quit smoking her thumb. An 8 yr habit was broken in less than a week! We had tried another brand with no success before.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 1/2 year old nail biter. I put a lot on her whole nail on all her fingers and made sure it dried, 10 minutes later she was biting her nails! My husband did taster it and said it was disgusting...maybe its just my daughter...</li>
            <li> I used this on my 8 year old daughter.  She sucks on her fingers when she is watching tv.  At first this product worked well and I thought I was on the road to success.  Unfortunately, after about 3 days, she returned to sucking her fingers.  I started applying the product on her nails every day, but it didn&#x27;t stop her.  She even sucked on her fingers, just a few minutes after a fresh coat of the product was applied.  So, for me this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great product but use careful when applying it, I used to much on my son this stuff is very strong...  I used it on my daughter who was biting her nails really bad I applied while she was sleeping and used it twice and noticed right from the first week that she was biting her nail less and less, after the 2nd used she quit biting them all together just yesterday i finally had to clipped her nails. I also used it for my 5 yr old he had the habit of sucking his thumb while sleeping, for him i applied while sleeping as well and he woke up in the middle of the night gagging and the after taste was really bad but after the first used and only used I did on him it work and he quit sucking his finger at night.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried it before i did on them so taste its pretty awful but it worked so be careful.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daugher has been chewing her nails off for months.  We put this on and it worked immediately.  She asked to go brush her teeth to get the taste out. Ever since, she&#x27;s not chewed her nails at all &amp; they&#x27;re finally growing back.</li>
            <li> really effective, stopped a life long bad habit! would use again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works! My son and husband have stopped biting their nails, a habit they have had since they both were toddlers! Warning-this will effect eating, do not eat with your fingers while using this product-bitter! But it works!!</li>
            <li> You defently won&#x27;t bite your nails anymore. I use this on my boyfriend that couldnt stop biting his nails. He has now stopped . I reccomend this to any body!</li>
            <li> Love it! I thought it would be hard to get my child to stop, but stop she did! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I have been biting my nails since I was a child and with Mavala Stop I have completely quit biting my nails. The only down side is if you eat something with your hands you will taste the bitter polish. But it is well worth it! I am excited about finally having nails!</li>
            <li> It worked for my son who bite his nail but i need to use it after each time he take shower</li>
            <li> this stuff works a little too well. if you accidentally get it on your lips, the horrid taste stays all day! it&#x27;s almost impossible to get rid of the taste bc its so potent. i tried it with my son so i would know what he is talking about (bc he complained about it so much). even when i was prepping food for dinner, it rubs off on everything!! i had to washing it off for fear it would get on my baby somehow.</li>
            <li> Mavala stops my 5 year old from biting his nails.  This is a great product. It stays on all day and the product has lasted months with daily use!</li>
            <li> We have been searching for something to get our 6 year old to stop sucking his thumb.  We tried many things that failed and were pretty frustrated and worried we never could help him stop.  I went to my sons parent teacher conference and found out he was sucking his thumb in class(he would do it and not even realize it) and Kids were asking the teacher about it I was so worried he would be made fun of so I rushed home and looked for something to help him stop fast.  I ordered Malva stop and from the very first day we put it on his thumb he never sucked his thumb again.  Honestly I can&#x27;t believe it but this stuff is amazing!  My son wanted to stop but it was so automatic for him he wouldn&#x27;t even know he was doing it, he would even put the mavala stop on his thumb every night and now 4 months later he is still has not sucked his thumb. It lasts on the thumb for quite a few days and the taste is so bitter! I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I knew I had to in case there is another parent out there wanting to help there child stop sucking there thumb.  This stuff will work, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MAVAlA STOP!!!!</li>
            <li> oI was very hopeful in the beginning when I first used this product on my 3 yr old. I was hoping my child did not fall into the category of what was warned on the box. When it was time to reapply, which was 2 days later the product was not as effective. I tried several more times, but no success.</li>
            <li> It stopped my 5 year old daughter from biting her nails immediately.  I only apply it every 3-4 days, but she remembers it&#x27;s there, and no problems.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything to get me 11 yr old (YES !!! he was still sucking his thumb at the age of 11) to stop sucking his thumb.  He kept telling me he had stopped, but sometimes when we were driving or watching TV on the couch, I would see him with his thumb in his mouth.  I had tried Thum, tape, gloves, punishments, rewards, you name it, I had tried it.  I was concerned about his teeth obviously, but I was also concerned that he was just picking up germs and putting them directly into his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product on the internet and decided to give it a go.  After all, we had tried everything else.  I ordered it on Tues Dec 7 with regular shipping and it arrived Thurs Dec 9. Fabulous!! We both put some on all of our nails.  In addition to the thumb sucking, my son had started chewing his nails and fingers.  I&#x27;m guessing as a subsitute for the thumb sucking when he was at school.  I told him I would do it too so we would be in this together.  Well, by the next day, he had stopped.  Not just the thumb sucking, but the finger chewing as well.  We&#x27;re going to visit family for the Christmas holiday.  This will be a pleasant surprise for Granny and Poppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that since I put the stuff on my fingers too I have to prepare our meals using gloves.  Compared to the prospect of potentially having a teenager who still sneaks and sucks his thumb, I can deal with the gloves for a few days.</li>
            <li> great product.  used it on my 4 year old since he sucked his thumb at night and he stopped sucking his thumb with this product.  highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had heard of this sooner.  My dentist recommended it for my 5 year old who was still sucking his thumb after intermittently starting and stopping on his own over the past year.  My son wants to stop, so he was actually excited about putting it on.  It lasts a couple days, and like someone else mentioned, I only put a tiny bit on his thumb - not the whole nail. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 yr old daughter would eat her fingers and toes! I applied this product and it took a few times for her taste this stuff and has completely stopped. Just remember to keep applying the product. Only cons of this product is if your toddler use their fingers to eat it will leave the nasty taste on their food and of course their mouth. Other than that, this worked great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old son.  The dentist told us that if he didn&#x27;t stop sucking his thumb by his next check up then he would have to use some metal contraption at night that would prick his thumb when he tried to put it in his mouth.  He would suck his thumb the entire night while he was sleeping.  This was a last resort after trying hot sauce, gloves at night, tape on his thumb, etc.  After a few days of using this product, he had completely stopped sucking his thumb.  This product is a blessing.  I only regret that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> We bought this product for our thumb-sucking daughter.  For one week, we put it on, and she refrained from sucking because of its taste.  The second week, the taste wasn&#x27;t there so she went back to thumb-sucking and is now a more obsessive thumb-sucker then before we used the product.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes that this product would work since my destist recommended it to me, however, this did not work for my 3 year old son, he have a very sirious thumb sucking habbit. i would put it on his nail while he was sleeping at night. The first morning when he woke up just told me his thumb taste bad then every other night when i put it on he would suck his thumb as usual and just got used to the horrible taste ,,im out of ideas now.</li>
            <li> My five year old was a die-hard thumb sucker and this little bottle helped her kick the habit. She was resistant at first, but we told her it was magic and would help her to remember not to suck her thumb so when she went to kindergarten they wouldn&#x27;t make fun of her.  We are on week three and she&#x27;s doing great.  She needs that sucking sensation to soothe herself to sleep, so she has resorted to sucking a little on her middle finger, but we are trying not to make a big deal of it.  We can&#x27;t expect her to go cold turkey after 5 years.  Anyway, I was skeptical, but this product is inexpensive and works great for my daughter.  She hates the taste and she&#x27;s kickin&#x27; the habit.</li>
            <li> this item really suited my need. it helped me a lot. thanks</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it actually taste bad,the concept is good but It didn&#x27;t work for me. My son said his fingers taste yucky but he was still biting his nails :(</li>
            <li> My 3 and a half year old started biting his nails.  We tried to make him stop by reminding him while he did it, but it did not work.  I got &#x27;Mavala Stop&#x27; and within 1 week he stopped.  It was amazing.  He did not like the taste at all.  I was very happy that it worked so fast so we did not have to apply for too long :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my son stop sucking his thumb from day 1.  I wish we would have bought this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Works like a miracle! My son still sucked his thumb at 5.5 years of age. I read the reviews describing vomiting and extensive crying caused by the terrible taste, so I used as little as I could on my son&#x27;s thumb nail - very close to the cuticle so that he wouldn&#x27;t lick it off when holding finger foods. I applied Mavala Stop when he was asleep. He woke up 2 or 3 times in the middle of the night because he licked the nail and was disgusted - but didn&#x27;t cry. He became very careful not to put his thumb in the mouth. He forgot few times during the following day but that was it. He never sucked his thumb again!</li>
            <li> This is the only polish that actually works for my 9 year old daughter.  No matter what I put on her nails I would still see her fingers in her mouth--but not anymore!!!  And she agrees that it works.  A few words of caution from her: is that she doesn&#x27;t like to eat certain foods anymore like any foods that are normally eaten with her figers (like chicken nuggets, french fries, etc). With her words of caution my only concern is that I don&#x27;t know what she is eating when she is in school!</li>
            <li> It could be that my son has a severe thumb sucking problem.  I tried the stuff and it really is horrible!  Every time I made the mistake of brushing my lips against my fingers, I had this very bitter aftertaste.  However, my son grimaced for the first little while, then went right on sucking.  He would suck at daycare and at night!  He was so committed and persistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we decided that we needed something more potent - the thumb guard.  We shuddered as we shoveled out the $80.  We hope to receive it in a day or two and will review it shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with children who have a severe thumb sucking problem, I do not recommend this product.  However, it may be worth the $10 or so before you upgrade to a more costly option like the thumb guard.  For those of you whose children have a problem that mainly just annoys you, then this should knock it right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nasty for sure.  It does not work for committed thumb sucking children.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever to stop your little one from sucking their thumb! I have tried so many things to stop my daughter from sucking her thumb (thumb guards, mouth retainer, etc.) this was the only product that finally worked.  At five years old, my daughter stopped sucking her thumb within two weeks using Mavala. The polish lasts on the fingernail for at least 3 days before needing a touch up.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for us, our 4 year old daughter sucked her finger at bed time only but even that is enough to cause damage to teeth. we talked about it with her dentist and she wanted to stop wanted to stop but needed a little help and this product worked great for her. there are other products out there that cover the finger with plastic and other materials but they cost a lot more and seem quite cumbersome. The kids that suck their finger all day long might need all day encouragement to stop and with this product they would get it to with out giving away their dexterity or finger use. We would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my 4 year old son stop sucking his thumb. I had previously bought some thumbsucking gloves, but he was able to take them off. I tried the polish on my thumbnail first, just to test it. Yuck! It has a very bitter, unpleasant taste, though it wasn&#x27;t bad enough to make me want to vomit. I just had to be careful not to touch any food with that thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t nearly so effective on my son. He was perfectly willing to let me paint it on every night, and every morning I saw that the polish was missing from his right thumbnail. He was very proud to tell me that he thought that the polish &amp;#34;tastes like food&amp;#34; and he was sucking his thumb anyway. I was shocked - I mean, it tasted terrible to me. So I asked him to lick his painted thumbnail and tell me how it tasted, and he did and repeated that it tasted good, like food. (This is a child who loves strong olives, spicy food, and pickles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the polish helped prevent him from most of the daytime thumbsucking, and for that I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. And there is a disclaimer on the box that says that young children may have undeveloped taste buds and not find the taste unpleasant. Which is obviously the case here. For someone who actually thought it tasted bad, I think this polish would work well.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old.. I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.  I have tried many many times to stop.  Mostly, it was trying to do it \\&quot;cold turkey,\\&quot; but that never worked.  I would also paint my nails pretty colors, get acrylics, etc.. all would revert back to me biting at my nails.  Not to mention, painting little stubs is NOT that attractive to begin with.  So, I gave in and bought this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now only two weeks after I started applying this to my nails.  The taste is HORRIBLE.  Oh my lord.. I hate to say it, but I am SO happy it is!  You will cringe at the thought of placing your fingers remotely close to your mouth.  The taste will remain very potent on your nails for about three days.  It is a nice clear coat of nail polish, so it doesn&#x27;t look bad on your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now no longer get the urge to bite my nails.  I went out and bought brand new nail polish to celebrate!  I can&#x27;t wait for another two weeks to where my nails will be nice and LONG!  I also have plenty more in the bottle jusssst in case I feel I may be getting an urge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product completely!!  Anyone who is fed up with biting their nails to an oblivion will be pleasantly suprised!  Trust me, I thought I was a lost cause!</li>
            <li> My 4 y/o was a constant biter/chewer. He&#x27;d gnaw his little fingers to the bone and chew the pads of his fingers as well. We used the Mavala for about 3 weeks and he hasn&#x27;t TOUCHED his fingers once! He has the most sweet little hands again because of Mavala. He&#x27;s so proud he show everyone his fingers. ;-)  Highly recommend this product. I have to admit it was a tad skeptical at first as we&#x27;ve tried several other products/methods to get him to stop biting. But this has been the ONLY product that has actually worked. THANK YOU!!!I</li>
            <li> This product works perfect! My daughter has stopped biting her nails and they are growing out nicely!</li>
            <li> Got this to stop my son&#x27;s thumb sucking.  It smells strongly of nail polish when applies, and should last two days.  He agrees that it tastes awful, but it wears off so fast that it hasn&#x27;t really stopped him.</li>
            <li> It was tough for the first few days (maybe the first week) because they woke up crying in the middle of the night but eventually both of my girls (6 1/2 and 3 years old) stopped sucking their thumbs.  Be sure to re-apply it every couple of days because it looses some of its awful taste after a few washes.  Highly recommend.  We tried several more expensive methods that did not work.  They can&#x27;t take the nail polish off (except for the brave daughter of another reviewer that sucked up the bad taste and washed it away with water).</li>
            <li> After a lot of frustration about dissuading our 3.5 yrs old from thumb sucking, we are so happy to found this product. Results were almost miraculous. He attempted to put his thumb in his mouth a couple of times the first day we applied the product. He was so disgusted, he tried to rub out his tounge on the carpet. Since then, he has not sucked his thumb. Its been ten days, we will continue with the product for couple more weeks. AS PER THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE, THIS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OLD.</li>
            <li> Did not stop my son from biting his nails, since he was 3. Now 6 years old and still bites his nails. I polish his nails while he sleeps so when he wakes up and goes to school it would be on his nails. Does no good. I notice he bites them in the car while driving home. This was of no help for me.</li>
            <li> This worked wonders for us! We used it for 2-3 weeks on our 3 year old son to kick the thumb sucking habit since it was starting to affect his teeth. I had tried just taking his thumb out of his mouth but he thought it was funny and a game. I didn&#x27;t want to use a bitter nail polish but finally caved in when my method wasn&#x27;t working. I&#x27;m glad I did! He has completely stopped sucking his thumb! This stuff absolutely works! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. It was recommended by my pediatric dentist for my 3 year old daughter to help her stop sucking her fingers. Initially I thought it was successful. It tastes horrible, and she didn&#x27;t want anything to do with it. However, now she has learned she can get past the initial bad taste, and suck the product off. Since it&#x27;s full of chemicals, and that means she&#x27;s ingesting those chemicals. I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb until I started using this product used all other items bought from amazon but this is the only that worked the best, my daughter cant stand this taste</li>
            <li> I never received this item. I sent an email to the seller asking about it, and I never even received a reply. So obviously I am very unhappy with this order and would not suggest anyone else order it.</li>
            <li> My 3yr old son has been sucking his finger since he was a baby and it was really begining to mess up his teeth. I had seen some VERY expensive finger gaurds to prevent thumb/finger sucking but I didn&#x27;t want something embarrassing or uncomfortable for him. Then I saw this Mavala stop for a few dollars so decided to give it a try. Just like that my sons habit is gone. This was an all day everyday habit for him. I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a side note I tell my son that the bad taste is a reminder that he is a big kid now. Not punishment. That made him more cooperative.</li>
            <li> I purchased this is a last ditch effort to get my then 13mth old son to stop sucking his two fingers.  He had sucked them to the point of being literally raw and blistering. We&#x27;d tried just about everything else we could think of before turning to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day it arrived in the mail I immediately pulled it out of the box, pulled my son onto my lap and proceeded to paint those two finger nails.  At first it seemed to work. One suck and his faced screwed up like he&#x27;d just sucked a lemon. After trying desperately not to laugh, I spent the next two hours blissfully NOT saying \\&quot;Don&#x27;t suck your fingers!\\&quot; The silence was heaven. But then after about 2hrs I noticed he was happily sucking away again. So I reapplied the product. Another 2 hours without sucking. Another coat...and so on for the next 48hrs (except while sleeping of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the second day my son had GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO THE TASTE and would suck his fingers within minutes after applying the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up wrapping his hand in socks, mittens, and first aid wraps for the next two months (taking it off only for eating) while the fingers healed. When we finally stopped wrapping his hand he seemed to need to suck less than before. Since then he continues to suck lightly whenever he is tired or hungry or nervous. Because it hasn&#x27;t gotten raw or blistered again, we&#x27;ve let it be. If it does get raw again we may try the Mavala again since we still have the bottle, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, during one application I had the misfortune to spill some on my jeans and hands. Although I immediately washed my hands *thoroughly*, the taste remained *very* strong for several hours. I accidentally touched my lips by habit once and was rewarded with a lingering AWFUL HORRIBLE taste on my lips for over 2 hours! It took DAYS for the taste to completely go away from my fingers!!! Thus, I can say with some certainty that it ought to stop most grownups from EATING anything at all that requires using your fingers to assemble or eat it (the taste transfers from your fingers to the food), let alone stopping someone from biting their nails! It came off my jeans with one run through the washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******* April 2011 UPDATE*******&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using that same bottle on my *second* son who is now 3 and still sucking his thumb UNLESS I paint this stuff on his thumbs. He HATES the taste and cries whenever we put it on him because he knows it means he can&#x27;t suck his thumb, but the sucking is already affecting his jaw and teeth alignments, so on it goes. I&#x27;m working on remembering to apply it every morning. I think if I can get more consistent it&#x27;ll do the trick for this guy. Guess my first boy was just more tolerant/stubborn, depending on how you look at it. ;-)ps from EATING anything at all that requires using your fingers to assemble or eat it (the taste transfers from your fingers to the food), let alone stopping someone from biting their nails!

            <li> It worked first time for my 2 year old the first time for finger sucking. Make sure to put only a little bit on top of her fingernails because that stuff stays on for a long time and it will get on anything she touches. I accidentally got some on my fingers then everything I touched was very gross! I tried to take it off by using  acetone and it did not work.... I&#x27;m really happy that it worked for her because it&#x27;s been a few weeks and she&#x27;s still not sucking her fingers!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 6 year old in our family with a major thumb sucking habit.  I tried it on one of my own thumb nails, just to know what it tastes like.  I put the thumb in my mouth, and, at first, I didn&#x27;t really taste anything.  Then, in a few seconds, it came on hard.  It&#x27;s a chemical-ish kind of taste.  I had the uncontrollable urge to spit, and I had to get up and go to the sink.  It last for a couple of days, and sometimes I tasted it randomly, like if it accidentally touched the food I was eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked so quickly for the 6 year old.  She hated it, and the first time we did it she cried.  We only had to use it one more time, and she was magically done with thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> Well there were a couple of instances of throwing up in the middle of the night  (due to gagging and screaming not actual nausea) which was sad but it did work in the end. Do make sure you don&#x27;t get any on your fingers while applying and use only the tiniest bit bc it can transfer while eating and it is very gross.</li>
            <li> Our 10 year old had an issue with mindlessly biting his nails while doing other activities. I was tired of asking him to get his hands out of his mouth, so I ordered this product. I put this on his nails and it did the trick. He tasted it a few times and didn&#x27;t like it. He said it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it didn&#x27;t taste good by any means. It&#x27;s enough to make him aware of what he is doing without me having to say a word. I would highly recommend this product. It really works!</li>
            <li> BUT not nasty enough, apparently.  I tried this stuff and it was VILE...I nearly vomited at the taste.  I thought &amp;#34;for sure my kiddo won&#x27;t suck her thumb when this stuff is painted on.&amp;#34;  NOPE. WRONG.  I will say, that my kid will probably suck her thumb for the rest of her life.  She&#x27;s almost 5 now and I have literally tried everything so I feel that the three-star review was probably very harsh.  If your kiddos insist on sucking their thumbs I am not sure anything will work.  So far, we use those &amp;#34;one-size-fits all&amp;#34; gloves that you can get for $1.00 and athletic tape at night to keep the sucking down while she sleeps.  Not sure what else I can do.  It&#x27;s futile people...just futile.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes horrible.  There is no way your kid will suck his/her thumb with this stuff on it!  I took a taste and couldn&#x27;t get it out of my mouth for hours.  YUCK!</li>
            <li> first off, i had been biting my nails for 3-4 years.  I was 15 and i hated my fingers.  I have tried everything to try and stop but it wouldn&#x27;t work.  When i ordered this i thought it would be a waste of my money because i have tried something similar before.  Although the stuff i tried before was very thick and almost fun to bite off, i was pretty sure that this would be the same.  I got it 5 days later and put it on.  First i wanted to see what it tasted like so it wouldn&#x27;t be such a surprise when i first bit my nails.  I tasted it and it was disgusting.  It stays on for atleast a week and will definetly help you stop biting. There isn&#x27;t any odor so it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.  I haven&#x27;t bit my nails in over a month.  This is amazing.</li>
            <li> I guess after two years old, there is no reason for your child to suck on a finger or thumb. As long as you put this on about every three days till they dont have the desire it really really works!!</li>
            <li> We used on our five year old and in less than 5 days he was no longer sucking his thumb. We followed others advice and only used a small amount. He did taste it a few times but after that it worked like a charm and he was done. I think he was highly motivated to stop and just needed the extra boost which this did. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old had been sucking his thumb since he was born and we tried everything, nothing worked. I bought the Mavala Stop put it on his thumb nail while he was sleeping, and he stopped sucking his thumb in less than a week. He hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb while awake in a two months. He does suck his thumb occasionally while sleeping. This product is gr8, if you have a thumb sucker dont hesitate to buy it and apply it!!!</li>
            <li> This helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb.  It took a few tries, she cried, it would wear off and we would try again.  I let her pick when to do it, she was five.  We discussed why it wasn&#x27;t good to suck her thumb or bite her nails (germs under her nails and on her hands, not being able to wear polish, hurt to bite too much, would mess up her grown up teeth coming in, etc), she&#x27;d agree to it and then cry for a few nights at bedtime until it wore off.  In a couple of weeks she stopped sucking her thumb.  I tasted it, it&#x27;s really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My husband has been biting his nails for over 20 years! Terrible habit. Before we got married we tried this product to see if he would stop and let his nails grow out for all the pictures and what not, it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we ran out, and he got stressed and it started all over again -__-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recently got this product again and it still works! The taste is the most horrendous taste ever! and it last no matter what you eat or how many times you brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this, is that it does need to be reapplied every couple days.</li>
            <li> I used this item on my twin boys. It stopped them from sucking their fingers/thumbs within 2 weeks. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have 4 yr old twins who used to bite their nails.  Can&#x27;t say the have stopped 100% but things have improved incredibly.  Would definetely recommend</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone who wishes to stop the habit of sucking thumb. My daughter is 3 years old and she have been sucking her thumb almost all the time. I found this product on amazon and ordered without any second thought and I am very glad that I found this product because my daughter stopped her thumb sucking habit from the very first application. this product is extremely bitter with even a trace amount and the taste just lingers on for long time. It&#x27;s now several months since she stopped her habit and I am sure she will never go back to that habit. I am thankful for people who invented this product. Thank u and go for this one!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for a week but my extremely determined 3 year old is now back to sucking her fingers. The product is extremely bitter (I tested on my fingers first) and an instant deterrent, however, a bit after a week my daughter got used to the taste (I didn&#x27;t) and would stick her fingers in her mouth a few minutes after I applied the product. I would ask her how her fingers tasted and she replied, \\&quot;bad\\&quot; but was determined to stick her fingers in her mouth anyway. Needless to say, we are now looking for another product.</li>
            <li> Better than THUM.  It took 3 days and the thumb sucking stopped.  But, remember to pair this \\&quot;memory fluid\\&quot; along with a reward system.  After one calendar month he earned a reward that we agreed upon from day one.</li>
            <li> I searched for answers to this thumb sucking problem and this stuff was my last hope. It worked BRILLIANTLY. JUST 2 DAYS OF TASTING THIS STUFF ON HIS THUMB HE HASN&#x27;T EVEN THOUGHT OF IT SINCE. THAT WAS A YEAR AGO. Buy it you won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after trying the Thum product sold in stores.  That stuff did not taste bad at all, however, Mavala Stop tasted horrible and immediately stopped my 3 year old daughter from suckking her thumb.  She did not complain about it.  I think she did not know she was sucking her thumb but after 3 applications or about a week...her habit was broken.  It has been several weeks since we used this product and still no thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> this helped my daughter quit sucking her thumb in a week or so. 7 years old and now is done with her thumb. she is proud of herself.&lt;br /&gt;buy this stuff! i never thought it would work.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews and would like to recommend it to anyone who has a thumb sucker.  We have tried other ways (taping the thumb, wearing a glove) and I had spoken to our dentist about some possible solutions. He suggested using the implant behind the teeth as a last resort, but fearing major dental problems, I just felt that we couldn&#x27;t wait any longer.  WOW! It worked in a week for us and I will continue to use it for at least a month to be sure the habit has been broken. I will be telling our dentist about it at our next appt.</li>
            <li> Second time using the product, and it&#x27;s great!!!!! being an adult bitting nails, is not cute..and this definetly solves my problem....the taste is relaly bad, and once you try to bite it once, your brain will record that bad taste and you will stop...the only downside is on I stop applying cuz my nails are long and nice, I start bitting again....oh well..maybe will be a life time product....</li>
            <li> Stopped the finger biting.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! Only two applications and my granddaughter stopped sucking her thumb.  Only one application and my grandson stopped biting his nails.  There is nothing in this product to harm your child in any way (no burning or stinging, etc), just a very nasty taste that will keep their little fingers away from their mouth.  It was recommended by our family dentist who actually tried it and said it was the worst taste ever.  Sure beats having to get braces somewhere down the road because of thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> Great (yucky!) stuff!  My daughter was a 3 year old thumb sucker who&#x27;s habit was affecting her bite.  Her pediatric dentist recommended this product and she stopped sucking her thumb all together in less than a month!  I felt bad putting it on her thumb, especially after I tried it (it was terrible) but am glad now that the whole thumb sucking stage is behind us!</li>
            <li> I am a 22yo female and have been biting my nails since I can remember.  I have tried a million times to quit, but the second my life got stressful, bam, nails gone.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product, but gave it a try and it has definitely helped me so far.  The taste is bad and lingers for ages, so you learn quickly to keep your hands far from your mouth. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> As soon as I paint this on my children&#x27;s nails they stop biting them.  The bad taste lingers in your mouth, yuck.  It takes a long time to wear away.  Also keeps them from eating their dinner with their hands.  Beware string cheese!  If you pick at your cheese with your painted nails it will taste horrible as well!  : ) Helps them keep their germy hands away from their mouth just in time for flu season. I&#x27;m buying my second bottle right now, it really works.</li>
            <li> I am a college student who has been biting my fingernails as long as I can remember. I have always hated that I do it but have never been able to stop, it seems that I do it when I&#x27;m idle (during movies, class etc). I have used stuff I put on my nails before but it never deterred me enough. When I got this stuff in the mail I put it on right away, a few hours later when I went to bite my nails I got just about the worst taste imaginable. Lets just say that the taste is so bad that when you even have the slightest thought of biting your nail you cringe. My nails are the longest they have been since I can remember and this product works great. If you have been doing it for a long time and are having trouble quitting I really suggest this stuff. I love not being self conscious about my nails.</li>
            <li> stopped my kid from thumb sucking in 3 days</li>
            <li> Cure a habitual case of nail biting in one application.</li>
            <li> Took one week and a barbie doll to stop finger suckling for my four year grandaughter. This is the second child in my family to use this product and it worked like a charm both times.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 yr old daughter sucked her thumb mostly when she slept or got bored, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was \\&quot;excessive\\&quot; but the dentist stated she was starting to see some changes in her palate from the thumbsucking and her teeth, which were in good health, looked obvisouly like she sucked her thumb. I know people have a lot of reservations about putting some \\&quot;chemicals\\&quot; in the mouth, I had some too, especially being a Registered Nurse. But thought I would still try it and see what happened. The first night was rough as she did put her thumb in her mouth and then gagged and spit and couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of her mouth. I don&#x27;t think she slept as well over the next few days (even during nap time) because she couldn&#x27;t comfort herself with sucking her thumb but we are almost 3 weeks since we started to use it and it&#x27;s been successful. I know she has tried to suck it a couple of times at night because I heard her gag (we still use a monitor). My husband I both tried it (put our mouth on our daughter&#x27;s thumb after application) and it was pretty nasty and the taste stays with you for a while...You do need to be sure to reapply the product every 2-3 days. Blessedly, our daughter only sucked one thumb and has not tried to suck the \\&quot;other\\&quot; thumb.</li>
            <li> My husband had been bothering me about my nail biting habit since he met me. I was never able to stop more than a week cold turkey. So I decided to give this product a try after reading the good reviews. It tastes so horrible I havent put my fingers near my mouth in 2 weeks! It does tend to get on finger foods and if I scratch anywhere near my face I have to wash it off but I can honestly say this product worked for me to quit biting my nails. I still get the urge to bite them but all I think about is getting that horrible taste in my mouh and...bleh!</li>
            <li> The orthodontist recommended this product for my ten year old son, who has an oral device to keep him from thumb-sucking but he is still trying.  It didn&#x27;t really have any effect on him. He says it&#x27;s gross, but it does not deter him from the habit. I have been a nail-biter for decades, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out... I grew my nails out for the first time I can remember. I managed to keep them that way for months (thanks to this disgusting stuff... though if I was really anxious I could overcome the taste and nibble away), but when I ran out of the product.. I became a nail biter again! It seems to all depend on the person and their sense of taste- I think it&#x27;s worth a try. Ordering it again for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails since I was 5 years old (or so).  I have tried three different products from drug and beauty supply stores with little success.  This product stays on your nails, even after washing your hands, and has a strong bitter taste that lingers.  I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in three weeks and was finally able to get a manicure!!  I am so grateful to have discovered this product.  It really worked for me.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has been sucking her thumb since the womb. I didnt try getting her to quit until about 2 1/2 and I wish I had started sooner. Our first attempt was the night shirt with the built in gloves. They worked for one night, then she refused to wear it or would take it off in the middle of the night.  Our second attempt was a thumb guard. She managed to get out of that one also. Later we tried bandaids around the age of 5 because at this point she wanted to quit. Just like all the other products, her desire to suck her thumb ruled.  It was usually only at night or when she was very tired she would suck her thumb, so school teasing never came into play.  I found this product online at Amazon and decided to give it a try. Once it arrived, she pleaded with us not to use it and she would quit, but after about 3 weeks, the sucking never quit. One day I just decided that it was time and no matter what we were going to try this. She was very reluctant, but she knew I wasnt giving in. Day one was rough, sleep didnt go well for her, but the taste was bitter enough to keep that little thumb out of her mouth. Its now day 11 and she has not sucked her thumb once since. I&#x27;m going to go for 2 full weeks 14 days, but I&#x27;m 100% sure she&#x27;s done..  It&#x27;s so exciting and she has a dental appt. coming up and can&#x27;t wait to tell her dentist she doesnt suck her thumb anymore!!  Thank you Mavala!</li>
            <li> I am not the type that often reviews products but I had to say something about Mavala Stop.  I have not one but two children that have been chronic thumb suckers.  I have been trying to get them to stop for years.  We have tried other formulas that you paint on as well as some home formulas with no success.  I skeptically bought this after reading the positive reviews.  It is amazing but it honestly worked from the very first minute we put it on.  They did not want to suck their thumbs and when they did come in contact with it it was a deterrent enough to avoid it.  We had tears the first two nights that they would not be able to sleep without their thumbs but somehow they did and we made it through.  Now they don&#x27;t even seem tempted and it has been less than a week.  I consider this a miracle given the hold that this habit has had over both of them.  We will keep using it until we are sure that the habit is broken.  I am embarrassed to mention that my kids are 9 and 12 and were still doing this.  It has been such a fight to break this habit and this product worked instantly.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nasty !!!!! Stays on too lol</li>
            <li> This is the only product that helped&lt;br /&gt;my 10 year old stop sucking her thumb. She sucked it for her entire life. We&#x27;re very happy.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I tried to make my children stop sucking their thumb for about 9 years but I couldn&#x27;t. Then I found this product and it really worked. I only used this product For about 3 weeks and they stopped sucking their thumbs. I recommend this product to any one who&#x27;s kids suck their thumb or bite their nails.</li>
            <li> One of my one-year-olds sucks his thumb vigorously that he started having severe bruises on his thumb.  We tried Vaseline, and that other product that stops thumbsucking (which you can buy at your local Target) to no avail.  I took a leap of faith on this product because of the overwhelming positive reviews.  It worked!  BUT...prepare for the crankiness as your little one tries to adjust to NOT having to suck his thumb...there is a loss of appetite throughout the day as he realizes not to suck his thumb because it&#x27;s now bitter (and the taste lingers even after drinking several glasses of water...I know because I tried it out of curiosity!).  But after that...no more thumbsucking!  It really works.</li>
            <li> My daughter was 8 years old and still sucked her thumb.  After school ended, I told her I had some special nail gloss.  I put it on her thumb nails.  Later, we were driving in the car and I saw her pouting in the back seat.  \\&quot;You tricked me\\&quot; she said.  I reapplied every couple days, and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  Highly recommended, it&#x27;s really great when you take a chance on something like this and it really works out.</li>
            <li> Long time fingernail biter here and while this product DOES what it is supposed to do, it is simply too gross to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not knocking on the product though. It comes with more than enough to hopefully cure even the most relentless of nail biters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution though. This stuff is truly disgusting. I&#x27;m sure you expected that but when I say that it is nasty I REALLY want to emphasize just how nasty that it is. DO NOT attempt to eat ANY finger foods when you are using this stuff. It will forever ruin that food for you should you attempt.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PI36W6 Mavala® Stop (0.3 oz)]]&lt;br /&gt;My three year old daughter has been suffering from severe trichotillomania (hair pulling), trichophagia (hair eating) and thumb sucking.  The habits seem to go hand-in-hand in her case.  Her pediatrician was concerned because she was eating the hair as she sucked her thumb which could cause a blockage in her intestines which could be fatal if not discovered and removed surgically.  We&#x27;ve been seeing a psychologist and trying everything to stop these habits (such as using other polish that claims to do the same thing as Mavala, we also tried having her wear gloves, we tried distraction, tried putting bandaids on her thumbs, tried stress relievers like squishy toys for her to squeeze and bracelets for her to fiddle with, we tried a reward program where she would get surprises if she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb or pull her hair, we tried disciplining her when she would do these things, we had her pediatrician and her dentist talk to her about it, we tried everything).  It has been a source of constant worry for me because I didn&#x27;t know what to do and I was so fearful that she would be teased about this one day and that would make it even worse, not to mention the effect on her self esteem and the potential health hazards.&lt;br /&gt;We started using Mavala a few weeks ago (after having tried other similar products with no luck).  I must say I was hoping for the best, but not expecting much due to the strong attachment my daughter had with her thumb. But after reading many reviews and seeing other people having positive results, I figured we had nothing to lose.  Our next step was going to be medicating our daughter based on advice from a psychiatrist and we really didn&#x27;t want to go down that road.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that my daughter would not let me apply the Mavala to her nails because we had tried similar products and she would try to prevent us from putting them on her because she said they tasted yucky (but obviously not yucky enough to stop her from sucking her thumb).  So I explained to her that now that she was three years old, she was big enough to use a \\&quot;special polish\\&quot; on her nails.  The special polish was Mavala.  I made a big deal about it and she became excited about trying it.  I told her it would make her nails shiny.  So she sat in my lap and allowed me to put it on her nails without a fuss.  That first night was difficult because she kept saying she wanted her \\&quot;thumbkin\\&quot;, and she wanted the polish off.  She went to bed in tears.  That is so hard for a mom to see.  But I kept reminding myself why I was doing this.  We put the Mavala polish on her nails every night before bed for several weeks.  She continued to allow me to put it on her because she felt so special being able to use this polish (it&#x27;s like she would forget every night that she didn&#x27;t like the taste of it).  For a few nights she would cry herself to sleep because she would try to suck her thumb and then when she would get a taste of it she would be so upset.  It probably took about a week before she stopped trying to suck her thumb.  We continued to use the Mavala every night for about 6-8 weeks just to be sure the habit was broken.  Sometimes I would just put it on her thumbs and not her other fingers since that was really my only concern.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy to report that this product was a miracle for us.  It worked.  It actually worked.  It saved my sanity, but more importantly, it saved my daughter&#x27;s life.  I truly believe that.  Her trichotillomania (hair pulling) and trichophagia (hair eating) also stopped when she stopped sucking her thumb.  That is life saving.  This product works!!!!!  I can&#x27;t even begin to say how much this product means to me and my family.  It&#x27;s absolutely what we needed and I&#x27;m so thankful for everyone who posted positive reviews.  Without those reviews I probably never would have tried this product.  So that&#x27;s why I felt so strongly about posting this review.  I&#x27;ve never posteda review about anything I&#x27;ve purchased before.  But if I&#x27;m able to help one other person out there it is worth me taking the time to write a review to let people know that this product worked for my daughter.  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing!a review about anything I&#x27;ve purchased before.  But if I&#x27;m able to help one other person out there it is worth me taking the time to write a review to let people know that this product worked for my daughter.  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I had used it before but lost my bottle while sharing it with others. My nails were growing within one week of not chewing them. You just have to be careful not to eat too many finger foods because you will get a hint of the taste while eating. It&#x27;s not bad but it is there. This product is a great reminder and deterant to keep your fingers out of your mouth. The delivery was very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough</li>
            <li> If you use this stuff like you are supposed to, you will not bite your nails. The problem is that it&#x27;s so effective that I sometimes don&#x27;t reapply it because I know how potent it is. It&#x27;s very disconcerting to stick your finger into your mouth to do something innocent like pick your tooth and to have that unbearably bitter taste follow it!</li>
            <li> Sure, this little bottle or putrid stuff is like $14. I have been trying to stop biting my nails for over 20 years and this stuff works great. Here are some reasons why this stuff is so effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You only have to put it on every 3 days or so, and it dries quickly when you do.&lt;br /&gt;- Mavala tastes AWFUL. I have not grown to enjoy the flavor nor have I been able to ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;- It isn&#x27;t horribly shiny and doesn&#x27;t draw attention to your hands&lt;br /&gt;- It goes further than keeping me from chewing my nails, it keeps my hands away from my face and out of my mouth. Every time I touch my lips, they taste bad. While my use of napkins has gone up considerably while eating, I see it as a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;- I have determined that the only way to get the flavor out of my mouth is by eating something very salty. This stuff is an excellent deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unsure about what to get, look no further. This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for us, she wasn&#x27;t opposed to the taste!</li>
            <li> Well worth it ! It worked for my 6.5 yr old&lt;br /&gt;daughter to stop her thumb sucking habit.&lt;br /&gt;We were so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> did not stop my small child from sucking their thumb. the bottle did warn that may be the case.</li>
            <li> My son Jon had sucked his thumb from age 3-months until age 3.  After one application of this product, he stopped immediately and never looked back.  It works!</li>
            <li> The effects didn&#x27;t last on me or my 10 year old son (nail biting, not thumb sucking) for even a day. What a waste.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old didn&#x27;t care about the taste. Fail.</li>
            <li> this product is such a life saver, my daughter has been sucking her thumb for a while, she has callous on her thumb due to her sucking habit, i&#x27;ve tried putting betadine, ginger, onion, garlic, cinnamon, band-aid but still no luck with it until her new dentist recommended this product, she stopped sucking her thumb for just 2 days,she said she don&#x27;t want to suck her thumb cause it&#x27;s yucky and because she don&#x27;t want to vomit. This is such a help so that she don&#x27;t need braces when she gets old....thank you for making this product....</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm on two of my children - one was a thumb sucker and one sucked her fingers.  It only took two weeks and the habits were broken!  I highly recommend this product and am so thankful to Dr. Jeannie Moody in Austin, Texas for the referral!</li>
            <li> I put it on my 8 year olds nails and she stuck her finger in her mouth. She said \\&quot;Yuck, that&#x27;s nasty!\\&quot; So she actually has nails now! Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> We painted this on my almost 3 year old daughter and she stopped sucking her thumb cold turkey. She is now thumb-sucking free for 7 months. It worked so well! It tastes nasty and I would warn you that if you/your child eats food with their hands the taste can affect the food and taste when eating.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for years, 10+ and finally found this product and it really works. Even in some of the most stressful times! I use to eat the other \\&quot;gross tasting\\&quot; polishes off my nails, this stuff is horrendous! My only complaint is that you can eat finger foods with it cause its SOOO GROSS! but thats the price we pay for biting our nails.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this out. I&#x27;ve been a nailbitter since I can remember. However, for some reason, it doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as long as I thought it would. People mentioned it stayed on for 2 weeks, while for me, it seemed to last only a few days. It&#x27;s great if you want to keep reapplying, but that can get tiresome.</li>
            <li> We used Mavala Stop once, a month ago, and my three year old son has not sucked his thumb since. We did put it on his thumb a second time, but just for good measure. He hasn&#x27;t even acted like he wants to suck his thumb!</li>
            <li> Works great for my little one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering this product, as I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar products and have always been able to tolerate the taste and bite my nails anyways. First opinion of this product is...smells like nail polish remover. I was skeptical because even a little bit of a nail polish remover taste hasn&#x27;t seemed to work and most just wear off after biting your nails once. Since I got my order last night...I&#x27;ve put it on, and ....first attempt to bite I didn&#x27;t initially taste it, but boy oh boy is the aftertaste rancid. It takes forever to get the after taste out of your mouth and is a HUGE reminder not to bite. I even tried brushing my teeth to get it out and it didn&#x27;t help much. After ashing my hands several times it still hasn&#x27;t worn the taste off of it. Whatever the manufacturers did to make this product to terrible tasting and long lasting...it worked. I absolutely hate putting my hands in my mouth with this stuff on. I&#x27;m betting I&#x27;ll have nice long nails before too long.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son constantly bit his nails, and this worked well as long as he had it, but he kept fussing about not being able to eat, and refused application all together. I had to sneak it on his nails when he was asleep. After a while, he outgrew biting his nnails without the product. So, I can say, yes, it did the trick!</li>
            <li> Our pediatric dentist recommended this product because it was stronger and long-lasting than the store-bought brands.  The first time we applied it to our 2-year old daughter&#x27;s thumbs, she stopped.  We applied it every night for two-weeks (just for good measure), and it worked great!  In fact, when she saw her friends sucking their thumbs, she would tell them to stop.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I became extremely confident that this would be the solution for my 4 year old daughter to stop biting her nails and fingers. I applied a coat as soon as I received it. I even made sure to apply nail polish first and then the Mavala just to make sure she wasn&#x27;t biting her nails. She went to bed, woke up with polish still intact. She went to school and after inspection of her nails found she had bit her nails. Apparently the awful taste was not enough to keep her from biting her nails. I myself tested it by applying some on my thumb.  It really is a bitter taste that lasts a good few minutes. Enough to not want to bite your nails. It&#x27;s nice that it has worked wonders for others. Unfortunately in my case not so. I will keep trying other things to help my daughter from biting her nails.</li>
            <li> After the first week, my 7-year was still sucking his thumb and being stubborn.  However, shortly after application two, I noticed his hand was no longer in his mouth as he slept.  Still working on my nail-biting 11-year old, but he hates the taste so he&#x27;ll stop soon.  This stuff tastes as awful as advertised, which is great in this case.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> I have two kids who sucked their thumbs. We tried this on both of them. It worked like a charm on my 3 yr. old. The instructions say not for babies but I tried it on my 1 yr. old any way. It didn&#x27;t work. She had it sucked off within 30 min.</li>
            <li> The first day I put it on my daughter she went to camp and used something and dug it off so that night I caught her sucking her finger. I then decided to put a light color nail polish first then marvala stop on top. She has not sucked her finger since that day.</li>
            <li> Child wanted to quit sucking her thumb but needed a little reminder.  Great way to without nagging child.  Just hope it isn&#x27;t toxic!</li>
            <li> This amazing product got my four year old to stop sucking her thumb in one day! (And this is a child who had her thumb in her mouth anytime she was not eating or speaking.)  Other reviewers have done the taste justice...I just wanted to share technique.  I didn&#x27;t want to shame my daughter into changing this bad habit, so I told her I bite my nails (I do, when one is broken) and that we would break our bad habit together.  I also bought a copy of the Berenstain Bears the Bad Habit, which we read before giving ourselves Malvala manicures. It only took one time of her tasting this stuff for her to quit...my experience was much more enlightening.  I had no idea how many times my fingers were in my mouth until this nasty stuff was on.  Also, if your finger finds the inside of your nostril, you will be tasting the stuff for hours. :)  It broke a bad habit I didn&#x27;t even realize I had!  :)</li>
            <li> I needed someting to make my grandson to stop sucking his thumb, and bitting his nails. He is three ( 3 ) years old now and I was afraid of what this was doing to his teeth, and bitting his nails meant his fingers were in his mouth, and that means GERMS!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter began sucking her thumb fiercely at 18 months old when her baby sister was born. Then she began sucking her thumb while using her other fingers to rub the tip of her nose. She did this so much and so hard that she literally rubbed an open wound into the tip of her nose. She&#x27;d had the \\&quot;boo boo\\&quot; for a year and we had tried everything to get her to stop -- socks on her hands, tape on her nose, commercial thumb guards, threats, bribes, EVERYTHING. We even had her in counseling to figure out what could be causing her to scar herself like this. Then, on a whim, I bought Mavala Stop. I only had to put in on her thumbnail every other day for a week. And she has not sucked her thumb or rubbed her nose since -- and that was about a month ago. This is by far the longest she has ever gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for this product. It has saved my little girl from infections, scars, and who knows what else. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this on my 4 1/2 year old that was sucking her thumb and wouldn&#x27;t stop no matter what.  It worked great because she could understand that it would taste awful and was afraid to put it in her mouth.  She stopped immediately and we haven&#x27;t had to apply it since.  We also tried it on my 3 year old who just couldn&#x27;t help himself at night and unfortunately he threw up from it.  We are going to wait a little while before trying it again and in the meantime do the usual things to help him to stop.  Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and would recommend it for those kids who can understand a little better and are a little older.</li>
            <li> My child stopped eating his nails after maybe couple of days. yes great product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you need maybe smaller bottle</li>
            <li> Worked instantly!  My[...] old daughter had been sucking her fingers for over 2 years.  Tried everything - sewing socks on her pjs at nite, dipping her fingers in vinegar, putting tape/bandaids on her fingers at nite, distracting her, helping her to develop new habits, taping gloves on her hands at nite, telling her that if she stopped sucking her fingers she could go to Disneyland.  Nothing worked.  All of it was a waste of time.  Then I found Mavala.  I prepared her for Mavala first.  I told her that we were going to get some medicine for her fingers and that it was coming in the mail (exciting for her!) I warned her that if she put her fingers in her mouth that she was going to make a funny face because it will taste so bad. (made it kind of like a fun game so she wouldn&#x27;t be upset with the taste)  First nite I used it, it worked!  She was so proud of herself!  After that, she would ask for it every nite. After about 2 weeks, she stopped asking for it and the habit that I thought would never be broken was gone like a flash!  I have since recommended it to several of our friends.  One thing to keep in mind though - Don&#x27;t use it on children under[...]...their taste buds aren&#x27;t developed enough and it won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter was biting her toenails and as a result she had an ingrown toenail.  Lots of $$ later on antibiotics I decided to give this product a try.  I used it on her toenails after bathtime and that night she stopped biting her toes...that was it. No grief, no crying she just said it was disgusting and quit.  I have started using it on her fingernails too and now she is free of nail biting and maybe a coincidence but she has also stopped picking her nose.  My kid&#x27;s three worst habits stopped in a matter of days!  I am very happy. I used it on my two fingers that I tend to pick at and chew at loose cuticles and yick the stuff tastes horrid.  Leaves a slimey taste in your mouth and makes you remember not to bite.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has finally stopped sucking her thumb thanks to this product.  We applied it once and she quit for 2 weeks...she had a brief slip up when she got in trouble and had to go to bed early (which was understandable).  We reapplied again the next morning (which she said she wanted) and she hasn&#x27;t done it again.  Truly amazing.  She has been so excited to be a big girl now, too.  I recommend this 100% to anyone with a thumbsucker.</li>
            <li> My daughter was really tuff to stop sucking her middle fingers.  I tried begging, bribing, and multiple other over-the-counter items.  I even tried a product sold only by the pharmacy that had cayenne pepper.  That was a real treat....  The first time I put it on, she hated it..  \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; I thought until she brought me the bottle an hour later and wanted more put on her fingers \\&quot;please.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEHEHE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, I was reluctant because of the price (which is really not that bad, but if it did not work, I would have been mad).  Well, in 48 hours, she was done sucking her fingers.  I have not put the product on her fingers since, and she is so proud of herself.  It worked PERFECTLY!!!  Even after all of the failed attempts.  It was quick, perfect, and magnificently effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend, even if you feel like you have exhausted all avenues (like I felt I did).</li>
            <li> I put this product on my 4 year old and 6 year old&#x27;s finger nails and they have not sucked their thumbs since.  I only put it on twice - so it was a fast and effective product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 MAVALA Stop for Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works! Our orthodontist told us to try this first before we had a habit device put in our daughters mouth. He said in 98% of the patients he told about Mavala Stop, it worked and their would be no need for an expensive device for the thumb sucking. He was correct! Within two weeks time she was done thumb sucking and has not gone back to it (she had just turned 7 and sucked her thumb all the time, accept in school, and it has been 6 or 7 months now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 4 1/2 year old son who has been sucking his thumb since he found it on his hand.  After a recent visit to the dentist where he was told it was time to stop the thumb sucking, we looked into the methods to help him stop.  I was torn between this product and ordering a thumb guard, but thought the thumb guard may be embarassing for him.  So I figured I&#x27;d give the Malava Stop a try first and boy was I happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time he sucked his thumb with this product I did feel a little bad as he was spitting for about 10 minutes straight and told me the taste was yucky. But after 5 just days, he had stopped sucking his thumb completely! Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I liked about the product is since its applied like a nail polish, I could put it directly on his thumbnails so it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on food if he were eating something by hand.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really foul but my baby would still suck her thumb in her sleep dispite the aweful taste. she got used to it i guess. oh and i dont liek that the product gets on other stuff dispite that it&#x27;s dry on her finger nails&#x3D; like if hold her hand or soemthing and then i put something (food) in my mouth i can taste that icky stuff.  I recommed ThumbGuards.</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old was sucking her fingers,I tried another brand thumbs before but didn&#x27;t work. and Mavala worked like magic.After applying this she stopped sucking.</li>
            <li> I have tried many product named like \\&quot;Doctor Thumb\\&quot;... none of them was worked out but this one !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good everyone who bites there nails should use this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt compelled to write a product review, but this time I couldn&#x27;t help myself.  My three year old was a prolific thumb sucker, and very strong willed.  I didn&#x27;t think this would work, or if it did, it would be a traumatic experience for the whole family.  This product worked as advertised.  My son was done even trying to suck his thumb within about two days.  A three year habit killed in less than a week!</li>
            <li> I used this on my sons fingers to end his thumbsucking habits. I used it like a nail polish and applied it once every 3 or so days and within about 2 weeks my son had stopped sucking his thumb all together.  I highly recommend this for stopping any kind of finger to mouth habits, it works great.  Also, I know some reviews mention their children gagging, vomiting etc., but my son had none of that. Some children might just have sensitive gag reflexes, so be mindful of that.</li>
            <li> The day it arrived I put it onmy son&#x27;s finger nails and after a week, he stopped putting his fingers in his mouth. This product really works, I will definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this about three weeks ago. It does not taste absolutely terrible, but the taste does linger in your mouth for a while if you accidentally bite your nails or lick your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with these nail biting lotions, creams, etc is that anything you touch becomes almost instantly contaminated. For instance, you can&#x27;t really eat chips without tasting the bitterness in your mouth. If you try to take meat out of a cold meat container, you run the risk of contaminating the meat underneath. Eating a sandwich is a problem because the bitterness wears off onto the bread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it has been about 3 weeks and I have not bitten my nails. I actually have nails. It will take probably 4-6 more weeks for my nails to completely grow out but this is probably the first time in 29 years that I have real nails. I don&#x27;t know what to do with myself!</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish is lasted longer. Sometimes I have to put it on everyday to keep my daughter from biting her nails. Otherwise this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I first tried Thums on my 2 year old daughter when she started biting her nails. She loved the taste of it! Lot of good that did. LOL. So I did some research and everything I read said for 3 years and up. But, of course, I didnt want to wait a year. So after reading several reviews, one review said that this product, Marvala Stop, worked wonders on their under 3 year old. So, after trying it, I will confirm...it works! Within a week my daughter&#x27;s nails were growing. I now put it on about 1x a week and am regularly cutting her nails. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works pretty well but tends to wear off rather quickly, especially if you wash your hands often. Hard core biters will adjust to the taste so, like quitting smoking, they need to be mentally prepared and ready to stop.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to us by my 3 year olds dentist to try because she sucks her thumb. It worked immediately!! We only had to apply it one time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been battling thumb sucking for 2 years and this is a miracle! My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb the first time she tried putting it in her mouth with the Mavala Stop on it! She has not sucked it since. Wish I would have tried it long ago!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! , just used twice and my 4 years old stopped sucking his thumb. Just try to explain to your sons why you do that cause they will hate the flavor.</li>
            <li> I only noticed that his product is not recommended for children under 3 since their taste buds are not fully developed and might have no effect on them.  However, I was desperate to get my 2 yr old to stop chewing his toe nails.  I only took 1 application, him making 2 attempts and couple of reminders that it will be unpleasant to stick them in his mouth.  Seriously, I worked like a charm.  He didn&#x27;t like it but wasn&#x27;t emotionally scared from the experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bitter. Even if I don&#x27;t bite my nails, anything that my hand touched are still bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I only used once and would not use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Out of habit, I bite my nails and cuticles. This product tastes SOOOOOO gross if you accidentally try to bite your nails and the taste lasts for at least 5 minutes in your mouth. It literally tastes like I put nail polish remover in my mouth. Yuck! But, I didn&#x27;t purchase this for a delicious taste so this product quickly breaks the habit. Definitely does what it says it will do. Starts working immediately and have only had it for about a week and already seeing my nails grow.</li>
            <li> this product worked instantly! The kids have no desire to put their thumbs in their mouths anymore! Smells like nail polish and is very bitter. I tasted a VERY tiny bit to see what it was like.  food kills the taste faster than liquid.</li>
            <li> This works. It is very bitter, so I can&#x27;t have my nail-nibbler daughter help in the kitchen to dice and chop veggies unless she is wearing rubber gloves after this stuff is applied.</li>
            <li> Get this stuff in your mouth, you&#x27;ll never want to put your finger in your mouth again.  One drawback, you can&#x27;t eat with your hands while it&#x27;s on your nails... so no more BBQ.</li>
            <li> Does it job and will definitely keep your fingers from your mouth. Been over 2 months since having my last nail bender and I have been chomping since I was 3 and I am in my 40s. 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and worked great!  My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb within a couple of weeks.  She was even honest enough to tell me when the product was wearing off.  Tip for use:  only apply one swipe of the brush onto nail and make sure it is a very little amount!  It doesnt take much at all.  I barely put any on her finger nails but trust me it was enough.  That little amount made for a lot of bitter nasty taste!  Too much of the product and they are unable to eat with their fingers during meals.</li>
            <li> We put the mavala stop on my 22 month old baby&#x27;s thumb nail and we are now on day two and it is working.&lt;br /&gt;He does try to suck on his thumb because he fogets but as soon as he tastes it he can&#x27;t do it any more.&lt;br /&gt;If your child is very young make sure you remaind him or her from were the bad taste is coming from helping them not to taste it all the time specially in the first hours because as time passes by they understand then you don&#x27;t have to remaind that often.&lt;br /&gt;I have try it my self to check how long it takes to wash out and how bad the taste is after one day or two and I have noticed that it does go away as time passes.So just in case I&#x27;m reappling once a day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll up date you about it in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after my sons dentist recommended it, since the Thum out wasn&#x27;t working for us.  Unfortunately my son still just sucks it off -- I have even tried coating his entire thumb instead of just the nail.  It has slowed him down a bit, but if he really wants to suck his thumb it doesn&#x27;t stop him.  It has worked for others in my family though.  My son and daughter bite their nails (as well as myself) and when I put this on their nails and they forgot about it they gagged when they started biting them.  I tried it on my own nails and it was really hard to eat any finger foods (especially popcorn) without getting the taste on your mouth.  That was the main reason I stopped wearing it on my own nails, it basically made me sick when I tried to eat anything (maybe this could be a diet aid too? lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this product, just don&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen immediately.  I am going to continue putting it on his nails and just hope he finally gets sick of it sooner or later.</li>
            <li> My 2yr old daughter sucks her 2 middle fingers, I read the review and ordered it thru amazon. I applied it on her finger nails and she tried sucking it and did not like the taste, after 2-3 attempts she got used to it and started sucking her fingers again. I paid $14 for no use. Try some thing else for kids, it migth be useful for adults.</li>
            <li> This worked incredibly well for our almost-four year old daughter.  It worked so well, we blogged about it here...[...]</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!  We had tried another product and offering rewards, but this worked so well she quit biting her nails after one application!</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter would not keep her hands out of her mouth and nose!  This did the trick! You do need to reapply every 3-4 days depending on activity level.</li>
            <li> The first time we applied the \\&quot;solution\\&quot; it worked like a charm.  Our 3 year-old put her finger in her mouth and had a look of complete disgust from the taste. Her finger wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere near her lips!  We thought we had found something that works.  But after 2 or 3 applications I guess she must have grown used to the taste, because it sure doesn&#x27;t stop her now.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she began to chug the stuff.</li>
            <li> My son was sucking his thumb and was almost 8 years old.  Nothing worked ever.  Mavala stopped his thumb sucking within a week.  Thank you for this wonderful product Mavala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
            <li> A friend loaned me her bottle of Mavala Stop.  I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to buy my own bottle until I knew that it was effective.  My 3 year old was a finger sucker big time.  I applied one coat on the two finger nails of the fingers that she sucked and the habit was broken in 3 days.  She was unable to wash it off, even after a bath it was still on.  She was so proud of herself, it&#x27;s now been 8 months since she sucked her fingers, and she hasn&#x27;t gone back at all.  So I finally bought my own bottle of it for my 5 year old who is a nail biter.  It&#x27;s taken a little longer, but she is no longer a nail biter.  This product was very effective, and the kids did great, they wanted me to put it on them, it was a sense of relief to them to have some help.</li>
            <li> Not 100% sure if it was this product but the 1st day she used it she puked. However after that she refused to put it anywhere near her mouth.  havent been sick again so i works as far as im concerned.</li>
            <li> Very effective.  My 6 year old daughter finally stopped sucking her 2 fingers (index and middle)!  It took us a little over a week of using Mavala 2 time a day and her habit is gone!  Just in time for her adult teeth to grow in and most importantly, she won&#x27;t get sick as much!!!! Yay for Mavala!</li>
            <li> My four year old was starting to but his nails and always had his fingers in his mouth and was still sucking his thumb at night so I purchased the Mavala stop. I put it on him when he was napping so he was never aware that he had it on and within two weeks he had stopped putting his hands in his mouth and no longer sucks his thumb!</li>
            <li> Stopped my thumb-sucker with one application! After 11 years...poor kid was desperate to stop but kept accidentally doing it in her sleep or when she was sick. This did the trick!</li>
            <li> After 7 years as a nail biter I finally have nails agaiN. They were horrible and now they&#x27;re fixed!</li>
            <li> This product did the job. My 5 year old daughter stopped chewing her nails almost instantly. It has only been a month and her nails are BEAUTIFUL! So happy! I just reapplied every 2-3 days to make sure it didn&#x27;t wear off. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Works great. both of my kids are nail biters and it stopped them in their tracks. Need to keep reapplying because they still haven&#x27;t kicked the bad habit. Fingers crossed</li>
            <li> My daughters have been able to eat off everything we&#x27;ve purchased before this. But this one actually makes them&lt;br /&gt;Gag</li>
            <li> Get this. Now. Seriously. I have bitten my nails since I was a kid and I have not bitten my nails for two weeks now (since I started using this). I actually have some fingernails to paint now. It tastes horrible, which is exactly what I wanted. It is not peppery- it is something else that&#x27;s way more putrid. Similar to licking a cotton swab of fingernail polish remover. I have to reapply every two days or so because the bad taste fades after that amount of time. Be careful when you eat finger food, as the taste can get on your food. I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 year old daughter who was biting her fingernails, toenails and surrounding skin.  After a couple of weeks of using this she finally has white on her nails.  Trickiest part to using this is remembering to put it on every other day.  The habit of sticking things in her mouth is a hard habit to break.  I&#x27;m confident that using this over a period of time will help break that habit.  Can definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Its not worth , dont buy, its not working for mydaughter, she still bites nail , will update review if sound any change</li>
            <li> This product works for us, my little girl hates the taste of it but is willing to put it on if I give her a piece of gum. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it rubs off into her food if she uses her fingers to eat which is irritating when your trying to get your kids to like their food. but it is one of the only things that has worked for us so we&#x27;ve learned how to work around it.</li>
            <li> I just got this in last night and already used it on my 5 year old for thumb sucking, and it is so far working just as described. The taste of the stuff isn&#x27;t as bad as I have read on other reports, so I was happy, but it was strong enough to cause him to stop sucking his thumb. I am really happy with the product and will continue to use!! :) THANK YOU MAVALA STOP!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so just wanted to keep this updated and let you all know it has been a full week with NO THUMB SUCKING! He is not complaining about the taste on his food, too much, and he is adjusting well!</li>
            <li> Keeps my daughter from sucking her thumb.  I have to apply it daily but it works great!</li>
            <li> Worked in three days.  No more thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> my 5 year old daughter stopped after a week of this! promising!</li>
            <li> My grandson simply chewed it off his thumb and continued sucking it. Nit worth 1 cent let alone the actual high price.</li>
            <li> wonderful product for adults.  I have bitten my nails since I was a kid I am now 67.  This product has helped me to finally stop.  My wife age 82 also a nail biter all her life is using it and she has also stopped biting.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Our 3 year old has sucked her thumb all of her life. The dentist suggested this and it has saved us a lot of headache! This wears off w/in a couple of days do you need to reapply regularly. But that is not a negative thing...don&#x27;t all nail polishes wear off quickly?&lt;br /&gt;Will last forever!</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all! LMAO  My daughter seemed to think she had dipped her finger tips in syrup...SIGH!</li>
            <li> 24 day later, my 5 yr old son has stopped sucking his thumb!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  He is so happy with himself, he never though he could quit.  He requests it to be applied every other day. It does taste horrible.  It also help my 8 yr old keep his fingers out of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, don&#x27;t give them finger food within a few hours of painting it on their nails.</li>
            <li> I think a -5 Star rating is more accurate.  I hate myself for being a nail bitter and using this product.  Be careful of eating finger foods,  the bitter and will ruin the best foods.  Nail bitting has nearly stopped with the help of this.</li>
            <li> My daughter is still sucking her finger with the taste of this product, even do this taste is really bad. So I am not sure if it really Works for other children</li>
            <li> When we started trying this product I was expecting it to take a while for my 3-year old (who is a serious thumb sucker) to give up that habit.  That was not the case at all!  My wife and I were extremely surprised at the instant effect this had on her.  It&#x27;s been 3 days, and she has not been sucking her thumb at all.  I&#x27;m fully confident that she is now done with the disgusting habit.  I&#x27;m not going to guarantee that this will work for your child, I can only tell you that my 3 year old is one of the most stubborn children I know and it worked for her.</li>
            <li> It works for toddlers and prevents them from thumb-sucking.&lt;br /&gt;I tested it and the taste was awful - i feel bad for my daughter but cant think of a better solution.&lt;br /&gt;It takes lot of washing to remove the taste.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how well this worked to make my daughter quit sucking her thumb. I only had to put it on her nails once and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb in over 3 weeks.  It did make her gag a few times the very first day but after that she wouldn&#x27;t even put her thumb close to her mouth.  I would recommend this to anyone trying to get their child to stop sucking their thumb. My daughter is over 2 years old and sucked her thumb A LOT every day since she was six months old so I really thought it would be very difficult to make her stop and thought we would go through major crying fits but with this stuff it was a very easy transition! Even her pediatrician couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.  It is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> i tried it myself before i did it to my 3 yr. old. it worked for me to stop biting too, this stuff is gross!!!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend putting it on in their sleep, and be ready with a little sip of milk to help rid the taste in the child&#x27;s mouth a little faster. her lower jaw will thank you! i told my dentist about this stuff and now he recommends it too. good luck! It was totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wished I knew about it earlier. My son stopped sucking his thumb in two weeks after 3 or 4 applications. Broke a habit which had lasted nearly 5 years in a fortnight.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for more than 15 years (I&#x27;m almost 22), and I managed to stop completely in three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mainly, I had to become aware of what I was physically doing so I could stop doing it. Because of the horrible, bitter, lingering taste of Mavala Stop, I gradually became aware of what I was doing and could consciously think about my actions. It forced me to be conscious of my bad habit. Secondly, the nasty taste removed any enjoyment or stress relief I got from biting my nails since it was so incredibly unpleasant. I became very wary, very quickly. This combination of factors made it possible for me to stop, which I thought I could never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is really horrible. It&#x27;s like acetone (nail polish remover), bitter, rotten wood, and some sort of fish put together. It has a very chemical taste with a sweet undertone that makes for a horrible experience. The taste is also very durable and lingering. If you licked a nail painted with Mavala Stop, it would take a few minutes to get the taste out. The taste was so bad, in my opinion, that getting it off of my teeth, lips, and tongue when I slipped up stopped whatever I was doing or thinking about. It&#x27;s very, very gross. Two coats of polish will last for more than one full week before rubbing off. It can help to freshen it up during the week to keep the taste at full unpleasantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It ruined finger foods for me during the time I used it. My fingers periodically touched my lips while I was eating, and the nasty taste would rub off slightly. This made me lick my lips a lot to remove the taste quicker-- it&#x27;s easier to get it over with quickly than to try to avoid it on your lips--which made them lose moisture and chap badly. So you should also buy some lip balm at the same time. If you touch a nail with a fingertip, it will rub off there, too, and from there can transfer to coffee cups, pencils, hors d&#x27;oeuvres, etc. Wash your hands before you eat anything that might touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no English directions packaged with the product. I don&#x27;t think this is a problem, since the directions are pretty much obvious (Shake. Paint nails. Gag at taste) but it might be a concern for some people. A great deal of other languages were represented in the instruction pamphlet, including German, Portugese, Spanish, French, and a number of Asian languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Stop has a shine comparable to clear nail polish, but not as shiny as premium or ultra-shine clear nail polish. Your nails will probably not look natural, but if that&#x27;s a concern, you could probably lie and say it&#x27;s just a nice, buffed manicure. It could easily be worn over nail polish and would probably work like an extra protective topcoat. The shiny quality rubs out over time. At the end of a week it will be duller and more matte, but also less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle holds roughly the same amount as a regular bottle of nail polish, but Mavala Stop seems to be of a slightly thinner consistency. I recommend carrying the bottle with you in a pocket or purse so that if you must do something to your nails, it can at least be a touch-up. Washing your hands seems to dull it out more quickly, and removes some of the taste, but not all, by far. It does not wash out with water and soap, but the power is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason you would fail with this product is if you can&#x27;t bring yourself to enforce it. You have to make sure you put it on and touch it up. The temptation of not putting it on or letting it wear off quickly is certainly there. I would advise getting someone else involved who will scold you or remind you about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone. The price is worth it as it works very well. I am very pleased with the result.thing that might touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no English directions packaged with the product.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails forever, I have tried everything. This product works better than anything. FORGET about putting it on a \\&quot;few\\&quot; times a week though, if you really bite your nails often you have to put it on a minimum of once a day but more often if you wash your hands/take multiple showers.</li>
            <li> This is the best worst tasting stuff you can get, put it on my 4yr old before she went to bed one evening, she put her thumb in her mouth once, and she hasn&#x27;t done it again for over a month, she fussed about it a few times, but doesn&#x27;t even talk about it now, haven&#x27;t put any on for almost 2 weeks, still no thumb sucking, to bad for all the orthodontist out there.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb since she was born until she was 4 1/2.  The problem with my daughter was that she would suck her thumb in the night, so she wasn&#x27;t&#x27; even conscious that she was sucking it. She kicked the habit when we bought the thumb guard. It is a device you put in the finger. It was created by a dentist.  It is unfortunate amazon doesn&#x27;t sell it.  I am not allowed to write the url in this comment so I&#x27;m just going to tell you that if you search in google for thumb guard created by Medetal you are going to find it. Good luck!</li>
            <li> The amazon reviews for these types of products are really frustrating. Most 5 star reviews are clearly fake testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to help my 6 yr old stop biting her nails and I&#x27;ve tried each product on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thumb\\&quot; is totally useless and doesn&#x27;t taste like anything. Active ingredient listed as Cayenne pepper extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Malvala Stop\\&quot; is bitter but I don&#x27;t really find the taste all that offensive. It might be useful for a very taste sensitive child or an adult that just want&#x27;s a reminder. My 6 yr old says she doesn&#x27;t like the taste but it&#x27;s not enough to get her to stop. The taste is slow to develop. Active ingredient Denatonium Benzoate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hoof stop the bite\\&quot; is very bitter and the taste comes on much quicker than Malvala. Bitterness lingers for a long time. Active ingredient Denatonium Benzoate (branded Bitrex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoof wins in that it tastes the worst and must have a higher concentration of Denatonium Benzoate. My main concern with both Hoof and Malvala is that the lingering bitterness will desensitize my daughter too it. Since the bad taste doesn&#x27;t go away she may just keep biting once she starts. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I bite my nails all the time, like down to raw sometimes.  Started young, never was able to shake it, and its really bad when I am stressed out, which is often these days.  With this stuff on my nails, I wont go near em - i tried about 3 times, and learned quickly.  Haven&#x27;t in nearly a week, and they are already healing and growing back.  This stuff tastes REALLY BAD and wont come off regardless of washing, so its bang for buck.  Gonna stick with this product for a month or so and hopefully that will de-program my brain and will be no longer a nail-biter.  Only word of caution for this product - its really strong, and you will taste it if you are not careful while eating with your hands.  Also, i accidentally gave my 1 year old a piece of apple and she got a dose, accompanied by some crying.  Overall these challenges are avoidable if careful, and its a really effective product.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm to get my 3 year old to stop sucking her 2 fingers!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for probably, as long as I can remember. This product arrived, and I even put a clear coat over my gel nails, and it has only been a few hours, but I have a feeling if I continue to use as directed I will stop biting my nails, even if I use the whole bottle breaking the habit. This stuff tastes gross, I have tried other stop biting nail in the past, but I was able to &amp;#34;get used to them, this product I do not think I will be able to. I highly recommend it. It took a while to ship, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s trying to kick the habit of biting my nails. Whenever I bite my nails, I don&#x27;t even realize it at first, and by the time I realize it, half of my nails are already ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product on, I get alerted as soon as my mouth touches a finger tip. The flavor is really unpleasant, it&#x27;s definitely a strong enough stimulus for Pavlovian conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s been working well, maybe a little bit too well. Just be careful when you eat and cook. This morning I made some pretty bitter sandwiches.</li>
            <li> Works great if you are really trying to stop biting your nails. Sideeffect... you cant lick your hands if you ahve eaten something Delish lol</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews, so I tried it for my 4 yr old. For me, it seems like I could have just put water on her hands and saved my $10. She didn&#x27;t notice any flavor at all, just liked that her nails were shiny. It&#x27;s possible it just didn&#x27;t work for us, but it was useless.</li>
            <li> I put it on my son&#x27;s finger and it stopped him from sucking it for maybe 5 minutes :(</li>
            <li> My 4 1/2 year old son has a horrible thumb sucking habit.  I find that I know exactly when the recent Mavala Stop application has worn off, as his thumb is back in his mouth.  One coat lasts about 3 days (even after daily swimming, baths, etc), and he hates it.  Works great, thank you!</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter of at least 15 years, after one week of applying this stuff to my fingers I was cured! The stuff tastes extremely bitter and just terrible in general. Frankly I only really tried to bite my nails once after putting it on, and that&#x27;s all it took, man it tastes awful. I found that I accidentally put my fingers in my mouth for other things (flossing and accidentally when eating chips and stuff) which kind of sucked because you have to deal with the awful taste when you&#x27;re not even trying to bite you fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars. It will work for you.</li>
            <li> Haha just the SMELL did the job all by itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We let my four year old son take one sniff of it, explained its purpose and he was sufficiently motivated to stop sucking his thumb except at bed time.  We haven&#x27;t had to use it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping it around to actually use in future if he doesn&#x27;t naturally stop sucking his thumb at bed time, but for now I&#x27;d call it a huge success!</li>
            <li> This worked to stop my son from putting his thumb in his mouth, but I think it is worth sharing our experience with it.  My son was still sucking his thumb at age 4 when he entered pre-kindergarten - he sucked it ALL THE TIME.  We wouldn&#x27;t have really been concerned had he only sucked his thumb at home, but he was doing it at school and as a consequence was getting sick quite often.  The first time we tried this it immediately prevented him from putting his thumb in his mouth (it really does taste terrible, I tried some on my fingernail) - what we hadn&#x27;t anticipated was that his thumb sucking was also a comfort/coping mechanism at school and the immediate elimination of it resulted in him acting out in uncharacteristic ways - queue Bruce Banner&#x27;s change into the Incredible Hulk.  Once we figured this out, we decided that the middle of the school year was not the time to eliminate his thumb sucking.  Trying to get this stuff off is quite a chore.  I tried fingernail polish remover, but that didn&#x27;t work so I ended up filing it off with a nail file.  Flash forward to the summer and we tried it again.  In addition to having this painted on his thumbnails, I had a reward system for every week that he didn&#x27;t suck his thumb, ending in the eventual earning of a big-boy two wheeler bike when he was thumb-sucking free for two months.  This worked great and he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb since.  Bottom line, this stuff kept my son from putting his thumbs in his mouth, but he needed to be ready to give up the habit so the absence of the thumb sucking didn&#x27;t have negative consequences.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 8yo daughter, with 2 thumb suckers, i was desperate to find something for her to quit sucking her thumb, my son who is a year older has permanent damage to his mouth and had to have a mouth piece put in. I didn&#x27;t want to have to do that twice at $300 a pop, so I ordered Malava stop, couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product In so pleased it worked so great, especially when nothing else would. THANKS MALAVA STOP for such a fantastic product!!!</li>
            <li> When my son was 3 years old, he sucked his thumbs so bad that they became infected. It was scary because his thumbs were slightly purple. Apparently the breaks in the skin from his teeth combined with getting dirt or whatever on his hands was enough to cause the infection. The doctor applied an antibiotic but recommended Mavala stop. We bought it and he couldn&#x27;t stand the taste. It didn&#x27;t take but a couple of days and thumb sucking was over. We applied for a few weeks just to make sure. Now my son is almost 7 and he&#x27;s developed a bad habit of biting his nails and chewing the skin around his finger nails. So, we&#x27;re back to using mavala stop again in hopes for a second cure!</li>
            <li> 12 y.o. son says it tastes bitter for about 20 minutes after he tries to chew fingernails.  Tastes bad any time he puts his fingers in mouth.  So it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help ease my daughter away from her finger-sucking habit. However, when the product came, there is NO safety seal on the outside box, and NO safety seal on the bottle cap. As a result, I&#x27;m afraid to use the product for fear of tampering or tainting. It&#x27;s shocking to me that a product aimed for finger-suckers and nail-biters, and on the box states \\&quot;An effective deterrent for adults and CHILDREN\\&quot; has absolutely no safety seals to ensure the product can&#x27;t be tainted or tampered with, in the long line of distribution from manufacturer to consumer!!!  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product made my 4 year-old son stop sucking his fingers on the very first day.  He tried to suck them once, gagged into the trash can, and that was it.  He&#x27;s had no trouble eating food, and he never had trouble during the night.  This was a boy who had his first two fingers in his mouth almost 24/7, and his teeth were already crooked because of it.  Our dentist even wanted to put a special appliance in his mouth to make him break the habit.  To save money, we decided to try Mavala Stop first.  What great results!  I highly recommend it.  I would mention, though, that we had to reapply the product every day, not every other day, in order to prevent relapses.  We&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and are starting to reapply it only every other day.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write an on-line review but this product was so great that I have to recommend it!!  My husband and I were desparately trying anything and everything to get our 2 yo to stop sucking his thumb.  He loves to play in the sand box and we were concerned that he was going to get sick from the dirt on his hand.  He was a thumb sucker from the beginning.  We tryied to cover his hand in a mitten and putting a band-aid on his thumb...  Everything suggested by parents on-line.  We finally decide to try the Mavala product.  Let me tell you it was like magic.  the first time we put it on his thumb, He made a terrible face.  After that he knew that his thumb tasted \\&quot;yucky\\&quot;.  I never saw him suck his thumb again.  We put it on for a few weeks just to reinforce things and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone that has issues biting their nails.  This worked for my bf and I&#x27;ve been looking for a product for yrs that would compel him to stop biting.  Finally, I found something that worked!</li>
            <li> I think it made my son lose his appetite.  Sucking his fingers and eating or stop the sucking not eating.  Easy choice.</li>
            <li> I immediately applied the polish to my 4-year-old son&#x27;s nails.  Initially he hated the taste.  Whenever he put his thumb in his mouth he immediately pulled it back out and made a really ugly face to show his disgust.  Success! Or so I thought.  Over the course of about 3-4 weeks he eventually got used to the taste (can&#x27;t understand why since it tastes terrible!) and thus is back to thumb-sucking (both of them).  Great concept but useless when a child gets to a point where he/she actually LIKES the taste. Back to the drawing board :(</li>
            <li> I bit my nails for almost 40 years.  I tried this as a last ditch effort.  It worked!!!  The taste is bad, but not nauseatingly so.  It more serves as a reminder.  I gave the rest of the bottle to a coworker and she used it on her grandson.  He quit too.  Now if I could only keep my fingers out of my mouth.  Contrary to the directions, I painted my nails daily.  I also cover the skin around the nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff was applied once to my 3 year old daughters thumb and it worked.  There were 2 long nights of her coughing because the stuff was so strong, but it did the job.  She was a 24 hour a day thumb sucker too.</li>
            <li> *Note* Being vegetarian, I had to email the company to make sure that it is a vegetarian formula, given all the flavor reviews made me doubt it,  but it is safe for vegetarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my 7yo daughter who&#x27;s been sucking her thumb since being days old.  Of course, this is our last resort, as we&#x27;ve tried MANY other remedies to no avail.  The first day I applied the product, she complained and cried that it was no fair and that it stained her mouth.  She would try orange juice, water, milk, and other foods to get the taste out.  I felt bad, but that was the point of the product! At night, to pass time until she fell asleep, she figured out she could watch the clock to get her mind off of not being able to suck her thumb.  I had to realize that she had been doing this for so long, she didn&#x27;t realize she was doing it, hence why this was the best product to get her attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her only other complaint was when she would eat finger foods.  We went to a tea room with little sandwiches and other finger foods, and just barely touching her bottom lip with her thumbnail threw her off.  Fortunately, she does not have an easy gag reflex, so we never had to deal with vomit like others on here. Although, when I asked her what it tasted like, she said it was a mix of bitter, peppers, and dog poop. So, there you go!</li>
            <li> It might work if your child wants to stop sucking their thumb, but if not, don&#x27;t count on it.  My son will wash his hands or pick at the polish until it comes off.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are the best $10 I ever spent. My 2yo daughter has been sucking her fingers since born. We tried many different ways and started to loss hope until we found this product. The first time we put it on her fingers, she did not even want to smell them, let alone sucking them. We only had to use it for one week then she completely forgot about sucking fingers.</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter(toddler) who is a very determined thumb sucker. Initially it looked like she stopped putting her thumb in her mouth, but after couple of weeks she started to put again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she is so used to this nail paint, she almost know when exactly to put her thumb back for sucking after the nail paint is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may be more suitable for little older kids but not for young toddlers.</li>
            <li> We found the product very useful in preventing thumb succking for our 3 y old.&lt;br /&gt;We applied a small amount (one touch) on her thumbs and she stopped sucking them right away.&lt;br /&gt;We re-aplied the drops every month for the next 5-6 months to wean her off completely.</li>
            <li> Absolutely bitter taste and it works wonders. My 4 year old was still sucking her thumb and I needed her to stop by her 5th birthday. I used it once on her thumb and she stopped sticking her thumb in her mouth for a good month. Once in a blue, I&#x27;ll catch her with her thumb in her mouth as if she&#x27;s done it as an afterthought, I simply reapply the polish while she sleeps and that&#x27;s that. She&#x27;ll ask me if I put the polish on her nails if she catches a taste of it while eating, (lol) I simply smile and ask her if she remembers me doing so. It&#x27;s great! But it depends on the child. I tried it on my 3 year old niece, but she simply continued biting her nails. She does it as a nervous tick and though she acknowledges that her fingers taste \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; she can&#x27;t help but bite her nails if she feels nervous or agitated.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful, as it should(I had to try it before giving to my son).  Our son just turned 4, and the dentist told us it was time to stop the thumb sucking.  We had tried other things (\\&quot;Thumb\\&quot; and hot sauce), but unfortunately he likes spicy stuff.  The dentist recommended Mavala Stop, and we&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now.  It works, but does wear off towards the end of the day due mainly to hand washing.  It&#x27;s by far the best thing we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything to help our 3½ year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, and this is the only product that actually worked.  The taste is really yucky and lasts for at least 2 days.  It lasts through hand washing and rubbing it off.  With other products she would endure the unpleasant taste long enough for it to wear off, but after 1 night of using Mavala, she wouldn&#x27;t even try to put her thumb back in her mouth. I did try to use it on my 2½ year old who bites her nails, but she just kept putting her hands in her mouth to try to wipe the bad taste out and that ended up in a viscous cycle.  The product does state to not use in children under 3.  I am very happy I found this product b/c now my daughter no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter has been sucking her thumb since she was born!  After a recent visit to the dentist and his suggestion that she really really needed to stop, I bought Mavala Stop!  It worked from the very first night!  She hasn&#x27;t put her thumb back in her mouth since we put the polish on there 10 days ago!  I actually only had to use the polish 3-4 times!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old was biting his nails with the gusto of a gray squirrel (Sciurus Carolinensis). We tried reasoned argument, but our words were as zephyrs in the trees. We tried other nail nibbling deterrents, but they seemed to be merely seasoning for the main course. Then Mavala entered our tiny, but oh so brightly colored world and it has proven to be the keratin crunching cure that we were hoping for. I don&#x27;t find it that offensive, but our little guy holds it in great disdain. Interestingly, if it wears off and he finds himself at the finger tip snack bar, he asks us for a re-application! Go figure, or perhaps it should be go finger. Whatever, this stuff has done the job for us, and our thanks to the Swiss for their chocolate, army knives, furtive banking and now this.</li>
            <li> I have two kids that suck their thumbs.  I&#x27;ve realized that if your child has a dull pallet i.e.  likes to eat all sorts of veggies and stuff, then this will not work.  Plus my son who has a dull pallet loves, loves to suck his thumb.  He wanted me to paint his tongue with Mavala.  While my daughter who also has been sucking her thumb for the past 5 years, and has a very sensitive pallet.  She only likes plain bread, plain pasta, white rice, etc...  She hated Mavala and her thumb sucking has subsided.</li>
            <li> If you or someone you know bites nails then you must try Mavala Stop!! We tried everything and nothing worked. After applying this product and a few habitual nail bites later my daughter stopped within a week!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is nine and has sucked her thumb every night until I bought Mavala. It goes on like nail polish. I had her try it before going to bed. The look on her face when she licked it was the best I&#x27;ve ever seen! She no longer sucks her thumb, it only took about a week to stop. The other kids tried it also. They couldn&#x27;t describe how badly it tastes. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My son is 4 and does suckle his left index finger alone of all. We use mavala stop to make him detest that habit. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> My son has completely stopped chewing on his nails.  My daughter had reverted to an old habit of sucking her index and middle finger.  After using this product they have both stopped.  She has not reverted back to sucking her fingers, but I do have to reapply it every other day on his to keep him from chewing his fingernails.  I think once we make it for 3 or 4 weeks then he will have broken the habit.  Best product we have used so far.</li>
            <li> Updated: This didn&#x27;t work. $1800 later, we now have a thumb crib. Oh well. Best to try the cheap alternatives first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works pretty well. My son is 7 and still puts his thumb in his mouth, even though he doesn&#x27;t fully suck on it. My biggest issue is that a) now that his adult teeth are coming in, he&#x27;s developing an overbite, and b) when his thumb&#x27;s in his mouth, his index finger tends to make its way into his nose (ick). My son has no idea that he even puts his thumb in his mouth, so it&#x27;s hard for him to stop on his own. This stuff tastes bad enough that, when he does bring his thumb to his mouth in those absent-minded moments, he takes it away. The hard part is remembering to reapply. The habit isn&#x27;t licked yet (no pun intended), so I need to be diligent. I don&#x27;t know if this would work for a hardcore thumb-sucker. My son is old enough to agree that he doesn&#x27;t want to suck his thumb, so we&#x27;re not really forcing anything on him by using this. It might be different with a younger kid who sees no reason to stop.</li>
            <li> I had a chronic thumb sucking child, whom had done so since birth.  I painted this on her thumb nail, and that was it!  She gave it up saying it made her thumb taste terrible.  She would literally suck her thumb while watching tv, while sleeping or anytime she became bored or anxious.  I kept waiting for her to go back to it, but she never did.  I made sure we applied this to her nail every 2 days, just to be sure it was on there.  She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  Great product.  I am still in shock it worked so fast.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this would stop my daughter from sucking her finger. I put it on and for that day she pulled her finger out as soon as she put it in. However she discovered that if she kept drinking water it would be better. Now three days later we have continued to repply but she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it anymore and thinks its a game to try and stick her fingers in my mouth. The stuff tastes bad and I don&#x27;t know how she does it but my two year old was not put off for long using this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to end nail biting or finger sucking, this is the stuff to buy. I originally bought Thum brand polish to stop my nail biting, but it wasn&#x27;t the least bit potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malava STOP, on the other hand, is so bitter that you won&#x27;t even consider putting your fingers near your mouth unless you&#x27;re eating (which can be a downside, because you may indeed get a blast of bitter while you&#x27;re eating finger foods). But I must say, it&#x27;s nice having nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product.  Buy with confidence. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product after buying or trying many products/tricks to stop may son from biting his nail. I tried it one time and he will think 100 times before putting his finger in his mouth. I don&#x27;t need to put it again and again I just tell him that if he put it again I will use Mavala on his finger and the good boy will listen.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Amazon for my four year old son. The last few months he&#x27;s been biting his fingernails until his fingers bleed, so as soon as it came I put it on his fingernails. He objected and cried, and the first day he didn&#x27;t bite his fingernails. On the second day he announced that he \\&quot;kind of likes the taste\\&quot; and has gone back to biting his nails anyway. Oh well, son 7, dad 0.</li>
            <li> trust me on this one, this stuff really works and out son stop sucking his thumb in a week.  we only applied it a few days, which was rough for him, but it was for the good.  We didnt even use the entire bottle as .3 ounces is all you need.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 11 year old son who just Loved to suck his thumb when he was&lt;br /&gt;feeling tired and ready for bed.  I heard about this product and purchased it and within days&lt;br /&gt;he stopped sucking his thumb.  All you do is brush it on the thumb nail and the medicine/smell&lt;br /&gt;does the rest. Trust me they are not going to want to put that thumb close to the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have to put it on anymore, he is all done....  Great Product - sure it would also&lt;br /&gt;work for those that bite their fingernails....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nail biting issue since I was 4 years old- I turn 32 here in less than a month so for almost 30 years I&#x27;ve been contending with this. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of cures under the sun to stop my habit but this problem was deeper than something of a simple &#x27;habit&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone reading this review and thinking of this product to stop a serious, chronic habit- I want to recommend a few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with anxiety as many nail-biters do, consider visiting your doctor, a therapist, even a psychologist. Nail-biting is a symptom, not the problem. Part of the reason I&#x27;m finally able to tackle this is that I&#x27;m not only using this product to deter me but I have now been on an anti-anxiety medication for a few months prior. This has made me far more capable in terms of trying to take these OCD habits by the horns and work them out. You need management skills, to understand antecedents to your behaviors, and how to modify those situations. So ending your nail-biting habit if anxiety related might take more than a simple paint on product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it states to use it once every other day. I use it almost every day - and become rather aware when the taste is fading and make note to keep coating it on. It&#x27;s working great, my nails are the longest they&#x27;ve EVER been, and I&#x27;m thoroughly happy even if the taste of this stuff is completely rancid. (Aka- it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep the bottle somewhere visible and where you frequently have your line of vision (but obviously away from children). For me, I set it next to my monitor screen. I&#x27;m on my computer daily - so I&#x27;m bound to notice it being right there. Don&#x27;t let it go out of sight, out of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP your nail clippers handy! Even if it seems easier just to bite or peel away an uneven bit of nail, you&#x27;ll spare most of it by just clipping off those rough edges. Sounds like common sense, I know. But anyone with an OCD habit for nail-biting understands what this refers to and how much of a &#x27;trigger&#x27; those rough nail edges are. Keep all these things available,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I also take Biotin. It&#x27;s a supplement- you can get it from any kind of drug store or Wal-Mart, etc. Read the bottles carefully, make sure you grab the one-a-day variety. You don&#x27;t want to have to pop 3 of these a day to get your recommended dosage. Biotin helps improve nail strength- and many chronic nail biters I know have flimsy nails. Mine are definitely stronger - and my hair! So double benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Stop has definitely been the best product I&#x27;ve found for deterring my nail biting. This stuff is foul and will even be obvious if you put food in your mouth with your fingers like... eating french fries might be a chore. Just a heads up. Which is good! Sometimes having our hands near our mouths like that is an unintentional antecedent. Try to use forks and spoons for your food as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!at this refers to and how much of a &#x27;trigger&#x27; those rough nail edges are.

            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!  My son who will be 5 next month has sucked his thumb since birth.  He would ALWAYS have his thumb in mouth when he woke up, during the day, at pre-school, playing, sleeping, ALWAYS!  I was at first going to purchase a product called \\&quot;thumb guard\\&quot; but it was $80.00, so I happened to come across \\&quot;MAVALA STOP\\&quot; on Amazon.  What a relief, the price was only $9.95 plus shipping.  After reading the reviews, I was convinced this was for my little guy.  I was a little hesitant because one review said there was no information in English or what the ingredients were.  That is incorrect information!  My bottle came in a box that had English directions and ingredients.  So as a consumer I was fully informed of what I had purchased.  The first day I put the MAVALA stop on his thumbs and fingers.  He sucked his thumb and got a taste and he must have spit for 3 hours straight, and the stuff would get on his food.  And he kept waking up in the night because he would go to suck his thumb like he always does, but the next day he only had a few \\&quot;nasty tastes\\&quot; and by the 3rd day, in time for school he was not sucking his thumb!!!!  He has not sucked his thumb since then, and this was the boy who was \\&quot;one with his thumb!\\&quot;  If you are going to use this to nip the thumb sucking, I recommend only putting this product on the fingernails only and not the thumb because I had to buy plastic gloves for  my son to eat his food.  And I would not put this on a child who cannot understand what is on their fingers and unable to talk fully with mommy or daddy.  THIS STUFF IS NASTY!!! And it would be cruel to put on a child who has no understanding, in my motherly opinion.  Now my little guy did throw up only once when he took this first big suck on the thumb.  So be prepared and I recommend buying a sucker for licks after your little one puts their thumb in their mouth to curb the bitter taste.  And have a wet wash cloth nearby to help at night when they wake up, with the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; on their tongue.  Sorry for the long review but I really wanted to help give parents and informed decision.ste\\&quot; on their tongue.  Sorry for the long review but I really wanted to help give parents and informed decision.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Taste is disgusting enough to deter biting. Like others have said, it can interfere with finger foods. Only problem is it isn&#x27;t as glossy a most topcoats, so a mani doesn&#x27;t look as good with this painted over.</li>
            <li> It leaves a gloss finish, which is not ideal for me as a guy.  Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem stress-biting my fingernails ever since college and continue into my professional career.  I find myself gnawing on my fingers whenever I am thinking hard on a problem or am stressed with a deadline.  I have taken to applying Mavala Stop to prevent me from this.  The benefit is two-fold, first the horrible taste immediately stops me from biting my nail and second it lets me be aware of when I&#x27;m biting my nails so I can better focus on stopping.  Point two is important because generally this is a sub-conscious habit that I believe I&#x27;ll need to consciously break.  I see noticeable improvement in my nails and in my awareness of nail-biting now, even when I haven&#x27;t recently applied Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cons to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;The taste lasts for a few days, which can be problematic as you have to plan ahead to make sure there are no activities that the taste could interfere with.&lt;br /&gt;You have to be very careful eating any sort of finger food with this on, as even the lightest touch on your lips will give you the taste and require some manner to remove it from your taste buds.&lt;br /&gt;The taste does not come out 100% with water, and leaves me with a slightly sick feeling if I cannot get it out of my mouth due to it tasting so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the cons are outweighed by the benefits and, are really necessary for what I want in the product, so I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> This works like a charm.  My little boy sucked his fingers.  We painted it on and in about 2-3 days.  He&#x27;s stopped.  It&#x27;s pretty nasty tasting.  I tried it and its a very bitter taste that actually intensifies when you drink water.  Great when nothing else works!</li>
            <li> It works very well. First day and my son is not sucking his finger.</li>
            <li> We tried this on our 3 year old -- it worked practically over night. No more thumb sucking.  However, make sure you clean off the bottle and cap before resealing it..  a year later when we brought it out to try on our next child, the cap was stuck on tight.  It took a pair of vicegrips to get it open.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, and I&#x27;d been biting my nails for roughly 20 years.  I was a serious biter/picker, too.  I constantly pulled at hangnails and my fingers were always red and inflamed.  In reflecting on my habit, I realized that biting and picking at my nails was a sort of compulsion to make things perfect, even, and smooth.  Ironically, I destroyed my nails in the process.  I look back at every picture ever taken of me, and NONE of them show my hands.  I either contort my hands so my nails are hidden, or I find some way to put my hands behind my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala has been a miracle for me.  I thought I would never stop, but I did, and I couldn&#x27;t have done it without this product.  Now, when you have a habit like I did which was so deeply ingrained and long-standing, it will certainly take more than one try to break it.  Here are my suggestions for nail-biters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Buy this or any bitter nail polish and put it on every day.&lt;br /&gt;2) Be patient with yourself.  Allow yourself to relapse and then get back on the horse.  I did--multiple times :)&lt;br /&gt;3) Stick with it--don&#x27;t skip a day because you&#x27;re tired of tasting bitter nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;4) Put hand lotion (sensitive skin type, nonscented) on ALL THE TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, leaving your nails alone is a psychological thing.  Whatever it is that prompts you to manipulate your fingers needs a different outlet.  Mavala makes this whole process much easier.  It&#x27;s like Antabuse for nail-biters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to stop biting/picking, bitter polish is absolutely the way to go.  Good luck to those who are trying to break the habit!</li>
            <li> This product worked for the first week. But than she got used to the flavor and now she sucks on her fingers no matter how much i put on them. Now it also seems like shes defiant against it just because I put it on. She looks at me with defiance and starts sucking her fingers any way. :( The reviews were so good... but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company I bought it through though was very efficient. It took a very short time to receive it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product! It is clear on the nails and has awful taste what stopped my son from biting his nails completely. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Works wonders to stop sucking thumbs!!! Only problem is if you touch food with it on your finger the bitter taste will get onto your food. Would recommend to anyone and would buy again (if i needed it) in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I received this product about three weeks ago, skeptical about whether it would work. Today? That is the furthest thought from my mind. This product WORKS. It&#x27;s that simple. The first time you bite your nails (or whatever you want to use this for really), trust me you&#x27;ll never purposefully bite into them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, the absent-minded nail biting is my real problem, been doing it for most of my life. I&#x27;ve done this exactly 3 times since I first bit into my nails, and regretted it immediately. The stuff taste absolutely horrid, and stays in your mouth for a good amount of time. Nothing can get rid of it, believe me I&#x27;ve tried (call me weak-willed, but when I first bit them I needed to get rid of that taste, I couldn&#x27;t take it). Just as a fun little story for you guys, I do this thing where I lick my nails as well. Don&#x27;t really know why, I just do - take a quick swipe of them with my hand, swiping all 5 at the same time. Well, the very first day I put that stuff on I (again, absentmindedly) took a quick double swipe of my left hand...and I don&#x27;t know how to describe exactly how badly that tasted. I don&#x27;t have the words to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails at all in about a week. There is one more thing I should tell you, though. For some reason, the stuff seems to really attach itself to my lips, even though I haven&#x27;t bitten in that amount of time. I can still sort of taste it if I lick my lips, and my girlfriend says that it really sucks to kiss me haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a winning product after I thought nothing would work.</li>
            <li> This stuff stopped a 3-year thumb sucking habit dead in it&#x27;s tracks. Our dd was addicted to her thumbs, and after trying many other things (including rewards, transferring to a different lovey, pep talks from dentist and pediatrician), we got the book &#x27;Thumb Love&#x27;, and after reading it a few times, applied just a dot to her thumbs every other day for maybe three applications. That&#x27;s it. No gagging, no crying, no fussing, just asking for a drink of water when she accidently forgot. I will say that she no longer sleeps thru the night in her own bed since no longer sucking her thumb, but that&#x27;s a different problem. :)</li>
            <li> What can I say? I have one of those kids that will do anything to suck her thumb.  It worked the first two days and then she got use to it.  I tasted it.  It&#x27;s disgusting.  I don&#x27;t know how she managed.  I wouldn&#x27;t try it again if it was on my thumb.</li>
            <li> Based on the great reviews on Amazon, I made this purchase. I painted my 3 year olds thumbnails when she was asleep and then waited....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when she woke up and stuck her thumb in her mouth her eyebrows furrowed and the thumb popped right out of her mouth. She winced and then looked at her thumb like it was a foreign object. She raised it up to me as if to say, \\&quot;WTF? This isn&#x27;t my thumb! This isn&#x27;t the thumb that I&#x27;ve been sucking for the last 2 years and have grown to love as a best friend!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was actually a bit heartbreaking to see her so sad.  But I was glad that she didn&#x27;t suck her thumb again. Her front tooth was starting to buck. Within a couple of days, she totally forgot she ever sucked her thumb. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An adult put this on his thumb just to see what it would taste like. After it dried, he stuck his thumb in his mouth and immediately pulled it out with a yelp. He said it was horrible tasting and that he couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of his mouth for at least 15 minutes. I opened a beer for him and he continued to complain that everything tasted bad now. So... with that kind of feedback, I&#x27;ve never dared to put this on my fingernails and taste it!</li>
            <li> This is just amazing! I&#x27;ve been wanting to break my daughters thumb sucking for so long and tried so many things by now that I lost hope at one time. But, by accident I found this product on amazon and in just two days my daughter stopped sucking her thumb completely. Seriously, I&#x27;m still amazed that how easily she stopped. Like the other reviewers mentioned, I used very little on her nail tip for the first time...and it worked. The first time she got a taste of it, she was like..\\&quot;its so yuckily mom\\&quot; and after that she would bring the thumb towards her mouth but stops as she remembers the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all the mommies out there.</li>
            <li> My 3-yr son stopped sucking his thumb for 3 months and then re-started and was very stubborn about quitting. Several months later I tried Mavala Stop at bed time after fun bandaids and a bitter herb product hadn&#x27;t worked. He didn&#x27;t suck his thumb going to sleep, but in the morning it was in his mouth and he told me his thumb didn&#x27;t taste yucky anymore. I checked and he was right. After that I put on two coats of Mavala Stop and it didn&#x27;t wear off so quickly. Although the instructions say paint every other day, sometimes he needs a fresh coat the next day. It&#x27;s been about a week and for the past few days I haven&#x27;t seen the thumb in his mouth! He makes a grimacing face when I hold up the Mavala Stop bottle. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a life-long nail chewer, a nervous habit I&#x27;ve tried to stop many times over the last fifty years.  I&#x27;ve tried other nail-biting treatments but nothing comes close to Mavala Stop.  This is the nastiest, most bitter taste I&#x27;ve ever encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and my nails already look - dare I say it - nice.  I am so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, touching your lips leaves the bitter taste on your lips.  Eating with your fingers will ruin the taste of whatever you&#x27;re putting in your mouth.  I wear disposable latex gloves when I&#x27;m cutting fruit/vegetables, making sandwiches, etc.  Each application lasts for about four days, the taste gradually fades but doesn&#x27;t go away completely by day four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a nail biter, cuticle chewer or have a thumb-sucking child past thumb-sucking age, this is the cure for you.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe the product is good, so many reviews cant be wrong, I even tasted it and was bitter as hell.  Somehow my kid thinks its sugar, maybe I should ask a refund on my kid...</li>
            <li> This product works great to stop thumbsucking!  There has been no thumbsucking in my house for 3 days.  I&#x27;m doing the every two day application and am very impressed.  I wish I had bought this 2 years ago.  I had tried other things, like the gloves, and nothing was working.  Thank you Mavala!</li>
            <li> The Mavala Stop is the only product that gets me to stop biting my nails because the unpleasant, bitter taste is just off putting enough.</li>
            <li> This worked for our 2 daughters. 1 sucked her thumb (4 years old) and 1 sucked her fingers (2 years old). It worked great! I kept reapplying when it would wear off and it worked! I would recommend this to anyone! I tried thumb guards and didn&#x27;t have any success with those.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 4 yr old son who was bitting his nails and it worked great!! the bitter taste make him stop the bad habit after the first application. Also used it on my daughter&#x27;s thumb trying to stop her thumb sucking habit but in this case it was not as effective, she would put the thumb in her mouth, make a \\&quot;this is so yucky \\&quot; face cause of the taste but reinsert the finger in mouth after, finallly after a combination of this product, band aids and supervision she has almost stop the thumb sucking. Overall for the price of this product it is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> My soon to be 7 year old \\&quot;was\\&quot; a thumbsucker up until 2 weeks ago. We tried everything from thumb splints, bandaids, mittens, bribes of toys, positive reinforcement but nothing would help. There is a another fingernail product out there at local dept stores that claims to have a bitter taste. I bought that only to find out it is cayenne pepper, which to me is cruel so I threw that out after trying it, and confirming it does put your mouth on fire. We brought her to the orthodontist for a consultation and they wanted $250 to glue a device in the mouth. I read it can cause soreness for several days. Then I saw this product  online, and the awful taste claim without any cayenne pepper in it, so I purchased it. We applied that to both thumbs along with a lot of positive reinforcement and encouragement (never a negative comment). It&#x27;s important kids get extra hugs and cuddle time to substitute the security their thumb provides. I tried the product and it is very nasty tasting and it linguers, but not a cruel taste. The first few days my daughter would sometimes forget and put her thumb in, and you will want water handy to wash the taste away. My daughter has been thumb free for 2 weeks, and she has broken the night time subconscious act of putting her thumb in her mouth. I can&#x27;t believe this is not available at the pharmacy. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter, I figured it was worth a try.  I applied it to both of her thumbs and let them dry.  She touched her thumbs to her other fingers.  She put her fingers in her mouth and started gagging.  I kept telling her to keep her fingers out, and she would be OK.  Then, she threw up.  About 15 minutes later, it happened again.  This product seems to be very powerful, and I really felt bad after using it, since it caused her to vomit twice.  I don&#x27;t know how many more times it would have happened had I not removed the product.  It seems to work, but with serious consequences for us...</li>
            <li> This works great!!  Within a day my son had stopped sucking his thumb; however, you should also be aware that it did make him vomit twice.  Would I recommend this product to friends?  Absolutely because my son is no longer sucking his thumb which is a habit I thought would be extremely difficult to break.</li>
            <li> My 6 year-old daughter has sucked her finger her entire life.  The dentist and orthodontist both agreed that she needed an appliance in her mouth to stop the habit as it was ruining her teeth.  I even took her to the orthodontist and had the initial consultation.  The appliance, x-rays, etc. would have cost me $300.00+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I purchased this product as a last-ditch effort.  It took me a month or two to get brave enough to put it on her nails.  It was amazing.  Within days, she completely stopped sucking her fingers.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> My six (almost) seven year old daughter could not stop sucking her thumbs (she was an ambidextrous thumb sucker!). We were ready to have the dentist install a habit appliance in her mouth which was $600. A friend of ours who is a dental hygenist gave us a bottle of Mavala STOP. It worked the first day. The taste was so horrible to our daughter that she would not suck her thumb. Every time she went to put her thumb in her mouth she would be reminded of the taste and take it out immediately. It has been two weeks and she doesn&#x27;t even try to suck her thumb anymore. I still put the Mavala on ever other day or so (after baths) because the dentist said it takes a good six months to know that you have really kicked the habit because stress, holidays, etc can cause relapse so I will us it on and off for a few months, but we are so thrilled with this product. We had tried another product and it did not work, it didn&#x27;t taste bad enough...this one is just rotten!</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money. The product does taste horrible but it doesnt last long, maybe a day depends on how much you wash your hands. I wouldnt buy it from folica. This is the second time i ordered from them and they screwed up twice. When I ordered Mavala they sent me two in differnt packages and charged me twice and twice the shipping. I refused one of the packages at the door. And was only refunded for one product but still had to pay for the shipping one both. They say they dont refund shipping. They are hard to get a hold of too. I will never order from them again.</li>
            <li> If your child is a thumb sucker you need to buy this product.  Our 3 year old was a major sucker and it took only one time, yes you read that correct, one time of putting \\&quot;clear nail polish\\&quot; to have her stop sucking her thumb!!  She is so proud of herself for stopping, and we are too!  Believe me, it is totally worth the money now, then having to pay for braces further down the road.</li>
            <li> Used for my 2 yr old daughter&#x27;s finger sucking...I only had to put it on once and she actually only tasted it maybe twice!  Very effective!  Super-fast shipping too - thanks!</li>
            <li> WOW!  What a great product!  My 3-year-old son stopped sucking his thumb permanently after just 2 weeks!  Quick and effective!</li>
            <li> I must share our story regarding this product.  My daughter is five years old and comes from a very long line of thumb-suckers (three generations that I know of).  I (her Mom) am shamed to admit I sucked my thumb until age 15 when braces prevented the practice.&lt;br /&gt;So when my daughter broke her thumb-sucking arm seven months ago, we thought surely having to wear a cast for four weeks would effortlessly break the habit for us.  We were very disappointed when as soon as the cast came off, the habit immediately continued.  I began to research other methods to help break the habit.  I found two devices which are placed over the hand/thumb, and was having such a difficult time trying to choose one that I never got around to ordering either of them.  Then one day my daughter came home from school and asked me if I had ordered the thumb cover to help her stop sucking her thumb.  So that day, I prepared to order both devices when my husband pointed out if wearing a cast for four weeks didn&#x27;t break the habit, neither will any other device we applied.  He made a valid point.  However after reading some of the reviews for Mavala Stop I was concerned this was too strong and bordered on \\&quot;child abuse\\&quot; as one reviewer put it. Even my own Mom had applied a few products to my thumb as a child, but I simply washed it off.  Out of desperation we ordered it, of course tasting it before applying it to our child.  But the miracle is, it worked!  My daughter has not sucked her thumb since that day now five months ago.  We even prepared for middle of the night awakenings (some parents recommended having juice near the bed with which to rinse out the taste) but we didn&#x27;t even have those issues!  The taste is unpleasant, but not so much that I would call it child abuse by any means.  Some people may have a stronger reaction to this product than others, so I am not discrediting those who feel this product is too bitter.  But I absolutely suggest trying it.  The cost makes it a very inexpensive trial.  At the risk of sounding corny: One bottle of Mavala Stop- eight dollars; Having my daughter feel proud of herself for breaking a very difficult and embarrassing habit, PRICELESS. Good luck to you all- Mrs. Pve trial.

            <li> So far Mavala is working to help my just turned three yr old stop sucking her middle two fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been a two-finger sucker since birth and we got her to only do it at nap and bedtime about a year ago.  We have been starting to see the affects of all of the sucking in her teeth (the top teeth or sticking farther out) and the huge callous on her middle finger.  Our dentist recommended giving her a day (third birthday for example)that her fingers would \\&quot;taste bad\\&quot; and wouldn&#x27;t suck anymore.  Of course, that is easier said than done.  After reading all of the reviews for this product we decided to try it for our daughter.  The first night we did it she gagged until she almost threw up and then cried for hours that she was sick, but no sucking!  We reapplied the product every day for the first week and it was a tough week on all of us.  She didn&#x27;t suck her fingers, but she didn&#x27;t sleep either.  She is gradually getting adjusted so sleep is returning, but she still isn&#x27;t sucking.  We haven&#x27;t applied the product for a week now and just a few days ago she tried sucking and told me it wasn&#x27;t as bad.  I reapplied it and she is doing fine and not sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mother I feel for all of us trying to use this product to break a bad habit.  I don&#x27;t like having to resort to this, but I felt that the consequences of the sucking was worse that a few days of discomfort and bad taste.  My husband and I both tried it before we put it on her fingers and have to agree the taste is attrocious!  The bottle has more than enough in it to last for what we need and the product does work for us.  Mavala is working for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This worked great for the first couple of weeks until my 3 year old figured out that if he peeled if off he could continue chewing his fingernails.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything short of an appliance to stop my two children from sucking their thumb and fingers.  The sucking was causing them to frequently be sick with colds.  Friend recommended this product.  From the moment we applied, about 1 month ago, they have not put their fingers back in their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to end finger sucking right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Hill</li>
            <li> My almost 5 year old daughter had sucked her thumbs from birth and nothing we did would make her stop.  So, I found this product on Amazon and decided to try it out.  I figured if it didn&#x27;t work, I was only out $[...] plus shipping.  Well, it has been 3 1/2 weeks and she no longer sucks her thumb!  We still put it on every few days, just to remind her.  But she really has no desire to suck her thumb!  It is awesome.  Now, here is the kicker....I have bitten my nails FOREVER!!! And I made a deal with my daughter that I would use this to stop with her.  Well, happy to report that I no longer bit my nails!  This stuff works because it tastes REALLY horrible.  It doesn&#x27;t transfers to food that I am cooking and I cook everyday.  It does wash off if you regularly wash dishes by hand, so I just apply daily.  I completely and totally recommend this stuff.  But remember it tastes terrible, I mean really terrible.</li>
            <li> This product definitely has helped my three year old break the thumb sucking habit, but it should be used cautiously.  The first time I put it on her thumbs, I painted the entire nail. She complained all day about the \\&quot;yuckies\\&quot; whenever her thumb accidently touched her lips (for example when she was eating her snack using her fingers). At bedtime, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and got a full taste which caused her to gag and throw up several times. (This is the simplified version of the story! You really don&#x27;t want all the details of the hour long ordeal!) Of course, this product is not designed to come off easily (the instructions say to apply every TWO DAYS!) so I had to figure out how to get her through the night. I finally used nail polish remover to try to remove the product from her thumbs. I&#x27;m not sure if it worked, or if my daughter was just too traumatized to put her thumb in her mouth after that, but she didn&#x27;t gag or throw up again. Now, I do still use the product but I only apply a very small amount to the tip of her thumb nail.  As a side note, while preventing her from sucking her thumb, it also has effected her eating habits. Any time she eats anything with her fingers and gets a tast of the Mavala Stop product, she decides that she no longer likes that particular food! So, if you plan to use this on a young child, you might want to start out applying a minimal amount to the tip of the thumbnail, and be aware that the effects may be more far-reaching than you intend.</li>
            <li> I bought this to stop my 4-year-old son from sucking his thumb. It worked like magic the first 2 days, but then I guess he got used to it, because it works for about 10 minutes after application then he&#x27;s back to sucking his thumb. It definitely tastes bad. I guess it depends how dedicated your kid is to sucking his thumb! It&#x27;s worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> My daughter was 7 years old and could not break the thumb sucking habit. I could tell she was frustated too. Like many other parents I tried everything; from the sock to tape to hot sauce, but nothing worked. Her new teeth were starting to come out with a gap. Them somebody told me about Mavala Stop and I decided to try. It was the best advice I could ever get. It took her only one night to put her thumb (with Mavala) back in her mouth and she never didn&#x27;t again. The taste is so bitter that she wouldn&#x27;t dare to suck her tumb again. The good news her teeth went back to the right position and she feels much more confident too. I would recomend Mavala Stop to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for most, although the contents (ingredients)are a little scary, by the second day my two year old learned to have an aquired tatse for the product.  It is very nasty and fowl tasting and will probably work for most, just not my stubborn child.</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s supposed to. You can get used to the taste in low concentrations of the polish and relapse. To fix that make sure you regularly reapply.</li>
            <li> I used this for my two and half year old daughter who has been sucking thumb ever since she was a week old and had started to use her thumb sucking as a weapon because she knew it irritated us. First time I applied it and she tasted it, she threw her thumb out but since it was night time and she couldn&#x27;t fall asleep without thumb she put it back in and I thought \\&quot;this is not going to work\\&quot;. 5 minutes later she threw up everything and I got scared, but thought of applying it one more time and it worked. First week she cried every night because she didn&#x27;t get her soothing, but a week later she even stopped trying to put her thumb in mouth. I didn&#x27;t have to apply it more than 5 times. So I would definitely recommend this product if you have a constant thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> This product really relieved alot of stress for my husband and I.  I tried it myself first just too make sure my child would not get sick.  we had tried another product but, made her very sick.  After a couple of days she is no longer putting her fingers in her mouth.  We owe it all to Mavala, thanks it really works.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a 21 yr old male that has bitten his nails all his life, i just haev to say that this product realy worked wonders. so first of all you must have the resolve to stop. nail biting happens when triggered by something, and so you put the hand in your mouth and u start biting subconciously. so u must have the resolve to stop when you actually notice any biting. this product just reminds you that you have your fingers in your mouth, after that you must stop urself from biting.this isnt a miracle product that changes how you think and react, that is all you, this is merely a product that reminds you to change your habits. i see reviews on here saying it didnt work i just kept on biting, well that&#x27;s because you expected it to change you, instead of thinking that this is a quick fix, think of it as a post-it on every 1 of your fingers. i recommend this to everyone out there that is just sick and tired of biting their nails</li>
            <li> We have been trying to get our daughter to stop sucking her fingers for several years.  When some other kindergarteners made fun of her I knew we had to somehow end the habit.  The Mavala stop nail biting product worked instantly, I only had to reapply once and she was done!  I would highly recommend to anyone with a similar problem!</li>
            <li> We tried THUM with no success.  This product worked much much better, lasted longer, and tasted much worse. I actually made a deal with my 3 year old that I would stop biting my nails while she stopped sucking her thumb - so we helped each other. Plus she had a daily calendar that she got stickers on whenever she went through the day without sucking her thumb. The combination of it all worked.  Within about 2-3 weeks, it was no longer a habit... for either of us.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would say this stuff taste like garbage, but it makes you want to stay away from the thumb.  I put it on my sons nails and it lasted 2 to 3 days for one aplication and kept him from sucking his fingers. Job well done.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Taste the Mavalaaaa!&amp;#34; is what my husband screams when he accidentally puts his nails in his mouth. He is a chronic nail biter who always gnaws his claws down to the quick, and so he&#x27;s never had the white show on his fingernails before. After using Mavala every day for a couple of weeks, his nails were long enough that he actually needed to cut them with clippers! I was ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait! There&#x27;s more! It&#x27;s not just a temporary fix. After those weeks of regular use, he had become completely conditioned (read: disgusted) to stop biting his nails, even once we ceased applying the Mavala. It forced him to acknowledge his subconscious habits, and the bitter taste was unpleasant enough to deter him from idly biting his nails. Truly the miraculous cure you&#x27;ve been needing for you or your loved one&#x27;s nail biting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about this product: It comes in a nail polish-style bottle with an applicator brush in the cap. It also applies much like a clear coat nail polish, not like a thin liquid, as I originally thought it would. As such, it adheres to the nail like a glue, making it pretty difficult to wipe, lick or wash off by accident (or on purpose, muahaha). You need to use only a little bit, on the edge of your nail (if you&#x27;re a biter). One application will last you the entire day, sometimes a little into day two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for success with this product: Just remember that any bad habit dies hard. We purchased Mavala several months ago and stopped using it when my husband stopped biting. He went several bite-free months, but since then, times have been stressful at work and he occasionally relapses into nail-biting. If this happens to you, immediately go back to Mavala! Always keep it handy. Put it in your desk at work or keep it in your purse or car. Just remind yourself how horrible it tastes! You&#x27;re much better off with this stuff to help you stop chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also try applying it earlier in the day, before you go to work/school/places where you tend to bite your nails the most. Avoid eating finger foods and touching your lips (or at least be very careful)! Popcorn, pizza, sandwiches, etc. are a nightmare to eat with Mavala on. Even if you are behaving, the flavor tends to rub off on anything you touch. My husband has even given me a hello kiss after a long day at work where he struggles with biting his nails. Even THAT brief contact transferred the taste of Mavala to my lips, blegh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I cannot testify to any of its other uses (such as to deter thumb sucking), but I do highly recommend it to anyone with a nail-biting problem. Be consistent, have the discipline to apply it every day, and correct yourself when you catch your bad behaviors. You will have healthy nails in no time! :)ool/places where you tend to bite your nails the most. Avoid eating finger foods and touching your lips (or at least be very careful)!

            <li> I read all the \\&quot;great\\&quot; reviews and was hopeful this would help my[...] daughter stop sucking her thumb.  The very first night I used it, she was sucking her thumb within 2 hours.  I have tried it for 4 nights and applied more each night, but it did not help.  This product may be helpful for those who bite their nails, but did nothing to prevent my child from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding!, April 26, 2009&lt;br /&gt;By  Kristopher E. Acebo - See all my reviews&lt;br /&gt;(REAL NAME)&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter was 5 years old and had sucked her thumb since birth. We tried many different things to get her to stop, reward charts, painting nails with regular nail polish. When the dentist told us that if she didn&#x27;t stop soon her jaw and teeth would be permanently malformed and recommended a dental device, we sought out another less expensive and less obstructive product. We applied it to both of our daughters thumbs and within a few days she had stopped sucking her thumb. Our daughter was ready and willing to stop sucking her thumb she just really needed an occasional reminder for zone out times like when watching t.v. or falling asleep. Amazing product for those kids who want to stop, but just need some extra help.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d ever get my daughters (especially my 5 year old) to quit sucking her finger! But, Mavala had great reviews so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. It worked. She hasn&#x27;t sucked her finger in almost a year, so I&#x27;m sure the habit has been broken by now. I kept putting it on even after she had seemed to have control over the habit...as a reminder. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped me grow my nails out. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for as long as I remember and as soon as I got engaged I knew I didn&#x27;t want everyone to see my nails in their pathetic state. I ordered this and used it for about a month on my nails, applying every few days. It tastes SO horrible but really helps. Only thing to watch out for is eating foods with your hands because you will definitely get a taste of this stuff!! I highly recommend trying this if you&#x27;re a nail biter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails my whole life, and I never thought I would be able to stop. I used this stuff for about 2 weeks, and I never bit my nails once because of how disgusting it is. The first time I put it on, my mom tried it and was trying everything to get the taste out of her mouth. Seeing her reaction was enough for me not to test it. At first, if I instinctively put my fingers on my lips and then licked my lips, I tasted it - and it is AWFUL! I would taste it while eating sometimes, which was just another reminder to not bite my nails. The only negative thing I have to say about my experience was that I could still bite the skin at the end of my nail bed, but that&#x27;s only because nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on skin very well. It took some will power to stop biting at my skin, but after not biting my nails that skin grew over and I didn&#x27;t do it anymore. If I get that urge to bite my nails again, I will apply this polish immediately. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop biting their nails. Now, I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed of my hands :)</li>
            <li> Wow. This stuff actually works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter that started to bite her nails and it was getting very bad.  I put on just one coat every couple of days and it dramatically improved the biting.  It actually stopped.  You need to make sure to apply it every couple of days though because it will come off and biting could start again.  We actually painted over the clear polish with her favorite colors and bam! All done it has worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> perfect things I never heard It is doing well in my family we all love it. thank you so much</li>
            <li> Stopped my daughter&#x27;s habit in 1 day. The taste was so bad that she threw up, but it worked!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there was anything that would so effectively and safely discourage thumb-sucking, but this product did.  Almost instantaneously, my daughter had a strong aversion to it&#x27;s taste, and is now more focused on not sucking her thumb.  We did need to apply it to her fingers as well, because she tried to bypass it, but quickly realized that would not work.  I like that this product stays on a for a few days like a nail polish, and can&#x27;t be wiped off, as some enterprising kids will try to do.  Overall, an A+!</li>
            <li> As advertized, great product!</li>
            <li> Works great at preventing my daughter from chewing her nails. Only downfall is you have to apply it every couple of days.</li>
            <li> this works wonders!  My daughter will not suck her thumb or bite her nails while this is applied.  It lasts a couple of days, so you don&#x27;t have to apply every day.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f32b3f349519d068356e0d5b90856d76]] I bought this to put on my Fiancee&#x27;s fingernail since she bites them constantly.&lt;br /&gt;When applied, the first day it works great and tastes horribly bitter. However, after the second or third day, she&#x27;s biting them again. I would think that this should last longer than just a day.&lt;br /&gt;I would say to consider this product if you want something that tastes bitter. While the bitterness disappears after a day or two, the polish aspect of it seems to stick around for awhile.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my daughter twice now - when she was younger I used it to help her to stop sucking her thumb and now I have used it to help her to stop biting her nails.  I have recommended this to several people!</li>
            <li> this does taste horrible but if you use your fingers when eating then you probably will not want to eat. my son is a thumb sucker and I tried this on him, I felt so bad because he still is learning how to use a spoon and at times uses his hands-- well he didn&#x27;t eat becuase he was trying to get that nasty taste away from his mouth. Now, With me I wash my hands a lot so everyday I would have to re-apply this polish</li>
            <li> I applied mavala stop on my three year old daughter&#x27;s thumb and it didn&#x27;t work for her.  The first day she was a bit upset that her thumb tastes different but from next day onwards, it does not bother her at all.  I tried repeated application of this product on her thumb but she is fine with it.  I am wondering if this product looses its bitter taste as time goes by?</li>
            <li> After putting off purchasing this item I finally bought it. The dentist said my daughter&#x27;s teeth formation was being changed by her thumb sucking. I had hoped she would stop on her own but it took about a week of this to end it. She hated the taste enough to stop. Wish I bought years prior.</li>
            <li> I applied this product to his thumb once.  He gagged everytime he put his thumb in his mouth.  Then he threw up all over everything.  From all the reviews I didn&#x27;t know this product did this.  If you do a search on Google, and type Mavala Stop vomit you will find articles on this.</li>
            <li> Works great! Didn&#x27;t expect such great result!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, but it&#x27;s not strong enough to keep him from biting his nails. It also seems to wash off much more easily than I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> The bitter taste of this product last in your mouth for a long time.  My 4 year-old daughter has just about stop sucking her thumb.  If your child resist having the polish put on you can apply it while they sleep.  The only drawback is that my daughter uses her hands to eat a lot.  Therefore, she gets the taste of this nasty polish in her mouth and I believe it discourages her from eating as much.  It&#x27;s a great way to get kids to use utensils!</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm. I had so much anxiety about getting my son to stop sucking his finger and it was really a piece of cake. He was very agreeable to the process so that probably helped too. I think he only put his finger in his mouth twice once we started applying the product. Previously he was sucking his finger off and on all day long. After 9 days he didn&#x27;t even need to have it on his finger anymore. It was that easy!</li>
            <li> At the very least, it reminds you that your fingers are in your mouth. Downside, you have to avoid finger foods with it on or the taste will overrun the food.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and have been biting my nails off and on my whole life.  This stuff works very well, has a uniquely bitter, and lingering taste.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and I still bite my nails/surrounding skin. I bought Mavala stop about 2 weeks ago. I apply it to my fingers in the morning everyday and inevitably end up biting a finger once -- and the taste it leaves on my mouth/mind keeps me away from biting for the rest of the day. It&#x27;s useful, and cheap.</li>
            <li> Got this product for my daughter - she says something is finally working!....taste is totally disgusting...biting is getting less and less.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li> bit my nails for 27 years before getting \\&quot;Stop\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a couple of weeks with the product I was able to stop using it, and haven&#x27;t bitten my nails for 6 months.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be so easy.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of times before.  I&#x27;m very proud of myself, and wish other people cared to pat me on the back for something which seems so inconsequential to them.  Highly reccomend Mavala.  I bought the .3oz (10ml) bottle, and didn&#x27;t even put a dent in it it looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small note: pretty much a finger food killer.  on the plus side, it&#x27;s pretty fun to shove your fingers into significant others&#x27; mouths and ruin their night.</li>
            <li> Our boy liked to bite his shirt collar. We put this on the shirt collar (it won&#x27;t wash out, use it on a shirt they have already chewed up). He hated the taste but it wasn&#x27;t harsh on him or anything, we just made sure we keep water with us in case he forgot and put his shirt in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I hated the fact that my toddler has been sucking her thumb since she was an infant, all I could constantly think about was her teeth, her hands always being wet and stinky or her always getting sick in school from having her fingers in her mouth!  I put the Mavala Stop on her thumb, she took a taste and has not put her thumb back in her mouth since!! I was a skeptic, but it worked very well, and I am so happy it did!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 4th product I&#x27;ve used to try an stop my 18 year nail biting habit. The first three weren&#x27;t very effective as I&#x27;d just bite through the taste. However, Mavala Stop worked wonders. The taste isn&#x27;t so bad that it&#x27;ll make you sick but it&#x27;s bad enough that it&#x27;ll make your subconscious stop biting your nails! Whenever I was bored I found myself biting my nails without even realizing it but now it never happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using the product I realized I hadn&#x27;t bit my nails at all because every time I&#x27;d go to the taste would stop me immediately. Its been over a month now and my nails look way better! This is my first Amazon review and I just feel like I have to write it because for years I&#x27;ve wanted to stop biting my nails and and I thought it was impossible to stop. I haven&#x27;t even used Mavala since the 2nd week of having it and I have yet to bite my nails WITHOUT IT ON in 3 weeks now. That&#x27;s how good it was! I used it for 2 weeks (I&#x27;m 24 and have been biting my nails since I was 6) and my 18 year old habit was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this if you want to stop! It works! Just remember to reapply it every 2-3 days in the beginning. I promise you this will work unless you have no taste buds!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember (I&#x27;m in my 20s) and I really wanted to kick the habit so I bought this product a few months ago.  After I got the product, I used it every day/ every other day.  About four finger nails had been growing pretty well (I was still biting the rest of them) but after the third week I went back to biting all of them.  Even though the taste is disgusting (and my boyfriend threatened to not kiss for a significant amount of time if he could taste it on my lips), the taste didn&#x27;t bother me as much after a couple weeks.  I really want my nails to grow out and I wish this could do the trick!</li>
            <li> I have ordered two bottles because I keep giving them away.  It has been the only thing that has helped my 10 year old to stop sucking his thumb or fingers.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so awful, if you even touch your lips with your fingertips you will taste that strong bitter taste, which is great for diehard nail biters like me! You have to keep reapplying it every few days or so.</li>
            <li> I brought this product last month for my 6 yr old daughter whom was a thumb sucker. My daughter stopped sucking her thumb after the first application. I still put in on her fingers once week night to be  on the safe side. I should have bought this a year ago.</li>
            <li> My daughter is always biting her nails. At first, I was not sure if this would really work but it does. I must say, I have to go into her room when she is sleeping and put it on. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My nearly 8-year old son was a habitual thumb-sucker before I found Mavala Stop. He wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but was willing to give it a shot. He&#x27;s 3 weeks thumb-free now and looks to have overcome his addiction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very bitter and lasts a couple of days before needing re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re simply amazed how effective Mavala Stop is and give it an enthusiastic \\&quot;thumbs up!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had a problem biting my nails and decided to buy this product after reading the reviews and I am very pleased with the result. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in over 3 weeks but its so bitter that if I mistakenly put my finger in my mouth I shudder from the bitterness. On the downside, everything you touch with your bare hands becomes extremely bitter so I now have to eat things like a sandwich or chicken with gloves. I have decided to get one for my 6 year old niece and 4 old nephew that suck their thumbs. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll love it : )</li>
            <li> My kids were stubborn - -tried everything including the nail biter formula at Walgreens.  This stuff was fantastic, though there were several nights I had to get up and get one of the kids a cracker or something b/c they accidentally put their fingers in their mouths and could not get the taste out. It is powerful stuff, but if you have stubborn kids, it is just what you need.</li>
            <li> Sure, his nails would avoid being bitten, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth it if it makes your kid throw up. I will be returning it and definitely not suggesting to anyone else despite the many good reviews. Poor little guy! :(</li>
            <li> Before you put this on your child&#x27;s fingers you must taste this for yourself.  If you cannot bring yourself to taste this then you shouldn&#x27;t put this on your child&#x27;s fingers.  I put this on my child&#x27;s nails before I tasted this and once I tasted this I removed it off of my two year old daughters fingers.  Both my wife and I would rather use a less horrible solution, such as Thum than subject anyone to this taste.  My daughter quit eating my wife&#x27;s freshly baked sugar cookies the moment her fingers touched her mouth.  She became very distraught to the taste of the Mavala on her fingers and we had to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I feel the use of this product is a form of child abuse.</li>
            <li> Thanks to MAVALA i have broken my 27 years nail biting habbit. For the past two months i have not bitten(i dare not) my nail and they look good now.</li>
            <li> It is so nasty that it works!!! Tastes horrible!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> GET THIS! I have been biting my nails since I was 4 years old and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where I bit nails, the skin around my nails, the surface of my nails, and I had bites going down my entire thumb! I used this and within three weeks I saw pretty amazing progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail biting is definitely still a habit that&#x27;s hard to shake but this product helps way more than what it costs. You only need to apply it every 3 days, and it can last half a year if you put the optimal amount on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes like absolute s*** though, the most bitter thing you&#x27;ve ever tasted. You will have to adapt eating finger foods after using this product. Most finger foods aren&#x27;t a problem but licking your fingers is terrible. It&#x27;s weird but I use chopsticks a lot to eat finger foods now. Keeps my hands clean though, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> It worked too well. Used it only once for a thumb sucking toddler and that was all it took.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! My 2 year old twin girls used to suck their thumb almost all day long!!! After using this for 2 weeks they stopped completely!!! I would recommend this!!</li>
            <li> works for trying to get 4 year old to stop sucking her fingers - but need constant reapplication</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this company did to the formula compared to years ago but it has changed.  I remember the first bottle I ever bought and it instantly cured over 30 years of constant nail biting.  The taste would stay on my nails for up to a week, even with two showers a day and multiple hand washings.  The taste was horrific and it did not take but a few times of biting my nails out of habit to have my mouth in rough shape for quite some time.  The last two bottles I have bought are nothing like that.  I can literally wear it off in less than two days through my normal routine of hand washing and two showers per day.  It comes off so quickly that you will gradually get conditioned to the taste the more subtle it becomes until you&#x27;re back to biting your nails even with the slight taste of the product.  I will be searching for another alternative despite having such amazing success years ago.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything to get our 6 year old to quit sucking here thumb.  And then we tried Mavala.  Within 10 days she quit sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an awful taste in your mouth (which is good!!) I pay more attention to when i am biting my nails now. I catch myself more and more. I think this will help me quit!!! :D</li>
            <li> My four year old was having a difficult time with sucking his thumb. My husband and I had tried several other strategies including a thumb guard, which was not successful at all as he would take it off during the night. I finally ordered Mavala Stop and applied it to the preferred thumb as instructed on the packaging. Assuming I would need to reapply in two nights, as instructed, I figured it would be a week or two before success would be achieved, but it WORKED with only ONE use! My son struggled to get to sleep the first night, upset with the bitter taste each time he attempted to suck his thumb, however by the next night, it was no longer an issue. He was not sucking his thumb throughout the day, during his nap at preschool or at night....the habit was CURED and he was so PROUD of himself! It was great to hear him boasting about his accomplishment to everyone and I have raved about this product ever since! I would encourage anyone looking to stop thumb/finger sucking and/or nail biting to TRY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> This did not work for my 3.5 year old daughter, but I think it&#x27;s due more to the fact that she is very stubborn. I applied every other day, but she still chewed on her nails. I think I will try again but apply everyday this time.</li>
            <li> My eleven year old finally stopped biting her nails because of this product.  She said it didn&#x27;t taste awful, but tasted bad enough to act as a reminder that she was biting her nails.  So it works!</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old grandson was still sucking his thumb, just weeks away from starting kindergarten. We knew he would be teased, but nothing could persuade him to quit. We&#x27;ve been putting Mavala Stop on both thumbs for two weeks now (just in case he decided to switch thumbs), and the habit is almost a thing of the past. At first, we put mittens on him at night, but now he doesn&#x27;t even need that. During the day,he has made no attempt to suck his thumb at all, and he goes days at a time now without putting his thumb in his mouth during sleep. If he does, it wakes him up, and he immediately gets up to brush his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was doubtful Mavala Stop would work, since we had read that it&#x27;s not successful with everyone, but I&#x27;m thrilled to say that it worked like a charm for us. I&#x27;m even more pleased at how proud he is that he&#x27;s quit.</li>
            <li> We used this on my daughter when she was 7.  It tastes TERRIBLE!  It is so bad that she couldn&#x27;t eat finger foods because the taste would transfer - she had to eat sandwiches with a fork ;) And it&#x27;s not just the taste.  It has an after taste that lingers for the longest time (I licked her nail once to see for myself).  The first night that she wore it she woke me up and said every time she falls asleep, she puts her thumb in her mouth and the taste wakes her up.  So, she wore gloves to bed for a few days.  Anyhow, after just 2 applications (about 2 weeks), she didn&#x27;t need it anymore.  The company says to re-apply every 2 days but we could get away with almost a week. It was great!  It&#x27;s been 6 months now and she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> My kids dentist recommended this stuff.  I have to say that it has been pretty impressive.  So much so that I have recommended to all the moms and dads in the neighborhood with thumb suckers.  We have a block full of recovering thumb suckers now..hahaha.  It works.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is a chronic nail biter.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Worked the first time I put it in my 5 year old finger nails - roughly 5 weeks ago and never looked back!  This product is an amazing deterrent and cheap!  I put in on my son&#x27;s fingernails every other day the first week, every 3 days the second week, once a week the third week and up to present.  My son is so proud of his accomplishment.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for my four year old.  She likes to suck on two of her fingers on a particular hand and we had hoped to help her to stop.  We explained to her while we waited for the product to arrive what would happen and she was very excited and happy.  She has made comments that she wants to stop to.  When we got the product we applied it to her fingers and it did taste nasty.  It worked great for the first day.  But while the box says to apply every two days, we discovered on the second day that it needed to be applied every 12 hours and then by the third day every 8.  And by the fourth, it seemed to not have an effect on her at all.  She may have gotten used to the taste or it may have been washing off, but either way, by the fourth day it wasnt working. A habit supposedly takes 21 days to break, but we didnt even make it past 4. I would not recommend this for a younger person. It may work on an adult though.</li>
            <li> I am more of the older person who still bites :( but this stuff has me seeing the whites of my nails for the first time in years. I usually look at my nails like this, 2 good 8 bad. Yes i have all 10 still i haven&#x27;t gotten that bitey. With this stuff I have been averaging 8-9 good and 1 sacrificial, but  i think in due time i will get to 10, its just had when you have never had nails since you were ...ever.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great at first.  Then my child figured how to peel it off - just like nail polish. After that it was not so effective. If I apply it while the kid is asleep, the effects last longer.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is now 2 years old. He started to bite his nails when he turned a year and 5 months... I only found out about Mavala in August and I am soo happy to say he has stopped after only 10 application from august till now...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for my son. I put several coats of the product on and he still kept biting his nails... it didn&#x27;t even phase him.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a way to work on weaning my son from his thumb sucking habit. I asked our dentist what he would recommend, and he said Mavala Stop is the only thing he&#x27;s been able to find that works! It&#x27;s been successful for us so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes of breaking my daughter (6yrs old) of sucking her thumb. I have used it now for well over 8 months and WHEN it is on her thumb it works pretty good. The only problem is it wears off after a bit. I would think after months of using it she would&#x27;ve stopped sucking her thumb. Well, not quite. I caught the little princess with her thumb (by her mouth she says - it was definitely inside). So I&#x27;m not sure I would pick this again although, not really sure there is another alternative. It did make my 2 yr old throw up the first time I put it on his thumb and he sucked it.</li>
            <li> Stuff works what else can I say.  Tastes like crap really grabs your attention as to what you are doing.</li>
            <li> If I were you, I would think this was a shill review. I assure you, it&#x27;s not. My son was a compulsive thumb sucker. Even during a school play he paused mid sentence to suck his thumb. Nothing we tried worked. For years we stupidly trusted mommy blogs that encouraged readers to avoid polish methods for thumb sucking. Finally, our ped dentist nicely told us he was destroying his mouth and gently insisted we stop listening to mommy bloggers and use this product. No joke, one application. One! &amp;#60;- you&#x27;re reading that right. We put the polish on his thumb before breakfast, and on the way to school he says &amp;#34;Mommy, I don&#x27;t want to suck my thumb any more. It tastes icky&amp;#34;. What I said: &amp;#34;That&#x27;s sounds like a great choice&amp;#34; what I was thinking: &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it&amp;#34;. No joke, the boy has not sucked his thumb since that proclamation. Between breakfast and the ride to school, my son quit sucking his thumb thanks to this product. I Highly recommend &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34;. On the down side I have this nearly full bottle about to go waste.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. My 4 year old son stopped sucking his thumb in 2 days. Prior to getting Mavala I explained to him that it was going to help him stop sucking his thumb. I told him that it tastes very nasty and I think that scared him. When he actually tasted him he didn&#x27;t like it and he stopped sucking his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to inform your child about what Mavala is for and see if it helps like it did for my son.</li>
            <li> This stuff is disgusting!!! So it works perfectly, haha. I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for 15 years and this kicked me off the habit.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;I did recently start again because of anxiety but will use this again to stop.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot from this product but not working for me. My son is a thumb shucker but the bitter test of the product don&#x27;t stop him to shuck. My bed luck.😑</li>
            <li> Works, it tastes SOOOO bad. I am 21 and bite my nails when i get stressed about something. This prevents me from biting them cause it taste horrible. and it LAST long, it could last maybe 3 days (unless you are soaking htem in water like in a pool, it will fade faster) but for best results if you apply it every 2 days that would be best, but it could last for 3 days.</li>
            <li> Cured my 5 and 7 year olds within a week. Neither suck their thumb anymore. The nice thing about this product is that it works while they&#x27;re sleeping too!</li>
            <li> I am 14 years old and still have problems sucking my thumb along with biting my nails. This product works great and it tastes horrible, kinda like nail polish remover,(I got some in my mouth when i was little). The only thing that you have to really do with this product is apply it one a week because the taste fades away after about 5 days. Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> this product is working like a miracle on my song habit. hope when i stop, the bad habit will not comes back</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve found this product useful to us as a family... for the pricetag you shouldn&#x27;t expect much but if its worth stopping a bad habit what could you lose?</li>
            <li> My son is 10 and had the habit of biting his nails as he lay in bed trying to sleep.  He wanted to stop and this product was just the reminder he needed.  There were a few instances where finger foods led to an accidental taste, but that also was quickly self correcting.  A great product, in my opinion, that performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> The taste is like metallic fish fermented in death. It will work, but like quitting anything, you must make an effort because even the most stubborn nail biter could work through a coat of fermented death.</li>
            <li> Amazing my 3 years old daughter stop biting her nails within A WEEK. I try it myself first it has a very bitter taste &amp; it works for her, thank you.</li>
            <li> This works immediately and I can tell when it&#x27;s time to put more Mavala on because my daughter starts sucking her thumb again. It works every time and it even works when my daughter is asleep.</li>
            <li> Mom of four here, and all of them suck either thumbs or fingers! I&#x27;ve tried other products similar to this and they have all failed.. Even bought them gloves! This was recommended by my children&#x27;s dentist and I&#x27;m very happy I gave it a shot! No more finger/thumb suckers here!</li>
            <li> This worked great! It really does taste terrible though. The first time my son used it, he did throw up, but it worked to stop his thumb sucking. The only complaint that I have is that our bottle glued itself shut. If I can&#x27;t get the bottle open, I will be ordering a second bottle for my daughter that bites her nails.</li>
            <li> We had been struggling to get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  She was 8 years old and had no intention of stopping on her own.  It was affecting her school work because as soon as her thumb went into her mouth (and her other hand would twirl her hair), she would completely zone out and not hear a thing the teacher was saying.  Her thumb sucking was her &#x27;happy place&#x27; and she wasn&#x27;t about to give that up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had tried the Thum stuff . . . it was &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; but it would wear off within a couple hours.  Since I couldn&#x27;t re-apply it while she was at school, it was a big failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having read the other reviews of this product, when we got it I started out with just a dab on her nail.  That was enough!!!  She absolutely hated the taste.  I always knew when she accidentally stuck her thumb in her mouth because she would come running in the room yelling &amp;#34;Drink!  Drink!  Drink!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts!  We only applied it every other day (or even every third day), and as I said . . . just a dab on the nail.  No need to coat the entire thing like I did with Thum.  It was only about two weeks later when she told me &amp;#34;Mom, I don&#x27;t suck my thumb anymore!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go without reapplying for a few days to see.  Sure enough, I never saw her suck her thumb again!  Even when she is tired and zoning out and doing her playing-with-her-hair thing that always went with the thumb sucking . . . her thumb never goes into her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 6 months since we used it and now my only problem is . . . what do I do with a nearly full bottle of Mavala Stop that I don&#x27;t need any more?!  :-)</li>
            <li> The absolutely awful taste of this stuff lasts and lasts. What I like is that nail biting is a habit and it occurs with no thought at all. Believe me, you will immediately know if you have started to bite your nails. UGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been a determined nail biter for years.  I tried thum and it did not work, mostly because it comes off. This is a polish.  The only bad thing, which is really a good thing, is that I no longer lick my fingers when I&#x27;m eating (ok, admit it, you do it too with fried chicken). also, I have to brush my teeth more often because if I do stick my fingers in my mouth I end up with a bad taste in my mouth, which I am guessing equates to bad breath too. It&#x27;s GREAT.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 year old daughter who was biting her nails. It did not work right away but I don&#x27;t blame this stuff. I tasted it and it tastes awful so I can&#x27;t say this stuff doesn&#x27;t do what its supposed to do. After a few weeks of applying this stuff every other day she has reduced the amount she bites her nails but she still bites them. I don&#x27;t know if its been this stuff that has helped or us telling her to stop every time we see her hand her in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this stuff over the cayenne pepper stuff, that didn&#x27;t work at all, wasn&#x27;t strong and wouldn&#x27;t have stopped me either.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product and read all the reviews about it.  We tried it on our almost 3 yr old son and unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.  He would just wait for it to dry up and his thumb was back in his mouth again.  I think he&#x27;s just too stubborn.  We will try again when he&#x27;s older and be able to understand better.  I haven&#x27;t given up yet...</li>
            <li> Works great the stop eating there nails my 6 and 11 years old boys. At works good but you need to do it every week</li>
            <li> We bought this for our kid, who was developing a nail biting habit.  He kind of likes it, which isn&#x27;t exactly the reaction we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> Helped my 5 year old to stop thumb sucking at night! He hated it, but didm&#x27;t protest it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took about a month of religious application for him to stop. I only wish that there was a smaller, cheaper option since I have 99% of the bottle left and I&#x27;m not sure it will keep until my 2 year old is 5. Like one of those teeny little cheap nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no worries- It worked and thats all I care about!</li>
            <li> Our daughter is nearly 5 and we have been wanting to try something to get her to stop thumb sucking. We were amazed by all the products available and probably more so by the price tags on many of these products. We applied the Mavala stop and saw immediate results. She did try the other thumb and we simply applied it to that thumb and in less than 2 days all thumb sucking ceased. Worked great for us! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, who wanted a product that would help his 3 year old son stop sucking his thumb.  He reports that the product is working great.  He says that his 3 year old is kicking the habit and that the taste of the product is preventing his son from wanting to put his thumb in his mouth at all.  My friend is also now using the product on himself to try to stop biting his nails, and reports that it is working great for that as well.  Also worth noting is that my friend says that the product, once painted on the fingernails, works for several days even with frequent hand washing, which he is happy about (since he doesn&#x27;t have to re-apply as often).  He says he couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product!</li>
            <li> NAil biting has been a habit on my children, that I want to stop right away, Both of my kids started biting their nails at the age of 2, with my son I ordered the omega cream, which worked great on him....fast forward a year, and my daughter started biting her nails, I tried the omega cream on her, and she still continued biting her nails, Guess it wasn&#x27;t bad enough, so I went on the search for soemthing else that was still safe to be ingested, and found mavala, and this did work on my little girl, I used it just as described, and applied it every 2 days, nicer than the cream which has to applied, very regularly. I&#x27;m sure that this stuff affected alot of things she would eat with her fingers, and that makes me feel guilty, but what do you do. It does say should be used on ages 3 and up, and shes only 2 1/2, but at such a young age, I feel like its easier to break the habit now, And watching her bite her nails, to where they are bright red, and just look painful, I can&#x27;t let it continue. I&#x27;m sure at some point, I&#x27;ll have to re-use it again, but it worked quick, and easy, and my daughter loved having me paint her nails with it.</li>
            <li> I have had a lifelong struggle with nail biting. Even during times that I managed not to bite my nails, I was constantly checking them for the smallest snag or imperfection. Throughout my life I tried several different things to break the patterns, including other brands of paint-on stuff that tastes bad. Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Mavala is in a whole new realm of bad. The most hardened, obsessed nail-biter will recoil in horror at the taste. If your habit really stems from an underlying issue like OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), then you may find it doesn&#x27;t cure the obsessing about irregularities in your nails, but it very likely will cure the biting itself. It&#x27;s just that nasty tasting. Since applying it, I no longer bite my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, if you touch your mouth, you floss your teeth, you eat with your hands, etc. you&#x27;re going to taste it sometimes. It&#x27;s worth it til you&#x27;ve broken the worst of the pattern. It&#x27;s also economical -- applied over dry or polished nails and cuticles, it will last days. And for any guys who may be concerned, it isn&#x27;t as shiny as a typical clear nail polish, but it does have some shine to it. You can take a bit of a cloth and dab at it while it&#x27;s drying to make the shine less noticeable if that&#x27;s a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy. I wish I would have discovered this 35+ years ago. It would have saved me from a lot of self-consciousness and probably a few colds.</li>
            <li> My husband has been biting his nails his whole life. It absolutely drives me crazy. I nag him enough and he stops but one stressful day at work and he was back at it. I now take care of his nails myself. I file them down and make them look nice and put a coat of this on it and he is not tempted anymore. At first I just did the middle of the nail fearing it would ruin his food but it just made him continue to bite.</li>
            <li> I guess all I really have to say is that this product should do what you want it to do if you purchase it and it has for me and my son.  I have no complaints.  I would definitely recommend this product for what you expect it to to do you. Simple and plain, if you need this to get someone to stop, then this is one product that will do the job.</li>
            <li> Totally deters my 6 y/o from sucking her thumb at night.  She hates the taste so it has been working for the past couple of weeks.  I just apply every two days like the package indicates.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Daughter was sucking her thumb and was getting a little too old for it.....she stopped within a few days!</li>
            <li> Bought this to help my granddaughter stop sucking her thumb.  We were working on a craft project when it came in the mail and I took it out to \\&quot;paint my nails\\&quot; and of course, she wanted hers painted, which I did.  When she put her thumb in her mouth a few minutes later it was obviously distasteful and she said the glue (from our project) made her thumb yucky so she didn&#x27;t associated the taste with her nails being painted!  Over the next few hours she put her thunb in her mouth several times and immediately pulled it out.  It&#x27;s been 48 hours and thumb sucking has drastically dropped and she loves having her nails painted!</li>
            <li> This worked for me. Anytime my nails touched my lips it tasted like I had an entire nail salon in my mouth. Its awful! I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it does what it says... it stops you from sticking your fingers in your mouth BUT this also means french fries and finger foods are no longer finger friendly. It was embarrassing the 1st time I ate french fries in public and got a taste of my awful polish I gagged and had to spit! I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve stopped biting my nails for almost a month now and I haven&#x27;t had to reapply the polish since the 1st two week. But I do keep it on hand in case I get an urge.</li>
            <li> Some may be confused by my rating for this product, but let me explain... After reading all the reviews for this product, I was so excited that I finally found something that would get my 3 year old son to stop sucking his finger. As suggested, we started with a small application on just the thumb area. I didn&#x27;t want to experience any extreme adverse reactions (i.e vomiting). He stated that it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;tasty\\&quot; and pretty much kept it out of his mouth the entire time for that day. Later that evening when it was time for bed, he went to sleep with his thumb in his mouth as usual. The next day, we applied more but this time on a larger surface area of his thumb. He proceeded to wash it off but we kept him from doing so. Apparently, my son&#x27;s taste buds wasn&#x27;t too altered from this product because he sucked his thumb anyway inspite of a heavier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the reason for my 5-star rating: the taste is horrific! It is the worst, most bitter thing I have ever tasted. It&#x27;s almost like a combination of crushed aspirin and bitter leaves or herbs. Additionally it leaves a horrible lingering taste on your tongue and lips that goes away on its time no matter how much you try and flush it with water. As one of the reviewers stated, it contaminates everything you plan to eat if you by chance use that finger to touch food. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all...one slight touch and your food is ruined. Not to be gross, I even tested out the product by tasting my son&#x27;s finger to see what he was experiencing (and yes, even his saliva)and it was AWFUL! I couldn&#x27;t believe that it didn&#x27;t phase him. I guess his thumb means that much to him. I believe this product would work if my son way younger - maybe. He&#x27;s that individual who is not phased by the bitterness. I was hoping to have a different outcome to post. But I have to speak up for this product; I believe it could work if your child has a very sensitive palette. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the case for my child, but I am hopeful that something will work...even if it&#x27;s just time itself.eful that something will work...even if it&#x27;s just time itself.</li>
            <li> It did the trick, but after 12 days of extreme emesis (vomiting). Literally everything our kid ate, came out in less than 5 minutes. We went through hell to help curb her thumb sucking. To the products credit, it is so nasty that it scares the heck out of the child, but they might loose weight like our daughter because they can&#x27;t keep anything down. Something that really needs to be advertised. Use at your discretion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old son, who had chewed all his nails down to 1/8\\&quot; or less. His nails and fingers were awful, and he had completely lost control over htis habit. We tried everything: from gentle reminders to getting irritated; from distractions to a promised gift; he even bit his nails during soccer training while kicking the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we received Mavala Stop, I explained him that this will help him stop biting his nails and makes them strong again. He just nodded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 6 year old daughter asked to get it as well. She bit her nails too, but not that much. I said &#x27;sure&#x27; without making a big deal of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first application I put on my sons nail stomps, but also a little beyond on his finger tips, so he wouldn&#x27;t move his biting attention. Within 5 minutes he cried a little and complained about a bad taste. So I tasted his finger too. It was indeed awfully bitter and unpleasant. I explained both that this taste comes from the &#x27;nail liquid&#x27; and they will not taste it if they don&#x27;t bit their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen him nor his sister biting his nails since! Not once. Even at school they noticed he stopped biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every day I asked him to show his nails, and complimented him with not biting them and how they were growing back so nicely. As a result, he started asking to apply the liquid even before I would think of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this liquid every night (so once a day). I saw other reviews that suggested more often, but I didn&#x27;t want to overdo right away. The wet wipes that we use for dirty hands at the dinner table actually remove the layer of Mavala on the nail, so it seems best to apply a new layer after dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sons nails grew back, and in 2-3 weeks his nails looked perfectly healthy...and required clipping!&lt;br /&gt;His sister the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus:&lt;br /&gt;On the first day at dinner while eating macaroni my son used his fingers and got the bad taste. He had to spit it out. He has used a fork and spoon ever since! His eating habits suddenly improved drastically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I couldn&#x27;t believe two habits improved within a few weeks. The bottle of Mavala is still 3/4 full, so no need to buy more than 1 \\&quot;serving\\&quot;. I stopped applying it a few days ago and the biting habit hasn&#x27;t returned. I&#x27;m so relieved.has used a fork and spoon ever since!

            <li> I had two of three children who sucked their thumb (a 6yr old boy and 4 yr old girl) and nothing was working.  I had read about this on line and thought - why not?  It was very highly rated.  Well, for my 4 yr old it was effortless.  Within a week, she no longer even asked to suck her thumb.  In fact, she would remind us to put the fluid on her thumb.  We kept it up an extra week just so old habbits would not set in.  She has been free of the habbit for 6 months.  My son had a harder time because he would accidently put his thumb in his mouth at night and wake up crying from the taste.  He was very willing to not suck his thumb while awake, but while sleeping it would just happen.  So, I got creative and put the Glad Press n Seal wrap around his thumb so he would not even get it into his mouth at night.  This actually worked!  Both kids no longer suck their thumbs.  Whew!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with my six year old daughter. She had been sucking her fingers since she was an infant. She was sucking both at home and at school and it was really interfereing with her school work. She wanted to quit but felt like she couldn&#x27;t. We tried using charts, stickers, rewards, gloves, and band aids on her hands but nothing worked. So I decided to order this product.(we also made another reward chart to go along the mavala stop) She stopped sucking her fingers immediately!! It was amazing. Her Dad and I were shocked as were her teachers. We have been using this product for over two weeks and she hasn&#x27;t put her fingers even near her mouth. She is  afraid of what it will taste like. I tried it though. It tastes very bitter. I highly recommend this product. Be careful though...the bottle breaks easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update..It has almost been year since we used this product and my daughter hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb at all!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked! Plain and simple, we used it for 2 days and our 3.5 year old stopped sucking her thumb and never went back. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get my 3 year old to quit sucking her thumb.  A few days of Mavala Stop and she has no desire to suck her thumb anymore.  Two Thumbs up to Mavala Stop!</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as it says it does.  I ordered it for my 5 year who liked  to suck her thumb.  I applied a coat to her nail bed every other day for about a week and a half.  After one taste of this stuff she didn&#x27;t stick her hand in her mouth again.  I continued using it for the rest of the week just in case she had a relapse.  I also used the product myself since I have been a chronic nail biter all my life.  It works great!  I accidentally tried to bite my nails one day while driving and the taste of this stuff absolutely turned me off.  I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since. For the price of this product, it is definitely worth it.  Two thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 year old.  He wouldn&#x27;t stop sucking his thumb.  His teeth were already starting to protrude and had a callus on his thumb from the pressure and how much he did it.  I used every night for like a week.  I applied after he fell asleep, so he wouldn&#x27;t know what was up.  First, I applied on the one thumb and rest of fingernails for the guilty hand.  I realized he started sucking on the other hand after two days, not as intensely but still.  I applied in both hands now using the above described method of doing it after hours.  After a week or two max he stopped.  I would see him trying to put his thumbs into his mouth and would make a face and put it down.  I obviously acted like I had no idea what was happening.  I recommend this thing to everyone.  Who knew!</li>
            <li> Really bitter to stop biting. Kids hate it. Now I can stop my daughter nail biting only with showing her the bottle. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and it works great!  My son has gone from sucking his thumb all day long to completely stopping.  I have to reapply every few days or he starts again.  I suppose it will take a few months to change the bad habit, but this product does what it promises.</li>
            <li> We could not get my three year old to stop sucking his thumb and it started getting more frequent. One application of this stuff and he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb in weeks!!</li>
            <li> It works to help your little one stop biting nails, but I just wish it lasted longer!</li>
            <li> works but must apply often to be productive.</li>
            <li> HAD TO PUT ON ALL MY SON&#x27;S FINGERS!! WORKED FAST! I TRYED AND REAL BAD!!!!  I FORGOT I PUT IT ON MY THUMB AND THE NEXT DAY WAS BITTING MY THUMB!  NOT GOING TO DO THAT ANYMORE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle, expired, or if the product was just crap, but this didn&#x27;t work. Washed right off hours after application but didn&#x27;t detour my son at all from nail biting or nose picking so i tasted some myself. NO AFFECT. No terrible taste, nothing. This product was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Completely useless. Applied as directed on my 3 year old son and 20 minutes later he&#x27;s sucking his thumb without so much as a second thought. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucked her thumb while pulling her hair. It has gotten so bad, she was completely bald on one side and her thumb was raw. We&#x27;d tried everything to get her to stop, and found this. We thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. I have to say, I wish we&#x27;d tried this earlier! After the first application, she No longer sucked her thumb. But. She went for the other fingers. So we applied this to all her fingers. Long story, short: it works. It&#x27;s been a month and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb or fingers since.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old still sucks her thumb. The first Mavala we had gotten from the dentist but it kind of got used and old. This smell is awful and the taste as well. I believe this product works. Be careful when using on small children because for the first time I tried it in the evening and my daughter was throwing up that night every time her thumb ended up in the mouth. It is a good idea to try it during the day first.</li>
            <li> It works in the first week.  I don&#x27;t even think I am going to use the whole bottle. I am thinking in buy the strengthener now.</li>
            <li> We purchased this to stop thumb sucking for our 3 year old.  It works during the day because of the bitter taste, but she sucks it off at night while she&#x27;s sleeping.  I&#x27;ve found that if that happens she gets sores in her mouth!  We will no longer use this product!</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work. Maybe she needs to be older, but it is of no help right now when I need her to stop.</li>
            <li> This product works for my 4 year old. It wears off in about two days, so I reapply it every two days. Yes it tastes horrible, but it does do the trick. The bottle gets stuck, but don&#x27;t make the mistake and leave it partially screwed because it dries out quick.</li>
            <li> Holy Guacamole Batman!!! This Stuff REALLY works!!!!  We have tried many ways to get our almost 3 year old son to stop sucking his thumb. Taping it up, essential oils, mittens just to name a few. After seeing him play at the park and get in the car and immediately stick his thumb in his mouth before I could get a wipey out had me utterly disgusted and horrified. BLECH!!!!!!!!! That was enough to make me come home and immediately look up a permanent solution. I came across Mavala and saw the great reviews and high star rating. Sold! I ordered and anxiously awaited its arrival. So excited when I got the package and washed his hands and put a small little drop on his thumb nail (I read other reviews that said doing the whole nail made for a exorcism type experience and so I thought a drop would do) So as we laid him down, we quickly turned on the video monitor because we knew that thumb would quickly go in. Sure enough, in it went and a quick exit it made followed by a loud, &amp;#34;BLEEEEECCCHHHHHHHHH! EWWWWWW!!!!!!! and rubbing his tongue on his blankets. A quick drink of water and he was out light a light. No crying, no anger. Sure enough, he did not put it back in. Next morning, I think he forgot that horrible taste as he came out, laid on the carpet as he always does and the thumb went it. Same reaction as the night before. Happy to say, that we are almost 3 weeks no thumb sucking and it hasn&#x27;t gone back in his mouth. :) THANK YOU!!!!! This product gets 5 stars from us.  (Although, my hubby would give the taste a negative 5. My son went to feed him a Dorito and my hubby over bites so he gets our sons fingers to make him laugh. All of a sudden he was like, &amp;#34;THAT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE DORITO!!!&amp;#34; And proceeded to rinse his mouth out in the sink) LOL!!!!  So except for the fact that this doesn&#x27;t taste like a delicious chip (that would defeat the point) We give it 2 thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 20 years; never again. If a bird crapped in my mouth, this is how I&#x27;d imagine it would taste.</li>
            <li> helped me quit, then i started getting used to the taste, not as effective now, great for starters</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the product on my 3 year old daughter who constantly bites her nails. I&#x27;ve been only using it for 4 days but I haven&#x27;t seen her bite them once. The only factor I did not calculator was when she is eating with hands, the bad taste transfers. Other then that,  I&#x27;m loving the results!</li>
            <li> It is definitely bitter enough to deter carefree finger sucking, but so far hasn&#x27;t really slowed my child down. She has found how to peel off the polish on her nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I resorted to painting the skin of the offending fingers when she sleeps, if she washes her hands enough times a day, the bitterness fades. It is probably a mater of rght timing. If I had started when she was 3 and not so skillful, it would most likely have been more effective. After all, it has been three weeks.</li>
            <li> So this stuff tastes horrible and it lingers too. The main problem I have experienced is that I work in a job where I have to wash my hands a lot. To keep it strong enough I have to reapply every two days or so which I find to be a bit annoying. Otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li> This product was disappointing for me.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have been chewing my fingers as far back as I can remember.  I stuck with the product for about 2 weeks.  The main problem I have with it is it&#x27;s not immediately bitter--the bitterness occurs after you&#x27;ve already bitten your nail but then the aftertaste stays with you all day.  Perhaps that&#x27;s the point, but it would be more effective if it was immediately bitter.</li>
            <li> it works instantly.  The best way to get your child to stop sucking their thumb.  I love this product.  I wish i knew about it sooner</li>
            <li> stopped my 3 year old in one day from sucking her thumbs</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it tastes terrible, something that preventing the other stuff I had tried before from working, and it is shiny so I know that something is there and I can fight the urge to bite my fingernails. The sheen is a problem as well though as a male it is hard to wear shiny nail polish but since it is working I can deal with it. The other problem is that when eating it sometimes rubs off on my lips, etc especially with finger foods. But I can say that since it is working i will deal with these two minor problems. I have been biting my fingernails for over 20 years and this is honestly the first product that has worked for me!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have come accross, although I had to apply it daily, not every other day!!  I just wish they would make the same product WITHOUT the &#x27;gloss&#x27; finish!!!  Anyway, after 37 years of biting my nails (not sucking my thumb!!!) I have finally broken the habit!!! Thank you Mavala!!!  I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to break the nail biting habit...just buy a stress ball to go with it...that way you keep your hands busy so you don&#x27;t get the horrific, bitter taste of this stuff in your mouth as often!!!</li>
            <li> My 11-year-old son just stopped biting his fingernails after we used this product for a few weeks, it&#x27;s so amazing.</li>
            <li> I tried this with my 12 year old son to get him to stop nail biting.  He stopped.  But it rubbed off his fingers on to other parts of his hand or face so he ended up tasting it even if he was not biting his nails.  When that happened he refused to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Its unreal!!! Our eighteen month old has been sucking her thumb with gusto since she was born!! We have been wanting to do something about it so I searched using the Dealio toolbar for something to stop the sucking and came up with Mavala. Its unbelievable!! After ONLY one application she STOPPED COMPLETELY. Her thumb does not even go near her mouth anymore. So we gave it a shot with our four year old who was bitting her nails. You HAVE to see it to believe it. For the first time in years we cut her nails!! Yes, you guessed right. One application did it. This is for real!! Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a six-year-old thumbsucker after reading the reviews here and having had already tried all kinds of postive reinforcements and rewards to eliminating thumb-sucking.  Going into first grade, it seemed imperative that he stop soon to avoid an onslaught on taunts from other children.  We used this product ONCE five months ago, and the thumb has not been sucked since.  This was a kid who sucked his thumb hours every day.  This was a great purchase.  With that said, I am not sure it was the product itself that caused the change or just the idea of something being placed on the finger that would help the child not suck his thumb.  Before subjecting my child to the bitterness of this concoction, I tried it... and it was not THAT bad.  Whatever.  It worked, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bitter! I&#x27;m put my finger in my mouth without thinking and being surprised by the awful taste. Only downside is that it leaves a shiny surface on your nails. For guys, this can be a small issue. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not quiet sure it would work. We had tried everything to get our 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb. It was getting embarrassing. She was ashamed, but habits are hard to break. So, I finally gave into buying it. It broke the habit completely within one week of putting it on her thumbs. She is so proud that now she tells everyone. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I love mavala. If I have more kids I won&#x27;t ever hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since using this. I was skeptical at first  because my 3 1/2 year old loves both his thumbs. I was using it morning and night because it was coming off in the bath. He did not like the taste at all but the first week I had caught him sucking his thumb at night (with the stuff). Then he started to say his thumb was yucky and only for babies and he says I don&#x27;t suck my thumb and he really doesn&#x27;t. The urge of putting his hand to his mouth has even faded. This weekend we went away and I did not use it and NO THUMB SUCKING. I am still putting it on thumbs, don&#x27;t know when I will stop I am scared of relapse. But I would really recommend this for sucking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old nail bitter that has wanted to quit for sometime.  An orthodontist turned me onto the product as \\&quot;the one that does the trick\\&quot; to stop nailbiting and thumb sucking in younger patients.  I&#x27;ve used it  for the past 3 weeks and found it is an excellent aide in reminding me to get my fingers out of my mouth.  The taste is a definant deterant and sticks with you.  It last through multiple handwashings (I&#x27;m in health care and constantly washing my hands) - so you don&#x27;t need frequent reapplicaitons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend MAVALA stop, the bitter long lasting taste keeps my fingers out of my mouth.  Although it has not cured the habit, that is up to me and time... (when it wears off, I&#x27;ll start to tempt fate with nail-love-bites).  And for less than $10 it&#x27;s worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Long lasting (1-2 days); Very bitter; Does not sting eyes&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Hard to floss (b/c it doesn&#x27;t wash off); Gets taste on foods when eating with hands</li>
            <li> My dentist strongly recommended this to me for my daughter at about 4-5 years old- she is now six and we are still using it to no avail (we have been trying to kick this habit since age TWO).  She said it had a 100% success rate.  Well, meet the first failure.  I think maybe it did not work because we eat spicy and ethnic foods- not chicken nuggets and mac-n-cheese.  Her palate can tolerate the strong taste.  Either that or she is just determined to suck that thumb!!  Hope it works for you.  : (</li>
            <li> My daughter had been sucking her thumb for 11 years and was desperate to stop before entering middle school.  This product helped her achieve this with EASE!!!  It was almost immediate and without the anticipated torture.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  My two year old stopped biting her nails because of it.  She hated it so much that we only used it a few times and mentioning it would stop her.  &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; became a fairly common heard word when she would experience the nasty flavor of this stuff.</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old daughter had begun to have problems with her bite due to constantly sucking her thumb, so I knew we needed to do something about it. This worked miracles- she never cried or fussed about it at all. I painted her nails before putting it on, and she was excited about that since I&#x27;d never let her paint them before because I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea due to her thumb sucking. I was a little leery of the ingredients in this but figured I would just try it for a short amount of time. I think I applied it 3 or 4 times and that was a couple weeks ago and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since! I know each child is different, but I am thankful that this worked for my daughter. Now I need to get my husband to use it for his nail biting!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this worked!!  My daughter started sucking her thumb in our first sonogram picture and has not stopped since (she is almost 7), until now!  After our first application, she stopped instantly!!!  We were blown away!!!  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Used this for my 6 year old son who was sucking his thumb, mostly at bedtime.  We had been working on &amp;#34;reminding&amp;#34; (over and over and over again), but once he lost his first baby tooth, we knew it was time to step in to break the habit.  We literally applied this TWICE, just to the top half of his thumb nail, over the course of 4 days.  Wow.  It worked immediately.  He has not sucked his thumb in months now.  I am still shocked at how this instantly broke the habit.  Only drawback - I have a full bottle left and don&#x27;t need it. ;)</li>
            <li> We were just months away from paying hundreds of dollars for an appliance to help my 6 year old stop sucking her thumb.  We set up charts and reward systems but nothing helped until we found mavala.  She stopped sucking her thumb immediately.  It&#x27;s been almost a month and she still isn&#x27;t sucking her thumb.  Now she wanted to stop sort of b/c she didn&#x27;t want the appliance and knew she was getting too big for it.  So there was some willingness but it was too much of a habit without the help of MAVALA.  Awesome stuff!!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> We tried this on our son to stop his constant finger sucking. He is three, and his teeth have already started shifting. The first night was awful, and nobody slept. The second night he cried again. The third night, he was sucking his finger even with the Mavala, and I thought I must have one of those extremely stubborn kids I&#x27;ve been reading about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few weeks and applied it again, and the second time around it worked like a charm. It&#x27;s been about a month now, and the habit appears to be cured, so we&#x27;re happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to stop my nail biting habit.  My mother even threatened to put gloves on me that I would have to wear 24/7.  I&#x27;m 27 now, and hopefully am out of the habit without relapse.  This product works since it&#x27;s a bitter reminder that I&#x27;m biting my nails.  The only pit fall is that finger foods (ie fruit, chips) also taste bitter.</li>
            <li> Bitter taste is very unsatisfying and stays on your tongue for a while. Double layers help.</li>
            <li> Work great. We have a seven year old that was still thumb sucking, mavala stopped the thumb sucking immediately. We were able to stop using mavala after about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to love a product that tastes so nasty. But that&#x27;s its purpose, and it worked for stopping nail biting. The only downside, is that when you use the product, you can&#x27;t put your fingers in your mouth at all- even if you&#x27;re just popping in a bit of popcorn or a cheese cube- the foul taste is so strong that you just have to use a fork for everything while you&#x27;re using the product.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and will make you aware of how often your fingers go in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things, but nothing has worked as well as this! It definitely cured the problem of biting my nails. It&#x27;s finally eliminated my 30 year habit!</li>
            <li> My little girl stopped sucking her fingers immediately after using this. Only took two applications for it to work. We have since passed on the bottle to another friend of ours.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!!</li>
            <li> My son is 5 and was really having a hard time stopping his finger sucking habit. We tried rewards, grounding from ipod, bribery, and another brand of paint on avoidance aid (that one he just said &amp;#34;oooh, spicy&amp;#34; everytime he tasted it. Well the Mavala works. He is now on week two of not sucking his finger. It tastes very bitter almost like hairspray. (Yes I know what hairspray tastes like - 80&#x27;s high hair made sure everyone knows how a mouthful of that tastes.) We only have to reapply every couple days even with very frequent handwashing habits. I don&#x27;t think we will need to use the whole bottle so when he is officially done, I&#x27;m going to give it to my sister for one of her nail biters.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my childrens Pediatrician because my son who is 4 years old started biting his nails and because of the frequency of his fingers being in his mouth he got sick...meanwhile when I read the review on the item it also mentioned that it will help to deter thumb sucking which is something my daughter started doing when she was 2 years old and she is now 7.  Once I purchased Mavala Stop I applied it to their nails instantly and I am very very happy to say that it WORKS!!! My son stopped bitting from the first application and my daughter stopped sucking completely 2 days after the first application!</li>
            <li> great product. Helped with my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.Definitely will recommend this to my friends who have the same problem</li>
            <li> Great stuff...helped my daughter stop sucking her thumbs!  If she resorts back to thumb sucking we paint on and it does the trick!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but it didn&#x27;t work for my child.  You have to apply twice a day.</li>
            <li> This product actually works. I&#x27;m 43 years old and have been a chronic nail biter and after using this product I have Long Nails!!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle for my daughter (10) and myself to help us to stop bitting out nails.  The flavor to me is bitter, but not a digusting flavor.  It stays on the tongue for apx 10min.  For me, it did help me to stop bitting my nails bc the taste would remind me to get my fingers out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my daughter, she doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, so it hasn&#x27;t helped her.....if she used it everyday, I&#x27;m sure that it would keep her from biting her nails.  The problem is it has to be applied daily to get that bitter taste effect &amp; she doesn&#x27;t remember to apply it daily, or just doesn&#x27;t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that the price, $12.00 a bottle ,is a little over priced.</li>
            <li> The product does what it should, but is a little flawed because it doesn&#x27;t stay just on your nails. I put it on yesterday, only once, for the first time and I still can&#x27;t use my hands when it comes to food. I was making a salad for lunch and the disgusting bitter, chemically taste of this product was on all of my vegetables. I have washed my hands like 25 times. I&#x27;d suggest getting gloves for cooking! Also, once the taste is in your mouth it takes like an hour to go away. This is good and bad at the same time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product:( With all the great reviews we were really hoping it would break our 5 year old of sticking his fingers in his mouth and chewing on his fingers. However it did not. He said it does not taste that great but did not stop him from chewing and sticking his fingers in his mouth. In fact it made it even worse! Sad i wasted $13.00 on this. Should have tried a cheaper product to start with....</li>
            <li> I have been a &amp;#34;nail-biter&amp;#34; for 25+ years. When my 4 year old daughter began biting her nails, I realized I couldn&#x27;t tell her to not bite them when she saw her mom doing the same thing. I ordered this product with initial hopes of using it on her to stop this from becoming a lifelong habit. Then I began using it with her. The product works. The bitter taste of this product is the key.  It has been used for 4 weeks. Neither myself nor my 4 year old have bitten our fingernails since it&#x27;s use. I highly recommend for those who are serious about Stopping the nail biting habit!</li>
            <li> My children&#x27;s dentist told me about this, I came home and ordered it. It came super fast and worked so well on my one daughter the other one, not so much....... She scrubbed it off! Yes, I think I might need to sneak it on her thumb when she&#x27;s sleeping!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff helped my son stop sucking his thumb in one night! I used it when my son was about 3 years old. I was geared up for a lot of crying and no sleep for the first few nights but instead he just slept all night. No tears, no vomit like some had reported, and no more thumb sucking. The taste must have stayed on for quite a while because he would put his thumb in his mouth and then immediately take it out. But he was never distressed or really even cared that he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb anymore. He would mainly only suck his thumb when he was tired so that probably helped with the transition away from it. If he had been a kid who constantly had his thumb in his mouth maybe it would have been harder on us....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend giving this stuff a try. I read reviews on lots of different ones before opting for this one and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Our 4.5 year old is a die hard thumb sucker and it&#x27;s starting to affect his jaw. Time to step up the game from bandaids on his thumb to something more. We thought this would be fabulous based on all the reviews, but after two coats of it that were allowed to dry, he stuck his thumb back in his mouth and looked at us like \\&quot;WHAT??\\&quot; (Like I thought you put something on here, I don&#x27;t taste anything!) He didn&#x27;t even taste it!!?? Must be a taste buds thing, the box does say younger kids might have this problem. Still, 8 bucks wasted. Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> I got his for my son who sucks his index and middle finger while he sleeps.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Definitely works for nail biting, though hand foods maybe ruined by the taste....  Recommended for any one who bites nails.</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to apply it faithfully as instructed.</li>
            <li> My little one stopped sucking her thumb very quickly using this product.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 yr old son has sucked his two fingers since he was 6 months old.  He always has his fingers in his mouth, catching a ton of germs and colds.  I didn&#x27;t want him to go any longer with this issue, especially since I read it can start affecting his teeth.  So I looked online for cures and stumbled on this.  Read all the great reviews and compared to the price of some finger contraption that cost $70, there wasn&#x27;t much options for finger sucking.  So I thought, why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had warned my son that if he didn&#x27;t stop sucking his fingers, they would soon taste yucky.  So when I got this in, I painted his 2 nails.  He put them in his mouth for the first time moments later and started coughing.  Then he said &amp;#34;yucky fingers, ugh!&amp;#34;  And he hasn&#x27;t sucked on them since!!!!!!!  I know he accidentally puts them in his mouth out of habit, especially when he sleeps, but he always takes them right back out.  I have slowly started to wean him off it now, its been about 2 months I only paint more on about every 2 weeks.  I think he&#x27;s almost to the point where he won&#x27;t even need it anymore. (Yesterday, I caught him in his sleep putting them in his mouth, but the he made a funny face and took them right back out and went on sleeping!) So I know he&#x27;s not quite ready to get off it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who has little ones sucking their fingers or thumbs.  The reviews that said their kids could no longer eat food with their fingers was not an issue at all for us.  Just give them a little warning, so they&#x27;re not completely shocked by the bad taste :)</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my son to stop sucking his fingers!  Agh!&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended this to me and I did not believe her!&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have been using it on my son for two weeks and he has not sucked his fingers!&lt;br /&gt;I am now using it on my daughter who will try to bite her nails when she is nervous!&lt;br /&gt;It too is working on her!  I am so happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just needed to put it one time on my daughters nails, problem solved! Highly recommend. Fast shipping and consider it a good price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months since I purchased this product and let me first say that I have been a nail biter for the last 20 years, since I was VERY young, about 4, but now I have stopped completely and the urge to even put my fingers CLOSE to my mouth is 100% gone. The taste is a very odd taste, sort of sweet and then like acetone... I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m really explaining it properly but whatever it was, it was disgusting. The product is seriously amazing. I&#x27;ve tried other products -- EXPENSIVE salon products -- and none of them have worked. The taste wears off on other things after you wash your hands or shower, but not this. Mavala Stop lasts for a very long time, I probably only used it two-three times a week when I changed my polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product in order to stop myself from biting my nails along with a product for nail growth because my nails were SEVERELY damaged. If you look at the photo on the right [my right hand] then you&#x27;ll see how short my middle finger nail is. When I started using Mavala Stop I literally did NOT have a middle finger nail because I had bitten it so much and it had actually fallen off completely. Today I actually had to trim most of my nails (before this photo was taken) because they were getting too long. If you have a bad habit of biting your nails, use this. You&#x27;ll never bite them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Give AMPLE time for this product to dry. I used it and waited about 40 minutes before I went to bed and when I woke up the next morning I had to take the polish off because it hadn&#x27;t dried properly and had creased and stuff. It felt dry to me before I&#x27;d went to bed, but I found that about an hour to an hour and a half were the best times for it to be totally dry!</li>
            <li> He was already starting to extinguish the thumb sucking during the day due to peer pressure, but was still sucking hard at night.  Wish the pediatrician/dentist/orthodontist had not been so nonchalant about the thumb sucking in the first place, as he pushed the roof of his mouth up pretty good.  I think we could have used this and other techniques to greatly shorten the sucking period, in a caring way.  This would have minimize the degree of orthodontic work, which did not completely reverse the effects. I think alternatives like this that will require much attention and consideration to use properly don&#x27;t get suggested by the docs because they presume that most people are not willing to put in the work.</li>
            <li> My daughter could not stop sucking her thumb regardless of what we tried. We applied the polish and its bitter taste, made her stop right away. Whenever she noticed the taste was not as strong as it is when first applied, she asked to have more applied to keep her from sucking her thumb. Great product.</li>
            <li> The dentists to me to get this for my daughter to help her stop sucking her thumb... I consistently used it for about 2 months.. Haven&#x27;t seen her sucking her thumb since!</li>
            <li> Working as expected. My son stopped biting nails whenever we apply this. However after one month we stopped applying for a while and he start biting nails again. So looks like we need to continue applying for some time. Product is good , go for it</li>
            <li> First night my 4 y/o had a hard time trying to figure out how to fall asleep w/o his thumb... it was hard to see him struggle :( BUT - the next night was easier and by the 3-4 he was good to go!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend only putting a small dot on each thumb nail as it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also, he would end up putting his thumb in his mouth while sleeping and then would end up in our room crying for a drink of water so I ended up putting a spill proof cup of water by his bed AND 4 tic tac&#x27;s which REALLY helped!!!! If he accidently put his thumb in his mouth he would take a sip and put a tic tac in and go back to sleep :) The orange tic tac&#x27;s  actually made his bedime routine easy as he enjoyed counting out his 4 tiny mints each night and he knew that if he accidently got the yucky taste in his mouth one little mint would fix it!</li>
            <li> Did a great job of curing my 7 year old from sucking his thumb. Beware though, the first night, he was up all night spitting and needing water to clear the taste out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because my daughter has been sucking her finger since she was about 18 months she is now 8yrs old soon too be 9 and we have tried EVERYTHING to get her to stop sucking her finger from hot sauce to positive praise for not doing it we started using the product on February 10th in the first couple days were I forgot to apply it she saw her do it once but once I remembered to apply it she won&#x27;t put her finger in her mouth I am very pleased with this product I also apply it every day rather than ever two day</li>
            <li> My son has completely stopped sucking his thumb. Less than a month and he had started sucking his thumb before he was born!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! My daughter sucked her thumb for six years and was able to stop all together in four weeks.  The stuff is very potent and doesn&#x27;t come off for days. It isn&#x27;t spicy hot but it tastes horrible without harm. I tried it on myself before giving it to her.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to prevent my 6 yrs old daughter from sucking her thumb,and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> My daughter chewed her nails nonstop. Other bitter polishes did not help. This one dis the trick, but had to be applied nightly or the taste would wear off</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for my thumb sucker. My oldest child stopped after a day of using this product. My middle one took longer, still using product. They both hated the taste (which is great to get them to stop). Be warned, do not accidentally get any on your fingers, you&#x27;ll be tasting bitter things all afternoon if you do. Yuck! But I would highly recommend to give it a shot with getting your child to stop putting fingers in the mouth. Way worth it!</li>
            <li> Yes!!! I bought a different brand that didn&#x27;t work (my son sucked right over it) but this one worked great!! I didn&#x27;t think anything would help him stop sucking his thumb but this proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> My daughter used to pick her lips to the point that they were crusted over with blood every morning. I put this on her nails and told her that it was yucky. The first time she picked her lips she realized that it was the truth and she never picked her lips again. I also used it on the door stoppers that the cat was chewing on, and on the tiny (swallowable) toys that my husband just had to buy my son. He put it in his mouth once, spit it out and complained of how yucky it tasted. I got a bit of this on my finger and realized it later when I licked frosting off of my finger. Its bitter and just yucky.</li>
            <li> It works!, Yeah! my nails are finally growing, I&#x27;m no longer ashamed of my fingernails and how thy look to others,  I am not putting my fingers in my mouth ever again; an awful habit that I&#x27;ve had for a long time; this stuff taste AWFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Helped stop my son&#x27;s nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> from my friend who used this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 7yr old boy/girl twins and both were still sucking their thumbs.  So we agreed to make an effort to stop.  I tried putting bandaids on their thumbs and also tried lemon juice.  Neither worked.  My dentist recommended the *Malavda*.  I did not tell them I was getting anything.  I put it on their thumbs in the middle of the night.  I got some on my fingers and the taste is horrible and there is no way to get it off.  my daughter woke up crying in the middle of the night saying she was going to throw up.  I took her into the bathroom to brush teeth and gargle a few times.  She was tired and said she still had the taste in her mouth.  My son woke up in the morning and had the same reaction and we did the same thing.  neither were happy about the taste.  They said they could taste it on their lips at breakfast and throughout the day.  the taste did last more than a day on your skin.  I only put it on every other day.  I then came up with a trick that helped much more and I do not use the *Malavada* anymore.  it was expensive and I would get it as a last resort.  The hardest thing for my son was falling asleep without sucking his thumb.  During the night it is usually out.  both asked how can they stop if they are asleep and do not know they are doing it.  I said it takes 28 days to break a habit and we covered their thumbs with my trick and watched the calendar.  We used the *Malavada* for about 2 weeks if that long.  I would not recommend using it under 4yrs old and I believe it is very strong and the taste is horrible.  I would give it 3 stars but only if everything else has failed</li>
            <li> I think my daughter has secretly developed a taste for this stuff, as we have been using it for some time now, and still have not cut her finger nails with a nail clipper. Hmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of on the fence about ordering anymore of it as we are on our 3rd bottle... Probably just need to accept the fact that our kids likes to eat their finger nails, no matter what we put on them prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this stuff works for the most part - you should at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> My boy had been sucking his fingers since he was in the womb.  He sucked them ALL THE TIME!  At 2.5 years old the roof of his mouth was becoming deformed and two of his teeth were not coming in.  We were very stressed out over this and really wanted him to stop but didn&#x27;t want to go about it the wrong way and cause an even bigger dependency on it.  We tried the finger guard first, I had the wrist wrap so tight it left marks on my son&#x27;s skin and he still figured out how to get his fingers out.  We tried positive reinforcement, and so many other approaches we read about online and nothing worked. I was VERY nervous about trying this product because so many reviews said that it made their child vomit.  I thought, how horrible!  After feeling like we had no other options, we finally tried this product.  I wish I would have used this first!!!!  It was SO EASY.  I let my son watch me put clear polish on my nails two days in a row.  On day 3 I asked him if he wanted me to do his nails.  Of course he said yes.  I applied this product to the nails of the two fingers that he sucks.  It dries really fast.  The first day he put his fingers in his mouth repeatedly and pulled them right back out.  He said he had stink on his fingers and we needed to wash his hands.  We washed them and then he tried it again.  We did this 3 times.  It did make him cough and he said he didn&#x27;t feel good but he never vomited.  We told him he may be getting too old for his fingers  to taste good.  Mommy and Daddy don&#x27;t suck our fingers because they don&#x27;t taste good anymore.  He seemed to think this was pretty cool.  He was a big boy now!  The second day was about a 70% improvement and by day 3 he didn&#x27;t even attempt to put his fingers in his mouth anymore.  It has now been 4 months and he hasn&#x27;t attempted to do it since day 2. The roof of his mouth is correcting itself and his two teeth have come in and are almost lined up with the other teeth.  We are so thankful for this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong nail-biting habit broken in a few weeks with this product. It tastes terrible so as long as you keep it applied, your nails are safe.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use because it made all sandwiches, etc. taste like Malava. Was for a 10 year old with a packed lunch for school. Hamburgers, sandwiches, fries, an apple, chips... Anything you have to pick up with your hands becomes totally off limits. Maybe if you need to lose weight and stop biting your fingernails this would be an ideal product. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a bust.</li>
            <li> The taste of the nail polish is excellent for stopping the nail biting habit, but the product tended to rub off on finger-foods even hours after it dried and the taste is hard to miss, and somewhat hard to get off the palate once it&#x27;s there.  I tried removing the product and reapplying to make sure I was getting JUST the nail and not any of the skin around the nail.  The problem still persisted.</li>
            <li> I put this on my 3 1/2 yr old.  It was kind of sad because it really tastes bad (I tried it myself too)  It&#x27;s only been 3 days and I&#x27;ll probably re-apply today, but she won&#x27;t even go near her thumb now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor used it on her son, and he stopped sucking too.</li>
            <li> My son is almost 3, and sucked his thumb all the time, even while playing. We&#x27;ve tried everything to get him to stop, from telling him that his nail would fall of from bugs and worms growing out of it, to chili powder mixed with hot sauce (he liked it!). I saw the great reviews for this online, and decided to try it. I was skeptical because of the chili powder experience, but after ONE application, he stopped! He had to drink 2 huge cups of juice to get rid of the taste in his mouth, and has tried a couple times to put his thumb in again, but I haven&#x27;t seen him sucking it at all...even at night. So that he doesn&#x27;t just attribute the taste to the polish (and think it will go away), I put it on when he sleeps now, and told him that his fingers taste bad because he sucked them for so long. One piece of advice: don&#x27;t give them finger foods, the taste transfers! Thank you MAVALA!!!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop worked immediately to stop the thumb sucking of my four year old son. There was no fighting at all.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea, but my son didn&#x27;t stop sucking his finger after I applied it.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old&#x27;s dentist recommended this product to try to get help my son stop sucking his thumb. But my little guy couldn&#x27;t have cared less. We took a break from it, and when I wanted to give it another go the whole bottle was a gummy mess.</li>
            <li> i guess we are severe nail biters....beyond help....because this stuff didn&#x27;t work. it washed off with water and my son figured that out pretty darn quick. after that, he would just scrape it off with his teeth and proclaim that he liked the taste. i tried it myself and it honestly doesn&#x27;t taste that bad. i mean, it stays in your mouth for a bit but nothing unbearable. i&#x27;ve been biting for 32 years.....this isn&#x27;t going to work for me. it does get all over everything you touch so be careful eating.</li>
            <li> Does help in reducing the duration, but somehow I think she is getting to like the taste of it :-(</li>
            <li> This product has alcohol in it and did not know that until i received it and ofcourse I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my daughter&#x27;s thumb for her to suck it .  Too bad they dont allow return :(</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, my 6 year old son has been sucking his thumb since he was 3 months old. We constantly would tell him to take his thumb out of his mouth. He wanted to stop but it&#x27;s such a bad habit that he just couldn&#x27;t. He was ready to stop so I told him I was getting his some stuff that will help him. I painting Mavala on both thumbs just in case he would revert to the other thumb and within a few days he has completely stopped sucking his thumb. I probably didn&#x27;t need to buy two bottles, but I&#x27;m painting it on his thumbs every day and night until I know for sure he has kicked the thumb sucking habit for good! Thanks Mavala I will recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing this problem.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s pediatrician recommended Mavala Stop to help quit her constant thumb sucking.  I tried other products in the past that didn&#x27;t work and to my surprise this product delivers!  While safe, it taste horrible and after five years of thumb sucking she is finally kicking the habit with the help of Mavala Stop.  I apply it every few days.  I received the order quickly and would recommend this product if you need help to end a thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> Beginning in the dental field, having pretty and healthy teeth is a must. I decided to try Mavala for my 9 and 3 yr. old. It really works. I even tested a sample myself. Surprisely, it&#x27;s GROSS. My daughters haven&#x27;t been sucking or biting on their nails for a month, now. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product does the trick. It wears away eventually, my child is very stubborn so i have to order this often. Seems to last after a few hand washes.</li>
            <li> Before I begin my review, a little bit of background of who was using it: I&#x27;m 23 years old now, but when I was very young I noticed my mother biting her own nails, and in my toddler mind, I thought I was supposed to mimic her, which resulted in a very fierce nail biting habit from my early childhood. I love my mother, but she had instilled within me with something of a curse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was psychological for me. I&#x27;ve read those addicted to cigarettes have a similar issue, the \\&quot;hand-to-mouth\\&quot; movement. I had to bite my nails. If they were even a little long, it was too long. Obviously, I knew I had to stop, but after trying a number of products nothing ever broke the cycle. Then I found Mavala Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was just what I needed. From the moment I put it on, I never once bit my nails again. The bitter taste it has is so incredibly intense that it outweighs even my strong urge to bite. And the worst part about it is that it lingers in your mouth for 30-60 seconds, and to me, that made me more or less think about my actions and not do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m proud to announce I have not bitten a nail in 4 weeks, and I&#x27;ve lost almost all urges to at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the appearance of the stuff, it dries on very shiny and I thought it looked nice. The instructions say you can paint it over nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you&#x27;re looking for a fantastic non-toxic deterrent for nail biting, this is the stuff! However, user be warned. Your fingers will be BITTER. Be careful when eating finger foods! Several times I accidentally either grazed by nail on the food or touched it to my lip when I was eating and found a nasty surprise! After a while you learn how to avoid it though. The most obvious tip I can offer is to eat finger foods with a fork.</li>
            <li> I tried to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb for years.  Finally I bought this and after a few applications while she was asleep, she stopped within a week</li>
            <li> It did work. I bought this for my niece, who was three years old when she first tried it. She had always sucking her thumb during her sleep since her birth. My family and me were very worried that it would ruin her finger and the shape of her mouth. Luckily, she stopped it before the bottle ran out. She has not sucking her thumb for months now!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not stop my 3 yr old daughter from biting her nails.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that she is too young for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I tasted it and it really tastes awful!!I will keep using it and hopefully the horrible taste would eventually stop the nail biting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like test&lt;br /&gt;But looks like it helps.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to my friends&lt;br /&gt;It works,so it is good</li>
            <li> My daughter has been bitting her nails and surrounding skin for a solid two years.  this product is certainly helping to break the habit.  It really does taste awful.  It lasts about 1 - 2 days depending on hand washing and immediately has her taking her fingers out of her mouth.  I would also recommend it for thumb sucking problems.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to quit nail biting for over a decade.  Everytime I about give up I look at my bloody cuticles &amp; remember why. Before my wedding I sucessfully quit for 3 months by wearing gloves from morning to night. It wasnt a very easy task, daily things like cooking, cleaning, showers, you had to take them off and remember to put them on again. Tried this approach since &amp; now with children it&#x27;s impossible.&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I had several I thought to be good bouts of non-biting after reading this book&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Your-Nailbiting-Gilbreth-Brown/dp/1412023645/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1352313041&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;stop+nail+biting.&lt;br /&gt;I would still suggest this book as a great read on the insight of biting, made me realize its not as cut and dry as biting it&#x27;s more of a OCD.&lt;br /&gt;People who don&#x27;t understand call it a nervous habit asking; \\&quot;what are you nervous about?\\&quot; Really?! It might have started that way, IDK I was such a young child I have no idea, then it turns into a OCD, something you do non-consciencly. That&#x27;s what the book said, and I agree, but I woudld go one step further and say.. I ENJOY IT! I like the constant busy work of it, the way the nails and cuticle feel when i chew them, the way feeling afterward when I know I smoothed out that hangnail.  Then I look at my hands. They are BAD, it&#x27;s no wonder either.&lt;br /&gt;-----&gt;Now to the product, after applying it less then 24 hours ago for the first time.  At first I absent-mindedly put them in my mouth, this stuff in TERRIBLE! It takes any and all enjoyment out of this habit. Making you conscience of what you did &amp; are doing with a lingering disgusting aftermath depending on how big of a hangnail you got. It tastes kinda like power steering fluid,(nail-biting is how power steering fluid ended up in my mouth, haha, the irony) I have taken a shower, done the dishes, &amp; washed my hands at least 6 times; the stuff is still coating my nails with taste still there haunting me. I LOVE IT!  I think this is finally the key! Because now I keep looking at my nails, knowing that the taste is not worth the bite. I&#x27;ll let you know in a few months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry such a long review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/14/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does work!!  Of course I&#x27;m still struggling with such a deep OCD but when I start to fall off the wagon, (when I&#x27;m stressed out about something) a few applications of this, spaced every 3-4 days and I&#x27;m back on track.  The fluid seems to penetrate into the &#x27;meat&#x27; of your fingers.  So the deeper or more you bite the worse the punishment is.  It really makes you Hate what your doing, which think about that sentence means you now fully realize when your doing it which was the first step of the battle.  I have grown several sets of beautiful nails.  I even got to paint them pretty for the first time in my life.  My mother who has been biting for 60 years asked me for it. She likes my pretty nails. :)IT!  I think this is finally the key! Because now I keep looking at my nails, knowing that the taste is not worth the bite.

            <li> This works and doesnt work. It&#x27;s definitely bitter to the taste but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily solve the problem of nail biting.</li>
            <li> I have an 11 year old son who is way beyond just nail biting and bites his fingers as well.  He&#x27;s been doing this a couple of years and really wants to stop, but has had a hard time and hasn&#x27;t been able to.  His fingers have been red from him biting the skin off.  He&#x27;s been complaining about it and saying he wants to stop because it hurts and it bugs him, but he can&#x27;t.  He would bite his fingers not just the tips around the nails, but down the sides as well.  I was hoping this would not only help him to stop, but also not hurt him when I put it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS GREAT!  There wasn&#x27;t any stinging when I applied it (obviously there weren&#x27;t any open wounds!) and he did NOT like it! By the end of the day he was saying how horrible it was because it kept making everything taste awful. :)  At dinner there was an added bonus of him not eating anything with his fingers (something we&#x27;re always getting on him for! :)).  2-3 days later he still had a bit on him.  I haven&#x27;t reapplied it yet because he&#x27;s set on not biting them so he doesn&#x27;t have to have this on.  I LOVE it and it was worth every cent!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails as a nervous habit as long as I can remember. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever had a set of nails that hasn&#x27;t been an embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother used to try every technique to keep me from biting them, and nothing ever worked. As an adult, I&#x27;ve tried many solutions. This stuff is the only thing that has kept me from eating myself into disgustingness. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 3 year old and her 7 year old cousin. It has been nearly 3 weeks and they don&#x27;t even try to suck their thumb or fingers.</li>
            <li> Convenient and work fine - for my son 8 yrs old!!</li>
            <li> I understand why they don&#x27;t want you to use this on toddlers. Their tastebuds are definitely not developed enough to be able to dislike this and stop finger sucking. Back to the drawing board for me.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter started biting her nails down to the quick and then would hide her hands. She tried to stop on her own, but couldn&#x27;t break the habit. A friend told me about Mavala Stop and I ordered it the same day. In 2 weeks she had beautiful nails. I applied every night before she went to bed and then the second week every other night. She put it on my nails too...only fair. :) It does not taste good. The new problem now is she doesn&#x27;t want to break or file her nails.... I&#x27;ll take this issue over the other.</li>
            <li> My son liked the stuff, so it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t phase my 3 yr old... so considering the other reviews I have to question how it was stored/ if for some reason the effectiveness was decreased? Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My 2 year old child&#x27;s dentist recommended this to help break a thumb-sucking habit. We found out the hard way that the bad taste (and slight numbing sensation) lingers in your mouth for *hours.* My daughter cried inconsolably for over 4 hours, refused to drink, would not swallow her saliva because of the discomfort, would not speak clearly because of the discomfort, and finally threw up. I attempted to remove the product with finger nail polish remover, then followed up with soap and water. After attempting to remove the product, I put her thumb in my own mouth so I would understand what she was experiencing. Indeed, after a single momentary exposure, and even after the attempted removal, the taste STAYS IN YOUR MOUTH for an extended period of time. After all of that, my child went right back to sucking her thumb the following day after the product wore off -- she was so exhausted after losing 5 hours of sleep, not to mention after such a horrible experience, she needed her thumb to comfort and self-soothe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this was a strong reaction but I don&#x27;t think my child was being overly dramatic. She is a middle child, her older sister is rough and tumble, and she is usually tough in the face of boo-boos and bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand this product&#x27;s usefulness for some individuals, such as a school age child who has unsuccessfully tried other methods, who understands how this product works, and for whom this might be a last resort. However, I was furious at our dentist for recommending this product as a first line remedy for such a young child. We are changing dentists because of this. and, clearly, not using this product again.</li>
            <li> my son stopped sucking his thumb after first use after day one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails since I was like 5 years old. I&#x27;m 27 now and finally was able to stop biting my nails. I even used it on my 8 and 9 year old and they stopped biting their nails too. I thought there was no hope for me to stop biting my nails but now there is. I have nails!!!  and so do my girls. We are going on our 3rd week of not biting our nails. I&#x27;m not really even tempted to bit them anymore. The habit is slowing fading away. It says to apply every other day but we apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is as described- it has a horrible taste to it that lingers in the mouth and on the lips for a few minutes. It also lasts for several days. I&#x27;ve only used it twice and am still not sure it will be enough to keep my from biting my nails and fingers, but I am hopeful. If nothing else, it works well as a clear nail polish, although it is kind of pricey for just that.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  Tastes terrible so it definitely is a nail biting deterrent.  My only complaints on this is that it isn&#x27;t a matte finish, it&#x27;s shiny.  Also one application typically only lasts about 2 days so it&#x27;s kind hard to stay on top of.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a couple days and it tastes absolutely horrible so my son doesn&#x27;t suck his fingers.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  We used it to help our son stop sucking his thumb when he was 2 1/2 (33 months).  He has sucked his thumb since he was about a year old and any time he was sitting still it was in his mouth.  I tried it on myself first to see how it tasted, it was very bitter.  I placed a very small dab on the tip of his thumb nail (not the whole nail just a small dot on the very top) after breakfast, he tried to suck his thumb but each time he got close to his mouth he pulled it away.  2 days later I re-applied for good measure.  Since day 1 he has not sucked his thumb once however he did have trouble napping and falling asleep in the evening because that was how he soothed himself to sleep.  As of last week he is napping and sleeping through the night with no problem and no longer even tries to suck his thumb,  I would highly recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! In less than a month we had ended the thumb sucking habit.  And wow is it awful tasting.</li>
            <li> It really helps&lt;br /&gt;Will force your children no to bite and suck its finger anymore&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product</li>
            <li> Only had to use this product 3 times and my daughter has kept her fingers out of her mouth since. Being the parent I am I tried it first on my nail and I can clearly see why she did not want her fingers with that taste in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my finger nails since the day I was born, I believe. I created a blog at nailbiters.e-nanigans.com about my experience with Mavala stop, and am updating it still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala has done a stellar job of making me stop biting my nail. However, unfortunately, it would appear that I&#x27;m not just a nail &amp;#34;biter&amp;#34; - apparently now that I&#x27;ve stopped biting my nails, and they&#x27;ve grown...my brain has decided it&#x27;s a good idea to take my newly acquired nails and wage war on my other nails...at any rate. I digress. Mavala stop has done it&#x27;s job and deterred a nail-biting veteran from biting his nails. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes your nails are a bit shiny after applying Mavala Stop, which more or less equates to a clear coat of nail polish that tastes horrendous....but it&#x27;s not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and has sucked her thumb since birth. My husband and I wanted her to drop the habit before preschool. Plus, I discovered that her thumb sucking was causing her to have a cross-bite. I applied the product and she hated the taste (it did not cause her to gag or vomit; which was a relief). She did not like the taste, but would begin sucking her thumb once the product wore off. I applied the product every day for a week and during the night while she was sleeping. After about a week and a half, she completely stopped sucking her thumb! We also gave her an incentive for quitting the habit which also helped to motivate her. I would recommend muvalva stop to anyone with a preschooler who sucks their thumb.</li>
            <li> the taste is really really bad,  this works.  My nails look good.  Word of advise stay away from finger foods while you are using this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter was CONSTANTLY sucking her thumb as of late and it was driving us nuts, as I didn&#x27;t want that habit to get worse as she got older.  Some say they grow out of it, some not sure, either way I didn&#x27;t want it to become a big issue when her adult teeth came in.  When it arrived, I put a layer on each thumb later that evening.  As my wife and I later witnessed her post Mavala taste, I felt bad due to the look of disgust on her face.  A few seconds later, she said &amp;#34;tummy hurt&amp;#34;, as she soon later laid on the sofa.  I saw her do it again shortly after then about 4 minutes later, as I was busy in the kitchen, my wife was yelling for help, as my daughter began vomiting all over.  Luckily, we had a blanket, as I will spare the details and cleanup.  My wife and I felt horrible!!!  I was not sure if to try again or what, as I did not want another episode of that again!!!  Once was enough!  So two days later, as directions say, this time I applied only a tiny amount ONLY on the tips of her thumbs, and did not put an entire coat as I did prior.  Since that episode,  she only tried a few times, but she is no longer a thumb sucker, nor do we ever see her try as of late.  We still apply it ever 2 days at night, when she is sleeping and passed out.  That way, she knows no better and does not put up a fight if she realized the root of the taste deterrent.  May just continue applying for a few weeks, just in case.  TIP 1:  FIRST try on an empty stomach the 1st time (just in case)  TIP 2:  TRY applying only a smidgen on each finger as needed.  (For us it is more than enough to deter my daughter)     As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases. So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  If this review was helpful to you please press YES in the link below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and the Boriele product. I find they both work well, I&#x27;m just too determined to bite. Between the two, I found the Mavala tasted the worst, but it also washed off way too easily, so that I had to apply multiple times a day. The Boriele, on the other hand, will stay for days after 1 application, however it doesn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails on and off for 26 years or so. This product is really bitter tasting, and is super effective for me. My fingers stay out of my mouth completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears off in 3 days or so, and while you can still taste bitterness, it&#x27;s bearable, so this product is most effective for me if I put it on every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoying thing - the bitter taste transfers to food really easily for the first couple days. I wouldn&#x27;t cook, bake cookies, eat sandwiches etc. for a couple days after application to be safe.</li>
            <li> Only works while she is awake, but as soon as she falls asleep her thumb goes right in her mouth and does not seem to bother her</li>
            <li> This is the best deterant that i&#x27;ve found for my little boy, but he still finds a way to suck his thumb even with this on.  I just think he&#x27;s that dedicated and looks past the terrible taste.  Maybe for most cases this works well, but still searching for a way to break my son&#x27;s habit.</li>
            <li> If you are an adult with a nail biting problem then this product might be great for you.  I however have an 8 year old son that has a nail biting problem I am trying to break.  My son came home from school in tears because of this product.  He claims he accidentally got his fingers in his mouth while eating a sandwich at lunchtime and the taste was so horrible he had an upset stomach the rest of the day.  Now, I can&#x27;t really say if the accident he claims was true or he bit his nails at school, but either way I can&#x27;t continue to give this to him if it&#x27;s going to upset his stomach each time.</li>
            <li> After 50+ years of biting my nails, this is the only thing that stopped me.  The taste is the worst thing you could imagine.  I only put my fingers to my lips one time and that was that.  Now 2 months later, my nails are normal lengths and the nail beds are beginning to take the shape of normal beds which may occur in another 6 months or so from what I read.  Thinking about this item?  Just do it; NOW!</li>
            <li> So far this has not worked at all.  My toddler doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothered by it, I&#x27;ve even reapplied it daily.</li>
            <li> It helps stop the constant sucking but I don&#x27;t like the fact that the taste stays on all food she touches. But it has helped</li>
            <li> Wow!!! This truly works.  My daughter could not stop sucking her thumb.  Once I applied Mavala to her thumb, she stopped completely.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this 3 years ago!  It will work!  It is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> It works... Just don&#x27;t forget you have it on your nails when you&#x27;re cooking.</li>
            <li> Great product, it works</li>
            <li> I wished that I would have read the reviews first.  I applied two coats on my daughter&#x27;s finger while she was sleep and had to endear her gagging to the nasty taste.  She was even afraid to eat using her left hand in fear of the taste when she wasn&#x27;t trying to suck her thumb.  It was well worth it.  She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb in two weeks since I first used the product and I have only had to apply the product twice.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different products to get my son to stop chewing his nails, and this is the only one that worked.  It isn&#x27;t an irritant ( no capsaicin like other products) so I don&#x27;t have to worry about him rubbing his eyes.  It also stays on for a long time because it is like nail polish.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product on 4 children at the age of 1... It&#x27;s has only worked for 2 out of the 4 children...I guess that you are taking a gamble when using this.... I&#x27;ve tasted it and it does taste awful but I guess it depends on how bad the addiction is for the child.. Overall I would recommend that parents give it a try because there is a 50/50 chance that it will work from my experience.:)</li>
            <li> Great product, did a better job than a braking habit braces which cost us $500 placed by the dentist on our 4 years old kid to stop thumb sucking habit. The tongue crib helped fixing the alignment of the teenth and the upper jaw, but our daughter did not gave up on the sucking of her thumb. With Malava, the next day no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Used it to help my 3-year old stop thumb-sucking...Worked great!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product does not work for my kid.  Didn&#x27;t even phase him one bit.  Not sure what it&#x27;s going to take to get him to stop sucking on his fingers.</li>
            <li> I NEVER TASTED IT, BUT MY KIDDO HATED THE TASTE AND STOPPED THE BITING HABIT AFTER 2 WEEKS..</li>
            <li> As far as negative reinforcement is concerned, this product is extremely effective.  I HAD a 17-month-old thumbsucker who was so attached to her thumb that her top teeth were starting to buck.  I had already tried several other tactics with no positive results.  My brother recommended Mavala Stop, so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night was rough on my daughter (and on us), but she very quickly stopped the thumbsucking.  The next day, however, she discovered her OTHER (non-treated) thumb, so I applied more Mavala.  In hindsight, I probably should have just painted both thumbs from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after reading another reviewer&#x27;s comments, I had only put a tiny bit on the tip of my daughter&#x27;s thumbnails.  I found it didn&#x27;t last long that way, so just ended up painting the entire thumbnail on both hands.  Since then, I&#x27;ve been thrilled to see that the habit is completely gone.  This product is perfect for ending thumbsucking.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cat, our 5 month old kitty was recently spayed.  For some inexplicable reason the vet used dissolvable stitches and told us not to let her lick them at all for TWO WEEKS.  Seriously??  They suggested a cone, but our area only sells the plastic ones and the cat wouldn&#x27;t be able to eat, drink, sleep, or even get into her little house bed with it on, so that wasn&#x27;t an option.  The vet also suggested a premie &amp;#34;onesie.&amp;#34;  We went with that option, but it&#x27;s been less than ideal as it rides up unless it&#x27;s snapped shut at the butt and then the cat can&#x27;t use the bathroom.  The snaps go over her butt, so cutting a hole there for toileting needs would be the same as not snapping it shut at all.  But, we tried the onesie without snapping it shut and just watched her as much as possible.  Predictably, she wouldn&#x27;t stop licking and chewing at the incision.  By day 5, my youngest daughter happened to see the cat chewing at her incision.  She went to stop her when the cat raised its head and &amp;#34;looked like she was eating something.&amp;#34;  Super.  While the incision looks normal, I&#x27;m pretty sure she managed to pull out at least some of her surface stitches.  We next tried to rig up a homemade soft collar to stop her injuring herself, but that didn&#x27;t work well either and only lasted a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, I finally remembered we had an almost-full bottle of Mavala Stop and wondered if it would be safe to use on a cat.  I checked every ingredient first to ensure there was nothing that could be toxic to kitty (there wasn&#x27;t) and decided to give it a try.  NOTE: I only used a VERY tiny amount of this stuff and did NOT rub it on the incision.  We also did NOT use it when her incision was fresh, but waited until day 5 when the wound was crusting over (and probably itching) and the cat was obsessively attending to it.  At that point, I dipped a medical grade swab into the Mavala Stop container, wiped off the excess on the bottle&#x27;s edge, and then very, very lightly and gently ROLLED the swab along the incision--just enough so that if she licked that area again, she&#x27;d get a light taste that might stop her from wanting to lick there any more.  Then we waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty soon the cat licked her incision.  I thought the effort was another failure until the cat immediately went to her water bowl and drank a lot of water.  Shortly afterwards, she again bent down to lick the incision.  This time, however, she froze in mid-movement for a few seconds, seemed to remember the unpleasant experience of a few moments ago, and continued walking without licking or chewing the area again.  She did that a second time soon afterwards but, again, froze in mid-movement and did not lick her incision.  Two days later and we have not seen her lick or chew the stitches/incision again.  She seems completely healthy and isn&#x27;t any worse for wear.  We have not applied Mavala Stop more than that one time and, as I stated, only used a very, very light amount--just so a bit of the nasty taste would be there to stop her licking and chewing.  So far, it seems to have resolved the problem.nt--just so a bit of the nasty taste would be there to stop her licking and chewing.  So far, it seems to have resolved the problem.</li>
            <li> It does taste terrible and it was a pretty good deterrent for daytime, but we really needed something to get her through the night without sucking her thumb and this did not work.  Painted it just before bedtime at 8:30 and when we checked on her at 11:30, the thumb was firmly embedded in her mouth.  She did complain of a bad taste in her mouth in the morning, but that wasn&#x27;t enough to stop it when she was sleeping.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been trying to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb for a year now.  THis did it in two days.  We put it on and told her that her fingers would make her mouth taste yucky if she put them in her mouth.  She agreednot to and ofcourse a few minutes later ran to her bed and lay down saying she was sick.  She was holding her saliva and admitted that she had put her fingers in her mouth we drank and spit and she has not (after those two days) put her fingers in her mouth- one application was all it took.</li>
            <li> I was hesistant to use this product on my 20 month old daugther who was sucking her thumb very frequently. But her 2 front teeth were starting to move forward so I went ahead and tried it. She cried for 20 minutes when she put her thumb in her mouth after applying it (I tasted it too and it is absolutely awful!). I felt so bad, but after that, she stopped crying and hasn&#x27;t cried since. She also hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since - not even in her sleep! It&#x27;s been a month now and I reapply it every 3-4 days. Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to use it much longer since I don&#x27;t really see her thumb going towards her mouth anymore. The product worked great for us.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a result of a dentists recommendation. My daughter (6) at the time was a constant thumb sucker. I know it was more out of habit as a way for her to comfort herself before falling asleep, but I started to notice a visible change in her front teeth as a result. I consulted the dentist about this and he recommended this product. It smelled awful when I opened the bottle. Very much like nail polish, painted it over the entirety of her thumb. Within a week of using this I&#x27;m proud to say she no longer sucks her thumb. Although she may have actually stopped the first night (the taste is awful). If you&#x27;re getting it for that purpose I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have two boys, 7 and 2, both thumb-suckers. At first I thought this was a miracle product, until they got used to the taste and just went back to sucking their thumbs. My 7-year-old only sucks his thumb at night, and I tried putting it on after he&#x27;d fallen asleep, but he sucked his thumb anyway. My 2-year-old wants to suck his thumb constantly. I will apply it and it works as a deterrent for about an hour, then he just sucks his thumb anyway, so I end up having to reapply it and the cycle begins all over again. I guess I just have very stubborn children, because this stuff tastes so horrible and lingers forever in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Tastes really bad and kid cannot suck thumbs, even in her sleep. Just be sure to apply while thumb is dry, otherwise it won&#x27;t stay on. Also washes off, so need to apply regularly.</li>
            <li> After all of the great reviews I thought for sure this would help my 9 year old son stop biting his nails. It worked for maybe a week and he was right back to it. The taste no longer bothers him - so for our family, it was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 6 and she was still sucking her thumb so I asked our Pediactric Dentist and he told me about Malavla Stop.  I ordered it, it was shipped out right away.  The first night I put it on her nails was the end of her thumb sucking.  We reappled it every other night for about a week and now the thumb sucking is history.  I had tried another device that actually went over the thumb it was pricey that did not work, she was able to pull it off.  I reccoment this to anyone who is looking for a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> The product tasted really really bad. My daughter hated it so much that she felt like throwing up the first time we applied it to her nails. We wanted to get rid of her finger sucking habit. Looked like it worked during the first 2 days but then she stopped worrying about the taste and started sucking her fingers more. Guess she understood we were trying to get rid of her bad habit and so started doing it more. Might be its good for older people biting finger nails but not so good for 2 year old kids.</li>
            <li> My son has been nail biting since before he was one year old.  He is three now and after the first week of using this product his nails are growing and look fantastic.  I have noticed in about three day this product wears off and he reverts back to the biting. Since this habit didn&#x27;t start overnight, I expect it to take some time to break completely. I was skeptical before trying this product but now I strongly recommend it. I finally can see there is light at the end of the tunnel for my little nail biter.</li>
            <li> My 6-year-old had a terrible nail biting habit and also chewed the skin around the cuticles and tips of her fingers.  Four weeks with this product and she now has beautiful nails and healed up skin.  By the second and third week we were applying it every day, sometimes twice a day because she got used to the taste, but by the end of the month, she had broken the habit.  You have to be vigilant about applying it consistently but it TOTALLY worked for us and I would say that she had a terrible habit - her fingers were constantly in her mouth.  She&#x27;s so proud of the way her fingers look now and I&#x27;m glad to know those germs are not constantly being transmitted to her mouth and through the broken skin on her fingertips.  THIS STUFF WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I have 4 children &amp; they all suck/sucked their fingers! They are 6, 4, 2, &amp; 3months. My 3 oldest have all stopped sucking their fingers thanks to this wonderful product! My youngest will have this on her fingers too when she is older, so she can happily suck her fingers now.</li>
            <li> This product stopped my 1 1/2 year old from trying to suck her thumb in a few days.  However, she did get diaper rash for about a day after using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I bought Mavala thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve had my nail biting habit as long as I can remember (30+ years). I would say on a scale of 1 to 10 my habit is about an 8. I had tried a different product called Thumb that worked for about zero seconds, the taste was really mild and was probably meant for toddlers. I decided to give Mavala a try and here is what I have to say, this stuff tastes HORRIBLE and lasts for at least 2-3 days (if you&#x27;ve accidentally tasted earwax, imagine that but 100 times stronger). I only have to apply it once or twice a week and it&#x27;s plenty, one bottle should be enough. You will not want to put your fingers anywhere near your mouth. The downside is that you&#x27;ll end up with the bad taste when eating finger foods, i.e. chips, fries, popcorn. Once it gets around your lips you&#x27;ll have the taste for a while but it&#x27;s manageable and well worth it. I&#x27;ve stopped bitting for that last 3 weeks, quite unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s working for me I almost guarantee it will work for you.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old sucks his thumb and has an overbite due to it. Luckily, he still has his baby teeth. I put the Mavala on and he stopped completely. It did break my heart a little because he no longer wanted his lovey anymore. It&#x27;s been a few months and surprisingly, his baby teeth looks straight! My 2 year old sucks her fingers and she stopped... however, this clever girls knows when I forget to put no the Mavala (it lasts for about a day) and she&#x27;ll go right back to sucking. It&#x27;ll be a while with this one....</li>
            <li> Good news is it is disgusting. So much in fact that my daughter threw up all over the place even though I only put a tiny spot on the problem thumb. She is just so stubborn she wouldn&#x27;t keep her thumb out of her mouth even though she was crying, screaming like she was in pain and telling me how gross it was and asking me to kiss her tongue (not going happen).</li>
            <li> This product ended an eight year turmoil, we tried thumb gone, a thumb guard inserted by the dentist and a plastic thumb guard that I ordered off the internet.  Nothing stopped my child from sucking her thumb until now.  This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 years old and is constantly sucking his thumb day and night and so I was looking for a product that would help him get rid of that habit. I bought this after reading all the rave reviews and testimonials from other people on this site who said it worked for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me it made no difference whatsoever. I applied it on my son&#x27;s right thumbnail the same day we got it just before his bed time. When he first sucked his thumb right after that he was in a bit of shock at the bad taste and had to drink water and gargle it out to get the taste out of his mouth. For a second I got excited that this just might work. But, as soon as he fell asleep after about 20 mins later, his right thumb instinctively went back in to his mouth and I could hear the same thumb sucking sound he always makes when he is sucking his thumb dry. The next day I asked me and he said it does not bother him at all, he said \\&quot;look, I sucked it all from my thumb\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied it 2 more times after that day and it has had no effect, his thumb sucking continues as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, it did not work for us and actually it is in the same category as other products such as \\&quot;THUM\\&quot; that don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that I found annoying was that at least THUM lists the ingredients that it contains, for this product, you have no ideal what&#x27;s inside or what it is made up of. The so called instruction sheet hardly has any details and it just one paragraph of information inside without any details about the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the product&#x27;s box was not sealed when I received it. The bottle was most likely sealed but not the box. (there is no way to tell really as it was closed tightly but did not have any seal on the lid) The top paper lid/cover had been opened and a crumpled piece of paper was stuffed inside on top of the bottle as if to protect the bottle during shipping, that is after having three layers in the packaging alredy so it made me a bit wary as to why someone would do that.it wary as to why someone would do that.</li>
            <li> I was a serious nail biter.  I&#x27;m 25 and can&#x27;t remember a time when I didn&#x27;t bite my nails.  Like some of the other reviewers, I would bite my nails down the quick.  It never bothered me really until I realized it started affecting my work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to finally stop.  I had tried cold turkey, fidgeting with toys, and even wearing gloves but nothing worked.  I then tried the MAVALA STOP nail polish.  After reading a lot of reviews, I was already frightened to put my fingers near my mouth.  For the first two days, I was overly cautious and never tasted the awful stuff.  Then one day I forgot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is so foreign and bad, you can&#x27;t help but bring it to your conscious level of thought and notify yourself that you were about to bite your nails.  That&#x27;s all I really needed and I have stopped biting my nails after 14 days and only 3 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pluses:&lt;br /&gt;- No smell&lt;br /&gt;- Does not wash off without scrubbing&lt;br /&gt;- Horrid taste akin to earwax&lt;br /&gt;- Apply once every 2-3 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the only downside to the product is that the day following an application, finger food is contaminated with this awful taste.  Use utensils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, not for children under 3 or really anyone where a bad taste is not a deterrent.</li>
            <li> We had to apply this once every other day on our 5yr old to stop biting his nails and it took 2 months for him to completely stop!</li>
            <li> Chronic nail biter, I have tried many things. So far this is the absolute best. It&#x27;s terribly bitter, and the taste takes some time to leave your mouth. It has also helped with dieting - not intentionally, however it is difficult to finish eating a meal when you forgot and licked sauce off of your finger and YUK!!!</li>
            <li> My son 5 years old stopped sucking his thumb  with Mavala Stop.. Recommended to many friends they loved it.  Recommend to many other friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked.  Broke my three year old over night from finger sucking.</li>
            <li> Has yet to stop my son from sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> My son bites his nails. I tried everything to get him to stop and nothing worked except for this. He would wash his hands with the others and I would have to reapply. With Mavala Stop I don&#x27;t have that problem because it stay one even if you wash your hands. I highly recommend this for nail bitting and thumb sucking. Great Stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great product... Works very well for nail biting and thumb sucking. Applied one time to my child and he stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Pros: It works. Daughter will not suck thumb when applied regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Cons: Daughter gives me look when I put it on like she might kill me in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hide sharp objects and go for it.</li>
            <li> after just 2 weeks of this my son has length in his nails, not bitten stubs. This stuff tastes disgusting and as he pointed out, only comes off if you take a bath. We had tried Thum in the past. It didn&#x27;t work for us. This most certainly has.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small bottle but it goes far. Hopefully you&#x27;ll only ever need to buy one!</li>
            <li> my 6 yr  old daughter wants to stop sucking her thumb but needs the extra help to kick the habit and this did the trick.  I don&#x27;t think it will work unless the child is really ready to quit though. but once they are, this will get it done!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t think it would work since I had tried other products like Thum.  My 5 year old was not going to stop...but this product stopped his thumbed sucking in less than 4 days.  Awesome!!! Just as an added bonus, I talked his nail biting Dad into trying some as well...I can&#x27;t believe it is working on him too.  He has been biting his nails for 48 years!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it, highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because of my son. He&#x27;s developed the habit of \\&quot;fiddling\\&quot; with his tongue with his fingers. Sometimes licking his hands as well. Unfortunately the Mavala didn&#x27;t help with  this particular problem. But as for nail biting and thumb/finger sucking, I&#x27;m sure it would work quite well. My son purposefully&lt;br /&gt;tasted the Mavala on his nails and described it as \\&quot;really terrible\\&quot;. (He&#x27;s 7 btw.) It&#x27;s just that with his particular habit, he was able to avoid tasting the Mavala Stop.</li>
            <li> After buying a thumb cover for 3 1/2 years for my son.  I decided to give this a try because he learned how to take that thumb cover off.  After 24 hours he has not sucked his thumb, but that taste is a complete turn off for him.  It has been 2 weeks now and everything has been going well.  This is exactly what he needed because nothing worked.  I&#x27;m love this product and will recommend it for anyone that has had problems with breaking the habit of sucking of the thumb/finger or nail biting.  It works!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to put this on my nails and start sucking all of my fingers immediately! When I did I was satisfied with the product since I couldn&#x27;t taste food for 2 days!</li>
            <li> This works well.  As long as you keep it on consistently (apply every few days) it should help break the habit.  My daughter hated it and won&#x27;t even go near the stuff.  She even climbed on the table, grabbed the box and bottle and threw it in the trash can.</li>
            <li> It works well for nail biting and defn has a TERRIBLE bitter taste but the only problem I have with this product is that you MUST reapply it daily, if you wash your hands a lot everyday, it tends to come off, just wish it would last longer!!</li>
            <li> Works great! My kids hate the taste and it lasts for awhile. I have to be careful not to get any on my fingers because it tastes sooo bad.</li>
            <li> 3 year old stopped thumb sucking in a day, but also got allergy and red spots on face and at some other parts of body. He lost his appetite for a day but after 2 days, there was recovery. He does not even think of thumb sucking anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! 8+ years of thumb sucking- done! We applied it on a Sunday - then again the following Sunday... That&#x27;s all it took! She&#x27;s kicked the habit!! Yeah!</li>
            <li> My son had a horrible nail biting problem that he would bite all the way to nub and eventually all he had was stubs ! So my lil man who is newly minted five year didn&#x27;t argue or stay put for the polish job I applied this while his was a sleep every night ! Now almost a month later I don&#x27;t even have to apply any more he know my knows now not to chew on his nails ! So grateful for this product I will recommend now to try it out on the hubby ! 1st photo before second after !</li>
            <li> My 6 year old had a serious finger sucking habit. We tried to be gentle, we tried to be firm, we tried to keep her hands busy but nothing was working. I painted her fingers one night, which wasn&#x27;t the best, because she cried herself to sleep. She complained all the next day. We painted them again two nights later, and then it was done. No finger sucking and no more painting!</li>
            <li> My son developed a terrible habit of biting his nails and his fingers looked awful. I found Mavala Stop a few years ago on Amazon and it really works. As long as I keep his nails polished, he does well, but as soon as I forget, he goes back to biting. We keep a supply in our home and I recommend it to anyone I see biting their nails.</li>
            <li> My soon to be 4 yo has been sucking his fingers from the womb.  For the first couple of days Mavala Stop seemed pretty effective.  After 4 days the fingers started making there way back into his mouth.  I reapplied and reapplied, but it no longer deters him for more than a day.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to try something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it made me stop biting my nails for a month. The reason it didn&#x27;t completely work is it was so strong when you first put it on, you can taste it on everything you eat (finger foods).  By the second day it wears down a little but still deters you from biting your nails. Then by the third or fourth day I would catch myself biting my nails again, but wouldn&#x27;t want to put more on because I enjoy my food tasting like food. All in all, I just don&#x27;t have enough self control for it! Not their fault, but if you are going to get this product, make sure that you are going to stick with it and not eat finger foods for a few weeks/months.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have tried many different ways to stop biting my nails. This product is great! After 2-3 weeks I had stopped biting my nails. I had couple of &amp;#34;relapses&amp;#34; when I started biting a little bit. A quick coat of this product stopped that and got me away from the bad habit again. I would recommend this for adults who can&#x27;t stop biting!</li>
            <li> My two elementary school kids who we could not get to stop sucking their thumbs quickly stopped after we started painting their thumbs with this stuff. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great when I remember to put it on. My son is a terrible nail bitter. The polish comes off faster than I&#x27;d like (hence the four stars) but it works well when applied regularly. It doesn&#x27;t help that my son is also a compulsive hand washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My daughter stopped sucking her fingers after 3 applications</li>
            <li> We only had to put it on my daughter&#x27;s nails 3 times,  she no longer sucks her thumbs.  It is a miracle, only wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4 weeks. So far so good!  A little difficult getting her to sleep during bedtime, but eventually everyone falls asleep right.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t faze my 5 year old...I tried it and it&#x27;s disgusting, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically clear nail polish. Everytime you bite into your nails you will be reminded not too. Just make sure to put it only on your nails and not on the tip of your fingers also or else you will taste the nail polish in your food when you eat. Lastly, I recommend carry around a fingernail clipper to use for those unbearable times you feel like biting your nails.</li>
            <li> Worked! My three year old stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Great product....my kid stopped sucking her fingers after maybe 3 nights of using it.after the age of 4...i used a product called Thum before which didnt work at all</li>
            <li> Bought this to help stop my 3 year old from biting his nails. Worked the first time we used it! Downfall is if your child likes to snack on a lot of finger foods the bad taste gets transferred to their mouth while eating.</li>
            <li> Was doubtful but it works!</li>
            <li> Worked well for a while but then the top started to get all sticky and the lid won&#x27;t screw on/off very easily and also the contents in the bottle have started to solidify. Did keep my husband from biting his nails for awhile but would wear off way to quickly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my toddler.</li>
            <li> Our 2 year old (WAS) a left hander ring and middle finger double sucker. Our pediatritian said not to worry about it and just remind him to take his fingers out of his mouth and that it would eventually stop. That advice was pointless before he was 20 months - but then seemed to be making progress. However, around 26 months he started ignoring us again. And since it was his left hand, he could still do lots of playing with his fingers in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we tried the generic &amp;#34;no more thumbs&amp;#34; type from CVS. That was laughable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered Mavala Stop. It worked - almost too well. My husband put it on him right before dinner time. Immediately got a grimace and stopped sucking. Unless he tried again when i wasn&#x27;t looking, that first suck with the Mavala was also the last. He quit cold turkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatley, what I didn&#x27;t realize that my 13-hour-a-night sleeper who was super easy to put to bed (we just put on his pjs and closed the door) was that way because he sucked his fingers to fall asleep and again any time he woke up during the night. Taking away the finger sucking created a huge issue with him taking forever to fall asleep, getting out of bed in the middle of the night, etc. Its been 3 months and we are just finally getting back to normal although he&#x27;s still only doing 9 hours instead of 13. It was a shift directly because we took away his fingers. If i had known i would have let it go a bit longer.....</li>
            <li> This worked great on my 4 year old to stop him from sucking his fingers. We only applied it every other day for about a couple of weeks, and haven&#x27;t needed to since. After reading the other reviews, we decided to only apply a small amount to the tip of his nails. He didn&#x27;t get sick and it didn&#x27;t bother him. And it worked!</li>
            <li> Wow! This really works. I&#x27;ve been biting since I was a kid (I&#x27;m 34 now) and this has finally make me stop. It needs to be reapplied every few days as it tends to wear off pretty quick. But it&#x27;s so worth it! After all these years of biting I now how beautiful long nails! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  Our son got hooked on sucking his thumb when he was born at 35 weeks and couldn&#x27;t be held for the first few weeks of life.  He is currently 5 years old and his new permanent teeth are moving because of his thumb sucking.  I&#x27;ve tried several things through the years with no luck.  I love this product because he can paint it on while he sleeps and it lasts until you apply it again in 2 days.  After a couple of weeks of use we had accidentally skipped an extra day, but never caught him sucking.  We paint the whole nail.  The first night of use be prepared to help them get the nasty taste out of their mouths so they can get back to bed.  We had prepared our son by using someone else&#x27;s story of a thumb sucking fairy, that was going to come watch over him so he could stop this habit.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old daughter. She&#x27;s been biting her nails and the skin around her nail. It started off good. She said it tasted terrible, then after a while she just started biting it off. Things have gotten better though. She&#x27;s more aware of what she is doing and trying harder to stop. For the price it was worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This product tastes so nasty!  So it does exactly what I&#x27;d hoped it would .... help me to stop biting.  I will have beautiful nails for my daughter&#x27;s wedding in June.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Well my son was so afraid of tasting it that he never even tried.  So far thumb sucking is over</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!! 8 year old stopped sucking his thumb the day we put this on. Wish we had it sooner</li>
            <li> Our daughter is 6 and about to be seven in a few months. Has sucked her thumb since she was a baby. We were getting more and more concerned as her permanent teeth started coming in. Put the product on and within a short time later we could hear it working...lol. By the third night she was no longer even putting her thumb in her mouth. Awesome stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> This product definitely keeps my son from biting fingernails and toenails. The application lasts a couple days. He does complain of the bad taste- which I guess makes it effective. Sometimes he complains, when eating that the taste gets on his food- at which time I remind him that he sould be eating with his utensils. :o)</li>
            <li> This stuff has stopped me cold from putting my fingers anywhere near my mouth. I have bitten my nails since I can remember and now at 30 years old, I&#x27;ve had enough. I tried some other anti-nail biting creams that would come off too quickly but this stuff has staying power, even through hand washing. It&#x27;s great stuff and at for under $20 bucks, it was money well spent to me. I will be buying another just to make sure I have one for my handbag so I don&#x27;t have to be without it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My 3 year old stop sucking her thumb almost immediately.  But my 6 year unfortunately grew accustomed to the taste.  I do not blame Mavala Stop at all...I&#x27;ve got a stubborn 6 year old on my hands! ;)</li>
            <li> Well it definitely tastes nasty. My seven year old daughter and I have both been using this. And I&#x27;ve had more success than she has but only because I know when it needs to be reapplied. Either she bites in spite of the taste or it wears off. Regardless not as successful as i had hoped for her. And somewhat successful for me. Better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Product is really helping my 4yr old son stop his habit of bitting his nails which are like half of normal nails length .He hasn&#x27;t bit his nails since we started using it.he says his nails taste yucky....yea.</li>
            <li> you have to try this. It works</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle now and it&#x27;s great. I had to replace my first bottle after a few months because it got very difficult to open.Works great on the kids (3 and 5). My 3 yr old calls it the &amp;#34;yucky nail polish&amp;#34; and hates it so much that she tries to wash her hands off multiple times in the day to get rid of it. it is a great deterrent for finger sucking and nail biting. I have to reapply it every other day to have the maximum effect and I even apply around the nail. My son has gotten used to it but says it&#x27;s still pretty gross. My 5 yr old son is doing much better with biting his nails and it&#x27;s all thanks to Mavala..whatever nasty,bitter taste they put it in seems to work.</li>
            <li> This works really well. You can wash your hands a million times and it won&#x27;t come off. The problem is that when I eat, it gets on my food (if I&#x27;m eating a sandwich) and then I have this horrid taste in my mouth for 1/2 hour. I will say that when I used it I didn&#x27;t dare put my nails in my mouth. So it works well. Minus one star only because of the food issue.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm. My girls stopped biting their nails immediately after the second application. I tried other brands and the kids got used to it. That didn&#x27;t happen with mavala stop.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product!  Used it on my first son when he was bitting his nails and got over the habit real soon. My friends borrowed it from me few times. Now my second son has developed the habit  (both around age 7) and we hope he&#x27;ll get over it soon. It has a bitter taste that discourage the child to put his hand/ nail near his mouth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bc my 2 1/2 yr old sucks her fingers. I told her that it was yucky had her taste it. She confirmed it was gross. I tasted it GROSS. I am applying every day and it is not working. It should work but if you have a STUBBORN thumb or finger sucker. This product does not work.</li>
            <li> Stopped my daughter from sucking her fingers and me from biting my nails.  Within a month this helped by 4 year old stop sucking her fingers, hopefully this bottle will save her from years of orthodontia years from now.  I used it too to try and stop by nail biting habit I had for all my life.  Within 3 weeks I broke this 30 year habit, it also helped my manners in terms of eating food with my hands.  Add a bit on each nail and you will quickly realize that you put your hands in your mouth more often you think.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old male. I had been a big-time nail bitter for basically my entire life. So we&#x27;re talking about 35 years. I am now about 10 weeks bite free. I have virtually zero desire to bite, and haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since the first week of January. It is now March 19th.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped before but within a couple of weeks was biting again. Couldn&#x27;t resist the urge. So when I purchased the Mavala, I had gone a week without biting. Folks, this stuff works. And it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this is that it tastes horrible. A metal like taste. I have never chewed on a AAA battery, but I would imagine that that is what it would taste like. The taste really does not go away. Even after days, and multiple showers/handwashing it is there. It is so strong, you pretty much have to give up finger foods. Buffalo Wings? Ha! Any sauce like &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; foods will be inedible. Even my family members complained because the potato chips tasted nasty after my hand had been in them. It is that strong.&lt;br /&gt;When I was a biter, I often wouldn&#x27;t even know I was biting. Now, with this stuff, one even accidental finger swipe on the lip reminds me not to bite. I have used other similar products, but none of them worked. Pay the extra few bucks and order this stuff. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but it is almost like it rewires your brain to think about biting nails as nasty (and,...it is). The best analogy I can think of would be if you really liked a certain restaurant. It was your favorite restaurant and you ate there all the time. They knew you there. No imagine constantly being shown videos of employees spiting in food, rats running around the kitchen, and a bunch of other disgusting things going on in the kitchen. You probably wouldn&#x27;t eat there anymore , right? Every time you thought about this restaurant you would cringe.&lt;br /&gt;That is what this stuff does. It CONSTANTLY reminds you how nasty your nails are. This stuff worked so well for me, I only needed to use if for about a month. I have put it on once in the past few weeks. Even then I really didn&#x27;t need it. My nails look great. Funny thing, is simple things like typing this review are different because I have nails. BUY THIS PRODUCT TO STOP BITING NAILS.I only needed to use if for about a month. I have put it on once in the past few weeks. Even then I really didn&#x27;t need it. My nails look great. Funny thing, is simple things like typing this review are different because I have nails. BUY THIS PRODUCT TO STOP BITING NAILS.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars if I could. I am very pleased that it worked as well as it did. My three year old stopped sucking his fingers after only ONE application. I highly recommend it to anyone with children who need to kick the finger sucking habit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stop biting my nails for years, using lots of methods including &#x27;bitter bite.&#x27; Perhaps it was the right time for me, but this product must receive some of the credit for my nails growing out and me stopping my entrenched habit. It tastes awful, God awful lol&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> My daughter was 3 years old and still sucking her thumb.  We ordered Mavala Stop, applied it to her thumb nails that night and it worked instantly.  3 weeks later and she still hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> It really works the taste is so bad my kids don&#x27;t even think getting their fingers close to their mouth. What I I love about it also is that it lasts for at least a week so you have to retouch it every hour like other stuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing results, stopped thumb sucking instantly.  We used this for our daughter&#x27;s thumb sucking, she was turning 4 and for months we&#x27;ve told her  &amp;#34;when you&#x27;re 4, your thunb turns Yucky&amp;#34;.  She is very strong willed and did not want to stop because &amp;#34;it still tastes good&amp;#34;.  We put a small dab on her thumb while she slept the first weekend after her birthday.  After the first shock when she put her thumb in her mouth, she only did it out of habit 2-3 more times.  We kept some juice handy to wash the taste away when she accidentally did it in the early morning hours.  She made the connection quickly and has basically stopped thumb sucking.  I put it on my own thumb to try, and a little will go a long way.  It tastes like you&#x27;ve just liked 10 envelopes all at once....kind of a bitter &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; taste.</li>
            <li> I have tried other things before. My daughter is 8 and she is been biting her nails for more than 6 months. She stop !!!</li>
            <li> It seems to work better than Bite It.</li>
            <li> When our daughter was 2 we used Mavala to stop thumb sucking. Now she&#x27;s 4 and we use it to curb nail biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter told us, &amp;#34;Eww, it tastes like coins,&amp;#34; and we were wondering how in the hell do coins taste like. We licked her fingernail and determined her description was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> Never write reviews but this stuff is amazing. My 2 yr old was a constant finger sucker since an infant, impeding speech, fine motor and basically everything since he always had his fingers in his mouth. We used it twice and he never looked back! He didn&#x27;t cry, whine - he simply put his hands in his mouth a few times, realized taste and that was it! I was also petrified he&#x27;d be so cranky since that was his self sooth ability / fall asleep but it was fine!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on for awhile..........within a day it&#x27;s gone.......not to mention my children still sucked their thumb and said they liked the flavor.</li>
            <li> Nope....didn&#x27;t work, my son was waaaaay tooooooo clever for this item. Wiped it off and started sucking the stuff off, LOL!</li>
            <li> The drug store stuff just doesn&#x27;t cut it. It wears off or is too mild.&lt;br /&gt;One application of this and my son wanted nothing to do with his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, he complains about the taste getting on his sandwiches. But you can&#x27;t have it both ways.</li>
            <li> Nothing else works.  Greatest product ever.  It worked when nothing else would and I would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Superb. Very sour.&lt;br /&gt;Makes u stop smoking.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: do not apply on finger skin. make sure u apply only a thin layer on the nail because if it is on skin and if u touch anthing u eat, you will feel a taste change</li>
            <li> My oldest son had been sucking two fingers since he was born. His dentist recommended Mavala Stop. I tried it when he was three and was disappointed. He didn&#x27;t stop sucking his fingers. It only interfered with his meals, as he often ate with his hands. A year later I tried Mavala Stop again. Miraculously, it worked. Within a week my son stopped sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> my mom saw this mentioned in a magazine and urged me to get it.  I&#x27;ve been a life long nail biter and nothing has worked for me.  I used this as instructed.  And after putting my fingers in my mouth 2-3 times, that was it.  I stopped biting and I haven&#x27;t bit them since.  I stopped using the product because I now have a manicure and eating finger foods really was bothersome since the taste would get on the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen others describe the taste, but frankly, I can&#x27;t compare it to anything - other than to say - it&#x27;s an awful, bitter foul tasting - it makes you stop in your tracks!!  I used it for about a week or two, using every other day - I&#x27;m happy to say, I&#x27;m a former nail biter - I got this stuff at the beginning of September and a month later - I&#x27;m cured!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only bit but I also picked my nails too- then would bite the cuticles - so I made sure and put this polish on the nails and cuticle beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It saved me from myself!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have two young children that suck their thumbs/fingers. This stuff smells exactly like finger nail polish and it is applied just like finger nail polish. It certainly works too. My son who is 7 still sucks his thumb and this helped us break him of the habit. In fact, my son&#x27;s dentist told me about this product.  I would purchase again, this is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting, but that&#x27;s the point. I definitely get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to it after a while, but it does deter biting for about 3 days. You just need to re-apply after a shower.</li>
            <li> This product works like a miracle.  I was having a very hard time trying to get my little 3 yr. old to stop sucking her thumps, and started to think that it was impossible.  This product was recommended by a friend who works at a dental office.  It worked the first day.  My daughter tried to suck her thumbs 3 or 4 times after I applied the product and could not stand the taste.  She stopped since then.  I am so happy with it and would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, but I could see how it would for others.  It certainly tasted bad, I just couldnt get it concentrated enough to matter.</li>
            <li> This product really helps you kick a nail biting habit. The taste is really bitter so remember to use a fork when eating, you&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> Been a professional nail biter for past 35 years. Always envious of guys/gals with nice long nails and spent many nights contemplating growing my own (nails..I mean). Was getting tired of nail infections and sensitive finger tips due to nail biting. While watching movies, I felt bad during nail-biting  thriller scenes that everyone was biting nails that I didnt have any to bite.&lt;br /&gt;Finally comes Mavala stop...I ordered on amazon got in 2 days thanks to my special arrangement with amazon called prime membership. They were kind enough to arrange a brown-uniformed guy to drive my Mavala to my home in a brown van. Applied mavala .and Voila..stopped nail biting. The taste is horrendous and will linger in mouth for a few hours even after using mouthwash. Now I have grown pretty solid nails after 35 years, and from time to time keep appreciating my fingers (my co-workers watch me suspiciously..A man appreciating fingers...gosh).I am proud of my acheivement, now I am a retired nail biter. Thanks Mavala.</li>
            <li> Works great for my three year old</li>
            <li> I was so hoping that this product would help my child stop thumb sucking, but of course I would have the one child that it would not phase and therefore I&#x27;m still in search of a product that will do the trick. I even tried putting two coats on the nail, but by the next morning she would be sucking her thumb again. I think it will work for most children, but just not mine. :(</li>
            <li> Worked for my 6year old son! It took him all of 2 weeks to break his habit.... It&#x27;s been about 2 months now and no more thumb-sucking!</li>
            <li> I had been trying to help my 3 year old daughter stop sucking her thumb for quite a while and nothing seemed to work.  I saw this product online and thought I would give it a try.  After applying it on my daughter&#x27;s nail, she had one taste and that was the last time she put her thumb in her mouth.  It&#x27;s been a few months now and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb at all.  We now put Mavala on her thumb about once a week, but I think that the habit is now gone.  I absolutely loved the ease and effectiveness of this product.  I highly recommend this product to any parent that is trying to get their child to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> This works miracles. I used this on my baby thumb when he was 3 so he&#x27;ll stop sucking his thumb and it work. he&#x27;s five now and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with him and that thumb.great product.</li>
            <li> Ok so yea what the reviews are saying are pretty accurate. The stuff does taste incredibly nasty and it&#x27;s effective when it&#x27;s on but it literally washes off of my nails in a 24 hour period. I have to then reapply it. As a man who is not exactly into painting his nails everyday that&#x27;s a pretty big drawback. I have a ridiculous impulse to biting my nails. It&#x27;s a BAD habit that I&#x27;ve inherited over 25 years so the biggest problem is I rarely realize I&#x27;m doing it before it&#x27;s too late and a nail is missing. I like the product but it has to last longer than a day...I just can&#x27;t stay up with painting my nails everyday. I&#x27;d rate the product 4 stars if it lasted a week or so.</li>
            <li> Worked great until my son realized by using Dawn dish soap he could wash the stuff off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I painted it on my son’s thumb and it lasted for about 5 days before HE asked me to put more on. It must taste REALLY bad because when he absentmindedly puts his thumb in his mouth, he runs to the sink to rinse his mouth out. It has been 9 days now. We are on application number 2 and he hasn’t sucked his thumb. Winning!!</li>
            <li> Totally recommend!!! It taste really really bad!!&lt;br /&gt;My two boys 6 and 8 years old had been bitting their nails until it bled...&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks of this stuff, applied once every other day... And no more nail biting!&lt;br /&gt;Their nails are grown enough that I can now trim it... For the first time ever I get to trim my kids nails.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the product until I finish the bottle just to be on the safe side of no relapses.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> This worked great to help my 6 yr old stop sucking his thumb!! He was ready and we tried many things, but this did the trick</li>
            <li> This works well but man is it bitter! Prepare food before you put this on (lasts two days) and eat with a fork or spoon because this rubs off on your hands. Well worth it for a month to break a nasty habit.</li>
            <li> The package came from Hong Kong and it has NO SAFETY SEAL on the box or bottle.  Does anyone think it is safe to have my child put this in their mouth when it could have been tampered with by anyone in another country?!?!?  Not this dad.</li>
            <li> OMG! If I keep using this stuff, I surely will break my awful nail biting habit in no time. Just the most awful taste, so incredibly bitter.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last.  My daughter just picks it off and eventually the thumb is back in.&lt;br /&gt;I guess my daughter is not ready to quit.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I figured all I had to do was keep my fingers out of my mouth, but the problem is there are so many situations where putting your fingers in your mouth is unavoidable. Not more than 10 hours after applying the product did I learn how horrible the taste is, and now I have to seriously consider how I&#x27;m going to floss at night. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to wear some nitrile gloves. This is definitely a situation I don&#x27;t wish to repeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a nail biter since I was about 4 years old, so now at 42 I hope to quit. I can&#x27;t yet speak to the effectiveness of the product at helping me to quit biting, since the polish is at the forefront of my mind. I&#x27;ll give it a few days and report later. The taste is truly terrible, though, unless you like the acrid, bitter taste that lingers for a half hour in your mouth, impervious to toothpaste, rinsing, or just about any other kind of imagined remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody needs to sell an antidote. I&#x27;d buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So besides flossing, I&#x27;m wondering what other situations might cause me to put my fingers in my mouth, and hopefully I&#x27;ll have the good sense to avoid it before it happens!</li>
            <li> Worked like magic! Bought this for my 5 years old daughter who was hooked on her thumb and refused to give it up. We Tried Mavala and she quit the habit in less than two weeks. We stopped using Mavala and she never went back to the thumb. It might not work for everyone. My friend tried it with her daughter and it didn&#x27;t help. For us it was a life saver!</li>
            <li> We tried everything on 2 of our 3 kids. This one did it in 2 days. My son is so proud of himself.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and son who both chew their fingernails.  The taste of this is so nasty!  Great for my adult chewers!  They don&#x27;t want their nails anywhere near their mouth haha.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this product for about 2 weeks now. My nails are slightly longer because I have not been biting them anymore. For that- the product works very well and serves its purpose. HOWEVER, the polish also gets all over my food when I&#x27;m eating with my fingers. Often I taste it on my lips for a long, disgusting duration. I can&#x27;t wait to grow my nails out for my wedding so I can stop wearing this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I used this to help my son stop sucking his fingers. It works very well and is easy to use. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. This along with the Bouncing Blue Large thumb sucking glove and a reward program ended our 6 year old thumb sucking in under a month!</li>
            <li> Definitely worked right away to deter my 3 year old from sucking. It was a rough few days because it was that effective. I apply it almost every 3 days. It&#x27;s just like any polish, apply one coat should be enough. I have yet to see my boy suck it with the polish. I have tasted it and all I can tell you is ew!</li>
            <li> It did not work. My daughter hated the taste but continued to suck her thumb.  This was recommended by a few friends and it worked for them.</li>
            <li> Our 3 1/2 year old sucked his thumb on a regular basis, and we have tried multiple products to get him to stop.  We put this on his thumb nails, and he hated it!  We put it on at night with a &amp;#34;thumb sucker&amp;#34; the first week so he wouldn&#x27;t accidentally suck it in his sleep.  It tastes terrible, and he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb in over 2 months now!!</li>
            <li> We used it with our 2 1/2 yr-old because he keeps biting his fingernails, and we only put a tiny bit, and after about 30 minutes he threw up so much ... A LOT !! ..... Be very aware when u use this product ... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to use it again.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for about a year for our 10 year old son. He does not put his nails in his mouth when the nail polish is on, so we apply it every night. When we run out, however, he begins biting again within a week. We keep buying more with the hopes that he will kick the habit for good.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to stop picking and biting at the skin around my fingers. I applied this stuff at night and was fine. Just knowing that it was there, I didn&#x27;t bite that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once morning rolled around, I went to put in my contacts (rubbed them first with solution, as usual). After I inserted them, I noticed a steady stream of bitter, awful nauseating death-taste in the back of my throat. And I hadn&#x27;t bitten my skin or put my fingers in my mouth AT ALL. The Mavala Stop had gotten on my contacts and the taste was trickling down to the back of my throat!!!!!! I could NOT get the taste to go away. I ended up having to remove the Mavala Stop with nail polish remover, wash my hands 3 times and then take my contacts out and re-rinse them for 1 minute straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear contacts, do not use this!</li>
            <li> this worked on my son and we&#x27;ve tried other products that didnt. This one is much stronger in flavor, and it really works!</li>
            <li> We tried everything with our daughter (3yrs) . Nothing worked but this. It took about 2 weeks. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 1/2 years old and sucks her first two fingers.  It&#x27;s been impossible to get her to stop.  I ordered Mavala Stop a couple months ago.  I applied it and at first she didn&#x27;t like the taste.  I noticed after a few hours though, she was sucking her fingers again.  I checked her nails, and the polish was still shiny so it wasn&#x27;t completely worn off.  Maybe the flavor gets more mild after awhile?  I reapplied it, and the same thing happened, she only stopped sucking for a couple hours.  I am still using it, only when we&#x27;re at home and she is relaxed, that seems to be when she sucks the most, she doesn&#x27;t usually do it if we are out at stores or at the park.  So far, it&#x27;s just working for a short time, and seems to not be strong enough after the initial application.  I will keep using it  but I was hoping for better results by now.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails for over 10 years and I am currently 2 weeks into using this with no nail biting and very little biting of my cuticles.  Just to be clear - this is a nail polish.  As a guy it makes my nails look all shiny, but even still it&#x27;s better than the alternative.  I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do anything to increase the health of your hands/nails/cuticles etc..., it is just a nasty nailpolish - which is OK for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used another product that was more of a salve for your nails and it healed my hands much more quickly, but was not so nasty and it dried out in my pocket and required reapplication.  If they could make this something more of a combo it would be 5 stars, but it certainly does the trick.  I recommend it and need to go get a manicure because my nails are looking like a normal human again!</li>
            <li> We had a 3 year old that sucked her thumb and it was causing her front tooth to stick out.  We tried other methods for months without much luck.  It took only 2 applications of this and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb now in several weeks.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 years old and was still sucking his thumb regularly.  No bribery, reward chart or words of encouragement were going to change it.  At the recommendation of his dentist I ordered this product, skeptical that it would actually deter him enough to stop sucking his thumb. We talked about the importance of stopping the thumb sucking and he was willing to give it a try.  I put the Mavala on his thumb and the first time he tried sucking his thumb he realized the consequences.  He cried about it for an hour insisting that I needed to know what it tastes like.  I tasted it and it is awful. If it tasted good it wouldn&#x27;t work.  He has not tried sucking his thumb since .  I never thought it would be or could be this simple.  Thank you Mavala!!! This skeptical mom believes in your product and I encourage other moms of thumb suckers to give this a try it really does work.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but has a lot of shine so it&#x27;s not as useful for guys.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, my daughter was not deterred and it wears off quickly</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used to help my seven year daughter stop sucking her thumb, which she has done since she was 4 months old. We&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to no avail. A Google search led me to Mavala Stop and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. With her adult teeth coming in I didn&#x27;t want her to ruin her teeth by sucking her thumb. I had a long talk with her and explained that the polish would help her to stop sucking her thumb. I let her apply it and within in two days she stopped sucking it all together.This stuff is incredible!!!!</li>
            <li> It works great! My granddaughter stopped her bad habit! Her little hands look great! I will keep ordering this product in case we&#x27;ll need it again.</li>
            <li> This took only one day of applications to completly stop my 4 year old son from sucking his thumb during the day.  We had previously tried EVERYTHING else under the sun and had even used the $80 plastic thumb guards (they were returned for a refund).  He still sucks his thumb at night on ocassion, but even that is starting to get better over time.  Without this product, my son may have gone to college still sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 3 year old son, after he started biting his nails, but only for a couple of days. For those days he could not even eat finger food without tasting the stuff. Now while he does not like it, it will not stop him.</li>
            <li> Stopped my husband&#x27;s nail biting for good!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and was anticipating that our three year old daughter would stop sucking her two fingers after applying it.  While she complained about the taste, it did not stop her from sucking.  I was disappointed.  It was also in a glass bottle, which we broke, but since it didn&#x27;t work for us, that didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> My daughter was shocked when we put it on her tumb hahah she fell asleep and stop sucking her tumb,but sometimes she sucked ity anyways. and just keep her saliva and not swallow it.</li>
            <li> My kid broke out in a rash after using it. May be good for some just want for us, sorry.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I have struggled with nail biting all my life and thought I could never give up this horrible and disgusting habit. I had tried a similar product when I was a kid and I just got use to the taste, so I was pessimistic that it wouldn&#x27;t work again. But as soon as I painted the nails with the liquid my urge to bite disappeared. The solution does leave your nails a little shiny, similar to clear nail polish, and this helps to remind you not to chew at your nails. It has been three weeks, and so far so good. Give it a try, it really works but you do need to want to stop biting and have some willpower.</li>
            <li> We had been trying to get our 6 year old to stop sucking his thumb for about 2 years. Nothing worked. We kept hearing from doctors that we should not punish him or make him feel bad about sucking his thumb, but rather let him stop on his own because of social pressure from his friends at church. Yet, our boy would continue to suck his thumb, even when his friends called him a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;. He seemed like he wanted to stop, but couldn&#x27;t keep his hand away from his mouth every time he was tired, nervous, or just not thinking. His two front teeth were beginning to form an overbite because of his thumb-sucking. We tried wrapping his thumbs in tape, but he would tear it off at night. We tried putting his thumbs in vinegar, but it washed away pretty quickly and he was right back to sucking again. Same with hot sauce. Then, we decided to try MAVALA STOP. It worked the very first time we applied it. He might forget and put his thumbs close to his mouth, but he remembered pretty quick that he didn&#x27;t want them in his mouth. The first night, he cried a little in bed because he was sad he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb. We told him to just hold his stuffed animals instead, and it seemed to work. It has been almost a week now, with no thumb sucking. Another week or two, and we&#x27;ll be sure this habit is over with. Can&#x27;t speak for some of the other products on Amazon, but the MAVALA STOP does work for us.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product to get 4 year old to stop sucking her finger!!  Tried everything else and this was the ticket!!</li>
            <li> Works awesome. Disgusting taste lingers for days.</li>
            <li> Works great. Got my 5 year old to keep her thumb out of her mouth. Tastes terrible, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get my 3-year-old daughter to stop sucking her thumb, &amp; nothing worked.  She even wanted to stop but just couldn&#x27;t kick the habit.  A friend told me about this but warned me to read the reviews.  They are right, it is GROSS....only a small amount is needed and the taste is not only horrible but it lingers for awhile, reminding you NOT to put your fingers in your mouth again!  She woke up 3 times the first night because she accidentally sucked her thumb, only once the 2nd night, and that was it.  Within 5 days she had COMPLETELY stopped sucking her thumb!  I did a 3rd application just to be sure but she was never even tempted.  A few months later &amp; she hasn&#x27;t gone back at all.  I am pretty sure her front teeth changed within days.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!!  Just remember to only put a tiny amount of it on....the taste is strong!</li>
            <li> I use this for my husband and he hates me every time I ask him to put some on his fingernails coz it really stops him from biting it. LOL</li>
            <li> Soon after applying a thick coat of this to my 3-year-old&#x27;s entire thumb nail, she stuck it in her mouth, quickly pulled it out and looked at her thumb. She then commented that it &amp;#34;tasted funny&amp;#34; and put it right back in her mouth. Granted, this child likes the taste of vinegar, but it didn&#x27;t change her thumb sucking habits in the least.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 20 month old and she stopped sucking her thumb the first day!!! This product is GREAT!!! It has been 4 weeks and still no thumb sucking. THANK YOU MAVALA STOP!!</li>
            <li> My niece is 3 years old, only used one time, he stopped suck his thumb.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible.  The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it takes a long time to dry and I don&#x27;t particularly care for the texture.  Aside from that it gives my nails a nice gloss and it tastes like battery acid, which is exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li> It works great it helped my little 2 year stop putting her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is as advertised. It tastes like garbage and broken down bicycles. The only problem is it transfers to everything. So if you eat a bagel or something, with your hands, you will often get some collateral damage while eating it.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old stopped biting her nails. I do have to put it back on every few weeks to remind her to not bite them.</li>
            <li> My kids hate this stuff - which is exactly why I love it.  Really helped my daughter stopped sucking her thumb at night.  I have to use it every few months on her again when I see that thumb sneaking back in while she&#x27;s sleeping.</li>
            <li> After months of trying other methods to help our 6 year old break his finger gnawing habit, we finally broke down and purchased this. A few weeks later and his digits are finally recovering. It&#x27;s a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This product worked within a week to stop my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s nail biting habit.  It goes on very easily, just like clear nail polish.  I would highly recommend this product for nail biting and thumb sucking habit breaking.</li>
            <li> This stuff was so nasty..you cannot get this stuff off your hands. It works very well. However, I have an autistic son who it only helped for short periods of time.</li>
            <li> So far this is working great to stop thumb sucking. Goes on like nail polish but apparently tastes horrible according to my son.</li>
            <li> it works!!!  It has been at least 2 months now and their nails look sooooo much better.  I don&#x27;t usually trust reviews but was desperate to do something to help my kids.  Even though they don&#x27;t bite their nails anymore they still remind me to apply Mavala on their nails,  At the beginning I would keep track with a calendar but I&#x27;m happy my kids really want to get rid of this bad habit themselves, they like that their nails are longer now and not ugly and all chewed up. My kids are 8 and 10 .  I am planning on buying Mavalas product to make their nails strong next as I noticed they are growing too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;it may rub off to food if you using bare hands- We use silverware and toothpicks a lot more now , it helps :)</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have tried other brands with the flavor trigger to induce vomiting if fingers are put into mouth.  Kidding about vomiting, but the taste seriously lingers for a long time.  It&#x27;s nasty.  My brain would automatically stop me when I started to nibble.  Usually, when I&#x27;m editing my writing on the computer.  Now I will need to purchase a nail hardening system since I can finally see the whites of my nails.  I was never a nail biter until I started this insidious habit 2 years ago.  Before too long, my beautiful, healthy and much longer nails were being nibbled to the quick.  I suggest anyone try it if they just can&#x27;t stop biting on their own.  Or, for those kids who are too old for thumb sucking.  Wished I known about this while my daughter was growing up.  She actually sucked her thumb through the 4th grade.  Nothing we tried would get her to stop.  Even wearing gloves at night!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products and this is the only one that actually works!  It tastes ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  It stays on for 2 days through hand washing.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the taste once it dries. :-(  I reapply this twice a day to keep her from sucking her thumb. I might as well use regular nail polish to remind her not to suck her thumb. She hated it at first, and said it was the worst thing she&#x27;d ever tasted. But now she will just say &amp;#34;It only tastes a little bad&amp;#34;. We will have to try something else.</li>
            <li> Never thought telling someone how bad their product tastes would equal a compliment, but in this case it does. The product isn&#x27;t flavored bad but works on your taste buds in such a way that activates all your bitter tasting ability. I&#x27;m not entirely sure that made sense but for those of you that have tasted it know what I mean. I can really tell this product is beginning to rewire my brain. Thanks to Mavala I&#x27;m starting to learn that it doesn&#x27;t pay to bite your fingernails. One of this products best features is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily. It lasts around 1.5 to 2.0 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short Story: I fully recommend this product. It works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I was very careful applying it onto just my nails.  However, it was almost a week later that I could touch food before the taste did not rub off.  Forget sandwiches or cooking anything you have to touch.  The tastes transfers way to easy and it was awful!  The plus side is that you don&#x27;t bite your nails...and also a great way to lose weight since you aren&#x27;t able to physically touch food for days!</li>
            <li> Works decently. And definitely helps, but it doesn&#x27;t completely solve the problem. It also usually wears off kind of quickly. So it is a must to reapply like daily so that it continues to be strong to the taste.</li>
            <li> Good product. Should last longer</li>
            <li> The kids hate the taste.  It works.  the youngest can somehow get past it yet and suck her thumb.  Hint; put it on all fingers.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked wonders for me.  I am a 28 year old been-biting-my-nails-forever kind of guy.  Four weeks ago I bought this stuff and applied the first coat.  I have not bit my nails since.  This is great!  I would have paid $100 for this stuff had I known it would work so well.  The coat will last for 4-5 days and if I get the urge to bite my nails again, I just apply a new coat.  Thanks, cannot express how great this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Moreno</li>
            <li> From the first day we used this, we have a non-thumb sucker. I only coat about half the nail. If you get it on the edge of your nail, you taste it when you eat with your fingers. I know from experience! I tried it on me, before my son. After a month, I am only using it every two days!</li>
            <li> Bitter when taste. No smell. Really works! I haven&#x27;t bit my nails since I started using the product. I found it succesful.</li>
            <li> 27 years later and I have officially stopped biting my nails!</li>
            <li> We got this for our son, but after a few tries and seeing it not working we gave up on using it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm! My two-year-old is cured of nail-biting - thank you!</li>
            <li> Maybe if I reapplied it every couple of days it would work but I tend to forget to do it that often :(  My 9 year old just goes right back to chewing his nails as soon as it wears off enough.</li>
            <li> I know it would stop my from sucking my thumb, however it did not work for my 4 year old. At first it did, she would kind of gag when she put her finger in her mouth. Then she would just make a face and then she just got used to it.</li>
            <li> This product gave my three-year-old daughter 4 canker sores in her mouth. She had a difficult time eating and sleeping! I felt so bad, it was complete torture for her! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, this product is really strong.</li>
            <li> after 10+ years of my terrible nail biting habit i had since i was a kid i decided to try something to break the habit. 2 weeks of this on my nails and i dont even need to use it anymore. i no longer bite my nails its pretty SWAGGED OUT</li>
            <li> my daughter stoped biting her nails after about a week of every day application. I would highly recommend this to help that nasty nail biting!</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old who started chewing his nails. I thought if I tried something like this early into the phase that we might stop it instead of him possibly doing it for the rest of his life. The product doesn&#x27;t even phase him :( I thought maybe I got a bad bottle, but when I tried it on myself it does have a bad taste, just apparently not enough to stop my kid.</li>
            <li> This product really helped&lt;br /&gt;My seven year old stop sucking her thumb. The first two days were hard but by day three she was done.  I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is hilarious. I got it to stop my 14 year old from biting his nails. His poor fingers were so raw, once he chomped them down on top, he would start in on his cuticles. He broke the bad habit in just 2 days. The faces he made when he absently put his fingers in his mouth was hilarious (for me, anyways). He says it leaves a lingering taste behind as well. Sadly, I dropped the bottle and it shattered. Wish it came in plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my grandson who is 5 years old. The instructions say to use every other day. I started off doing that, but my grandson has learned that he can suck his thumb every other night. But, he did stop biting his fingernails. So now I put it on him every day and he is not sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Good but it loses potency after a few months.</li>
            <li> This worked so well with the Berenstein book I thought I was dreaming! My daughters nails were so far down she was bleeding daily. With this polish and ideas from the book she learned to control the urge to bite and now can get manis with me!  So unbelievably surprised and grateful!</li>
            <li> My 6 year old has been chewing her fingernails since she stopped sucking her thumb (right when she turned 3).  I have tried everything to get her to stop, she has the desire to stop, and I was really hoping this would work but it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her at all :(</li>
            <li> I am a lifetime nail biter...it&#x27;s disgusting.  I stop...and then I start again...and then I get Mavala Stop - apply it every 2-3 days and poof - I&#x27;m a nonbiter again.  Definitely works!  In fact, it&#x27;s the only thing in my 30+ years that I&#x27;ve found that does work!</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  We couldn&#x27;t get my 4 yr old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  She was beginning to get a large overbite, and her dentist recommended Mavala Stop.  I purchased it on Amazon right there in his office.  Just before bed time, I painted it on your thumb nail only, and when she tried to suck her thumb, she complained of an awful taste in her mouth.  She cried for the first few days, but when we explained to her that Dr. B (her dentist) said this would help her to stop sucking her thumb and give her pretty teeth, she seemed to begin to understand.  Here we are about a month later, and no more thumb sucking.  It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Justin (Dad)</li>
            <li> My 5yr old&#x27;s thumbsucking days are over.  I ordered this almost a month ago and applied it twice.  I still have a full bottle and am certain I will not need it. Thumbsucking has stopped completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-3 weeks now and im happy to say i have not bitten my nails not even once..... i used to bite my nails until there was literally nothing left now i am afraid to bite them because of the taste of this product.</li>
            <li> The nasty bitter taste stopped nail biting after only a few days. Recommended to friends. Makes a great gift! :)</li>
            <li> This product worked great to get my son to quit his thumb sucking.  He&#x27;s only made the mistake of putting his thumb in his mouth 2 or 3 times at night since we started using it.  One application will last a few days.  //The joker in me can&#x27;t wait to use this on somebody&#x27;s coffee cup as a prank.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little scared this stuff is toxic, but it is working for my child.  He asked for help to stop biting his nails and he is happy with the results now that he&#x27;s been using it for 3 weeks.  I don&#x27;t put it on every other day, but whenever he or I thinks of it, probably twice a week.  He hasn&#x27;t completely broken the habit but we are seeing definite improvement, may even need to clip a few of his nails soon they&#x27;ve grown so much.</li>
            <li> It made my kid throw up in the middle of the night, but this product did what we wanted it to do - stop our kid from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> My son stopped biting his nails immediatly after I put this on his nails. Make sure you only put it on the nail or you food will taste like it. We learned the hard way. But it works!!!!</li>
            <li> Works but easily washes off after regular habd washing. My three year old runs as soon as he sees the bottle. I have to apply when he&#x27;s asleep . He says his finger is spicy</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how well this product worked for us.  Our son was a serious thumb sucker who had gotten where he basically sucked his thumb whenever he wasn&#x27;t busy playing.  His teeth were starting to slightly push out and before the problem got worse my husband and I wanted to try and get him to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had the product for about a week before we actually put it on my son.  We talked about it to him a lot telling him that we were going to put medicine on his thumb if he wouldn&#x27;t stop sucking it and would ask what he thought about it.  We tried to involve him in the timing of when we actually applied the product.  Finally, one night he told us he was ready - I think he had grown tired of us constantly telling him to take his thumb out of his mouth.  That first night I slept with him and was worried how he would do because I know he sucks his thumb in his sleep.  I heard him gagging some, but he never threw up and didn&#x27;t suck his thumb. I kept water in bed with us so he could drink when that taste was in his mouth.  It also seemed to make him cough quiet a bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day was a little harder because when he would eat with his fingers he could taste the stuff on his thumb and it would put that gross taste in his mouth.  We had to brush his teeth any time that happened.  He had me cut up his sandwich for lunch so he could eat with a fork and we did other things like that to try and help him not get that taste in his mouth.  A few times that day too out of habit, like while he watched a TV show for instance, he would forget and suck his thumb, but that taste was bad enough that he really worked to not do it.  I licked his thumb that day to see what he was experiencing and I really couldn&#x27;t taste much so it was already wearing off pretty well, but it was enough to stop him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That second night was much more difficult because he was tired and really wanted to go to sleep and suck his thumb and begged me to take it off.  It was very tough but I held my ground and tried to comfort him with songs and stuff so he could go to sleep.  The next day, the product seemed to have worn off but he never sucked his thumb again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this.  It may seem a little extreme, but I think with the right approach and lots of communication, you can handle the situation the best way possible to cure the habit without traumatizing your little one.  Good luck Moms and Dads!y tough but I held my ground and tried to comfort him with songs and stuff so he could go to sleep.

            <li> I have been a biter for probably 10 years now. No clue what triggers it and a lot of the time I do not realize I do it until it is too late. I could never mentally make myself stop for more than a couple of days...Until now...This stuff is amazing and worked wonders for me. For me, it is that it tastes so horrible and lingers in your mouth, that you don&#x27;t even want your hands anywhere near your face. You quickly learn to be afraid and stop biting, as long as you continue to apply. To the guys: This stuff is like clear nail polish and does leave a shine. I personally didn&#x27;t care, but I noticed that if I applied it and then used nail polish remover there would still be enough residual yuck around the cuticle and such that it kept working, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative side is the taste it leaves...but this comes with the territory, you signed up for it. Finger foods are a no go...chips, sandwiches, etc all had a yucky taste. If you touch your face a lot and then lick your lips you will probably taste the stuff. I guess in the end this is all just a reminder to not bite those nails. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I was getting worried beacuse my little one had been sucking her thumb since 6 months and she&#x27;s 2 now. I didn&#x27;t like the way her teeth were looking so I had to do something quick. Her dentist recommend mavala and we ordered it. It has been a month and she has not sucked her thumb. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a three years old girl that had a problem of sucking her tomb and we tried to many things  before and nothing didn&#x27;t work until now.  We bought this mavala stop and applied it only  three times in two weeks and she stop sucking her tomb.  Is been 11/2 month since she stop sucking her tomb that even her tomb looks like normal.  Thanks God and to someone who came out for this invention.</li>
            <li> This product works.  I have however stopped using it just because and sadly, I have returned to my old habits.  It did work for a couple months while using it though.</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting, perfect.  Most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to apply it, my 5 year will not put his hands near his mouth just to avoid having to have it put on.  The only down fall is when he puts his hands to his mouth to eat, he can taste it and then he loses his appetite.</li>
            <li> It was great.  My son stopped sucking his thumb  in less than two weeks. I would offer him a small drink after he tried and remind him to not do it.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of biting his nails, my husband has nails again! Tastes terrible...works great! Worth the cost and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a chronic nail biting problem and this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on your fingers for days and if you dare touch your mouth, the bitterness is really really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 33 years old and my nails are &amp;#34;human sized&amp;#34; for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> It works! My kid stop biting his nail after I apply this on his fingers. The reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is overpriced. I think $6-$8 is a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I applied it this morning to my daughters fingernails and toenails as I was putting her to bed she sticks her fingers in her mouth and I asked her if it bothered her and she said no she didn&#x27;t mind the taste.</li>
            <li> This is the only think that worked to get my son to stop sucking his thumb.  Worked almost the first night (after one night of him tasting it and waking up screaming when he realize he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb again).</li>
            <li> Niece chewed her nails even with this one her fingers.</li>
            <li> Used it on my 5 yo boy who has been sucking his thumb since birth. Took about a month or two. First week I put it on every night. Second week every other night, and after that every time I remembered! He stopped by third week and completely probably by 5th or 6th week. He was not a day sucker so I can&#x27;t comment on that I guess. I didn&#x27;t tell him I was doing it. I just told him his body will be getting ready to help him with his efforts in stopping this behavior by making his thumb taste bad. I put it on after he was asleep. He bought the whole thing and was proud of his body helping him and was proud to have stopped sucking his thumb &amp;#34;all by himself.&amp;#34; Definitely recommend this product. In fact I have half to two thirds of the bottle left! Put it on your finger and taste, it is nasty. So expect some crying on reflex sucking the first few days. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn, it is just a really undesirable taste. I wonder what they put in there.</li>
            <li> I really hate it, super bad idea because everything you do with your hands got the nasty flavor  even when you eating,feeding your baby,making food that&#x27;s terrible,doing sex :p, etc&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t never recommend it to anybody!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Never I prefer to have short nails....................</li>
            <li> I have bad nail-biting habit at age 26.  But this product tastes so bad, and lingers for very long, that I quickly became averted to putting my fingers in my mouth.  At first, you&#x27;ll realize just how involuntary that action is, and eventually you&#x27;ll stop doing it because of the horrible taste.  I have so far been successful in not biting my nails since I bought this.  Stick with it and you&#x27;ll have the same results.  Couple notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle recommends putting it on every other day, which I will say is accurate.  It will usually last through the next day.&lt;br /&gt;-The supply appears to last a good few months&lt;br /&gt;-This product will ruin flossing for you.  It is impossible not to taste it while flossing.  Very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-Same with finger foods.  You&#x27;ll need to be very careful eating them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else can make you stop biting, give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t list a way to take the stuff off once it&#x27;s put on.  I tried nail polish remover and several washings with soap.  It&#x27;s now almost 10pm and my son can&#x27;t get to sleep.  He initially threw up and continues to dry heave every few minutes.  Now he just wants to suck his fingers and go to sleep, but he keeps forgetting and putting them back into his mouth only to start heaving again!  There&#x27;s no way to soothe him.  This should not be on the market without a remedy!</li>
            <li> After 30+ years of nail biting, I finally have nails that I don&#x27;t try to hide away. My daughter also stopped sucking her thumb.  The taste really is awful!</li>
            <li> I  bought this item for my two daughters, one two and half and other one ........both were annoyed when i used first time on thier thumbs but after that it did not make any difference to both of them, i was disappointed  that how can this could be...... now i think there is no other thing which could stop them from thumb sucking.People have given very good reviews about this ....that&#x27;s the reason i had purchased .......it was not at all helpful for our case.</li>
            <li> The product worked like a charm!  My 3 y/o immediately has stopped sucking his thumb, even at night, and hasn&#x27;t sucked it since!  My seven year old took a while to get used to and kept on trying to put it back in his mouth, but the taste kept on reminding him that well, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Because his habit has been for so long, i still have to apply to his thumbs, but it does its job!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> It only took 2 days with my 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb.  Best investment for the problem.  I wish i did it years ago..</li>
            <li> I had thought I would have such a hard time getting my 2 1/2 yr. old to stop sucking her thumb. She actually started sucking her thumb more and more - bed time, watching TV, in the car...&lt;br /&gt;After the 1st time I used this product I never again saw her do it. Every few days I would redo both thumbs and I never even saw her try.&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but was amazed and how quickly this worked for my almost 6 year old. My daughter has sucked her thumb since she was an infant and lately her thumb has rarely left her mouth. I put Mavala on twice and haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb once. Simple and it works!!!!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our son since his thumb sucking was causing the skin on his thumb to peel and crack.  I tried it on my nail first and it was a horrible taste, difficult to completly remove even with nail polish remover.  We were careful to only get the polish on his nail so it would not bother him while his was eating.  After regularly applying after bath time he was completely free of thumb sucking in 2 weeks.  My sister also purchased this product for her daughters (nail biting and thumb sucking) after seeing the results with my son.  Worked great for her kids also.</li>
            <li> The day I got the polish in the mail, I put it on my 5 year old daughter who constantly has her hands in her mouth, my four year old son who was a thumb-sucker, and my three year old daughter who bites her finger (and toe!!)nails....AND IT WORKED!!!!! No one cried and no one has started back up. We are putting it on them about twice a week and will continue that through this winter with the flu season. My husband put some on one of his nails to see what the kids are tasting and he said it tasted horrible for days. The only down fall is that the product states that it is for 3 years old and up. I have an about-to-be-two-year-old and he bites his finger nails. We will wait a couple of months and try it on him. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> We used this product for about 3 weeks this summer with my 8-year-old to help her stop sucking her thumb.  It worked particularly well as a reminder during the nights, and she never woke up crying as some of the other kids have that have used this product.  We didn&#x27;t use it as consistently as we should have, but it still did a pretty good job.  Around the second week, she figured out that it was bitter and didn&#x27;t want to let us use it, but we reassured her that it is nontoxic and would really help her stop sucking her thumb(which was definitely a goal of hers) and protect her nails in the process.  Since she was older than the average kid that uses it for thumb-sucking, I didn&#x27;t expect miracles.  She still occasionally sucks her thumb, but never when actually asleep and much more rarely in general than she used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails since the age of 4, I&#x27;m now 23 and can proudly say that I no longer bite my nails. One application was enough to have me cease all nail biting.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product several months ago for my daughter who had a horrible finger sucking habit.  At 3.5 years old, I was done with this habit although I knew it brought her great comfort but was a chronic habit!!  Her fingers were nearly raw and it seemed as if they would never lose the pruned looked one gets when they&#x27;ve been in the water too long.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine recommended it, and I gave it a whirl.  No luck.  Despite it&#x27;s wretched taste, it did not deter her from sucking on those fingers, especially at night.  Fast forward to about a month ago.  I found it and gave it another try.  Worked like a charm.  Being older, I think it had a better impact on her that if she put her fingers in, it would taste very bad.  She remembered, and avoided it.  Day time finger sucking is a thing of the past now and I know there are a few occasions where she has done it during the night because she will wake up saying that her mouth tastes bad.  Just going to take time.  Overall recommended...give it a try!</li>
            <li> The bitter taste really helped me control my nail bitting and I am a life long chewer!</li>
            <li> ....and wow does it taste bad!....I would venture to say that if you follow through with this product, it would be a 100% cure all for thumb-sucking,(or the super annoying - two finger pump-sucker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabbie was 5, a serious two finger sucker, constantly, Some Malava at night and it stopped immediately. a few weeks later we stopped Malava and she started sucking again. Another few weeks of Malava, and viola! no more sucking, never again and she&#x27;s totally forgot about it. Now spends a lot more time coloring and getting into real trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ginger was 4, it worked but she came to the bedroom crying saying, \\&quot;someone poisoned my thumb\\&quot; - funny, we let her keep her thumb for another year but just ordered a new bottle :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife going to put it on my fingers too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would work great to stop Grandmas or Politicians from kissing you or to keep your dog from licking your toes.</li>
            <li> My thumb-sucking daughter \\&quot;tasted\\&quot; this product only about 3 or 4 times before deciding it wasn&#x27;t worth \\&quot;tasting\\&quot; again.  She immediately stopped sucking her thumb while awake, and has severely reduced the amount of thumb-sucking she does in her sleep, too.  Of course, it does need to be reapplied to maintain its usefulness, but with a pretty pink underneath it, she doesn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well except whatever food you touch it makes the food taste like it.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 year old sucked her thumb a lot.  No, I mean a lot!  There were times I thought she was bound to suck the thumb print right off her skin.  We tried the \\&quot;PC\\&quot; method of offering positive reinforcement and giving her all the benefits for not sucking her thumb.  We tried punishment every time we caught her (yes, I can be a bad parent too).  Finally we tried the Mavala.  That&#x27;s the last time she has sucked her thumb and its been 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people are commenting to only use a tiny amount and to be careful not to overwhelm the child.  Forget that, I slathered some on her thumbnails once a night before bedtime for about 3 weeks (called it \\&quot;magic fingernail polish\\&quot;) and it worked great!  She put her thumb in her mouth once and only once.  This was for a true chronic thumb sucker!  The reaction was so dramatic that I tried some as well, think sour patch kids with a horribly bitter after taste lasting about 15 minutes no matter how much beer you pour on it (my wife was rolling at the expression on my face).  All I can say is anything that could stop my thumb-suck-a-holic from even wanting to get her thumbs near her lips, awesome!</li>
            <li> I have tried sticker charts, bitter nail polish, band-aids, socks, gloves.  None of them worked for my 6 year old daughter.  I read the reviews and decided that 420 people gave this stuff a thumbs up, I would give it a try.  Soooo glad I did.  Within 24 hours she wanted nothing to do with that thumb.  It has been over 2 weeks, I&#x27;m calling her cured.  I have been promising for 2 years that she could  have her ears pierced if she quit, this weekend we are going to the mall for her reward.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old son who sucks his thumb at night to fall asleep. It worked wonders.  Within a few days he quit the habit.  The taste is awful and enough to make him stop.  I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> WOW! My almost five year old son has been wanting to stop sucking his thumb and could not do it on his own.In just two applications (just a dab based on other reviewers saying not to use too much) he quit. He doesn&#x27;t even try in his sleep. THANK YOU!  We had tried everything else without success.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  In 1 day, it worked on my 4 year old that even sucked his thumb in his sleep.  I even used it on my 2 year old and after 3 days she totally stopped.  I will say it did cause her to gag and throw up the first 3-4 times she tried it.  It does say to only use on children over 3 but my pediatrician said it was okay.  Overall,I would totally endorse this product.  It is amazing even after 2 months it still works.</li>
            <li> We were really excited to hear about this product because our almost 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs for about a year and a half now.  She does it throughout the day and when shes tired.  The reason my husband was so insistant on getting her to stop is because she keeps scratching huge gashes on the bridge of her nose and then picking the scabs and he is afraid of scarring.&lt;br /&gt;The Mavala worked the first day, but by the 2nd day she was sucking her thumbs again. We reapplied multiple times a day and she would get upset but then suck them anyway.  Sadly, we are one of the few unsuccessful stories for this too good to be true product. :(</li>
            <li> Well I was told by our dentist that this stuff would guarantee our 4 year old would stop sucking her thumb because this tasted so bad. Well it definitely doesn&#x27;t taste good but she has managed to suck her way through it. We will still continue to use it but it didn&#x27;t work within the 2 weeks we were told it would</li>
            <li> Really helps for cutting back on nail-biting. It has a heinous chemical taste, which is exactly what it should have. Issues can arise when you eat with your hands or touch objects that reach your face, such as an instrument. One of my fingers touched my trumpet mouthpiece, and I had that nasty taste in my mouth for hours on a gig. I had to stop using this stuff because it was too difficult to eat on the go with my hands and play my horn.</li>
            <li> My almost-three-year-old daughter has been chewing her nails since we moved out of state. She adjusted very well to the new place and made great friends but would not quit biting her nails. I bought this after reading the reviews and was optimistic that it would work.  Well, it worked for a few days (and I put it on every day) but then she just didn&#x27;t care about the taste (and trust me, it tastes bad. I somehow got a taste of it) and kept on chewing her nails.  I should mention that my daughter has eaten birthday candles and play-doh as a toddler, not as a baby.  I think it would work on most kids, it just did not on my waxing-eating, play doh-eating child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2011&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a try again about two months ago (my daughter is now almost four), and after about 4 days, my daughter quit biting her nails. A week after that, I clipped her nails for the first time in 18 months! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> MY 3 year old daughter totally forgot this product was ever on her nail. And after using this product I noticed her hands are already dirty or bitter when shes putting her thumb in her mouth. I feel so stupid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been chewing my nails for over 30 years.  I&#x27;ve tried to quit many times, and used other \\&quot;bitter tasting\\&quot; products on my nails that never worked because the taste was just not enough to override my compulsion to chew my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult now studying to go into a law enforcement profession where bad nails can be a vector for infection and disease-transmission, I NEED to stop doing this or I put my life at risk.  Malava Stop works for me.  It&#x27;s been a month since I chewed my nails and I&#x27;m starting to use nail polish and nail care products seriously for the first time in my life (OMG I&#x27;m going to become a nail polish freak).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say that this stuff tastes bad doesn&#x27;t even come close.  It&#x27;s NOT hot/spicy like pepper, and is hard to describe, but your reaction to it is immediate and visceral (\\&quot;UGGHHH that was a bad idea\\&quot;).  The best part about it is that the taste LINGERS.  It isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s momentarily bitter and then stops.  If you make the mistake of sticking a finger in your mouth, you will remember it for HOURS afterward.  In this respect it works like behavioral conditioning at the animal level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest switching to a fork for eating while using this product, as the taste does interfere with eating foods with your bare fingers.  Even if you remove the product (such as if a child deliberately strips the stuff off as soon as you&#x27;re out of sight), you will still taste it strongly for at least a day or two.  So if you&#x27;re using this on your kids to stop them from nail biting, they won&#x27;t be able to remove the product to get rid of the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, like anything of its type, works best in combination with willpower and a commitment to stop chewing your nails.</li>
            <li> My almost four year old had been a thumb sucker since in the womb, one application (I did two layers) along with telling him how nasty it tasted...he absent mindedly sucked, but only once! I never did have to use it again! His dentist made him a thumb statue to celebrate him officially quiting. (Its been 6 weeks and absolutely no sucking!)</li>
            <li> We used it to get our 6 year-old to stop sucking his thumb.  It worked immediately!  He hasn&#x27;t sucked him thumb since!</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and was wary of trying a product that contained chemicals, but nothing else had worked to date.  I have a 4 year old and 6 year old who sucked their thumbs.  I tried everything; bandaids over thumbs, thumb covers etc.  The thumb covers were very pricey and you had to buy additional straps to keep the covers on if you needed more than what was sent initially.  My girls would ask to get the covers cut off when they were eating and therefore we would go through 4 or 5 straps a day instead of one or two.  Also they would occasionally suck their thumb with the cover on which would cause the cover to collect moisture inside and they both ended up with terrible blisters.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order the bitter nail polish as most of the ingredients looked like they were in nail products that I have used on them anyway.  I also hoped that if the product worked they would not actually be sucking their thumb anymore and ingesting the product.&lt;br /&gt;It worked overnight.  My girls were old enough that I explained exactly what we were going to try.  I told them the polish would taste bad and that was just to remind them not to suck their thumbs.  If they didn&#x27;t want to taste it then don&#x27;t put their thumbs in their mouths.  When it came we all tried it.  It was pretty bad, we called it bitter, but the best way to describe it was it reminded me of licking envelopes.  After reading other reviews I decided to only use a small amount on the thumbs.  I covered just the top third of the nail.  The bitter on my thumb stayed on with frequent hand washing for about three days.  I let the girls keep water at their bedside for the first week or so because when they stuck their thumbs in they would want to run straight for a drink.  They never put their thumbs in after that during the day and by the second night when I checked on them neither had a thumb in their mouths.  I applied it for 5 weeks.  At the end of 4 my 4 year old stuck her thumb in after a tantrum so I applied one more dose.  Other than that I never saw their thumbs in their mouths again.  Each week I put a little less on their thumbs and by  the end I was just applying one strip on each thumb.  When the kids ate with their fingers if it got on their food even a little their food would taste bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and am planning to send my bottle around to friends as I only used probably 10% of the bottle on both kids.&lt;br /&gt;My girls are both so proud that they stopped sucking their thumbs.dose.  Other than that I never saw their thumbs in their mouths again.  Each week I put a little less on their thumbs and by  the end I was just applying one strip on each thumb.  When the kids ate with their fingers if it got on their food even a little their food would taste bitter.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and am planning to send my bottle around to friends as I only used probably 10% of the bottle on both kids.&lt;br /&gt;My girls are both so proud that they stopped sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li> this worked great!  3 of my kids wouldn&#x27;t stop chewing on their nails.  Used this for a few weeks and it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; them.  I will say, one kid was smart enough that he figured out he could scratch it and then he started tearing at his fingers instead of chewing, but that is no fault to the product.  Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my 10 yr. old daughter get ready for braces.  She loved helping with the nightly application. She became very encouraged seeing her nails grow and stopping her childish habit. She earned a manicure several times during the process!</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say I did read many reviews BEFORE trying this product.  So I knew that this stuff tasted VERY BAD and if you happen to touch the finger by accident you would have a nasty taste if it came anywhere near your mouth LOL!  I was a bit uncertain at first about it because it smelled kind of like fingernail polish?  Even with my concerns I tryed it out anyway.  I put it on my 3 year old twin boys (he has a sister twin) fingers at night so he ended up putting his fingers in his mouth anyway, but when he woke up he had this bad look on his face an said \\&quot;Mom finger is icky!\\&quot; He almost threw up, but I read some people who had this happen to them to so I was prepared.  He gagged a bit I washed his finger and put more on and he didnt suck his fingers that day at all!!  BUT, I used it for about 2 more days and then quit thinking I was done.  He started sucking again until I started using it CONSISTANTLY for about 2 weeks and now no sighs of sucking whatsoever!!! VERY VERY PLEASED AND RELIEVED!!!</li>
            <li> This did not work for us.  Doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you but this was our last resort before the dreaded dentist device.  Worked for about the first minute and then she didn&#x27;t care.  Put the finger right back in.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old who bites her nails and thinks nothing of putting her fingers in her mouth.  I decided to try the taste first because it had such a strong chemical smell to it. I wanted to be sure I bought the right thing. I was NOT expecting such a strong overwhelming, lingering taste! If you have ever had a ball point pen break while you are absentmindedly chewing on it you would never forget that assault of ink in your mouth. Well take that and times it by 20 at least and you have this stuff. Even though I felt like an abusive parent putting it on her fingers, I knew she needed to stop putting germ infested fingers in her mouth. (One too many bugs this year) Anyway, my reaction to tasting it was so violent that it has been 3 days and she is terrified to put her hand near her face! Goal accomplished, just wish it was a little less assaulting to the taste buds.&lt;br /&gt;Put it on the dogs nails to prevent paw licking and he was Not a happy dog all weekend!</li>
            <li> Works great. When I catch my son starting to chew his nails again all I have to say is do you want that nail polish on again and he freaks out.</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking on 2 of his fingers since he was born. I tried to get him to stop on his own, but it wasn&#x27;t working. I only had to apply this twice. The first time it was completely effective, but after about 2 weeks he noticed that the taste wore off and he started sucking again. After the second application he was completely done sucking. Totally worth the cost, even though I only had to use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> I suggest you re-apply after washing your hands.  I wash my hands throughout the day and find I need to use the product more frequently.  This is the best product I have found.  The taste is VERY bad and helps remind me to keep my nails out of my mouth.  With all the news regarding hand washing and the need to keep your hands off your face and certainly out of your mouth, I suggest you give this a try. At its best this product helps keep you more conscious of your bad habit.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> My son asked me to get it to help him break his habit.  The nasty flavor lasted more than a day and didn&#x27;t wash off.  He hated it, so he quit sucking his thumb fast!  Note to parents: no matter how gross, anyone can get used to a flavor if they don&#x27;t want to quit.  Please only use it for kids who are motivated, not coerced.</li>
            <li> Literally after 2 applications my 3 1/2 year old stopped putting his hands even NEAR his mouth - and this was a constant nail biter and bleeder before this!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work for us but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. My 3 year old has been biting his nails out of the blue I tried the over the counter stuff you buy in drug stores and it did nothing. His dentist recommended we tried this so I ordered it. After putting it on his nails and seeing his reaction to putting his fingers in his mouth I thought we found something that was going to work.  He would not put his fingers near his mouth after the first application. In our case though it only lasted a couple days. He is right back to biting and no amount of polish is working.</li>
            <li> My son stoped sucking his finger two weeks after i used the product.I have been recommending it to others moms too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product!  At age 7, my daughter was still sucking her thumb and nothing we could do stopped her.  A friend recommended this product and said it worked after one use.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work after one use for us, but only took twice and my daughters thumb sucking is a distant memory!  We put it on at night before she went to bed, and she hated the flavor so much and complained that it still tasted bad in the morning.  A few days later she started sucking again, so we applied it one more time.  Walla, that was it!  We have been thumb sucking free for almost a year now with no relapse.  This product is truly amazing.  A must buy for anyone trying to break their kid of thumb sucking!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing omg this product helped me so much! I took me 10 years to stop butting my nails and his is the only product that worked</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking his fingers for 7 years. Used this product for three weeks and it worked!</li>
            <li> Great product and really fast shipping..</li>
            <li> OMG this  product works. My 6yr old daughter stopped sucking her thumb in less than 2 weeks. In the beginning, at night time it was very difficult, but she eventually got use to it.  All mothers and fathers who have young children that suck their thumbs  GET THIS PRODUCT IT WORKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint- Ask  the child if they want to stop if so  encourage them with this porduct!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Good Luck</li>
            <li> Awesome !!! Tastes like a lingering turd!</li>
            <li> Caused my little one to throw up when she put her thumb in her mouth. It didn&#x27;t really stop her thumb sucking though. Now, she just refuses to have her nails painted. &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. My son still sucks his thumb with this stuff on his nails.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually use this product, because we bought the book &amp;#34;David Decides&amp;#34; for my 5 year old girl, and to my complete surprise, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t know if this works or doesn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t have to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why this gets one star though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to return this...when I tried to, I got this message:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.

            <li> I have been biting my nails for 30 years. Nothing has ever made me stop long-term,  except acrylic nails. But I hate getting acrylic nails and I didn&#x27;t want to use that as my crutch this time. So I purchased this product. It is so repulsive to the taste that after wearing it for one day I didn&#x27;t bite my nails again, though I continued to wear the product for three weeks as instructed.  It really helped me. But I would want every reader of this review to know that you put your fingers in your mouth all the time without meaning to, such as when you eat or if your hair blows into your mouth etc. and this product will get in your mouth a surprising amount of times per day and it is horrible. 😝</li>
            <li> This product is very good. We tried different methods for making my four year old stop sucking her thumb, this is the only product that is stopping her. We have to reapply this every 2-3 days and its been about 3 weeks since we started using it. We are hoping she will give up the habit soon.</li>
            <li> It works wonders even for older kids, it is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff was horrible! soi guess it does its job! i used it to deter my child from sucking her thumb.  she cried and them powered thru until she couldnt taste it anymore.  i used it on my self as a nail biter.  GAG</li>
            <li> 43 years and finally have grown my nails out. This stuff really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my six year old who had developed a terrible nail biting habit. I received this at the end of December and she immediately stopped! It&#x27;s now mid January and she actually has nails that I&#x27;ve had to file! We&#x27;ve been reapplying every few days just to be sure she doesn&#x27;t start up again, but our results have been fantastic!</li>
            <li> One of my sons picked up nail biting when he was bored. I bought this product knowing that it would taste awful, but I had no idea it was THIS bad. This is a horrible product! It works incredibly fast, but is too hard on children. If you still want to try this product, test it out on yourself first. Every food item you/your child handles without a utensil will taste like a combination of earwax and rubbing alcohol. EVERYTHING!!! It doesn&#x27;t just stay on your nails. Children should enjoy the food they ingest. It is an absolutely horrible product.</li>
            <li> Stopped my daughter from sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> I have twins at home that I battled with on the finger sucking issue until I found this little gem.  They had a thing for sucking their index and middle fingers at the same time, which obviously was an issue but this did the trick immediately.  No longer do I have to constantly tell them to get their fingers out of their mouth and all the pain and heartache that comes with that.  A quick swipe on the whole nail for these two kids did the trick.  They have been resistant to everything else I tried.  People that know the twins have noticed they no longer suck on their fingers, too, which made me secretly jump for joy.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 almost 5 and up until her first dentist appointment (about a month ago) I was ignorant to the fact that such a wonderful product existed!&lt;br /&gt;So for a little background my daughter was more than ready to stop sucking her thumb but just didn&#x27;t have the will power to do it on her own. I explained this product after purchasing it and she was of course excited and nervous. When it arrived in the mail she lost all prior excitement and wanted nothing to do with it. So I decided to paint it on her thumbs while she was sleeping that night... I was later woken up to what sounded like a cat hacking up a hairball but in fact it was my daughter who had put her thumb in her mouth. The crying was a little difficult but I explained it to her let her brush her teeth and that was that. We have been thumb free ever since!!! ( to be completely honest I have painted it on her nails every two days since purchasing just in case she gets the desire but we are going on a month now ) it has been well worth the effort and she is so proud of herself for quitting. I highly highly recommend this it truly works!!!</li>
            <li> got this for both my kids who chew their nails.  Both continued chewing away.  My daughter even said the taste is not enough to deter her from the bad habit.  Tried telling them there is a nasty ingredient in it.  That worked for like a day.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old wanted to stop sucking her thumb but just couldn&#x27;t seem to get through the night.  Well after one night of trying to suck it with this stuff on she has never tried it again.  It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s going great.  We actually put this stuff on her fingers together.  She likes to feel involved with the process.  Then she puts light pair of mittens over her hands to keep her from involuntarily sucking in her sleep.  In the past we just tried the mittens and she would pull her thumbs out before falling asleep and end up still sucking all night.  Since night 2 her mittens have remained fully on every night and she hasn&#x27;t tried sucking her thumbs at all.</li>
            <li> Stopped biting nails since. Taste horrible and accelerates nail growth.</li>
            <li> This did the job.  Only warning to parents:  be careful not to get any on your hands.  I did and this stuff tastes awful and took quite a while to get it off even after many washings.</li>
            <li> works very well to keep my child from sucking her thumb but had to apply to all fingers as she would swap to another if it was just on thumb. It has not completely stopped the sucking because you have to remember to reapply it, but it does last a long time with one coat.</li>
            <li> I used this about a year and a half ago and since then don&#x27;t bite my nails anymore. It was amazingly how quickly my brain connected nail biting to unpleasantness. I cannot image relapsing.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our dentist and saved us from needing an appliance to stop him from putting his fingers in his mouth. This stuff tastes bad, but from what he says it does not transfer from his fingers to anything else. I had some stuff when I was a child that was always getting on my food, so everything tasted bad and it was not associated with putting my fingers in my mouth. Anyway, this ended up being a last resort and I would highly recommend it. It does last 2 days. Cheap, arrived very quickly, I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Only reason I give the item 3 stars is it did not cure my 5 year old daughters thumb sucking habit shes very determined to do so I guess</li>
            <li> We had tried everything and were ready to actually have the doctor put a cast on our son&#x27;s arm to physically stop him from sucking his thumb.  We have even tried orthodontic prongs and devices that were sharp in his mouth in attempts of stopping his thumb sucking habit and nothing worked like this product.  We put it on his thumb and he immediately stopped sucking his thumb!  He finally even says he lost the urge, since the bad taste actually makes him NOT want to suck his thumb anymore!  The other things we tried helped a little bit, but he would always return to finding a way to get his thumb back in his mouth.  This actually made him quit the habit and never want to return.  SOOOOOO thankful for this miraculous product!!!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  If my stubborn, persistent son stopped with this, anyone can!!  It truly works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3yr old who sucks two fingers. It only worked for a short time after we put it on. Anytime we washed his hands, for instance after he used the bathroom or came in from playing outside, it seemed to wash right off and he was back to sucking again.  As a result, we were constantly applying it. Taking it everywhere with us to ensure he had it on for a good amount of time to hopefully break the habit.  Needless to say, there were constantly times throughout the day when it wasn&#x27;t on or not potent enough so he never got out of the habit. He would stop sucking for the moment, check to see if it was worn off after a few hours and go back to sucking again. :(</li>
            <li> Worked in a day to get my 3 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb! Amazing. I never thought it would work so quickly.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what else to do besides leave a bad review.  The item arrived broken with the whole package smelling like nail polish funk.  I log onto amazon and because it is a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; I am not allowed to get to the screen for a refund or replacement.  So I guess I will leave a bad review as I see no other outlet for my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Contacted Amazon support and received a refund.  Updating to 3 stars</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. So far so good been using it a week and my 4yr has gone to bed every night , not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this on my son&#x27;s nails and I can only say it works. But, after a hand wash, you should re-apply another coat.</li>
            <li> put on my childs finger and all she did was suck it off and then found the bottle and poured it out so she wouldnt get it again</li>
            <li> It did not work at all. The person for whom I bought it is still biting his fingers!!! I am very disappointed about this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this for myself to stop unconsciously biting my nails and it&#x27;s amazing how long it stays on my nails. After days of shower and frequent hand washing, it&#x27;s still as bitter as the first day I put it on. It&#x27;s not just bitter to the taste, it&#x27;s long-lasting bitterness in your mouth. After tasting it I have to drink water and maybe eat something to wash it off my mouth lol. It works perfectly as it creates a fear of putting my fingers in my mouth again.</li>
            <li> This REALLY WORKS.  I have tried them all over the years and all others failed. This stuff is miraculous and will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Very well worth whatever they charge as it does the job. Priceless  !!!</li>
            <li> I tried many things. This product works great and fast. It didn&#x27;t take my daughter long to break the habit.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter has been sucking her thumb since she was 2 months old.  It started to be only when she was sleepy, but a few months ago, I noticed her doing it out of boredom.  I knew I had to do something about it and FAST.  I searched home remedies online, and nothing struck me.  This product popped up as an option, so I searched where I could buy it.  I read so many positive reviews about it on here, but was still leary about it woking for my daughter because of the severity.  I figured why not try it.  It was inexpensive and if it didn&#x27;t work, I was willing to take it as a loss.  The day I got it in the mail, I used it that night.  I snuck into her room at night while she was sleeping and brushed it on both thumbs (she switches).  She did wake up that night crying that it tasted \\&quot;disgusting\\&quot;.  I simply told her that she is almost 5yrs old and thumbs start to taste bad when you turn 5!! She rinsed out her mouth and went to sleep.  No thumb sucking that day.  The second night, I did the same thing.  She again woke up and washed out her mouth and went to sleep.  She has not since sucked her thumb!! I eventually brushed it on every other night just in case for about two weeks.  She has been thumb sucking free for two months now!!!! Love this product! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it!</li>
            <li> We purchased this product with the idea of using it on two of our children,  5 and 2. For our daughter 5 who has sucked her thumb since birth it work for about a day or two with no residual effect. However for our son 2 it was very effective. It would be interesting to know why there was success with our son but not our daughter. Over all we would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff. Its disgusting and annoying. 5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm!!! My daughter no longer bites her nails!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a last-ditch effort to get my 5-year-old to stop sucking her thumb before starting Kindergarten. Had been trying all sorts of tactics for the last year (including vinegar and other &amp;#34;bitter&amp;#34; tasting products, positive reinforcement charts, games of &amp;#34;hiding the thumb&amp;#34;, etc.) and nothing worked. I tried this and she stopped within 24 hrs. She did complain the first night that her stomach hurt when I put her to bed which was when she usually sucked her thumb and so perhaps a result of the product but it was only that first night and it worked so I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li> This worked great, very happy!  It took less than  a week to get my son to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is 100% what you&#x27;re looking for if you need to stop biting your nails, or have a child who needs to either lay off the nails or thumb. Maybe wait to use on a kid who can at least articulate themselves decently, because this stuff lingers and they need to be able to understand instructions from you to ensure they don&#x27;t keep getting it in their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mavala is rediculously disgusting, and I&#x27;ve tried a few other solutions. Mavala also clings annoyingly for days while the other solutions are gone often within a day or the very next hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip - be very careful getting the lid on tight &amp; periodically clean the threads on the cap. Otherwise this stuff can get hard &amp; unuseable once it starts getting low. If you cap it up though, you&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip #2 - don&#x27;t put this stuff on before you cook or prep food. Read that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Mavala. You&#x27;ll hate me for it, but your nails won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to using this product was when I completed making a meal for my family, I tended to &amp;#34;lick&amp;#34; my fingers. Yuck. HaHa&lt;br /&gt;Another bad habit eliminated!</li>
            <li> Works great for my nine year old, but didn&#x27;t phase my four year old at all, except for the first time when it leached onto her finger food and her meal tasted bitter.  Plan to reapply it every day or so, as instructed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 4 yr old son who chewed his nails something terrible. After one application I could tell it was working. This stuff tastes horrible. I would suggest only making a quick swipe across the nail bed as it doesn&#x27;t take much on the finger to keep it out of the mouth. It stays on the nails for days before you need to do another coating.  It has been several weeks and I never see my son with his fingers in his mouth anymore. I used to see him constantly with his fingers in his mouth before Mavala. And his nails look wonderful! I would recommend this product to anyone with a nail bitting/thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my four year old&#x27;s finger nails for a week...Did not work out as it&#x27;s boasted on the label, want to send it back and look for something else !!</li>
            <li> Yes this stuff works, and works well.  I have been a horrible nail biter for 50 years.  Now for the first time I am growing nails.  I sometimes forget and put a nail to my lips and this product reminds me instantly.  The taste is horrible and lingers in your mouth so you will have ample incentive to break the habit.  Use it once a day.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off very easily, so it will still be there at the end of the day.  It does have a slightly glossy sheen to it, a bit like clear nail polish, but that is way better than nasty looking nails.  Also, you may notice a bit of taste transfer to foods you eat with your fingers, so I would avoid things like eating bread with your fingers, etc.  No finger licking barbeque!  Overall, very satisfied with this product despite the minor hassle of avoiding finger foods.  Nail biting is far, far worse.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, in fact PERFECT for us. We purchased it to help our 7 yr old daughter stop sucking her thumb. Wanted to try something less expensive before purchasing the $75 thumb guard and we are so glad we did. It will be 30 days this weekend since she last sucked her thumb and we will be celebrating! First night we put it on she felt she couldn&#x27;t fall asleep, taught her the counting sheep method and its been just perfect ever since. First couple nights woke up in the night with the nasty taste in her mouth and had to get a drink of water....other than that its been way easy. 100% satisfied with results and purchase.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our son at his request. It tastes really nasty and quickly and very successfully stopped him from nail biting. However, changing habits is a complex business and I suggest that you read [[ASIN:081298160X The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business]]</li>
            <li> My kids bite their nails and complain about their fingers hurting.  I put some of this on and by the end of the day, they stopped putting their fingers in their mouth.  I can&#x27;t believe it worked that quickly.  I haven&#x27;t tasted it, but when they would accidently taste it on their nails, they would run to the sink for some water to rinse out their mouth.  I know it sounds extreme, but I couldn&#x27;t find another way to get them to stop biting their nails.</li>
            <li> My 6-year old had his first two teeth come out as his adult teeth were fighting to come out at the same time.  They were starting to come in crooked because of this AND his thumb-sucking.  His dentist recommended we try Mavala Stop because he said it was the worst-tasting thing he ever tried (and he has tried several).  Well, it worked.  My son stopped sucking his thumbs ASAP.  In fact, he woke up in the middle of the night crying because he accidently stuck his thumb in his mouth while asleep, and swallowed the awful taste.  He learned to stop quickly.</li>
            <li> I had to write the review for this as it worked so good. My 2.5 year old son used to suck his thumb a lot. He would even suck his thumb in a carnival ride where you are supposed to hold the bars or even in carousel and all the time at home or in car. We tried all home remedies like ginger, garlic, horse radish or what not. Nothing really worked, though he has developed lot of taste due to that. I was thinking to wait for him to turn 3 but his habit got worsened and annoying. Finally ordered this, and we are so glad. I am thankful to Mavala and he will also be when he grows up not to have all his teeth and jaw out of shape due to excessive thumb sucking. I tried this on my nails to avoid chewing skin on sides and it ruined the taste for many minutes and reminded me not to do it.&lt;br /&gt;One of the tricks we used was that my wife will start putting nail polish in front of him and out of curiosity he will also want some on his nails and I took that opportunity to put Mavala instead. I would say he has been very brave. He does try to stick his finger (not thumb) every once a while but that&#x27;s okay, I hope he will grow out of that else there is Mavala.</li>
            <li> My 8 yo daughter is a hardcore biter, even though she just started biting within the last year, maybe even the last 6 mos.  It wasn&#x27;t biting like I did as a child, where I&#x27;d stop once it hurt.  She was biting in a way that made me worry she&#x27;d deform her fingertips.  I tried something cheap from Sally&#x27;s but she said it didn&#x27;t taste bad enough.  So I ordered this and it works!  We&#x27;re about two weeks in and she doesn&#x27;t put her fingers in her mouth anymore.  I&#x27;ll continue for a while b/c she&#x27;ll still look at her much longer nails and say, &amp;#34;Wow, I just really want to bite them off.&amp;#34;  So until that dies down, I&#x27;ll continue to use it, which is advised anyway.  I&#x27;ll probably use the bottle up at least.  And yes, it can get on food that she touches, but she seems to cope with that pretty well.  A great product that does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> After buying another product that claimed to eliminate nail biting, I was hesitant to buy another.  The son figured out that the other brand washed off, but Maval Stop is like nail polish.  You paint it on every 2-3 days and that bitter taste does not go away.  We broke my sons nail biting habit in just 2-3 weeks.  And now that we&#x27;ve stopped putting this on his nails, he hasn&#x27;t started biting again.  I guess the memory of that terrible taste stops him before he can start.  Thanks for such a great product. I highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve tried the no-bite stuff, I&#x27;ve tried all the supermarket versions....none of it can compare. You will NOT be putting your fingers anywhere near your mouth with Mavala Stop on your hands. I&#x27;ve been nail-biting since the first grade, and now I&#x27;m in college....and I&#x27;m excited to finally have good nails!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t hesitate. I was skeptical, too. This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made--you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> First off...yes, it works great!!!  The taste is HORRIBLE.  I used it on our 5 1/2 year old to try and get him to stop sucking his fingers.  The warning...once you suck/lick a finger with that stuff on it...the taste seems to last.  He kept complaining that his tummy hurt and ended up barfing twice.  I tested it myself and the &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; seemed to stick to my lips and took almost half a day to go away.  Almost like the oils/taste soaks into your skin.  Any time I licked my lips I would get a taste of it again.  I can only imagine what he was going through each time he tried to suck his fingers.  His stomach just couldn&#x27;t take the constant taste over and over again.  Soda crackers helped get rid of it and settle his tummy.  I did try and remove it with finger nail polish remover, but again, the oil/taste seemed to soak in.  It will just have to wear off.  Directions say to repeat coat every other day, so hoping it will go away soon :)</li>
            <li> My boys both complained of stomach aches after  continuing to bite nails after it was applied. Tried 3 different times! All 3 times they still bit nails and complained of belly aches later. Whatever it is made them sick so I stopped using product!</li>
            <li> Ok so I brought this for one of my 4 y-old twin boy who eats his finger and toes nail &#x27;till the skin is red and raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it 2 weeks now, the first time I painted his finger and toes nails with it (which he let me do with no wiggling) he smelled it and says &#x27;yakky&#x27;  and he didn&#x27;t bit the his finger or toe nail the whole day, nor the next day, nor the next...&lt;br /&gt;then I gave him a bath, and he figured it out (the little smart alex)  he kept squirting more and more in the water and playing with the bath soap, mark you I taste it and the thing has a bitter taste, even my hubby says it was nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now my little one is back to biting his finger and toes nails...even though I&#x27;ve painted it with Mavala, seems his taste buds has gotten use to the bitter taste.....anyone has anything else I can try please?  his finger nails are starting to turn very dark color, and it&#x27;s useless me telling him to stop biting, he just runs away laughing at me...good thing my other twin doesn&#x27;t bit his finger nor toe nails...I wish it had hold up much longer but it seems it&#x27;s not good for toddler age 4.</li>
            <li> This helped my 6 year old daughter stop sucking her thumb during the night.  It worked like a charm!  She was the one to tell us she was ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Did not do what it advertised to do. Works for like first 2 try and after that it has no affects on the child.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I never posted a review on this stuff!!!! Our 3 yr old daughter stooped sucking her thumbs in 1 week!!! Best product out there!!! The other junk we tried out from Walgreens didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Our son now sucks his fingers, everyone says &amp;#34;oh, have fun breaking that habit&amp;#34; I just chuckle to myself. I have no doubt this will work on him too.</li>
            <li> This nail Polish has helped my daughter stop biting her nails. Every once in awhile she will start biting again- I reapply the nail polish and she&#x27;ll stop due to the bitter taste. I also make sure to keep her nails as short as possible.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 4 year old daughter after she worked as hard as she could trying to quit sucking her thumb.  She agreed to try it and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb at all during the day for 4 weeks.  We have found her sucking her thumb occasionally in the middle of the night (not sure how she can stand the taste but I don&#x27;t think she realizes she&#x27;s doing it).  We never thought it would be this easy.  She reminds us all the time to put it on and seems comforted and relieved that she has something to help her quit.  We will gradually reduce the applications over the next month and see how it goes.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The directions say one coat will last two days.  I personally feel that reapplying everyday is necessary if you have a really bad nail-biting habit like I did.  Other than that, the product delivers a very bitter odd taste when you come in contact with it.  The draw-back is that you will taste it whenever you are eating something with your hands.</li>
            <li> Yeah!!!  I&#x27;m so happy!  My 9 and 7-year-old daughters had this thumb-sucking habit for so many years.  Doctors always dismissed my concerns, but the habit only became more and more fixed.  I&#x27;m ashamed to say that sometimes I berated them.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  We&#x27;d tried a pepper-flavored product before, but they got used to the taste.  It just wasn&#x27;t enough of a deterrent.  I was interested in some of the gadgets a child wears on the thumb, but thought I&#x27;d give this cheaper product a try first.  I think I only had to apply it 2 or 3 times on each child&#x27;s thumb.  It really must taste awful.  My older daughter did have a gagging episode, but just once.  Then she truly stopped sucking her thumb!  It is still amazing to me to look in the car&#x27;s rear-view mirror and see them free of thumb-sucking!&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to use this for a very young child, I suggest scanning these reviews first for more opinions.  I don&#x27;t know if I could put a little one through the experience of the awful taste.  My kids were old enough to deal with the yuck and the gagging.  Maybe it is worth it for a baby to experience this in order to stop the habit.  So many people told me that this habit would fall away, but in our experience it just got worse.  I would advise any parent to try to help the child stop early, and not just hope it will go away, like I did.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old twins, who both sucked their thumbs stopped sucking their thumbs after just one application. Now I have no worries about more mouth damage from continued sucking! This amazed their pediatrician and dentist, and all my parent friends.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have been chewing on my cuticles for at least 10 years and have never had anything work like Mavala does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to chew on my cuticles CONSTANTLY throughout the day, which left my fingers bleeding, raw, and horrible to look at by the end of every day. In fact, I envied people who chewed on their nails because their fingers looked light years better than mine did! I didn&#x27;t realize half the time when I was chewing on them, which definitely makes it hard to break the habit. At first I tried to have my boyfriend and other friends just stop me when they saw me, but they can&#x27;t watch me all the time, and I just got really good at waiting for them to stop looking. After trying some other creative ways of breaking the habit, I decided to purchase Mavala Stop to see if it would deter me from putting my fingers near my mouth. Did it ever! The taste is NASTY (which is great for reminding you to stop) and it lingers for a while on your lips and tongue afterward for at least a few minutes. This is great for me because it just reinforces the lesson even after, which means I am less likely to attempt to chew again. I swear I would try to convince myself that it wasn&#x27;t so bad, but when you have the taste still on your lips for a while there is not way to deny that is it gross. I am proud to say that my cuticles are healing up wonderfully and I am less likely now to try to put my fingers in my mouth. There is enough nail polish in the bottle to last you until you have permanently broken the habit too, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about a temporary fix and then when you run out falling back in the habit. The polish is not very noticeable either, just a little shiny at first and then dulls after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note though: The first day I used this product, I put a lot of it on and all over my cuticles just for safe measure. I don&#x27;t put any more on my cuticles just because it was too much, but it was a great shock factor to teach me not to do it any more. I would say though be careful with children because it will be REALLY bad if they put their whole nail in their mouths without realizing it. The taste also lingers on your lips if you touch them (which is really disgusting while eating food), so be careful when you freshly apply the stuff. And for adults, slather it on every 2 days with someone else to watch you, since it would be easy to \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to put it on without a support system to make sure you follow through. Seriously though, I carry this stuff in my purse and I have not had a problem! I dread the thought of chewing my cuticles cause I know I will get a nasty taste in return!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would probably also work for kids who has issues putting different stuff in their mouths (fingers, boogers, blankets, toys, etc) or with pets chewing on things. Be creative and give this product a try, you won&#x27;t disappointed!teach me not to do it any more.

            <li> I&#x27;d tried everything: THUM, bribery, begging....nothing worked to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  Her dentist recommended this product, told me they&#x27;d had over an 85% rate with their patients.  I figured it was worth a shot....My daughter held her thumb out, I painted Mavala on her thumbnail and she hasn&#x27;t tried to suck her thumb since (not even in her sleep).  It&#x27;s been over a month and no setbacks.  Now I am on the hook for a new bicycle and a trip to the aquarium...well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have never wrote a review before but I felt obligated to write one on this product.  It is AMAZING.  My daughter has been a thumb sucker from day one.  We really wanted to cut the habbit before her 3rd birthday because as a former finger sucker myself, I know the older you get the harder it is to quit.  I bought this product (she will be three in 2 months) and one the very first day of using this she has stopped sucking her thumb.  I put it on every night before bed for the first week and then every other night the 2-3 week.  By day 3 she was really starting to go through withdrawl (moody, crying at night, etc) but she is doing very well and adjusting everyday.  I will continue to use this product for a full 4-5 weeks just to make sure she has kicked this habit.  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old son has been sucking his thumb since birth and we&#x27;ve tried to get him to stop the bad habit.  I tried the stuff you can buy at Walgreens, but it didn&#x27;t work.  An Orthodontist suggested Mavala Stop and it&#x27;s been 4 wks now and he has NOT sucked his thumb ONCE!  He had a hard time sleeping for a few nights, but after a few days, he was fine!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old son that has been sucking his thumb since he was 2 years old. Its a miracle that this stuff works!!! Make sure you purchase a great tasting kids mouthwash too because when he put his thumb in his mouth while he was sleeping he screamed and cried about the awful taste and mouthwash did the trick. I had to reapply everyday because he somehow managed to peel it off while he was at camp. I assume it was from being in the pool everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it has been a week and his thumb is starting to regain its normal color and none of the disturbing thumb sucking noises in the middle of the night. I have tried alot of products and guards and this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when my daughter was two and had a nail chewing problem. Then it worked great the chewing stopped in a matter of weeks. Now she is four and has developed a thumb sucking habit. The product worked great untill she realized she could wash it off. Now when I apply a coat before bed time I hear the sink running about 10-30 minutes later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated my hands because my hands looked boyish with my icky chewed nails. I&#x27;ve always had this nervous habit of chewing my nails and it was starting to get ridiculous. So I tried out this Mavala Stop thing and voila, girl hands! I am so happy I finally have nails. The taste of this stuff is AWFUL! Seriously. The first week I had to keep brushing my teeth to get the taste out and even then it was lingering in my throat. It sure helped me avoid chewing my nails though. So I am soooo happy with this product. You need to make sure to add a new coat every 2 days thought because it does fade with soap.</li>
            <li> Seems to working, but only if you coat often enough and a large enough area to cause gagging (may be some vomit too).  Using a small amount (nail only) with a 5 year old only had a minor affect and was sucked off fairly easily without much effect (other than some minor cough/saying throat was a little sore).  The 5 year old continued thumb sucking for four days while using this product on just the nail.  However, applying a larger glob to cover some skin area too had a more dramatic effect when the thumb was sucked;  There was coughing for about 5 minutes, some gagging, minor throw up, but now thumb sucking is finally beginning to stop with just that one heavier application.  For a 3 year old, coating only the nail was plenty to cause gagging and some minor throw up, and the child hasn&#x27;t sucked thumb since.  The direction call for coating nail every other day, but it may require coating once or twice a day depending on how much they have sucked.  For those worried about night time unconscious sucking, place a sock over hand or some type of thumb-guard to prevent thumb sucking while sleeping to prevent gagging at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, my opinion is to start with just a thin coat on the nail or part of the nail every other day per instructions, but be ready to move to coating everyday and/or thicker and larger area if you find your child continues to thumb suck.  Be ready for gagging and some throw up if your child throws up easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and I&#x27;ve been biting my nails ever since I can remember. I&#x27;ve never been able to see the whites of my nails! I decided to buy this product in hopes of stopping and I&#x27;m glad I did. Ever since the first day I put it on my nails I&#x27;ve stopped biting them. The stuff is a little glossy but I don&#x27;t care because it works. It REALLY REALLY REALLY Taste horrible, disgusting stuff. The first time I put it on I didn&#x27;t actually get a taste of it until I forgot the stuff was on and put my fingers in my mouth and was shocked to how horrible it tastes. It tasted so bad that I didn&#x27;t re apply the stuff and didn&#x27;t bite my nails for about 2 weeks but then the urges came back so I re-applied the polish. The only problem I had was eating messy things and then licking my fingers, Kinda ruins the meal. Also flossing is difficult so just remember to remove the polish when flossing or when eating messy foods and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bite your nails, chew up the skins of your fingers or enjoy picking up change off the ground with ease due to healthy long fingernails I fully recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this product for my 16 month old daughter as she sucked her thumb continuously.  I used just a dab on both thumbs, and it instantly deterred her from sucking her thumb.  After a couple nights I noticed she began sucking her other fingers to soothe herself.  So, I began dabbing mavala onto all of her fingers.  After 2 weeks, I&#x27;m happy to say she&#x27;s no longer a thumbsucker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difficult part is that when finger feeding, she&#x27;d get the awful taste in her mouth.  All in all, a small price to pay for the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had any vomiting issues as I&#x27;ve read on others&#x27; reviews, but again, I only used a tiny dab on each fingernail.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> THis product is magic!!! I tried it on my 2 year old and he stopped sucking his thumb the same day!!! never expected it to work that fast or that well! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> My daughter has tried many products to stop biting her nails in addition to various rewards systems.  Unfortunately, the habit had been so deeply routed, she couldn&#x27;t stop biting - even with other bitter nail products.  Others we tried had to be applied several times per day which led to inconsistent negative response when biting, or didn&#x27;t taste bad enough.  Mavala tastes horrible, and truly stays on for two to three days with multiple hand washings.  Trust me, I accidentally got some on my lower lip and it lasted for days!  Her nails are fabulous, and she is so proud of herself.  This product is worth every penny for your nail biter, thumb sucker, and would  probably work for the nose pickers too!</li>
            <li> I used this for my daughter. She was 5 at the time and was biting her nails a lot. I would check them to see if they needed cut and they were always bit off short. I don&#x27;t know when she was biting them, I think at night before she fell asleep, I never saw her do it, but it was obvious. So I bought the Mavala Stop. I only had to use it once on her nails and she never bit them again....worked great....now what to do with the rest of the bottle? ;)</li>
            <li> This worked great for my 4 year old daughter who constantly sucked her figures.  I only had to apply it for a few days and she broke the habit.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims to do.  Stops finger sucking or nail biting. I put it on my daughter&#x27;s fingers, and I tried it.  It tastes really bad.  IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO!  Finger sucking is ok when the kids are young, but for a 5 year old, it is detrimental to their tooth formation. This product WORKS.  1 week, and we were DONE.  It was a hard week though!</li>
            <li> We had tried several things to try to get our 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb that did not work.  After just 1 application of Mavala, she only put her thumb in her mouth for 2 brief moments.  WIth Mavala she instantly was able to break the thumb sucking habit.  I also tasted the product to see what we had subjected to her.  It is extremely BITTER!!!! However, it does not burn the mouth.  And whereas other products we had tried would wear off after a few days, this product along with its bitterness lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> Worked to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb but the taste didn&#x27;t bother my son at all to stop him from biting his nails.  And it really does taste bad ... I actually tested it on my own nail before putting it on either of them.</li>
            <li> We bought this product to help our 5 yr old stop sucking his thumb. Our son was an avid thumb sucker at night and occasionally throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We researched products out there and this one received the best reviews.  After trying the product for about 2 days, it worked!  Our son had no desire to suck his thumb..  We continued to use the product for about 3 weeks as directed to ensure no setbacks...  It&#x27;s now been about 2 months and our son has not once tried to suck his thumb...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Apply as directed.  We applied this at night when he was sleeping.  He had no idea it was us that was applying the \\&quot;magic sprinkles\\&quot; as he called them on his thumbs.  If he knew it was us, he would have resisted.  We told him the tooth fairy must have sprinkled magic dust on his thumbs to help him stop sucking his thumbs...&lt;br /&gt;2.  Make sure you apply the liquid to all fingers (at the base of the nail not the tips).  After the first day we noticed our son trying to suck other fingers when the thumbs didn&#x27;t taste good. ...  We corrected that after a 2nd doses on all fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It tastes awful but it works and that was our goal!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is six years old and she has been sucking her thumb ever since she was born. Our dentist warned us that she would have permanent damage to her mouth if she didn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb soon. She was also starting to get teased by her friends. We tried the glove but that didn&#x27;t work as she kept taking it off and even sucking her thumb with it on.  So we decided to try this product as a last resort before we had the dentist insert a devise in her mouth. We put the product on for the first time and she put her thumb in her mouth a couple of times and that&#x27;s all it took. She didn&#x27;t like the taste of it and she just stopped sucking her thumb. The directions recommend putting it on every couple of days so we applied it a few days later but we really didn&#x27;t need too. By this point she had already broken the habit and was done sucking her thumb. I&#x27;m still blown away by the results and I&#x27;m completely amazed how fast it worked. I guess by some of the reviews it&#x27;s not for everyone but it sure did make a believer out of me. I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other methods but couldn&#x27;t stop my daughter from sucking her thumb even though she is also want to stop this habit herself. She is now 6 years old and her new teeth is coming. This product work for her. I applied a little at the middle of her thumb nail because I read other reviews that it may cause some children to vomit. My daughter woke up couple times the first two nights and we gave her water to wash her mouth. Now she stop sucking her thumb. Me and her are both happy with it :)</li>
            <li> Simply put. Youngest daughter wouldn&#x27;t stop. tried everything. 2 days!!!! it&#x27;s tastes horrid, and doesn&#x27;t go away equals strong incentive not to put your thumb in there.</li>
            <li> My 4 and a half year old daughter was an addictive thumb sucker. I used Mavala. She was horrified by the taste - she put her thumb in her mouth twice with Mavala on and then never again. She has not sucked her thumb in 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptical but hopefull about the results I would get with this product.  My 3 year old son was biting his nails to the point that I was concerned that he would cause permanent damage.  I was thrilled with the reaction of my son to the first time he put his fingers in his mouth after applying Mavala- YUCK!!! It has taken several weeks, but I have not observed him biting his nails at all (I don&#x27;t know what he does during daycare).  I am also happy to report that he now has enough new growth that I actually had to clip several nails.  My son just started a new school so I will continue to use the product for the next few weeks in case he regresses to previous behaviors.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since i was very little, and i thought i could never stop. This product really works! The taste is bitter which makes me not want to bite my nails. I would really recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;ll make a grown-ass man cry himself to sleep. Seriously. This stuff&#x27;s the real deal. No joke. You&#x27;ll be beggin&#x27; for your momma.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...or nasty depending on how you look at it.  I have been a habitual nail biter for about 33 years... yes that&#x27;s right...33 years. I tried everything to stop from reading books, therapy, hypnosis, tapes, but nothing worked.  I finally gave up and thought that I would be a nail biter for the rest of my life.  I never thought about trying something like this because it seemed like a gimmick and was just too easy. I was wrong!! I bought a bottle with no expectations that it would work.  I put it on and the first time I started biting ny nails I had to run to the bathroom to wash my mouth out.  Even then the after taste remained in my mouth for 1/2 hour or so.  This stuff is beyond gross tasting.  I would find myself starting to bite my nails while I was doing something and BAM that taste would hit my mouth and I would immediately become aware of what I was doing and stop.  There is just no way you can keep biting your nails with this stuff on them.  You will have to stop because if you don&#x27;t you will become physically ill. It&#x27;s been a month since I bought it and for the most part I have stopped.  I still find myself trying to nip at something here and there but as soon as I do, BAM, that awful taste kicks in and I stop.  The only negative about the stuff is that if you love finger foods like fried chicken then you better be careful.  No licking your fingers or you will be in trouble.  But that is a small price to pay to kick a habit that is disgusting and embarassing.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb for 3 years straight , bought this product , only had too apply it 4 times too her nail and the habit was completely broken in a little over a week .</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son stopped sucking his thumb in 1 day. Love this product!</li>
            <li> It worked very well in stopping my daughter&#x27;s thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> It works. It is GROSS. But it works....warning, it gives me headaches so the initial couple weeks of use kind of sucked but it did help alleviate my bad habit</li>
            <li> Helping my son to not bite his nails and my daughter to not suck her thumb. So far a huge success.</li>
            <li> Tastes gross, helps get the job done!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!  My sister used it on her daughter who was a thumb sucker about 10 years ago. I have used it in aiding to stop my children from sucking their fingers (son) and thumbs (daughter).  My son stopped thankfully and I am still working on my little girl. I do wish the nasty taste this product produces while on the nail (which is how it gets them to stop sucking) would not go onto everything you touch. For example.. I used it to try and help me stop biting my nails, but than anything I ate with my hands would have that bitter taste. So that is my only negative.</li>
            <li> We tried the peppery-tasting one for our thumb-sucker but it didn&#x27;t work at all.  (Cayenne flavored thumb...thanks I like it!)  Mavala Stop was recommended to us by friends for their thumb-sucker and they were right.  Very effective.  The taste is &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; and it stays on for a few days.  Best if the child wants to make the change, as this is meant to be a reminder when the child unconsciously puts his/her fingers in his/her mouth.  Would work great for adult nail-biters, too.</li>
            <li> Worked the first day, after that it washes off and finger sucking starts again. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Taste is awful and has kept me from biting my fingernails as I had hoped. I have actually needed to use nail clippers twice now and this is someone who has chewed his nails his entire life.</li>
            <li> This really helps our grandson with thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful- yuck- but does the trick.  Got rid of the paci AND a thumb sucker (aged 4) in a matter of weeks. Put on nail and on skin around thumb.  Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Applied this to my 3.5 yo daughters nails, and it was extremely efficient in ending her sucking the thumb. I had to try it myself, too, and it tastes horrible! My only comment is that it could come in a smaller bottle, as you&#x27;re unlikely to need a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Works well to break habit.</li>
            <li> This thing works!!! I use it for my 2 yr old daughter and I honestly thought that it would not work since this is for 3yr+ due to to smaller kids doesn&#x27;t have their taste glands fully developed but it worked!!! she stopped sucking at her thumb right away, I used it for a month since I heard that it takes 21 days to stop or to get a new habit so,just to make sure.., the only thing is that you have to be careful while they eat cause if they use their fingers food will taste really bad, and I also would suggest to apply this at night while they are sleeping :)</li>
            <li> This works! I hated that my friend bit his nails. It had been a lifelong habit. So I started giving him weekly maintenance on his nails with this polish. A life long habit broken. We both are very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has always sucked his thumb. 2 days of this and he has completely stopped!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my partner to help stop biting their nails. It works very well (they told me that any time they had it on and accidentally tasted it, that they immediately had to spit it out), but only if you use it frequently! We have to put it on every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my four year old daughter who has developed a serious nail and skin biting problem. I have to reapply it at least twice a week for it to be effective. So far, so good. She hates the bitter taste and happily keeps her fingers out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> Yep, tastes pretty awful! It worked for me after biting my nails for 30 years. It was more about becoming aware of my nail biting habit and that is exactly what this does. Gives you a bitter reminder that your nail is in your mouth! But I will warn you...don&#x27;t go to KFC while using this, though, because it won&#x27;t be finger lickin&#x27; good. Haha! The only reason why I took away one star is because of the way it seems to change the texture of nail polish. Or maybe I didn&#x27;t let my polish dry well enough before I put this over it. Anyway, it&#x27;s a good product. Buy it!</li>
            <li> This worked great! My four year old stopped sucking his thumb from the first night we used this because it tastes horrible and the taste lingers in your mouth (I made sure to try it on my own nails 1st and to taste it 1st so I could honestly warn my little one about the bad taste).  It lasts on the nails for about 2 days so you don&#x27;t need to apply it every day.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes absolutely horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it still didn&#x27;t work for me, but then again, neither did spraying my fingertips with pepper spray (I bit my nails through that! yikes!).&lt;br /&gt;Of the millions of products like this I have tried, this is the nastiest one I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to consider is that when you eat things with your hands, like a sandwich, you sometimes get some of the taste of this in your mouth. You have to be careful not to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for nail-biters (unrelated to the product) : I got acrylic nails on top of my severely bitten nails (down to the cuticles). Every couple weeks, I would go back to the nail salon to get them \\&quot;filled.\\&quot; (They put the acrylic liquid stuff at the base of your nail, where it has grown out. It hardens to blend in with the rest of your acrylic nail. Then they do a regular manicure: trimming the nails, painting, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;Many months later, my real nails were the same length as the acrylics on top of them! I let them fall off, and my nails were so damaged they were BENDY, rough, and jagged. I could literally bend the tip of my nail in half. This made me want to bite them, of course. So, I trimmed them down - as hard as it was to see my first-time natural long nails cut - filed and buffed them, then painted them with a light pink polish. Eventually, I was able to stop painting them and not have the urge to bite them. Now, I keep a nail filer and buffer with me at ALL times to fix any jagged parts throughout the day. My nails are now long, healthy, and they grow really fast.&lt;br /&gt;So, if this product doesn&#x27;t work for you (as nasty as it is!), I&#x27;d advise doing what I did - minus the pepper spray!</li>
            <li> Worked great!  My daughter had a horrible habit of biting her nails and the skin around her nails at all times. We would see her doing it during soccer games, during swim meets, ... all the time!  Not any more.</li>
            <li> The best - a gentle reminder that hands do not belong in mouth. Over time cap can be hard to open - rinse bottle in hot water and twist.</li>
            <li> My son had been a thumb sucker since day one.. He just turned 6 and is autistic. So he used it as a way to soothe himself.. But a very bad habit as well. His teeth were really starting to show and his communication was lacking because his thumb was always I&#x27;m his mouth.. I purchased this product very skeptical. I actually tried it first and was shocked on how potent it was.. The taste definitely lingers and it is not a good one... I hesitated doing it to my son, worrying it would majorly upset him. First night I painted his thumb nail, he attempted 3 times to suck.. He hated the taste and begged for milk.. He never freaked out so it was actually quite amusing. Ever since that night he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb once! It has been atleast a month. I have only applied twice so far. I am very happy to say my son no longer sucks his thumb!</li>
            <li> This was only temporarily helpful. My son got used to the gross taste and has continued to chew his nails.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 4 year old who has been trying to stop sucking her thumb for 1.5 years.  We have tried cloth thumb buddies (she removed them), socks on her hands taped with climber&#x27;s tape (she would peel off the tape), hot sauce and Bitter Apple spray.  Nothing worked and her constant thumb sucking was causing her front teeth to flare.  At her last dental check-up in May of 2014, the dentist told us that unless she had stopped her thumb sucking by December of 2014, she would have a Blue Grass appliance&lt;br /&gt;(a dental appliance with a roller placed on the roof of her mouth).  My husband saw a youtube video about the Mavala Stop and we found and then ordered it on Amazon.  We put the Mavala Stop on ALL of her nails the day we received it in the mail and she did try to suck her thumb, but told my husband and I that she did not like the taste of it and was not sucking her thumb anymore.  This happened within 1 week of using it!  We saved hundreds of dollars in dental work by spending $11.00 on this bottle.  It works!!!  For any parent whose child cannot stop sucking their thumb OVER  the age of 3, I highly recommend this product.  My daughter did not gag or have any reactions to the Mavala Stop and actually tells me &amp;#34;Mommy, I need my Mavala Stop tonight&amp;#34;.  We love this product!</li>
            <li> It works! Just reapply every couple of days! No finger foods... Yuck, which is actually a good thing in this case.</li>
            <li> Do not benefit from this</li>
            <li> This product really WORKS! I could stop there as that statement says it all - but to add a little and respond to some of the other reviews I&#x27;ve read:&lt;br /&gt;It does dry to appear a little &amp;#34;less shiny&amp;#34; than most clear polishes and there have been some reviews expressing concern that this will draw further attention to already ugly chewed up nails. Hogwash! If you are a grown woman like me and have been biting your nails to the point that they bleed - no one is going to notice that your clear polish is not a brilliant shine.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a local salon and started with a fresh manicure. It wasn&#x27;t exactly gorgeous since there was so little to work with, but they filed everything smooth, got rid of the ragged cuticles, and applied a very neutral polish. I came home and applied Stop and believe me - I STOPPED biting. This product leaves a beyond-description-horribly-nasty-vile-taste in your mouth for at least 5 to 10 minutes that NOTHING will take away. I haven&#x27;t bitten a nail since.&lt;br /&gt;I did have a little trouble remembering in the beginning not to lick my fingers to be careful when eating hand-held foods, but it didn&#x27;t take long to adjust. Within 2 weeks I had enough nail for a simple French Manicure. I got the Shellac since it lasts so long and applied Stop every few days. For the first time in my adult life, I am actually getting compliments on my nails!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> was not as impressed as I thought I would be with this product it does not taste as bad as it should taste, it is shiny so if you need for a male, forget it!</li>
            <li> I bought this not too long ago and based on the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month and a half ago. It has since kept me from biting my nails whenever I&#x27;ve remembered to put it on in the morning, and sometimes even when I&#x27;ve forgotten! It tastes disgusting and bitter, which is something you might expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that if you ever miss, you&#x27;ll have this disgusting bitter taste on your fingers. This makes it really hard to eat finger foods (chips, hot wings, burritos, etc.) without getting a bit of that bitter taste, which is kind of unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my nail biting was getting to be a big enough problem that this small inconvenience was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I was very worried about the health hazards of this, but when I realized how little I have to use (not the full dose) and, that during the winter my poor little 4 year old&#x27;s two fingers were actually WEARING AWAY, raw, peeling and painful ... I chose the bit on the tip of the nail as the better choice.  Voila!  Her fingers healed and she was loathe to ever put them in her mouth again.  She was actually HAPPY about it too, because by the time I got up the nerve to put the stuff on her, she was really hurting and looking for a better solution to help her quit than lansinoh and bandaids and socks, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works also on my ten year old who er uh, needs to break some nasty habits.  She says when she puts her finger in her nose she&#x27;ll feel it burn ever so slightly.  Voila!  No more er uh ... icky booger swab to with &amp;#34;the finger&amp;#34; to her mouth to taste it (UGH).  She doesn&#x27;t even realize she&#x27;s doing it ... when she&#x27;s reading a good book and gets to a stressful scene there she goes on auto-pilot.  Not anymore!  The auto-pilot has been disabled thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome- I put it on my daughters fingers to stop her from sucking on them and it worked in one day- no fuss and long process !</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old daughter was thumb sucking from the day she was born but&lt;br /&gt;stopped thumb sucking in one day. I mean I&lt;br /&gt;just  let her saw that I put a little stuff on her thumb and I let her taste it and wasn&#x27;t happy of the taste and I said&lt;br /&gt;look it&#x27;s yucky no more chewing your finger, the next time I knew she was careful&lt;br /&gt;not to put her thumb in her mouth.  That time she was tempted couple of times of course&lt;br /&gt;to put her thumb in her mouth when she was sleepy but I was there trying to tell her finger down you don&#x27;t need it and it worked. Just one whole day. I was determined to let her stop because I don&#x27;t want her to be like me a thumb sucker up until I was 7 yrs old it was hard to stop. But I&#x27;m glad it did work for my daughter as early as 2.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy no more thumb sucking :) as simple as that...thank you so much mavala....</li>
            <li> This product is a good prevention for thumb sucking and nail biting. We have been using it for a couple weeks a noticed remarkable results.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr kid stopped biting nails after 2 week apply. He completely stopped and looks its out of his mind now.</li>
            <li> Stopped sucking his thumb the moment polish was dry. I only had to use it one time. Well worth the money. Now don&#x27;t have to put hard wear in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Chose mavala to stop nail biting, works very well  tastes terrible (like it should!) when injested. I got Immediate results.</li>
            <li> It works!  It worked the first day. Put it on every other day. It&#x27;s awesome. My son has stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter most of my life and I wanted to stop. I tried everything I could think of to try to stop biting my nails. And this is something I would do subconsciously. I would do this while sitting watching tv, reading a book, magazine or computer and when I am bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Mavala Stop. I would sit here on Amazon and other websites reading reviews and just about every review I would read raved about this product for helping them quit biting their nails or keeping their children from sucking their thumbs and fingers. I had my doubts reading these reviews but I decided to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product on Monday, right after Easter, and applied this product. I forgot I had this product on my fingers and put them to my mouth. The taste. OH THE TASTE!!!! I&#x27;d swear the same sadists that created &amp;#34;The One Ring&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; in the bowels of Mordor, created the taste of this product (those that have watched &amp;#34;The Lord of the Rings&amp;#34; movies or read the books will get this reference). It is the most vile, horroble bitter taste I have ever tasted. The taste sticks to the inside of your mouth and stays there for a long time. There is nothing you can do to get the taste out of your mouth once its there. Plus, not only does the taste stick to your mouth and tongue, it sticks to your lips and around your mouth. So anytime you lick your lips or anywhere surrounding your mouth, you get that taste as well only not quite as strong. As far as how well the product lasts, it seems to have some staying power but leads to one of my complaints about the product. It seems to have a weakness to soap when you get a bath or wash your hands. It knocks the taste of the product down a good bit, especially after getting a bath. So if you reapply this after getting a bath, you should be good. If you can spare getting soap on your fingernails though the bad taste does seem to last but does get somewhat weaker over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to how the product works on children, but I can speak for an adult and this product does work. I have been using the product for a week and after that first day, I have rarely put my fingers to my mouth as I don&#x27;t want to taste that taste in my mouth. It does effect eating snacks like popcorn and potato chips as well as eating finger foods. But now, I don&#x27;t bite my nails, and for that...this product is a really good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, if you are a nail biter and you want to quit? Please, I implore you... get this product. Yes, it tastes horrible and nasty but it works wonders. If it can help someone who has bit their nails for the last 33 years plus then it will help you, too.duct works on children, but I can speak for an adult and this product does work.

            <li> Very effective.  Cured my 6 year old&#x27;s nail biting habit in 3 days!  I&#x27;m now using it to keep my 5 y/o&#x27;s fingers out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> Is some pretty nasty tasting stuff, but is quite effective because of that.  I have been a nail-biting for many years and this is definitely helping.  It looks like clear coat nail polish and lasts for a couple days.  Be a little careful of certain finger foods as the taste can transfer a little if you have just applied it that day.</li>
            <li> My nail biters hate it and that is exactly what I wanted to hear from my little ones. When I run out I&#x27;m and buying more.</li>
            <li> This worked for a few weeks on my daughter who sucked her thumb at night. After that she got use to the taste and sucked her thumb anyway.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Get gloves or the plastic thumb/finger guards. Liquids do not work. I once tried Tabasco on my first kid&#x27;s thumbs to get him to stop sucking his thumb. He started demanding Tabasco on his eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thumb guards are the only true solution. Worked for all my kids.</li>
            <li> I put this on my kids&#x27; thumbs to get them to stop sucking their thumbs, and within an application or two, they did quit. I had tried every other tactic in the book, but nothing had worked. My pediatrician recommended Mavala, and he was exactly right about it ending that bad habit.</li>
            <li> My two kids have been biting their nails for a couple of years and we have tried just about everything to stop it.  This is the only thing that has worked for them.  After about 10 days their nails are now starting to grow out and we can see white growing out from the nail beds.  The taste of Mavala is terrible (which is the point) but they want to continue to put it on because they are seeing the results. Needs to be reapplied about every other day.  They say it takes aprox. three weeks to start of stop a habit.  They haven&#x27;t reached that time period yet, but are hopeful that once they do the product will not be necessary any more.  If it is, there will by plenty remaining in the jar so they will keep at it.  I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a thumb sucking problem.  I&#x27;d previously purchased a bottle of Mavala Stop and it worked, until I left the closed bottle on the side and enough leaked onto the threads on the bottle to seal it forever.  I bought a bottle of Thum locally, but that stuff didn&#x27;t phase my daughter at all.  So, again, I went online to purchase Mavala Stop and it is once again working.</li>
            <li> This stopped my nail biting. They are beautiful. I love to look at my hands and see my gorgeous nails.</li>
            <li> Great product. It absoutely works.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this product is literally life changing. I have tried so many methods to get our stubborn 5 year old twins to stop sucking their thumbs and this product worked on day one! I put a dot on the tip of each thumb. Each of them tried it once and that&#x27;s all it took. I still use it (we are on day 6!!) just because I don&#x27;t want them to regress. I fully expect them to be thumb-free by next week! Save yourself thousands in ortho costs and purchase this product, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> tastes really really bad!! but&lt;br /&gt;my daughter gave up on biting her nails in 2 weeks..&lt;br /&gt;we stopped putting it on her, and she hasn&#x27;t gone back to her habit..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have more than half of the bottler left, and probably would use it on her sister!</li>
            <li> My son is 2.5 and has sucked his thumb since birth. I wanted him to stop the habit before preschool. Also, thumb sucking was causing him to have an over bite. I applied Muvalva to both thumbs every other night (once he fell asleep) for 1 month and IT WORKED.  I would recommend Muvalva for a preschooler. Be consistent about applying the product daily or every other day. Don’t let you child see you put it on. Also, the first night be prepared with some orange juice to help get rid of the taste so they will go back to sleep. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> they hate the taste of this and complain about it always. Hey just keep your fingers and nails out of your mouth is my response.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for 50 years and have never found any of the biting deterrents to really work. This one is different. It tastes awful!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY horrible tasting, and long lasting. One slip and your entire mouth and lips are filled with a gross taste that you never want to experience again. It&#x27;s a perfect negative reinforcement! With this stuff on I&#x27;d never even think of putting my fingers near my mouth., and it does not easily wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t think it tastes awful, something is amiss with your taste buds.</li>
            <li> This here is genius, today is the 5th day and counting my daughter hasn&#x27;t sucked her fingers. She&#x27;s been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 5 months she&#x27;s now 22 months. I must say the first day, I only applied to the nails and it didn&#x27;t work, she made a face and continued sucking her fingers, but two days later I applied to finger nails and around the top of her finger tips and it&#x27;s working. That was with only one application. Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
            <li> It actually works!!! I&#x27;ve had this bad habit since like I was born. But now I get rid of it!!</li>
            <li> This did not work for my daughter. Was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My 3 yo daughter has been sucking her thumb since she was in the womb. I have tried everything including the expensive silicon thumb cover that promises to work.  Well it didn&#x27;t and then came accross this product.  I had to put in on her thumb 2 days in a row and she has not sucked on that thumb since.  Very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It did help prevent nail biting but it also gets all over everything you touch ... including food you&#x27;re about to eat. Be careful!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm;) It helps with stopping my three year old from sucking her thumb, she hates the taste, therefor she stops and restrains herself from putting her thumb in her mouth.</li>
            <li> This really works! Applied ur on my kid &#x27;s fingers for a few nights and he has stopped sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> We tried exhaustively to get our daughter to stop sucking her thumb for years. Now that she is 7 and her permanent front teeth are in, we could wait no longer. While I think emotional and mental readiness certainly played a role, I was surprised at how well Mavala Stop put her over the top on the first night. We even forgot to bring it with us on a weekend trip and so she didn&#x27;t have it for a long weekend, but she didn&#x27;t backslide. We just jumped right back on it when we got home. Highly recommend for incorrigible thumb suckers like my child. Additionally, her friend had used it and provided a rousing endorsement.</li>
            <li> After trying everything to get my son to stop sucking his thumb (rewards, school peer pressure, taping his thumb), this is the only thing that worked.  He stopped within 24 hours of application and now he reminds me when it is time to put on a new application.  THANK YOU MAVALA STOP!!!!!!!!!! He has so much confidence now!!!</li>
            <li> Upon reading the reviews I was skeptical since my 4 year old had such a bad habit since she was born.  She knew something was wrong but kept quiet the first day.  She cried a lot at night since that&#x27;s when she soothes herself with her thumb the most.&lt;br /&gt;The next day, it&#x27;s almost like she didn&#x27;t miss it at all. No crying at night.&lt;br /&gt;I reapply it every two days and so far (we&#x27;re on week 3) there&#x27;s no attempt to even suck her thumb while watching tv, reading, or at night.</li>
            <li> This product works ! It is a miracle that I stop biting my nails/fingers. I try everything under the sun and needless to say this product did the trick and I have been nail biting free for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> This product worked great both for helping my 4 year old stop sucking her thumb as well as helping my husband cut back on his nail biting. I tested the product on myself before using it on my daughter. A little bit goes a long way. I was happy that while the taste was displeasing it wasn&#x27;t so terrible that it made her sick or gag. But it only took a couple of times of her putting her thumb in her mouth to make her VERY CAREFUL not to do it again. Great product!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks on our 8 yr old daughter and she has not even attempted to suck her thumb again! I think the habit is broken! For the price, it was totally worth it! The alternative was a \\&quot;cage\\&quot; that would be placed in her mouth for 6 months costing us over $700. The Mavala Stop was inexpensive and it worked great! My husband also used it as he is a nail biter and he hasn&#x27;t touched his nails since using it! The taste is offensive and stays with you for a while when you taste it, but makes you not want to taste it again! Worth every penny and I have already recommended it to others!</li>
            <li> I put it on my two year old daughter and after a week she stopped sucking her thumb! she understood it was for her to stop sucking her thumb and called it medicine :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve collected my fair share of nervous habits over the years and finally I got fed up with my inability to stop biting my nails. My problem is that as a nervous habit it was something I&#x27;d do without noticing. By the time I realized what I was doing and stopped, my nails would already be ruined. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in 4 days since using this product. It only took a couple of slips for me to stop wanting to bite my nails. The taste is really horrible. The only downside is that I also taste it when I try to eat finger foods like fruit and sandwiches but its not too bad with food.</li>
            <li> Works well to nick the habit of nail biting. Dries quickly and keeps parent from being the constant enforcer. The only drawback is when they eat with their hands (as children do).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to add a negative review, but this did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for my finger-sucking 3 year old.  I have brushed it on multiple times with no change in behavior.  With all the 5-star reviews and great comments, I thought for sure this would be our answer.  It didn&#x27;t even phase her.  I put a little on the first time to be careful.  Nothing.  The next time, I put on more and also tested it on her older sister, just to see if it was actually working.  Her older sister could taste a faint bad taste when she turned her nail over and put it next to her tongue, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t so strong she was heaving or anything.  The last time I covered the whole top of my finger-sucker&#x27;s finger, including the skin part on the \\&quot;palm\\&quot; side of the finger, and still she sucks them.  She doesn&#x27;t even grimace.  Maybe my children just don&#x27;t have sensitive taste buds (they&#x27;re generally not picky eaters like some I&#x27;ve seen), but this did not help us at all.  Now what?</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Too effective. Yes you read that right. This thing works exactly as advertised and within 4 days, I have pretty much stopped biting my nails. So why is this a con? Well thats because you can&#x27;t use your fingers to eat any food at all. This is probably not a problem for most people but I am an Indian, so there is a lot of bread or rice that we eat with our bare hands, so if this thing accidentally touches your food, well you can say good bye to good taste. I have tried eating normal food (e.g. cut fruits or chips).with my fingers as well. Again, if this even remotely touches that food from your fingers, you are done for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just something to bear in mind when you are using this product..</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter because she would always bite her nails. After applying this nail polish she stopped. It is a very very bitter taste and makes for a great deterrent for biting nails. The only downside to this is that it stays on the nails for a long time, so if you give your kid finger foods to eat they will still be able to taste the bitterness and might not like that food anymore lol.</li>
            <li> I NEVER thought my 4 year old would stop sucking her thumb. Ever.  I bought this last year and was scared to use it because of all the mixed feedback about stopping your child from soothing themselves.  Her teeth were noticeably displaced due to her habit, so I knew I had to do something finally.  For 12 hours, it was like detoxing a drug addict.  She was screaming and crying she wanted to suck her thumb and begging me to wash it off,  I stayed strong (but compassionate and comforting) and the next morning, like magic she just... Stopped.  We never discussed it, she never complained and let me reapply without a fight,&lt;br /&gt;Done in a day.  She is happy, adjusted and hasn&#x27;t relapsed and I only used this product 2 times. I rarely review anything. But have totally sympathy for parents looking for a solution.  It was not easy, but totally and completely worth it.</li>
            <li> This product cured my 6 year old&#x27;s nail biting problem.  He just couldn&#x27;t stop biting his nails.  Poor little guy, every week or two he would bite them down so far his fingers would hurt.  He wanted to stop but couldn&#x27;t help himself.  We told him about this product and he welcomed the help.  First day it was about every 20 minutes he ran for the bathroom to rinse out his mouth... lol .  I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at him... silently of course.  That stuff tastes TERRIBLE and It worked great!  Haven&#x27;t had to use it any more now and just clipped his nails for the first time in quite a while a few days ago.  Great product, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this has really helped my son a lot. He hasn&#x27;t stopped biting completely but he is well on his way</li>
            <li> Great product.  She did complain that it got on her lips and made everything else taste bad, but that&#x27;s just part of it.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver. I absolutely love this product and I am so glad I purchased it. My 2 ½ year old daughter kept putting her two index fingers in her mouth since she was 6 months old. The doctor told me to let it go but as she was getting older it became a habit. Every time she would go to sleep she was depending on sucking her fingers. I didn’t like the fact that her teeth can get ruined so I decided to make this purchase. This thing leaves such a horrible taste that she stopped sucking her two index fingers. My husband and I are very excited :)</li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually stops me from biting my nails. The only thing is that if you are eating food with you hands, you will most likely taste the product which is extremely bitter and gross.</li>
            <li> My daughter stopped biting nails!!! Really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old suddenly started biting her nails right down until they were sore and bright red.  I carefully applied this product to her nails only (avoiding her fingers) and she stopped biting them instantly!  We did have a bit of trouble with her eating fruit etc with her fingers as some of the product would transfer onto the food and make it taste horrible so I just have her a fork to use instead.&lt;br /&gt;It really works.</li>
            <li> Just as expected! My son had a hard time w taste and we are gradually working on it. When we are ready for a few sleepless nights we will be using!</li>
            <li> I surely does taste bitter, and yes I have stopped biting my nails for the most part, but the taste gets on anything I put my hands in! It doesn&#x27;t just stay on the nails, it goes on anything food you might be picking at with your hand.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that this product really worked. I have been trying everything to get my 6 year old to stop sucking his fingers. I am glad that my dentist recommended this.</li>
            <li> My son is 3 and he could care less if this stuff is on his hands.  He actually has asked me to paint it on because it was like paint.  NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> my daughter has been sucking her thumb since in the womb.. non-stop.. two weeks before her 3rd birthday, i purchased mavala hoping this would get rid of this nasty habit.. it took less than 48hours, and my daughter has no craving to stick her thumb in her mouth. the first night was rough, very rough. lots of spitting, crying, and im thinking she needed something to do with her hands, so she just scratched and scratched her whole body.. she kept crying out, mommy, please take it off, i wont suck my thumb, i wont... believe me, it broke my heart, and twice i wanted to give in.. but i stayed strong with what i wanted for my daughter, and just kept explaining that shes a big girl now, and it ll be better tomorrow... the next day, she was grumpy, from being up half the night.. but the next evening, peaceful sleeping.. two days later, she brought me the bottle and told me to &amp;#34;paint her nails&amp;#34; she has not put her thumb in her mouth since... totally worth the money</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb because after several years of failed attempts of trying other tactics, nothing else worked.  This stuff you simply brush on, let dry and it has a non toxic bitter taste kids don&#x27;t like.  Within a few applications it did the trick, no more thumb sucking!  I would recommend this product to other parents looking for a similar solution.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Tastes DISGUSTING! It got me to quit biting my nails, and I&#x27;ve been a biter since I was 5 yo. I&#x27;m now 21. Although I don&#x27;t recommend this if you have children. My son stuck something in his mouth he wasn&#x27;t supposed to (kids will be kids) and I went to get it out and it tasted so bad he gagged.</li>
            <li> This really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long at all.  Didn&#x27;t seem to really deter my child from putting fingers in mouth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to prevent my son from sucking his thumb.  We also purchased the thumb guard.  We only used the Mavala once so I am not sur eof its long term effectiveness.  The one time I did use it it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Stopped my 6 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking at night almost right away.  She only did it while she slept before trying this product but it was enough to have her teeth move around.  The taste of this kept her thumb far away from her mouth.  We painted it on only her thumb nail, covering it the first night with two thorough coats of &#x27;polish&#x27;.  After that, we painted a single coat every third night and stopped using it after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did tasted it once.  She said it was really bad and it took a few minutes to get the taste out of her mouth but she didn&#x27;t gag or have anything lingering.  She did need to be careful when eating anything with her hands to keep that thumb away from her mouth.  Just a brush of the nail near her mouth was enough to get the sour taste but it didn&#x27;t linger long if it was just a glancing blow.</li>
            <li> This product helped my teen to stop biting her nails within 2 weeks just in time for her braces.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My brother and I have bitten our nails since..well, since we could remember.  It&#x27;s a nasty and embarrassing habit and I have now become a college student who continuously bites her nail.  It&#x27;s become so second nature that I cannot mentally convince myself to stop.  I have tried putting nice nail polish on (which would end up being chipped away by me anyway) and even tried just letting peer pressure get the best of me.  But, nothing works.  So I finally gave up and looked for a Stop-Nail Biting polish to try.  The reviews sounded hopeful so I gave it a try.  Mavala Stop works as long as you are responsible enough to keep applying it every 4 or 5 days.  It stays pretty prominent even after hand washing, showering, etc.  I have found that it has kept me from biting my nails and I cannot wait until I can ween myself off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother uses this as well. Don&#x27;t worry, boys, it goes on glossy but dries off matte.  So you won&#x27;t look like you are wearing nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you want to stop biting your nails and mere will power just won&#x27;t cut it, buy Mavala Stop.  Good luck to my fellow peers who have been a victim to this nasty habit.</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking his thumb since birth he is 2 months shy of his 3rd birthday so this habit was really troubling me. At first we tried to keep him busy/distracted during the day and it seemed to help however in the last 3 months it seemed to be worse I found him constantly sucking his thumb even while playing. First thing we tried was \\&quot;thumb\\&quot; bought at drugstore...it worked one day and by the second he was sucking again even with it on his thumb...then I read about this product decided to try it and it worked only took 2-3 days of applying it..naturally we had problems with his sleeping because he was so accustomed to suck his thumb to fall asleep and even during his sleep however that only lasted a week or so and with coaxing, reassuring, and sleeping in the bed next to his a few nights..he no longer sucks his thumb!!!!! It is such a relief, I was so worried about dental issues. It is also so nice he can just fall asleep on his own without his thumb in his mouth!!! I did try this product out first before I used it on him and it just leaves a very bitter taste in the your mouth. He never threw up he would drool and try to spit the product out. I also did not have to apply very often but I did apply to all fingers! A big thank you to the makers of this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My six-year-old has sucked her middle and ring finger since she was three months old. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get her to quit. I finally bought Mavala Stop and promised her a day with me at an indoor water park if she&#x27;d quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hasn&#x27;t sucked her fingers for four weeks. Praise God! This is the answer for finger sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails with Mavala Stop, just to see what it&#x27;s like. It&#x27;s bitter, and it stays on your fingers for at least three days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.... My 5-year old twin daughters absolutely refused to stop sucking their thumbs.  Everytime they would all I could hear in my mind was cha-ching to the dentist.  We had tried EVERYTHING!!!!  Tape, socks, finger splints, THUMB, offering money, and threats to cut off the thumb (Not like I would really do that, but it was worth a shot).  We applied the Mavala stop to the girls&#x27; thumbs and in about 2 weeks.. they were DONE! (insert jumping up and down - HAPPY).  I would recommend this product to anyone that is trying to get their children to stop.</li>
            <li> This worked immediately for my 6y.o. She really didn&#x27;t want to stop sucking her thumb but was old enough to realize she had no choice. We tried a thumb guard without sustainable success. There are other posts for lack of success with Mavala for younger children. I&#x27;m going to wait to use it on my 3 y.o. based on this advice. But, it worked for my 6 y.o. from day#1. We continued to apply it about every other night for several weeks to be sure the habit was truly broken. It&#x27;s cheap and I&#x27;d give it a shot, especially for an older child.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the positive reviews. My 3 year old sucks her thumb, and I am desperate to get her to stop. The product definitely smells bad, but my daughter just rubs it off and then sucks her thumb. I try to keep her from touching it so it has time to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. It is a deterrent at best for us. Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t recommend it. It might be a better product for a younger child who doesn&#x27;t think to rub it off.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 1/2 year old who has been sucking his thumb since birth, but i needed to put a stop to the sucking. He is to start pre-school soon and this was to avoid too much bacteria on his thumb and to his mouth. I purchased Mavala and thee day it came i put it on his thumb, he put it in his mouth and he cried himself to sleep for a good 10 minutes and this was 2/17/2011 and from that moment on there was no thumb sucking.. Guess what i didn&#x27;t have to apply it again he just never put his thumb in his mouth and it&#x27;s been a month and no thumb sucking. It did work for me, hope it does work for you. It is very nasty, and the taste stayed in my mouth for a while so i am sure if it doesn&#x27;t work for you on day 1, keep applying it. Don&#x27;t give up because all kids are different, but it did work for me truly amazing.</li>
            <li> My son sucked his fingers since birth (almost 4 years), and after three days of using STOP he no longer does!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I wish is came in a smaller size because we have almost a full bottle left over!</li>
            <li> Works great!  My daughter is almost 6 years old and sucked her thumb nonstop.  After using this product once, she stopped sucking her thumb within 2 days!  It&#x27;s now been a month after we used Mavala and she&#x27;s still free of her thumb sucking habit!</li>
            <li> My son has sucked his thumb from the time he was eight weeks old.  He is now three.  We tried just encouraging him to stop and using the Fireman Fred booklet and puppet.  Both didn&#x27;t work.  I put a band-aid on his thumb every day and that helped but he still couldn&#x27;t break the habit.  Then over Christmas break, I put the Mavala stop on and he IMMEDIATELY stopped thumb-sucking and hasn&#x27;t done it since.  I did one follow-up brushing on the nail and the cuticle line -just to be absolutely sure- and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He found the taste HORRIBLE.  Keep in mind that when eating the thumb may come into contact with the mouth and be a yucky experience during mealtimes.  Just have a drink ready and the bad taste will eventually dissipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product!  It worked for us.  I will be using it on my younger son when he is old enough per the package directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:  Use the mavala stop when you have nothing going on and can deal with your child&#x27;s irritability during the day, and some restless sleep -or even crying at night.  A few days to a week and things should be much better at night.  Also keep in mind that the thumb is a soother, so it may take awhile for your child to emotionally adjust.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;As I stated above,  I would be trying it on my second son.  He was an ambidextrous thumb sucker.  I decided not to wait until three and used it a few months before then - trying to avoid those preschool germs.  I only had to apply it once!  He never put his thumbs in his mouth again.  No reapplication was necessary.  Awesome product period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 3 year old.  I thought he was never going to quit and I had my doubts but it worked great.  Only had to use it a few times.  He cried and I felt so guilty but it had to be done.  My husband said it tasted awful and my son agreed.  He wanted a drink and his teeth brushed so he wouldn&#x27;t have to taste it anymore.  He didn&#x27;t vomit so that was a plus.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It helps.  It won&#x27;t solve the nail biting addiction 100% but if you have the willpower, this will help you a lot.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed my kid stop outmatically after once I paint it thanks to those who made it and distribute thank you</li>
            <li> After years of trying to get our son to stop sucking his thumb with no avail, we decided to give this a try after reading all the good reviews here. It really worked!  My son stopped sucking his thumb after only one application. All we did was put a tiny bit on the tip of his thumb nail.  He did accidentally put his thumb in his mouth at bedtime and got a bad taste in his mouth. That was enough for him to stop putting his thumb in his mouth. It has been a month now and he has not once sucked  his thumb.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has sucked his index finger since birth and his dentist is concerned about the negative impact it is having on the roof of his mouth and front teeth.  We put the product on his index fingernail yesterday and he has not sucked his finger since.  We are hopeful that this will be the solution!</li>
            <li> After being an extreme nail biter for 60 years and learning to hide my nails to where it became an art form, I tried using Mavala Stop and it worked right away. The taste is so bitter and lingers in your mouth for so long that you just stop biting. I now have long nails and it is so wonderful to write a check at a store or unpeel some old tape without being embarressed. I&#x27;m an Operations Manager for a large company and I now exude confidence when people look at my hands. I highly recommend this to all nail biters. It might be a tad bit strong for young children.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 year old used to suck her thumb constantly. Nothing worked. She used to suck her thumb so much that she didn&#x27;t even take her thumb out to eat. She was becoming mal-nutraioned because of her thumb sucking. And with malava she stopped sucking her thumb with one application. I kept applying it for 3-4 days just to make sure that the habit doesn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I used this for my (9) year old daughters finger sucking. I painted all of her nails with it, just in case she started sucking a differant finger. Works great! No more finger sucking. I highly recommend it. It seemed a little expensive at first but was well worth it. It might even save me a few thousand dollars in Ortho visits if I caught it in time for her teeth to correct (which they do sometimes). So if your a parent, save your self the ache of spending all that money on braces. Get this now while you can! It only took us one bottle to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> My beautiful little 3 year old girl sucked on her thumb like an addict chased their next high. She was sneaky (hid under tables) We could see her, she lied \\&quot;Papa no me take the band-aid off my thumb\\&quot;As 10 soggy band-aid&#x27;s were lying next to or under her bed, and so on. I tried everything from nasty kitchen concoctions to buying her off. Then it happened. I found the cure! This stuff worked in under 4 days. Yes, yes, its horrible to give you child something that tastes so bad. I made my peace by realizing she eats her boogers (from time to time) and occasionally indulges in a mouth full of dirt for and afternoon snack. Either way.. I tried this stuff and it is horrid tasting. She put her thumb in her mouth one time after the first application, and never again. Plus she liked getting her fingernail&#x27;s painted by her loving father, that was really tormenting her with a nasty tasting substance that mad her stop her favorite crutch. Father 1 - Daughter 0...........</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 1/2 years old and I have tried a variety of methods to break her of her thumb sucking. When I took her to the dentist and she told me that her teeth are loosening as a result of her thumb sucking I knew I had to find a way to break her. I got on Amazon to find a book that was suggested and one of the reviews of that particular book mentioned this! So I ordered it and got it pretty fast and the first time she stuck her thumb in her mouth after I applied it she started screaming and said her thumb tasted bad. She said she didn&#x27;t like it and didn&#x27;t want to do that again!!! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> kid stopped biting nails in 2 uses.  Yup , he gagged first time he sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly!! Although we hated to see the horrible look on our son&#x27;s face when he stuck his thumb in his mouth, it worked very effectively....</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop does taste gross that&#x27;s for sure, BUT it also didn&#x27;t help me any. I noticed that instead of biting i was picking my nails off instead :(. It also gave me a terrible four day long stomach ache ( Today is the 5th day so I don&#x27;t know if it will come back yet) and when I tried taking it off with nail polish remover the taste is still there.</li>
            <li> didnt help my daughter with thumb sucking !</li>
            <li> Wow. This stuff really worked. I&#x27;m a 35 year old man and I&#x27;ve bitten my nails my entire life. I&#x27;ve tried quitting before, but it never took. I used this stuff for a week.. and after about 1 or 2 times of me putting my fingers in my mouth and the horrible taste, I haven&#x27;t done it again. It&#x27;s been 3 months now.. and I&#x27;ve had to start using nail clippers. Get this stuff, put it on every other day.. and it&#x27;ll work. Be warned... don&#x27;t eat ribs, I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked yet want my $ back</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nails, waited for it to dry, and went about my day. Went to bite my nails and... meh. The taste is slightly unpleasant, but this product didn&#x27;t result in sudden cessation of my nail biting habit. I&#x27;ve tried applying the product a few more times under different conditions (just out of the shower, etc.) and have had the same result.</li>
            <li> My son is 5 years old and had sucked his thumb for years. I was discouraged because I thought he was too old to break the habit but this worked in about 1-2 days. He was spitting, sucking on his shirt and blankets to get the taste out his mouth when he sucked his thumb but that eventually stopped. It has been 10 months and he still don&#x27;t suck his thumb.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old not only bite her nails but sucked on  her thumb since before she was born ( I have an ultrasound that shows it!)it has stopped. I use the product for one week and she hasnt suck her thumb since.My only complaint is that the first time  I used it it literally glued its self shut. I couldnt open it the second time and the neck of the bottle broke while trying. It lasted a week. Afterwards I switched to another brand I had at home &amp;#34;thumb&amp;#34; and I havnt have a thumb sucking problem ever since. As for nail bitting she will often break one but as Im on top of it she will tell me or I&#x27;ll noticed and she&#x27;ll lets me fix it. The breaking of them is what triggers the biting on them. So yes I recommend it. But make sure the neck of the bottle is dry before you close it. Its almost like glue.</li>
            <li> This worked great! One taste and my daughter quit sucking her thumb. Strong and effective.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a HORRIBLE taste and initially was a great deterrent for my son.  He stopped thumb sucking altogether for a few weeks.  However he started up again (I think he has bad anxiety), and it&#x27;s been hard to get him to stop. I believe IF he were committed to trying and used it regularly again, it would definitely work. It&#x27;s horribly good!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s had a bad nail- and cuticle-biting habit for a while, and I&#x27;ve held onto this for a while hoping he&#x27;d stop on his own - but he was doing it without even realizing it. I didn&#x27;t want him to think it was punitive, so I explained that since his brain has started bringing his hand to his mouth unconsciously, we need to do some retraining so that his brain is unconsciously thinking that bringing his hand to his mouth is gross. The taste is bad enough to accomplish this, but not so bad that he can&#x27;t stand it - he was worried about being in school and not being able to wash his mouth out right away, but this hasn&#x27;t been a huge problem. I haven&#x27;t seen him put his hand to his mouth for days now.</li>
            <li> I wonder why have they allowed this thing to be on the shelf. Please try this product but a slight brush on ur nail and , u wud have hatred towards it. thankfully i tried it before trying it on my child. I think better is trying to encourage your child out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder why isnt there negative rating</li>
            <li> My third grader started biting her nails. I&#x27;m not sure what started the problem but warnigs etc... didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this and applied it maybe 3 times and after one week,  she stopped biting her nails. Pretty much immediately after tasting it once when trying.&lt;br /&gt;She is now in fourth grade and has long pretty nails and I have to make her sit down so I can trim them. She&#x27;s proud of her hands again, instant confidence boost.</li>
            <li> This product drys on fingers, yet it seems to be on everything Its on my fingers so how on my lips and my food, cant floss teeth i constantly have the taste of htis product in my mouth even if i am not sticking my fingers in my mouth</li>
            <li> Definitely works! It stays on your fingernails after several washes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks for my 7 year old son.  It works well, you just need to make it part of your routine to remember to add it every two days.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything for three years without success. The &amp;#34;sucker&amp;#34; has to want it and this was the little extra thing that did it. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> We told our 3 year old she could get a bunny when she stopped sucking her thumb... after a year of trying to talk her into not sucking it anymore... we bought this! OMG don&#x27;t think twice buy it!!! we put it on her thumb she stuck it in her mouth twice I think and that was it! no more thumb sucking at all! BUY BUY</li>
            <li> My main problem with this product is that it made my daughter gag and cry.  Also, it seemed to find its way in my mouth even though I did not apply it to myself.  It has a way of sticking to the back of your throat and staying there for a while.  Nothing rids the flavor.  It occurred to me, that my daughter was tasting this discussing stuff long after she tried biting her nails.  overall, I found it to be ineffective and cruel.</li>
            <li> My son is 9 yrs old and had been sucking his thumb since he was about 3.  His thumb was starting to get distorted, raw, and flat.  I read the previous reviews for the product and decided to try it out.  I lie to you not, after the first application, he immediately stopped sucking his thumb.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. And it was weird because I hadn&#x27;t even noticed he stopped sucking it until one day I just realized I had not seen him do it for a few days.  I asked him to let me see his thumb and it had started healing.  I asked him if he was still sucking his thumb and he said no.  I asked him why, and he said he didn&#x27;t know, he just hadn&#x27;t.  I think it was the nasty taste of the liquid.  When he first got it he put his thumb in his mouth and then immediately ran to the bathroom, started rinsing his mouth with water, then started brushing his teeth.  Lol! It must have been disgusting. Be that as it may, it worked.  I stopped giving it to him after about a week and he hadn&#x27;t done it for about 2 months.  One day I just happened to catch him with his thumb back in his mouth again and I immediately put it back on.  Once again, he hasn&#x27;t sucked it since and that was just a once time application.</li>
            <li> It tasted awful and got me to stop biting right away, within just a few days. Three weeks later I have beautiful nails that are getting better every day!</li>
            <li> Must reapply every few days.  It has a shinny coat so some boys might not like that.  The smell is horrible but so is the taste.</li>
            <li> Tried this on my 2 years old and  it works!  She sucks her two middle fingers and in two days, she stops.</li>
            <li> This worked just like it said.  My daughter&#x27;s nails grew within two weeks.</li>
            <li> My 3 1/2 year old has always sucked his thumb.  His dentist recommended this and I applied it once - he tried sticking his thumb in his mouth 2 times and it tasted terrible and he stopped.  I never thought I was going to be able to stop him from his thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> I got this product to keep my 4 year old daughter from sucking her fingers. The first time she tasted it, she learned her lesson. But after that she didn&#x27;t care about the taste at all and is continuing to suck her fingers with the polish on. I even tried it myself to see how strong it was and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as strong as I remember products like this when I was a kid, this one is must be deluded</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm!  I would reapply it every day instead of every two days.  The second day it might not be strong enough to keep them from sucking or nail bitting.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been biting her nails for 6 yrs now.  This stopped her in days! Once they get a taste of it, they won&#x27;t put their fingers bear their face again.</li>
            <li> so far its working.  the taste if bad but it doesn&#x27;t burn or hurt.</li>
            <li> My Son is Officially not a nail biter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took about a 2 weeks  and he now has to get his nails trimmed about twice a month !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> works like a charm for my husband. Doesn&#x27;t deter my little one from biting.</li>
            <li> Finally got my two year old to stop sucking on her hand.</li>
            <li> Remarkable product.  My three-year-old sucks her fingers so aggressively that her fingers have persistent wounds.  Prior to using this product, interrupting sucking sessions often created tears and sadness.  We discussed the product with her and put the tiniest dot on one fingernail.  She knows this is to help her not suck and that it will taste bitter/bad, and is extra careful to let it dry, and welcomes the application.  From the moment we applied it, she simply stopped sucking. She did not complain of bad taste, and did not even seem to want to suck any more.  It&#x27;s like the habit just went away with no tears, no bad taste, and no trauma.  She is proud to show how her fingers are healing now.  We have so far not had any problem of her contaminating her food, but have been careful to only apply the tiniest amount of product as far back as possible on the fingernail. Truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> My son just got used to the flavor. If your kid is sensitive to tastes, maybe this will work for you.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s will is stronger than the awful taste of this stuff. It worked at first, and then he didn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product. I have been a professional nail biter since before I can remember, with more cuticle infections then I can count. This stuff tastes absolutely terrible, so it works. :)&lt;br /&gt;I bite my nails, and the skin/cuticle area around my nails, so I ended up having to basically paint the top parts of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, this product deserves five stars because it does the job, at least for me. However, the taste of the nail polish is easily transferred to other things like finger foods (chips etc.). Part of the issue is quite likely that I had to paint the entire front tips of my fingers (most definitely the problem). So for me, finger foods were simply out of the question. I would suggest 2-3 coats of polish. The first couple days were rough, and I constantly had a terrible taste in my mouth, but each day got a little better. Now I can actually see the start of nail growth, so yay for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes disgusting, but suck it up, buy it, stick with it, and eat with a fork.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect. Just apply it every 2-3 days, works great</li>
            <li> We have been trying to get my 7 year old son to stop sucking his fingers for a few years now.  We first tried Thum and he just sucked his fingers anyways.  We tried band aids, tape, gloves, etc......  all to no avail.  After some more searching on the web I came across Mavala Stop and read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  As soon as it was delivered I put it on his fingers.  He licked his fingers and true to form he shrugged it off like &amp;#34;No big deal&amp;#34;  He ended up playing in the water with friends about an hour later and it came off.  He was sucking his fingers when laying on the couch watching a movie, so I put more on.  He has not put his fingers in his mouth since that first night!!!!!  I only used it for a week.  Woohoo!!! Thank you Mavala Stop!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*He did complain that it got on the food that he ate with his fingers.  But, it didn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal.</li>
            <li> Used this to help kick my daughters habit of thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb immediately! Wish I&#x27;d have tried this sooner!! I just swiped the polish along the bottom of her thumbnail (along her cuticle) every other day for about 3 weeks. I didn&#x27;t cover her whole nail because I didn&#x27;t want her to accidentally get it in her mouth while eating. Worked like a charm!! I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone trying to break a thumb sucking or nail biting habit.</li>
            <li> I was excited about the number of 5s this product received.  I tested it before applying it to my thumb sucking son.  It tasted bad- enough to make me pull my finger from my mouth.  I was very optimistic that it would work.  The first time my son put his thumb in his mouth after application, he immediately pulled his thumb out, making a horrible face.  I was so excited! Then the next morning while driving to daycare, I saw my son sucking his thumb. At the first stop light I got to- I reached back and sucked his thumb- it still tasted bitter.  By the end of the day- the bitter taste on his finger was gone.  My son had sucked it off.  Giving this product two stars, because I think it would work on adults who want to break a bad habit- but doesn&#x27;t do any good for a toddler who is adicted to his thumb. Unfortunately for me- I won&#x27;t need this product because I don&#x27;t suck my thumb or bite my nails.</li>
            <li> Ok it works but the whole experience is probably not worth it. I made the mistake to put it on my son&#x27;s nails and he had a stomach ache for a whole week during school and at home because of it. From what I know, the ingredients are not dangerous, but he literally had a horrible week because of it. I recommend using it for a few days and use nail polish remover to take it off and then have a discussion about bad habits with your child (unless it is yourself, then have a discussion with yourself). My child quickly learned from it but it came with tears and his school teacher had a stressful week.</li>
            <li> As intended, this product has finally brought an end to my lifelong nail biting habit. Shortly after my very first application, my mind wandered and I made the horrible mistake of putting my finger into my mouth to bite my nail as per usual. The taste of Mavala Stop is absolutely horrific and is easily one of the most vile things I have ever tasted. Bitter, repulsive, and lingering are words that can be used to describe this product if it manages to reach your mouth. It only took a few days of this for me to gain an awareness of my nail biting and this awareness has enabled me to stop biting my nails. I have stopped myself numerous times raising my fingers to my mouth, haunted by the memories of previous encounters with Mavala Stop in my mouth and on my lips. Did I mention the taste of this product lingers? It will terrorize your taste buds for at least 20 minutes and is nearly impossible to get the taste out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cook frequently, make sure to wear gloves at all times when using Mavala Stop! I have ruined a couple of meals by forgetting that I had applied this product to my nails and the entire dish was ruined. This stuff is extremely potent and will easily taint food if prepared with bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I had the willpower to stop biting my nails without the aid of a horrible tasting product but I don&#x27;t so this product was a last resort for me. After a month of using Mavala Stop, I have been cured of my nail biting habit. I only hope that I never relapse and never have to use this product again.</li>
            <li> Worked on the first try with my 6 year old who constantly had her fingers in her mouth and bit her nails. It&#x27;s been almost two months and she&#x27;s doing great. Haven&#x27;t even had to reapply it after the first week. I&#x27;m using it for myself too for nail biting. As long as I keep reapplying every few days, it works for a 40 year old mom too!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I wish we had tried this years ago. We got this product last year because our 8 year old was still sucking his thumb-almost ALL the time!  This broke the habit within a couple of weeks. He complained about putting the product on his thumb, but once he tasted the product on his thumb he would keep it out of his mouth.</li>
            <li> My first order for this was in July 2014 and my second order in December 2014.  I have used this on my daughter who was 4 to help her learn to not suck her fingers.  It&#x27;s August 2015 now and she will be 6 years old soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first 2 months I applied this to all her fingernails 4 times per week, like clockwork.  I told her the &amp;#34;fingernail polish&amp;#34; was to help her nails grow so that she wouldn&#x27;t complain.  I have used other over the counter, well-known, thumb sucking products and they didn&#x27;t prevent my daughter from putting her fingers in her mouth at all.  I was very surprised and happy to see her take her fingers out, spit, and yell &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; after she put her fingers in her mouth with the Mavala Stop on them.  From then on she would spit all over her shirt after putting them in her mouth for a second.  This in fact did help my daughter to think about it before she put her fingers in her mouth.  She does not like the taste at all, and neither do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months I decreased the application to 1 - 2 times per week.  I want this to work since my daughter has in fact altered the shape of her mouth and will need extensive dental work.  After 6 months I was still applying it one time per week.  She was rarely putting her fingers in her mouth anymore so I was forgetting to apply the Mavala to her fingers as often after 7 months had gone by.  I was applying them about every 2 or 3 weeks and would do so when I saw her putting her fingers in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 13 months now.  It&#x27;s very rare that she puts her fingers in her mouth and when I do, I put Mavala on her nails.  I believe that after another year of applying this, she will be able to stop.  This process is going to take time because it is a self-soothing habit and she is young.  I am very pleased with the outcome so far with using Mavala on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;tastes gross&lt;br /&gt;my daughter does not like it at all and neither do I&lt;br /&gt;affordable&lt;br /&gt;arrives in a timely manner&lt;br /&gt;seeing results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t find it at the local stores so I gave it 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;comes in a tiny bottlearrives in a timely manner&lt;br /&gt;seeing results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t find it at the local stores so I gave it 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;comes in a tiny bottle</li>
            <li> Did not make her stop but trying it one more week</li>
            <li> I think it works great. My son isn&#x27;t biting his nail.and my other son doesn&#x27;t sick his thumb. However I&#x27;m still going to continue using it.so it had been 3 weeks. As lo of progress has been made. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It helps my husband stop biting.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This product has really changed my son&#x27;s feelings about biting his nails.  The taste as he describes is horrible.  So much so, that he won&#x27;t put his hands near his mouth.</li>
            <li> This product totally worked.  I tried others with no avail. This is the only thing that worked. The results were instant from the first application.  Only had to apply about 3-4 times and my son&#x27;s urge to bite nails was gone.</li>
            <li> i was biting my nails all the time since i was a little girl, now that I used this my nails are long and pretty. i dont even have an urge to put my fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking from my son from day 1 of putting this on!!!!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it, this stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, our daugther stoped biting her nails within like couple of days, works great as intended, very happy at the end..</li>
            <li> My daughter had sucked her thumb since birth. She refused a pacifier &amp; went for her thumb from day 1. At 3 years old she would still suck her thumb raw. We tried everything, the sour stuff (she loved the taste!) the hot stuff, bitter stuff, even a device that was like wearing a thumb-only glove! Nothing worked and at 3 years old, she was starting to affect her bite. We heard about STOP on-line and gave it a try. I didn&#x27;t want to give it to my child without knowing exactly what she was in for, so I put a little on my nail, let it dry &amp; put it in my mouth. WHOA! The taste was a combination of burning rubber and rotting fish! And boy did it linger. We put this on her thumb nail and a few hours later we were driving in the car. Her thumb went in her mouth, came right back out, and she started crying for a drink to get the taste out. Remembering how bad it tasted, I pulled over at a gas station for some juice. THAT WAS THE LAST TIME HER THUMB EVER WENT IN HER MOUTH!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. My only warning/concern is if your kids are messy eaters &amp; tend to eat all their food with their hands, the taste might get into their food.</li>
            <li> This nail polish tasts so nasty that it really works. What else could we have wished for. It does make our girl stop sucking the thumb as soon as it is applied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my three year old. It didn&#x27;t phase her. She just sucked it off. I painted one of my nails, and the stuff tastes awful. I think there&#x27;s just something wrong with my child.</li>
            <li> I painted this on my son&#x27;s fingers 24 hours ago and it is already stopping his bad habit of chewing his nails.</li>
            <li> First let me say, do not let the rating of 2 sway you completely. The box does state that toddlers may find the bitter taste appealing because of under developed taste buds. However, we have not found this product very helpful. In fact she has probably scaled back about 5%- if that. There is not very much of a difference and the bitter taste does not seem to bother her. She will be 3 in the winter, so perhaps she isn&#x27;t old enough for the product yet.</li>
            <li> Working so far on my 3 yo.</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic meal butter for my entire life, and have managed stop many times for months at a time. This time I have not managed to stop for two years and I&#x27;m tired of how short and stubby my fingers look without my long pretty nails. This product does help but it fades after one day and must be replied sometimes I tend to forget will go back to my habit. Also, this sucks if you eat a lot of finger food or even if you get some sort of pasta sauce or ketchup on your finger and instinctively lick it off. In that sense it is Satanic but it does the job well and is seriously helping.</li>
            <li> Only thing that has helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb. Works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my 4 year old. She was a thumb sucker and also when board or nervous she would grind her teeth into her nail beds to the point where it caused enough trauma that her fingernail would fall off. I talked to her before I bought it and she wanted me to buy it to help her so I did and by day 2 she wasn&#x27;t putting her fingers in her mouth. I have slacked off a bit at putting in on every 2 days but it is still working and her nails are starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my almost 3 year old daughter to finally stop sucking her thumb. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It works for my 8 yr old. Fast to apply, he puts it on willingly by himself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago because I chronically bite my nails. Great news, I haven&#x27;t bitten since I bought it! It works great the first two weeks. Then the bitter taste becomes more tolerable, but by that point you longer desire to bite your nails. At least, that&#x27;s how it worked for me.</li>
            <li> My child is 8. I tried so many other products with 0 success.  This worked right away. It was very unpleasant but did not make her gag or leave a unpleasant taste for so long it interfered with her  drinking or eating. I strongly suggest it for children struggling with giving up thumb sucking!!</li>
            <li> Great Item .. Definitely helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Dream come true solution for our almost 5 year old son who was sucking his thumb still at bedtime or for comfort occasionally on couch. We had been trying to get him to stop and he was very frustrated because he could not ultimately stop. We had tried socks on his hands and bribery and threats of dental interventions, you name it. We explained how this worked and told him it was being ordered. We told him it would help his thumb to learn how to stay out of his mouth. We first applied before nap time, both thumbs. He did not like taste and after some complaining and begging, he fell asleep after 30 minutes or so with no thumb. Same at night probably more complaining.  Next day was better with some complaining. It took 2 days and he was not trying to put thumb in mouth. We kept applying for week or so, with zero thumb in mouth. Such a relief that this habit is kicked.</li>
            <li> Worked well while we used it. Can&#x27;t blame the seller for us either losing it or, more likely, my daughter disposing of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same as Bite Free, tastes pretty bad when you put it on but really doesn&#x27;t cure the problem.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!! We used it one day and night with my daughter that&#x27;s 3 1/2yr old. It was a tough day with several meltdowns and crying but it worked!!! She would cry saying her thumb tasted bad. We reapplied it after 2 days and she told me that her thumb tasted bad. It&#x27;s been a week and no more thumb sucking! We did try it one when she was younger (2yrs old) and she couldn&#x27;t taste it. So we waited till her taste buds matured. So glad we tried again. Bye, bye thumb and over bite.</li>
            <li> used it for my 2 year old to stop sucking thumb, ended up just letting him suck it because he wouldnt stop crying to sleep.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old was biting his nails till the bled and I was so worried about him getting an infection. The thumb product wasn&#x27;t working at all. After he washed his hand the taste would be gone. I tried This product on my husband first and he could still taste the polish a few days after! I thought I was hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the taste was so bad the first night I put it on my son he started to gag. That night was the only time we had an issue. Also sometimes he would get the taste when eating his snack and have the &amp;#34;yuckys&amp;#34;. After a month of putting it on his fingers twice a week, he hasn&#x27;t bit his nails sense. I was amazed!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Definitely stopped my daughter from sucking her thumb 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> After 7 long years of trying to break my son this stuff sure worked! It is well worth the money! I wish I had know about it earlier!! I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> This tastes absolutely terrible. It lasts for about four days. The only thing that has helped me quit biting my nails is keeping them painted with a color and clear coat so I don&#x27;t bite them. Unfortunately this did not work for me to stop biting my nails completely and the price is pretty steep for the product.</li>
            <li> This works for me every time, but you have to be willing to quit. My only qualm is that the polish comes off very very easily after a day or two so applying over and over is necessary.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this enough stars.  My nearly 5 year old daughter has been sucking her middle and ring fingers of her right hand since she was born.  We tried bribing.  We tried stickers.  We tried keeping a chart.  We tried a different brand of stuff you paint on the nails and she would just smile, look at me, and suck those fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this Mavala Stop and figured why not; this was basically the last resort before getting a finger guard dealy for $70 that she would have to wear 24/7 since both the doctor and dentist said she HAD to stop by the time she was 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as we got the package, I explained what it was and painted it on the BOTTOM half only of each finger.  I didn&#x27;t want her to just start sucking OTHER fingers so I got them all covered.  I only did the bottom half of each nail so that when she was eating finger foods she didn&#x27;t accidentally get it in her mouth (I did this based on other user reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 hours after the first application, she was eating some Cheetos and stuck a finger in her mouth to get the cheese off.  She started freaking out so badly I thought she had bit her tongue.  Nope, she was upset because it tasted so bad.  She has NEVER stuck her fingers in her mouth again!  TOTALLY STOPPED after ONE application!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a couple of weeks now and I refresh it about once a week just as a reminder.  SO RELIEVED this worked. I only wish I would have done it when she was 4 and not 5; it probably would have saved me a few lectures from the dentist and a few doctor trips for her.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is 6 and was sucking her thumb at night.  We tried various things to get her to stop and she often said she wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied this one time and that&#x27;s all it took the break the habit.  We were amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put it off since we avoid chemicals/plastic/etc, but in hindsight, for this case we should have used this much earlier.  We could prevented a lot of movement of her teeth.</li>
            <li> Used it on our 2 and a half year old whos finger sucking was ferocious; after a couple of rough nights, she stopped sucking her fingers completely after about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. MY daughter stopping sucking her thumb in 3 days!  This stuff tastes horrible and kept her from sucking her thumb. It really works!</li>
            <li> We tried everything to get my 3 year old grandson to stop sucking his finger. His dentist told us about Mavala. The first 2 days we thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, he still put his finger in his mouth, however it wasn&#x27;t as much as he normally did. By the third day we noticed it was less and by the forth day he was playing with toys more, and sucked his finger less. Now three weeks later, he hasn&#x27;t put his finger in his mouth at all. He plays more and is actually talking better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any con&#x27;s about this product. We are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It works just as described.</li>
            <li> I hate it in the sense of the taste. It&#x27;s so foul that i become keen on my actions because any slight touch to the mouth with the polish,  would unleash the semen of demons.  When I&#x27;m experiencing the taste, I get so angry at myself for buying this product because it&#x27;s just THAT nasty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely plan on polishing some forks and spoons with this product and use it as an April Fool&#x27;s joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product goes way beyond expected.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is a menace to nail biters, thumb suckers, and the poor sucker who accidentally gets a little too aggressive with their burrito. This weapons-grade liquid evil goes on nice and clear, and only with a close inspection would anyone be able to tell that your fingernails are especially shiny. The real dark magic happens when you try to bit a nail coated in this transparent horror juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I tried it, I guess I stirred while I was sleeping and bit my thumbnail or something (that&#x27;s a thing, right?). I awoke sharply to the taste of a thousand exploding batteries in my mouth. It was horrifying. I rose, went to the bathroom, rinsed with water, brushed my teeth, brushed my tongue, all to no avail. This stuff is BIT-TER, and when it lands, it stays. I made it back to bed, and hours later when I awoke again for the day, the sharpness of the great evil that is contained in this bottle remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 100% sure this will help you stop biting your nails or sucking your thumb or putting your fingers in your mouth while you eat or whatever it is you do. When you sign up with Mavala Stop, you sign a pact with the darkness - it works, but there is a terrible, terrible price to pay if you misstep.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use it every day! I even put it on my cuticles. My nails look so much better, but my poor fiance taste it on my lips if I even put a finger in my mouth! Keeps me from doing it even more. Just started to apply strengthener on my nail and then this! Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I use this on my six-year-old daughter. I had tried everything, and this is the only one that actually works.  The thing is, you must remember to reapply it every few days, or else she&#x27;ll go back to sucking her index finger.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t faze my daughter one bit.  Gave it to a friend whose daughter had been sucking her thumb for years and her daughter stopped the habit after one application.  She thought it was amazing.  A friend who who bites his nails tried my daughter&#x27;s and he was afraid to put his hand near his mouth.  I bought him a bottle and he never picked it up.  I guess he loves biting his nails.  Gave his bottle to the friend I mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson who Is four and he bites his nails and sucks his finger he bit right through it and liked it. It had a bitter after taste but it didn&#x27;t bother him at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money. They can&#x27;t return it but they did refund the money due to it&#x27;s a chemical an liquid.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Mavala after reading the reviews. I took other parents&#x27; advice and I didn&#x27;t paint the entire thumb nail. I put it on the cuticle of my almost 3 yr old&#x27;s thumb who had been sucking his thumb more than ever. After the first taste of it he wanted to have something to drink to wash it down for about 10 minutes. He has not put his thumb in his mouth one more time since! It has been a week now and a couple of times he asked about putting his thumb in his mouth and we told him that it would taste yucky and he took our word for it without a fuss. The hardest part for him was learning to fall asleep but he quickly adjusted. Overall we were shocked at how quickly and easily it has put a stop to the thumbsucking!</li>
            <li> Stops finger sucking almost immediately.  Had a really stubborn finger sucker.  We could not break the bedtime habit until we started using this.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this to help me, and my 8-year-old daughter, stop biting our nails. It works great, tastes horrible. Within a week I feel less inclined to put my fingers in my mouth, and my nails are longer and stronger than I ever remember them. Another week or so and I think the behavior change will be essentially permanent. Note: needs to be reapplied every 4-5 days, pretty much just like nail polish.</li>
            <li> This worked immediately for my 7 year old son.  My 2 year old was LITERALLY throwing up but keeping his fingers in his mouth (lacked the mental connection).  I&#x27;m going to try again with the 2 year old in 6 months when he&#x27;s 3 (it&#x27;s recommended for 3+ year olds).  It tastes like licking the inside of a balloon- not good- so it&#x27;s effective.  Make sure you don&#x27;t use this right before feeding your child finger foods or anything that will give them reason to lick their fingers... unless you want them to stop liking that food.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews that suggest adding tabasco sauce to it if it stops working.  I will try that with my 2 year old IF it doesn&#x27;t work &#x27;as is&#x27; when he&#x27;s older.  If you have a child that constantly puts fingers in mouth, then you&#x27;ll have to reapply it once every 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> As a general dentist, I usually recommend an oral, cemented appliance be placed in the mouth for up to three months to stop a finger or thumb habit. When my nearly 5 yr old son showed no progress with cessation, a friend recommended I try this product. It is without question the worst tasting product I&#x27;ve ever put in my mouth! Lasts for up to 3 days with one application. Does NOT wash off. My son stopped after only ONE application. Easily saves $300-$400 that one would normally pay for a habit appliance from the dentist or orthodontist. I now recommend this to all of my patients with a finger or thumb habit to prevent the malformation of the jaws and teeth that occur with the habit. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.  My son, who is nine, was a constant nail biter, and the skin around the nail.  Before this product, he had his fingers in his mouth 60% of the day.  The product tastes like a bitter nail polish, but the taste lasts on the nail almost all day.  I would put the product on his nails twice daily.  The product broke him of his habit of wanting to bite by making him aware of the times he put his fingers to his mouth.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by our child&#x27;s dentist. Works well although it does come off so multiple applications may be needed. Does seem to be bitter enough to deter finger sucking though. Almost getting to the point after a month&#x27;s use where just the threat of applying it keeps my girls from finger-sucking.</li>
            <li> it works good. kept me away from biting my nails. but sometimes when i ate chips i accidently tasted the product on my finger nails and it killed the food&#x27;s taste.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 years old and has been sucking her two fingers since TWO DAYS OLD! This was the hardest thing to break her of. I tried everything but Mavala Stop worked, THE SAME DAY!! Her finger sucking was beginning to affect the growth of her teeth. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was beside myself with anxiety over how to stop my little one from thumb sucking! I had heard of this product before, and finally decided it was time just before my daughter turned 3. I&#x27;m glad I waited - it appears it is most effective on kids 3 and older as their taste buds are not fully developed before then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter was quiet upset the first time we tried this on her thumbs only. It really is foul tasting and she would suck her thumb to help her fall asleep. We told her it was necessary to heal the boo-boos on her thumb. If your child has the same night time habit, try this for the first few times during the day to prevent the meltdown at bedtime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, all it took was the first two times and she has not even looked at her thumbs the same way since!  My husband and I ecstatic to have found the cure and this will have saved us a lot of anxiety and money in dental bills in the long run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter now asks for the medicine for her boo-boo on her thumb, but avoids tasting her thumb even if there happens to be chocolate on it :-)</li>
            <li> This product was incredible. Not only did it stop me immediately from biting my nails, but my two year old also stopped his thumb sucking habit. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied several times a day and works instantly. L-O-V-E this product!!!</li>
            <li> We were hesitant to use this product on our 4 yr old son, but his thumb sucking was getting worse.  We used Mavala in conjunction with the Thumbuster guard [[ASIN:B0016ZX7AI Stop Thumb Sucking, Thumbusters, Blue]]...and it was a winning combination!  The guard was a visual reminder of what was underneath...yucky stuff.</li>
            <li> I sent this product (Mavala Stop)[[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 Mavala Stop, 0.3-Fluid Ounce]]to my daughter for the grandchildren.  She reports almost immediate success.  We are extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my 3 year old. He stopped sucking his thumb in less then a week! The first few nights he still would suck his thumb after he was already asleep, but eventually the bitter taste would wake him up &amp; he would fall back to sleep without putting it back in his mouth.</li>
            <li> this stopped my son from bitting his nails in about 2 weeks and he has never put his fingers back in his mouth</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly to help my 13 year old teen stop biting her nails, I applied it every 2-3 days, now she&#x27;s loosing the bad habit, it has been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I put it over my nail polish (it didn&#x27;t affect the look at all) and then a top coat. It works perfect but be aware of eating any finger foods! The taste is really nasty and if you touch your lips it really gets you!</li>
            <li> I (36 years old) was still biting my nails and my 3 year old daughter was sucking her thumb. After using this product for just one week, I have stopped biting and my daughter has mostly stopped (without putting on the solution). The stuff lasts days, especially on an adult (I think baths vs. showers shorten the effective life in children). The only issue is that you have to be very careful with eating and hand-held foods. I also got hit several times while flossing my teeth. I would recommend the product for either habit. BTW, I am a guy and it does have a sheen to it, but not that noticeable. I only applied it to the ends of my nails, where I was biting, so it did not look like I was wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li> My mother used this on me and I used it on my daughter.  Just works. No fuss.  Best one out there.</li>
            <li> After trying the \\&quot;Thum Thumb\\&quot; brand from the local drugstore to no avail. I decided to purchase this and give it a try. My son will be 3 in a few more months and has sucked 2 of his fingers forever. The habit is affecting his teeth, and our doctor unbelievably suggested putting duct tape on them! Which I was not about to do. After I received this in the mail I applied it to myself to test it out. It is nasty, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn or anything like that, just leaves you with a nasty taste in your month for a few seconds. I put it on my son the next day, just on the 2 fingers he sucks, I told him it was medicine for his nails (which look ragged and thin because of all the sucking!) I told him it didn&#x27;t taste good so he should try to keep his fingers out of his mouth. He didn&#x27;t mess with it at all or try sucking until nap time rolled around. He just stuck his fingers in his mouth without thinking, and then out they came! He said \\&quot;mommy medicine doesn&#x27;t taste good\\&quot; he tried to spit the bad taste onto his pillow, but the flavor was gone by then and he settled down for sleep with out any crying or finger attention at all! I was afraid he would cry or not be able to put himself to sleep with out his fingers, but he did fine! He played on his bed a bit longer before falling asleep, but never cried, and never tried putting his fingers back in his mouth. At night time he fell asleep quickly without even \\&quot;testing\\&quot; if the fingers still tasted bad. The next day at nap he asked if there was still medicine on his hand, I said there was, and it didn&#x27;t taste good, so he should try not to put them in his mouth. He must have believed me, because again he just went to sleep without them! I reapplied every couple of days for 2 weeks and he never even asks about it or trys to use his fingers anymore. Habit forgotten without a struggle! Defiantly recommend! Keep in mind though if your child eats with his hand he will get a bad taste in his his mouth while using this. Never affected my son since he sucked his middle and ring finger, which he doesnt use to eat. However it got me a couple times that first day when I licked my fingers while preparing dinner, so becareful and encourge the use of silverware while using.my son since he sucked his middle and ring finger, which he doesnt use to eat. However it got me a couple times that first day when I licked my fingers while preparing dinner, so becareful and encourge the use of silverware while using.</li>
            <li> Been biting for 15 years and now i kicked the habit. Hopefully I don&#x27;t relapse. But so far so good. No compaints.</li>
            <li> I have a thumb sucker who also chews her nails and toe nails. YES NASTY! HAHA! Her dentist reccomended this product and its a wonder!!!!!! Just might save us having to get her braces! Her baby teeth are starting to fall out so we had to do soemthing. We have tried everything else. So glad we got this!!! She can not stand the taste and was nearly in tears the first time she tried to suck her thumb, now she would just make a funny face. I havnt seen her suck her thumb in over a week!!!</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter is seven years old.  Both of us really wanted her to stop biting her nails.  I have daughters who are much older and knew if she didn&#x27;t stop now, she never would.  I talked to her about a product that I could paint on her nails to help her stop biting them, she kept asking when I would buy it.  I searched and found this product, we received it in the mail and within a week she had stopped biting her nails.  She said \\&quot;look at my nails and mommy are you proud of me?\\&quot;.  I am very proud of her and she hasn&#x27;t taken one bite of her nails in weeks.  It really helped her stop and was much easier than either of us could imagine.</li>
            <li> I have an teenage nail mauler- cured! It broke her of the habit so fast, one taste and that was it!</li>
            <li> My son is a thumb sucker since first days. I&#x27;ve started to use Mavala during the night. In the first nights he was awaking every time he put the thumb in the mouth complaining the taste. But, after some nights he stopped to complain after put the finger in the mouth. But, during the day the Mavala is 100% effective. No more thumb sucking during the day. But, we need to have a hard psychological support during the process</li>
            <li> Took my daughter less than a week of having this on her thumb to stop. I wish I had known about this sooner!!  I painted it on while she slept.</li>
            <li> My 5-yr-old was an incessant thumb sucker. After trying a Mavala knock-off (she sucked it off and kept sucking), we ending up having the dentist place a &amp;#34;thumb sucking appliance&amp;#34; in the top of her mouth (to the tune of $300).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work. My daughter continued sucking her thumb, right through the appliance placed on the roof of her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we had the appliance removed and ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overnight, the thumb sucking stopped. We are on day five of &amp;#34;sans thumb.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s awesome. My daughter is so proud of herself. We apply a coat every night and will continue to do so for the next several weeks until we know the habit is broken for good.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 4 year old daughter who wanted to stop sucking her thumb. It stopped her day time habit right away, But she thinks it&#x27;s worth the horrible taste to suck it off at night. It really is a horribly bitter, yucky, burning sensation of a taste that lingers and lingers.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like the taste but she still would &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; thru it. Finally, using the pink thumb covers did the trick. It was tough breaking the habit.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucked her thumb since infancy. I warned her that her fingers would start tasting yucky if she continued. We started mommy manicure days. A couple weeks later, I put this very, very lightly (like small drop) on top of the fingernail paint. She didn&#x27;t notice that I did this. After an hour or so, she came to me telling me her tongue felt funny. She started crying about how nasty it was and I explained that it must be the yucky fingers since she was sucking her thumb. This only happened twice before she stopped, altogether. I warn her when I find her fingers in her mouth that they might taste bad again and she stops right away. This stuff is awesome for this age, at least!</li>
            <li> My daughter turned 5 years old, over the summer, and has been sucking her thumb since she was an infant. I had been encouraging her to stop, but it was too hard for her to break the habit on her own. After receiving this product, I had a conversation with my daughter. She said she wanted to stop sucking her thumb. We also set a goal. If she made it for one whole week, without sucking her thumb, she would get to pick out a toy! That was enough motivation, coupled with the Mavala product, to help her break the habit! She stopped that first day, and hasn&#x27;t done it since! It&#x27;s been almost two weeks now. I am SO thankful for this product and have already given it to some friends. I definitely recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 4-year-old so refuses to stop sucking on his index finger.  I applied it on his finger and it didn&#x27;t bother him at all.  I kept applying it hoping that eventually I would start seeing results but nope,  I didn&#x27;t.  I ended up sawing a glove to one of my son&#x27;s long sleeve shirts and that finally helped break the habit.</li>
            <li> I have found a worse tasting product that works better for me.  That is the Hoof brand of the stop nail biting.  It has a stronger taste.</li>
            <li> It works..... I have been reading the reviews and once I had put this product on my nails I didn&#x27;t dare to even do a test taste. But unfortunately when I was reading my book I had managed to slip my finger in to my mouth and gnaw on it not even a split second after I did, I ran downstairs and directly into the kitchen for some water. I have rated this a five star because it is my first day but I can assume even months from now I will not get used to that taste.</li>
            <li> It took only 4 applications and about one week to completely stop my 7 year old from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> After biting my nails for 45 years, this finally stopped me.  It stays on longer and taste worse than other drops.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It worked essentially immediately for our child.  I think the kid needs to want to stop, but if they do - this is absolutely the tool to do that.</li>
            <li> I Bought this product for my son who was still sucking his thumb at 10 years old,I tried other products which really did not help, after just 2 application I am pleased to say he has stop the thumb sucking,with such a quick and positive results I have recommended it to other friends who are experiencing similar problem with their child.</li>
            <li> it looks like regular clear nail polish.  Taste like crap..  The taste will stay in your mouth.  You will never want to chew your fingernails again.</li>
            <li> Goes on like nail polish, works great for nail biting but, can&#x27;t eat finger food while you have this product on your nails.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has been sucking her thumb since she was 3 months old. We have tried different hot and nasty tasting things on her thumb that she would just wipe off, we tried bandaids that she would take off and we tried reminders, treats etc. She had become so bad, her thumb was starting to crack and bleed and she had gone from sucking it when sleepy to sucking it 24/7. We tried this and within the first week, it had dramatically stopped. She said it taste horrible, we did have to put it on her thumb everyday for the first week but after she realized the taste was so horrible and was there to stay, she stopped. Now, we use it every few days or if we see her stick it in her mouth which is seldom. It has been about 4 weeks now. This stuff worked wonders for us!</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is strong, in a good way! Been struggling with nail biting for a long time. I used to use stuff call \\&quot;No Bite\\&quot; which is as good, but can&#x27;t find anymore and started biting again. I tried the Orly nail biting product and you can barely taste that stuff, even shortly after applying. This Mavala Stop is quite the opposite. I started using this a few days ago and haven&#x27;t even thought of biting my nails (which is a big accomplishment for a nail biter). It goes on clear (maybe a little too clear and shiny for my male fingertips, but small complaint) and stays on strong. Even after a full day of washing hands and working out then showering it was still on there good. The second this stuff touches your mouth you instinctively want to spit it out, completely stopping the urge to bite nails, and reminding you if you do. Still in the early stage of breaking my habit but so far am amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Within days my child was no longer sucking his thumb.  The product last about two days before needing to be reapplied, which is what is suggested on the packaging.  We&#x27;ve had tons of people ask about Mavala Stop and have recommended it to everyone who asks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 43 year old husband. He stopped biting his nails immediately because he hates the taste so much. I applied it once a month ago and he can still taste it! His nails used to be stubs but now they are a normal mens length and he will be cutting them for the first time that he could remember in his life. The only complaint that he has is that for the first couple of weeks he could taste it on his food too when he picked it up. I told him that its a good weight loss plan for people too then. :)</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old who sucks his first two fingers and I was really hoping this product worked. But like other reviewers, at first he did not care for the taste, but after a day, the taste did not bother him. I put it on several times and he still continued. I am at a loss right now and really do not know what else I can do. I have tried Thum, and that too did not work (sigh).</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is a chronic thumb sucker. I am very pleased with the results and her progress, this product is amazing! Thank you</li>
            <li> It works.  I can&#x27;t remember when my nails were this long.  The bitter taste keeps my fingers out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> My daughter (4 yrs.) has sucked her thumb since before she was even born!  At her last dentist appointment the dentist said she was going to loose her top and bottom front teeth because of the pressure she was putting on the teeth while sucking.  When I asked the dentist how I should get her to stop sucking her thumb the dentist told me there was nothing I could do until my daughter was ready.  When I asked my 4 yr old if she wanted to stop sucking her thumb she told me she loved her thumb and did not want to stop.  I ordered the product and told her what was coming.  We also gave her an incentive to stop sucking her thumb ( a new bike!)  From the first night we put the product on her thumb it worked!  That night she got up several times to get a drink because of the taste in her mouth, but after that we have not had any more thumb sucking!  I put it on the very tip of her fingernail the first night but after that I painted her whole nail. My daughter is very proud of herself and talks about being such a big girl now that she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to help their child stop sucking their thumb!</li>
            <li> Works great. My son is 5 years old. I put on this thumb nightly (after he fell asleep) for 4 weeks. Have moved to every other night. But notice his thumbs slips back in if I don&#x27;t stick to the every other night routine.</li>
            <li> Our 4-year-old was a MAJOR thumb-sucker, she did it all throughout the day as well as at night. I tried rewards, sticker charts, etc. because I was trying to avoid going a &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; route, but none of that worked. So finally, I was trying to decide between Mavala and a thumb guard (I knew people who had had success with each one), and Mavala was much cheaper so I decided to try it first. I am SO GLAD I did because the first day, after lots of talk about being such a big girl, a fun reward if she stopped, etc. I put it on her favorite thumb.... so she sucked her other thumb. I put it on her other thumb, then she started sucking her pointer finger... put it on that finger, and so on, until she had it on all 10 fingers (she even tried sucking her baby brother&#x27;s thumb once!) I am really glad I used Mavala instead of a thumb guard because in hindsight, if I&#x27;d gotten a thumb guard, she would&#x27;ve just sucked her other fingers! Also, since she is 4 and not younger, I think the Mavala was nice because no one else was aware of it (whereas, a thumb guard, her friends would&#x27;ve noticed and asked about it, and I&#x27;m not sure she would have done as well emotionally with it -- because it was very emotional for her to give it up --- if it had been so public). I applied it once every 2 days, and am STILL applying it almost 7 weeks later because if it comes off and she is really tired and watching tv, riding in the car, etc. she will try to suck whichever finger doesn&#x27;t have any. So this has not been a really quick-fix, like 3 days and we&#x27;re done, it&#x27;s an ongoing process, but I have been very pleased with the result. It was MUCH less emotionally taxing for me than when I was reminding her 50 times a day, offering stickers, etc. This was simpler and I didn&#x27;t have to nag and stay on top of it, other than applying it every other day. I would HIGHLY recommend this!! And I will use it with my son, who is only 1 year old and is a finger-sucker, when he is older (it says ages 3 and up).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t bring too much effect on my kid. Still biting nails despite its bitterness.</li>
            <li> I wish I had had this 15 years ago. I&#x27;ve been struggling with biting my nails my entire life. This ended it in less than a week. MUST buy!</li>
            <li> Great bitter, bitter taste which definitely stops my nervous nail nibbling habit.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My son (9) who chews his fingernails doesn&#x27;t touch them when the Mavala is freshly applied (usually lasts 1 to 2 days).  Its really important to keep reapplying the solution to curb the habit.</li>
            <li> It did not work for my granddaughter.  But I have heard it worked for others.</li>
            <li> it helped my son quit sucking his thumb but now he sucks his finger haha</li>
            <li> Want to stop biting your nails? Try this product! I finally have long, beautiful nails after biting mine to the nub for over 40 years! Thank you Mavala Stop!!</li>
            <li> My daughter is 5, and has been biting her nails for several months. I have tried showing her pictures of infected nails, and telling her how sick she can get from continuing to bite, but that didn&#x27;t really work for her. Nor did trying to talk very calmly with her about stopping, and how she can come talk to me if she ever feels like she needs to bite. But when I found this, I decided to give it a try. I also bought the Berenstain Bears book about the bad habit of nail biting, and told her that with this book and this &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; we could finally help her stop biting her nails. And it IS working! This stuff really does taste horrible, and it smells like really strong nail polish remover. It does last a couple days, even after baths and handwashing. As long I keep applying it every few days or so, she does a fantastic job of not biting her nails, so they are finally starting to grow out a little! I am so happy that I found this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product for my 3 year old niece who has suddenly started sucking her thumb out of nowhere. I&#x27;m not sure why she started doing it but we are trying to get her to stop. I only put a small bit on her thumb to begin with, as many people have said it caused their kids to get sick. The fist time she put her thumb in her mouth all she said was her mouth was &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; and she didn&#x27;t like it, but she continued to put her thumbs in her mouth. Since then when I do she her suck her thumb and apply this polish, I coat her whole thumb. She says she doesn&#x27;t want me to do it, and she will even put her thumb in her mouth after I&#x27;ve applied it. I would say it&#x27;s stopped her somewhat, and she is aware that when I put it on she shouldn&#x27;t put her thumbs in her mouth but she hasn&#x27;t stopped and I don&#x27;t see this making her completely stop.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so awful. It really does the job. I only had to put it on my nails twice, and i haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since.</li>
            <li> awesome product my daughters nails are finally growing out and she&#x27;s loving it ,,,she used to chew her nails until they bled ...wonderful product would buy again and refer it to anyone</li>
            <li> This helped my son finally stop sucking his thumb</li>
            <li> I used this for just a few weeks and it helped me stop biting at my fingernails. I noticed I bit at them when not paying attention. Well, this disgusting stuff quickly brought it to my attention!</li>
            <li> When the dentist told my daughter that she needed to stop sucking her thumb we got serious about trying to encourage her to stop. To my surprise, this is the only product that worked.  We tried a thumb guard- she could pull it off.  We tried rewards- but they don&#x27;t work if she sucks her thumb while sleeping.  The first night was hard.  She cried and begged me to take it off.  The bitter taste was so strong that she could not stand to put her thumb in her mouth.  She fell asleep without sucking her thumb and the next night was no problem at all!  We kept the polish on for 2 weeks but after 3-4 days the habit was broken!  Great product!  I am so happy it was easy!</li>
            <li> The product arrived timely and the packaging is wonderful. I&#x27;ve used Mavala Stop since I received it and although it hasn&#x27;t completely prevented my granddaughter from sucking her two fingers, she is aware that she will receive the &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; on her fingers if she places them in her mouth. I feel it is helping in the sense that she knows the taste isn&#x27;t something she likes.  That alone is a help for me.  I&#x27;m confident that she will eventually be more aware of Mavala Stop and discontinue this habit. I have nothing negative to say about this product since it does make my granddaughter aware of what will happen if she doesn&#x27;t follow the instructions and keep those fingers where they should be.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 7 years old and had no desire to stop sucking her thumb. I wanted something to give her a jumpstart. We are on day 8 of no thumb sucking! So glad I bought this when I did.</li>
            <li> This worked!  I have used so many products over the years and this is the first time it worked.  The taste is not so bad that I am miserable when i accidentally taste it when cooking, but it is a hassle if you like to cook.  for a couple weeks I had my husband do most of the chopping and that worked fine.  It is just terrible enough to make my subconscious terrified of letting my hands anywhere near my mouth.  After 2 weeks I think it was so deeply ingrained that I automatically stopped my hand halfway to my mouth, even without the polish on anymore.  I used about half the bottle and then didn&#x27;t really need it anymore, every once in a while I&#x27;ll put it on if I have an accidental biting situation.  I&#x27;ve got 9/10 nails looking great right now and I haven&#x27;t put it on in a month!  Yay!</li>
            <li> Works within days. Unpleasant taste reminds my 12 yrs old when he is biting his nails. Nails are already improving after 2 weeks but I guess it will take little longer to kick the habit.  I am adding a pic with the ingredients list from the packaging.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 4 year old nail biter.</li>
            <li> NOT non-toxic! I application on my 3 yr old dtr for thumb sucking had her gagging, coughing, and spitting. I know that bad taste is the point, however, this seemed extreme. I tried and with the same response as her....and the taste stayed in my mouth for HOURS! I threw it out!</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked right through it! :(</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my 3 year old son. He will suck his thumb even minutes after putting this product on and doesn&#x27;t care about the horrible taste. I actually tried it on my pinky nail before trying it on him and I thought the taste was horrible...it also lasted a few days. It may not be a product issue...just that my son isn&#x27;t picky with flavors.</li>
            <li> Makes me want to stop biting my nails. Would like to see a stronger version of this.</li>
            <li> This product is loaded with toxic ingredients. I have no idea why it would be acceptable for children to use.</li>
            <li> Not only is my son no longer sucking his thumb, I also stopped biting at my nails and cuticles!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product my two toddlers ages 2 and 3 have been sucking their thumbs since birth NOTHING has worked until i found this product. I was nervous because of the reviews that left kids gagging, but even after quite a bit of coating they did not have an extreme reaction. I tried it on myself and it was a very strong bitter taste it stayed on my thumb for two days without reapplying!! Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a good way to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb while awake.  We did notice the bitter flavor did not bother her when she was asleep.  We had to find another solution for that.</li>
            <li> Day 1 - applied the nail polish (just a small dot on the top of the fingernail)&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 - daughter tried sucking the thumb twice&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 - have not tried sucking her thumb since!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for children old enough to express themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply VERY small amount (just a dot) on the very top of the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 3yo daughter who&#x27;s been sucking her thumb since she was 3 months old.  Around age two, the &amp;#34;comfort me&amp;#34; thumb sucking&lt;br /&gt;turned into bad habit and she&#x27;s been sucking her thumb non-stop.  It did not bother me until I&#x27;ve noticed her upper teeth shaping into an upside down V.  For the past three months I kept telling her that pretty soon her thumb will no longer taste good to her.  I&#x27;ve ordered the nail polish last week.  I applied a smudge on the top of my thumb on Tuesday.  Of course, I had to taste it - it&#x27;s a VERY bitter!!!  I&#x27;ve asked my daughter if she wants to see how bad mommy&#x27;s thumb tastes and she tried it.  On Friday, before my daughter went for her nap, I told her that once she wakes up, her thumb will no longer taste good.  I applied a small dot to the upper part of her fingernail as soon as she fell asleep.  I made sure there&#x27;s water close by so that when she wakes up, she can get the bitter taste out of her mouth.  She woke up an hour later, crying, gagging.  I gave her water, kept hugging and kissing her.  She fell asleep without the thumb for the second hour.  She woke up with the same result.  She tried sucking her thumb about two more times that day.  The night went surprisingly well - did not try sucking at all.  On Saturday, she tried sucking twice - once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  Since Sunday she did not put the thumb in her mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product takes a long time to wear off.  I&#x27;m washing dishes every day at least three times a day.  Tomorrow will be a week since I applied this nail polish to my fingernail and I can still taste the bitterness.bitterness.</li>
            <li> I got it for my 9 year old and he just sucked it off. I don&#x27;t hate the product, it just didn&#x27;t work for a child that far up in age or habit.</li>
            <li> It works my daughter nails look great for the first time in 10 years she has long nails... She is a nail and skin biter and now after 3 weeks she is feeling great about her hands we apply at least 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for us.  I had hoped it would deter my 2 YO from biting his nails and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Worked for my daughter to stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li> I accidentally spilled it on the table as I was apply on my child&#x27;s thumb and it literally stripped the varnish off the table in the area I spilled it.  I can only imagine what this would do to my child&#x27;s body.  Several types acetates and alcohol listed in ingredients.  I can&#x27;t in good conscious give this to my child.</li>
            <li> Pros: It is bitter enough to alert me every time I put fingers in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It is too bitter.... such that it leaves &#x27;bitterness&#x27; in everything my finger touches, like chips, cookies, straws, and lips (Yes I bite lips as well sometimes...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I will not continue using this since I am a chip/cookie lover. I can definitely live on without finer biting habits, but I cannot live a day without any non-bitter chip/cookie.</li>
            <li> Finally, one that works. I wanted my son to stop sucking his thumb before he went to preschool, and this stuff amazingly did the trick.  We tried thum, and it failed.</li>
            <li> Either the product didn&#x27;t work or I just have a really tough and stubborn kid</li>
            <li> Even my baby still 1,5 years, I already tried this stuff on her thumbs which already flatted for being sucked a lot. So I just can&#x27;t wait. Unfortunately she cried and vomited for the taste very bitter(which I tasted too).  I realized for applying covered almost the whole thumb&#x27;s nail. Then I applied a tiny bit, she sucked her thumbs and surprise...never suck again just like that. Even more she the one asked me to apply when she find out no more bitter taste on her thumbs when by coincidence she bite them. And her thumbs no more flatten.</li>
            <li> Stops thumb sucking immediately.</li>
            <li> I know the product says 3 years and up - mostly due to the potential for undeveloped taste buds.  However, my 20 month old was an aggressive thumbsucker.  It was CONSTANT, not just for self soothing, when he was tired, upset, etc but ALL OF THE TIME, ALL HOURS OF THE DAY.  My husband and I had the mindset of &amp;#34;he is still so young, what does it matter right now&amp;#34; until he started getting sores, calluses and cracking skin - then we knew it was a problem we better solve now.  I painted his thumb and I immediately felt guilty.  He drooled, cried, and made a face when he ate or drank for several hours.  Within a couple hours I could see him go for the thumb and then stop himself before it got in his mouth - I did have to paint it 3-4 times a day.  By day 3, no more thumb sucking or thumbsucking attempts (Not even as he slept).  Here we are almost a month later - the thumb sucking is a distant memory and the sores and skin have finally healed.  We have had scraped knees, 2 new teeth, and a small cold WITH NO THUMB SUCKING.  The biggest surprise of it all?  My 3 word talking 20 month old now says 20-30 words!!!!!!  I did not expect it to work so easily and quickly, nor did I expect such a jump in his expressive language.</li>
            <li> works good. you have to put it on everyday though, to be effective, just fyi....got it for thumb sucking child</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I mean, like everyone else said it tastes horrible and will completely ruin foods for you, but it&#x27;s amazing in that it works. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for as long as I can remember and even though I tried to quit several times, I would always revert back to my old habit whenever I was stressed, bored, etc. But being in my mid-20s now, I decided enough was enough and to kill this bad habit once and for all. I had to use Mavala for about 2 weeks and then stopped using it b/c I didn&#x27;t have the urge to bite my nails anymore. This stuff is sooo bad tasting that it makes you conscious of what you&#x27;re doing and so you stop. I will say though that I had to re-apply this stuff almost every day. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I wash my hands a lot or what, but I had to constantly keep applying it every night. It was no big deal though, I was just happy it was working!  And now a month or so later, I&#x27;m completely cured! The desire to bite my nails is completely gone :)</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for getting my daughter to stop thumb sucking. Less than 2 weeks and she is free of her thumb.</li>
            <li> It works.  Our daughter is no longer sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> My kids ignored it or washed their hands to get it off then went right back to nail biting.</li>
            <li> This worked on our 4 yr old son for thumb sucking. One time use! We highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> We tried using this when our daughter was still a little too young and it didn&#x27;t work. When it didn&#x27;t work we would take a month or two off and try again.  One day after she turned 3 it worked like magic. We are happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for nail biting. Even for someone like me who&#x27;s in their 20s. It&#x27;s funny how conditioning works even when you&#x27;re older than a child - when this is on my nails, my hands are NOT going near my mouth. This stuff stays in your mouth and on your lips for at least 10 min after touching, and it is sufficiently disgusting. Unfortunately I find that you have to reapply once a day because the taste completely wears off after two days of normal hand washing/showering.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Recommended and very effective!</li>
            <li> At first it did work at helping my daughter stop sucking her thumb. The fact that you have to reapply it every two days was frustrating and after some time my daughter got use to it. She started sucking her thumb again. Now I&#x27;m purchasing her a thumb guard. Wish me luck!!!</li>
            <li> The flavor is so awful that it is helping me to stop biting my nails. Need to be consistent. Great product.</li>
            <li> my daughter started sucking her thumb and after only 3 uses, just the threat of painting her nails made her get that thumb out of her mouth. it truly did the trick and I don&#x27;t even mind that 98% of the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li> This product was effective and efficient. My 2.5yr old son stuck his thumb in his mouth on the first day that he was born. Thumb-sucking evolved into nail-biting over the passed two years (although the thumb sucking never went away). I applied Mavala Stop for three days and like magic the habit was GONE! Beware though, the babies get that yucky taste when they eat too. It wasn&#x27;t so bad because it was a nice reminder to never put your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Yes tastes terrible, but didn&#x27;t do the trick for my child.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old girl, has a shocking habit about thumb sucking.  Mavala has a terrible taste wich really helps destroy this habit since first day ...  After a couple of days , the girls realizes her actions and conciously decides not to take the thumb into her mouth..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend  Mavala for this situation</li>
            <li> I bought this Mavala Stop because my three year old daughter who couldn&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb. I tried everything and when I finally came across this Mavala Stop, it was phenomenal. I applied it on her nails every morning and night for about three days when she finally stopped sucking her thumb. I never saw something that worked so fast because my daughter and her thumb were glued together night and day, practically inseparable . She would complain about the icky taste and whenever she had the urge to suck her thumb, she had another thing coming. For a week, I stopped applying it on her nails and she stopped sucking, a done deal. I would recommend this product for whatever nail biting, thumb sucking child out there. It works, tops. All I could say is, wow.</li>
            <li> This product was referred to me by a friend and I used it for my toddler who was getting more and more addicted to thumb sucking . I used it for a couple of weeks and she completely stopped sucking her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect the product to be this effective .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase and wanted to share it with moms who are looking for a product to get rid of Thumb sucking hassle free way!</li>
            <li> Ineffective product. This product was painted on my toddlers nails and each time he was back to sucking his fingers minutes after application. Not a helpful solution to help curb finger sucking.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is a hardcore thumb sucker.  I tried this per the dentist recommendation, but he just scrapes it off with his teeth.  I would not say it is a product defect, but not a guaranteed fix to the problem either.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 yr old son.  For the most part it works, but I need to put it on every day.  I guess enough wears or washes off that 1 application every 2 days doesn&#x27;t work for him.  The stuff is definitely disgusting, we were playing and he he got his hand in my mouth.  Took about 10 min to get the taste out.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my son. I&#x27;ve heard some people have success with this but my son acted like it wasn&#x27;t even there. The only thing that was effective was an appliance by the dentist. It stopped him immediately!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to keep your kids from biting their nails, this works really well.  If they wash their hands or go swimming a lot, you&#x27;ll have to reapply.  Other than that, works like it should for nail biting.</li>
            <li> Been biting my nails since high school wrestling. Started as an anxious nervous habit. Now it&#x27;s just a terrible habit.  Business meetings were always embarrassing. This stuff deterred me from biting and now I get to enjoy the benefits. Only took me 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It works, it seriously works. My 4 year old was so stubborn we tried everything to get him to stop sucking his thumb. Nothing worked. This worked in like 2 weeks he was done sucking his thumb. We used it for a month reapplying it every few days and haven&#x27;t had to use it much at all since then. We occaionally catch him sucking his thumb and we out some on and then it stops.</li>
            <li> Works really well, does indeed taste horrible. Be careful as children that love to eat finger food will not be so pleased.</li>
            <li> This stopped my son sucking his fingers after four years in a day! Great stuff</li>
            <li> Okay, I have been biting my nails since I was a little kid. Nothing my parents told me stuck and I just kept going until I got into this interesting habit of improving my looks. So, I&#x27;m going for my nails now.I have been using this since February and it&#x27;s doing great. Granted eating finger foods is a little difficult but if you really want long nails then you get past the bitter taste and just eat the food and learn ways to avoid the nails, like a fork! That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for! I have figured that its better to eat fries with a fork any way. No salt left on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this stuff is amazing. now i just need a strengthener because my nails are a bit weak and have broken once already. Mavala makes a great shiny coat over nail polish too so it looks nice!</li>
            <li> I was hoping from talking with people and the reviews on here that this would work for my thumb-sucking son, but it didn&#x27;t even phase him.  I don&#x27;t think it tasted even as bad as the stuff you buy at Walmart.</li>
            <li> We tried numerous things to get our daughter to stop; reward charts, other nail coatings, socks... but nothing seemed to help.  Mavala Stop worked perfectly.  The only problem is the stuff is so foul that she did not like to eat anything with her fingers for days after an application.  So be it, just more reason to quit.  And she did.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best product on the market for this purpose. I have bitten my nails for 24 years of my life now...it&#x27;s an awful habit! I have tried every nail biting polish, hot sauce, etc on the market and STILL bit my nails. I recently bought this product and literally will NOT put my fingers in my mouth or near it. The taste is outrageously bitter and it dries out your mouth...pure motivation to break the habit! I highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. Made my 2 1/2 year old stop sucking her thumb nearly immediately. FOREVER grateful!</li>
            <li> I originally used this product when my son just turned 3yrs old and it did NO good. He continued to suck his thumb as if there was NOTHING on it.  I chalked that up to his taste buds not being fully mature, so I held onto the product.  He recently turned 4 so I tried it again and it WORKED MIRACULOUSLY!! He stopped sucking his thumb in ONE day.  For those that tried it on 2-3yr olds and it didn&#x27;t work, try it again when they&#x27;re older.  It worked for me and I&#x27;m thrilled. DEFINITELY worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT help my 4yr old from sucking her thumb. I even tried coating the entire thumb with it and the next thing I know, she has her thumb back in her mouth. I am very dissatisfied with this product. I had such high hopes that it would work after reading so many excellent reviews on it. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Intially we were so excited when we got the nail polish, because of all the other reviews. This product never worked on our kid, first day she felt bitter taste but later got adjusted to taste. The money we spent is not worth at all.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, this product  has helped to decrease nail biting for my 5yo daughter, but hasn&#x27;t stopped it as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> After trying EVERYTHING, I bought this product for my three year old who would not stop sucking her fingers.  One application and she stopped.  I actually tasted it and it doesn&#x27;t burn their little mouths, it will just leave a bad taste in their mouths for a while.  She actually told me that she didn&#x27;t want to suck them anymore.  Stop is a great product.</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking his thumb since he was in the womb (could see  him doing it on the ultrasound!).  Though it made him a great sleeper as a baby, now at 5 1/2 it was time to stop.  Now he&#x27;s losing his first tooth, the dentist told him he should stop too. Fortunately, my son is very taste sensitive, so he really did not want to suck w/ the Mavala on. Unfortunately, the first night he woke up screaming at 2am because he sucked and we had to deal w/ the rinsing and wiping his tongue off w/ a towel!  He kicked his habit within 2 days, has not sucked in 4 weeks now! (BTW, we started putting a sock over his hand so he would not accidently suck at night time)</li>
            <li> Took my four year old ONE day to stop sucking on her thumb. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work - child still put fingers in mouth without any indication that the so-called &amp;#34;bitter&amp;#34; taste was intolerable.</li>
            <li> It works! I just forget to reapply after a few days.</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works, but it&#x27;s not really practical to use with children. I have an 8 year old and a 3 year old who bite their nails constantly. Their doctor told me buying products like this one would be a waste of money, but I was confident about this product because of the great reviews. The good news is that this product does what it is intended to! However, the bad news is that my children started refusing to eat because of this product. I only painted their nails, so I didn&#x27;t realize it would come off and taint their food if they touched it. My 3 year old shoved her hands in a bowl of spaghetti noodles and then refused to eat the rest of them because just about all of them ended up tasting as terrible as the product. She was running around scraping her tongue with a napkin practically the whole day. Similarly, my 8 year old tried to eat carrots and some chips --both times, her fingers touched her mouth and she couldn&#x27;t handle eating anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste lingered in both of their mouths for hours afterwards, so I agreed to remove the product before their nighttime bath/shower. I used nail polish remover, just like the instruction booklet says, but it was not very effective. Both kids still looked visibly disgusted the next day when their fingers touched their lips, and I assume it was because the product is so strong. The booklet says application is only necessary every two days, so I figured it would wear off by the third day --and it did. Everything was back to normal for us on the third day.</li>
            <li> I was exceptionally surprised and pleased to find that this works exactly as it claims to. I first bought it about 3 years ago, and held off submitting a review because I wanted to see if it really worked long term, since I&#x27;ve only ever been able to stop biting my nails temporarily. When I first tasted it, I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad and was worried my money had been wasted. But within the next 2-3 times that my nails rubbed across my lips, it was REVOLTING. It tastes absolutely horrible and lasts a good long while both on your nails and in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with a nail biting problem, I find it best to first paint my nails with Mavala and then with a regular nail polish over top. This provides the nasty taste when you actually bite your nails, but the extra layer of regular polish prevents finger foods or a brush of a nail across your lips from causing spasms of revulsion. In other words, JUST your biting problem is targeted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sum up: great product that works like it should. At least, it does for me.</li>
            <li> after about 2 weeks of applying twice per week my four year old daughter got use to it its no linger effective</li>
            <li> Product worked great for stopping my 2 year old from sucking her thumb. After just two applications of mavala stop, she doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb anymore. If your kids have this problem I would recommend it for you. It says it may not be effective on kids under 3 years old, but it still worked for us. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it when I am consistence on applying.</li>
            <li> This product is working very well!  I can tell when it fades away, because I see my sons fingers in his mouth again.  This summer when we were swimming, we had to apply every day, but now that swimming if over, each painting is lasting 2-3 days.  We are hoping that in a few more weeks, he will kick nail biting good-bye!</li>
            <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works...period!  Our son no longer sucks his thumb.  Now we need something to keep him from biting his fingers...does it ever end?  :-)</li>
            <li> My daughter had just turned 3 years old and I wanted to get her to stop nursing but I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her she just couldn&#x27;t anymore, even though she wasn&#x27;t doing it very often. This worked PERFECT!! VERY strong stuff. I put tons of it on and after that once she agreed with me that nurse was broken and NEVER NURSED AGAIN!! She only even wanted to one other time and I just reminded her it was broken. I was so surprised at how well it worked I tried ti myself and it was TERRIBLE tasting, and I felt bad but the damage was done and it worked, so it was worth it! And I think emotionally it was better for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have been biting my nails since I was in middle school. I would constantly try to quit cold turkey however within a week I was biting my nails again. Looking at my hands and how ugly my fingers looked I decided I needed to stop biting. I found Mavala on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Within the first week I completely stopped biting. I keep putting it on my fingers just in case I relapse. I am also much more conscious of biting them and you start to see how much better your fingers look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is so bad and if you get it in your mouth it can linger for a while. One thing to note is that when you eat with your hand sometimes you get the taste in your mouth. If you&#x27;ve struggled with nail biting I highly recommend this product to stop.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My son is 6 and was still sucking his thumb. He wanted to stop but said he couldn&#x27;t do it by himself. I heard of this product from the dentist and my boss at work. I am still using this product until I am sure that the habit broken. It has been about a month and we have been successful thus far. AMAZING! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> excellent works great</li>
            <li> Finally my daughter stopped eating her nails.</li>
            <li> So Nasty its Great! 31 y/o ex-nailbiter</li>
            <li> Does not last long for my daughter&lt;br /&gt;This was however recommended by my kids dentist so it must be pretty good, it just did not work for us</li>
            <li> This stuff is great--tastes awful, just what I need!  Bought the Orly and do not bother with that stuff, way too mild and washes off easily. So far I think this will do the trick!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great ! My son can&#x27;t stand the taste and has greatly reduced how much he tries to put his thumb in his mouth. It takes about a day in a half before he&#x27;s able to start putting his thumb in his mouth so I need to reapply the polish every other day.</li>
            <li> Great product, taste horrible! My daughter sucks her thumb and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually stops her. Now if I could just find that bottle, I&#x27;m pretty sure she hid it from me.</li>
            <li> Three stars: because it worked with one application for my son, but gagged him and induced vomiting from the taste even though he wasn&#x27;t chewing his nails, just touching his mouth to get a piece of hair. Sadly, he was still eating mostly with fingers at 3 yo, too, and this was a very hard situation for all of us. If I could do it over I would have waited till he was older, for sure, if at all. We worked through it together. No more nail biting. Not sure it was worth it...</li>
            <li> Best product out there. I tried many others that did not stop my daughter from sucking her thumb. I used this on her and and it worked instantaneously!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother because she is teaching me how to drive. She bites her nails until she gets to the nailbed and continues biting. She put this on and stopped two attempts later because of the taste. The taste does not wash off, so it works after washing dishes or using the sink. Like other people said, it can make fingerfood mildly unpleasant, but the taste from eating fingerfood is nowhere near as unpleasant as actually biting into the stuff. She still eats popcorn, but her nails are safer. Now she pulls the door handle off my car instead of resorting to self destruction.</li>
            <li> I used this both for my three year old sucking his thumb and my 5 year old biting her nails. The bitter taste was not too bad, but bad enough to make them pull their hands out of their mouths when they tasted it. We had no problems with it interfering with eating. It had am immediate impact and both of my kids actually appreciated the aide in stopping their habits. They ended up reminding me to apply it! They both stopped their habits within 2-3 days and now, I&#x27;m applying it for a second week, just making sure it sticks.</li>
            <li> ok.... Parents- if you have finger suckers...this product WORKS!!! my daughter completely stopped BECAUSE of this product...and I tried EVERYTHING possible! Mavala is a Miracle!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my older daughter, but trying it again with my younger one.  The older one just powered through it and sucked it all off ... we gave up after a few applications (ended up putting mittens on her hands which finally worked).  Just started with my younger one and it seems to be doing the trick so far ... she is not so happy at night, but in the long run, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My 7 year old was still sucking her thumb and both of us wanted it to stop. After reviews of Mavala on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. Within 3 days, she had stopped. We had to reapply on day 3 because the taste had faded. I can&#x27;t even describe  the bitter, chemical like taste it has, it&#x27;s awful! It lingers in your mouth for several minutes until it is washed away by saliva. Be careful though, you may want your kids to wear a glove on the affected finger when they are eating since it seems to taint everything they handle with the hand that has the nail treatment on it. That is obviously why it is so effective. As a side note, my 19 month old was still pestering me to nurse her before bedtime, long after my milk supply had vanished. I couldn&#x27;t even sit down with her on the couch without her pulling my shirt down or putting her hand on my breast. My daughter said, mommy, why don&#x27;t you put the mavala on your boobie?  So I tried it. It absorbs into the skin, isn&#x27;t sticky like nail polish and yes, it is effective. I felt sorry for my toddler the first time she latched on and started gagging! ;) I told her the boob is yucky now, and she accepted this fact and fell asleep in my arms. The next night she was a little scared to nurse, but still wanted to. I let her latch on, and she again gagged and wanted nothing to do with nursing from that point on. I successfully quit nursing without much effort and pain for both of us! I am now giving my bottle of Mavala to my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s best friend, who also wants to quit thumbsucking!  Thank you, Thank you Mavala!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000YUXI0 Mavala Stop - Helps Cure Nail Biting and Thumb Sucking, 0.3-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I started using Mavala when my fingers started hurting of so much bitting, I had to stop some how, I found Mavala online, I liked the reviews and decided to give it a try, and I got to say, my nails are long now! my habit of bitting my nails had to stop as the taste of this product is terrible and so hard to get off.  I only had to use it twice in two weeks, now with the longer nails I don&#x27;t feel uneven edges neither the urge to bite them off.  I keep it handy in case I need it again. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 3 year old girl.&lt;br /&gt;I  re-applied every day and she still sucked her finger like nothing was on her nails.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop really works!  My 6.5 year old would not stop biting her nails.  After a few months of reminding her to stop and her continuing to do so, I decided to do something about it.  It only took one day.  She claimed it tasted so nasty that she had to drink water to get it out of her mouth.  At any rate, it worked just like the reviews said and now I&#x27;m left with about $9.75 out of $10 worth of nail polish.  :)  I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 13 year old son who bites his nails and cuticles and it stops him.  Every few weeks we need to apply a new coat to remind him not to pick the habit back up.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and I can testify that it tastes horrible .... I didn&#x27;t expect to use it on my daughter until I had tested/tasted it first.  Her finger sucking has cut back dramatically but now I catch her sucking her fingers through her blanket.  Now I need to do a search for a shredder!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my 3 and 1/2 year old son who bites his fingernails nearly all the time. It worked the first day (and that may have been more of a placebo). We re-applied it after 2 days and I still noticed he was biting his nails, so we went to applying it every day. Still chewing incessantly. I have tasted it and do believe that it could work, but I think my son has gotten used to the bitter taste and it doesn&#x27;t bother him now. He still bites his nails terribly and I&#x27;ve given it nearly 2 weeks. I&#x27;m not all that impressed.</li>
            <li> One use was all it took for my 3 year old daughter to quit sucking her fingers.  I wish I&#x27;d found this product sooner!</li>
            <li> Within 24hrs thumbsucking was gone! She was 2.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of 3 year-olds and this worked great for one but not the other (she was just determined to suck her thumb no matter what!).</li>
            <li> This product worked extremely well and served its purpose. My 8 1/2 year old son, who has sucked his thumbs since he was a baby has successfully broken the habit! This was accomplished practically overnight. I have recommeded Mavala to the school nurse and a local orthodontist.  They are planning to purchase cases of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.  I have been using this product for three weeks now and I have completely stopped biting my nails!  The taste is just plain nasty, if you put your fingers in your mouth once or twice by accident it probably won&#x27;t happen a third time.  It took about two weeks to lose the urge to bite them and now it&#x27;s week three and I&#x27;ve removed the nail polish altogether and it looks like I&#x27;m home free.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I Purchased this for my 4 year old&lt;br /&gt;Because he chewed his finger nails so low and I noticed his skin was looking rough to around the nail well anyways I received it really fast and that night I applied it on his nails. Going on day 5 and its working perfect. It has a really nasty bitter taste to it and you have to be careful Cus if your eating you definitely don&#x27;t want to touch your mouth. My whole family applied it so we could experience what he&#x27;s going through together and although the taste is bad which I didn&#x27;t expect it to taste like strawberries lol it is doing its job and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, the problem is you can&#x27;t eat ANYTHING with your hands. Or pick your nose. And this stuff will bind to the cap like superglue, making it very hard to open after a while.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter was into thumb sucking and was just not ready/able to give up. 1 week of Mavala Stop...and it is history. Make sue your kid understands and is agreeable to it before you try it.</li>
            <li> This has been the only product to stop various family members from nail biting. This is SUPER strong, and if not carefully used can be transferred to food when eating!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  After many pediatricians told us that my almost 6 yo daughter would \\&quot;grow out\\&quot; of sucking her thumb, Mavala Stop did the trick in about a week.  We tried hot salsa, jalapeno juice, rubbing a fresh garlic clove on her thumb, and another OTC product called THUM.  Sounds like I am a pretty mean mom.  Wish I would have tried this first, but I thought it was too pricey.  Not so!  Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Stop tastes bad, but not revolting and leaves a tingling unpleasant taste even after the thumb is out of the mouth. I put it on my own thumb to see.  Another positive is that one application stays on for a full day so you don&#x27;t have to worry about applying it all the time (like other products).  Just once at bedtime was enough for us.  As an added bonus, my daughter has also declared that she no longer needs her \\&quot;special white blanket\\&quot; which she used to rub on while she was sucking her thumb. I cannot say enough good things about this product.  You will not need the whole bottle so if you know of another thumb sucker pass it along.</li>
            <li> It worked the 1st time we put it on for my 7 year old daughter. It has been over 3 weeks and she has completely stop sucking her fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this high because I received on a Saturday and we are only almost one week into this product and my 3 year old son has already stopped sucking his thumb. The first day we felt bad for him because I guess that taste was just awful, he kept complaining \\&quot;my mouth mommy my mouth\\&quot;, a lot of whining. He drool all day Saturday and I will rock and hold him because he was discussed with that taste. We laughed a little because he would think about putting his thumb in his mouth but then shake his head and scream at his thumb. As he sucked his thumb he would dig in whoever was close to him finger nails, it was soothing for him, but now that he has stop with the thumb sucking he no longer plays with our finger nails, like it went hand and hand together. I applied on both thumbs just in case he would try to put the other one in, the negative to this product is it does have a very bitter taste and unfortunately whatever they eat the first couple of times will have a horrible taste and they might not want to eat, but they will catch on if they don&#x27;t put their fingers in their mouth they won&#x27;t have that taste, and force them to use a spoon or fork when eating. I reapplied every 2 days.</li>
            <li> This product was used for a 6 and 4 year old. The thumb sucking habit was broken in a few days.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from my sister  apparently this is what my mom used on her for her thumb sucking!  my almost 4 year old has sucked his thumb since before he knew he had fingers!  ive been trying every thing!  for years!  so finally i looked this stuff up, now let me tell you i have a very stubborn little boy.  but my sister assured me it was horrible, even too  horrible for him.  the fist night i put it in him,  his brothers (5 and 2.5)  wanted some too so i figured why not....then i told the boys to lick their thumbs.  wow i was not ready for what happened next.  every one was screaming running around about how horrible their thumbs where!  that was the end od my stubborn thumb sucker.  because that went soo well i tried it on my 1.5 year old.  very cautiously because &#x27;stop&#x27; is ment for 3 and up.  he had a hard time he wanted to suck his fingers soo bad. he would put his fingers in his mouth caugh n spit and try it right away again.  he must of tried it 15 to 20 times!  i felt so bad for him  but eventually he did fall asleep  with out his fingers in his mouth.  if i could give this 7 stars i would!  after years of trying this finally worked.  the only thing id mention is put it on every night.  i went days with out putting it on at first and my stubborn little guy was hiding sucking his thumb....so every day till he was really done</li>
            <li> Mavala stop really works!!!!!!  It performs wonders. I will recommend it to anyone who needs to stop thumbsucking. I used it for my 4 year old and it worked wonders. I only used it for one day and she stopped completely.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old had a hard time breaking his habit of nail biting. I bought this product, It worked in the first try. I was watching him for while, He was keep going to the same habit. I tried it again twice more. He now stopped completely. I still have the bottle almost full. I will keep it just in case.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son the first 3 weeks he was bitting his nail but after that the taste was nothing to him so he will bight them anyways with them painted ....</li>
            <li> So far, the most successful method we&#x27;ve used to defeat thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I received it right on time. I used it on my 4 year old daughter who thumb sucks and am getting positive results already. I used this product some time last year and it has worked marvelously well. I just like to keep a bottle close by at any time just in case. Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, and haven&#x27;t been able to stop biting my nails since before I can remember.  After just two weeks of using this product, I already notice a huge difference.  In just a few days I could tell there was a change!  I have been applying a nail growth supplement, then the Mavala Stop, every 3-4 days for nearly a month now.  My fingers don&#x27;t hurt, I can finally scratch an itch, and best of all I can see a resemblance to what fingernails should look like.  If you are like me and have just given up trying to give up your bad habit, buy this!  I thought it would just leave a bitter taste in my mouth, but it did in fact make it easier to resist.  Even if I scratch my lip, or lick a finger, the taste instantly reminds me to keep my fingers from my mouth.  It is somewhat irritating, but I can definitely see that soon I won&#x27;t have to have the reminder to keep my nails healthy anymore.</li>
            <li> This product worked in one day!!! For many years and many different and expensive techniques tried, my 9 year old daughter would not stop sucking her thumb. I applied the Mavala Stop to my daughter&#x27;s nails and the taste of it made her disgusted. She threw up and has not sucked her thumb since. So far its been 3 months and counting.</li>
            <li> I got use to the taste to where it disn&#x27;t stop me it helps half the time,maybe it washes off</li>
            <li> Just as described, shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> Disgustingly effective... :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been biting my nails for 30 years. Just after a few days using this product I stopped.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! Horrible taste but it worked!!!</li>
            <li> It tastes nasty, but you have to keep applying every 2 days at the most for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful, helped me stop nail biting.  Does not work for my 7 year old thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> This product helped my daughter stop sucking her thumb at night after only a few uses. I wish it came in a smaller bottle but I understand not everyone would agree. Thanks for a great product that stands behind what it says!!!</li>
            <li> I had been biting my nails for over 20 years and had no idea how to stop. A couple of weeks using this and no more nail biting!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me. My daughter had this habit of biting the skin around her nails. I put it on and she does say it is bitter and unpleasant, but she feels the bitterness AFTER she has already pulled a piece of skin. And it is not a conscious decision for her to do it, so she doesn&#x27;t stop to think beforehand that it will be unpleasant AFTER. I guess the problem is that the taste receptors for bitterness are in the back of the tongue. If it were spicy for example the result would have been more immediate.</li>
            <li> This did not help my son. He said it tasted bad but ended up just tolerating the taste.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to get my [...] to stop sucking her thumbs.  I started using it a week ago and have been re-applying it every 2 days.  I am happy to report that she has not sucked her thumb since!!  I tasted it myself and it is really gross!  The longer you leave it in your mouth, the longer the bitter taste lasts - about 10 minutes when I tried it. Later that night I caught myself biting my nail and quickly tasted the Mavala and removed my finger.  It wasn&#x27;t long enough to leave a taste in my mouth, but it shows how quickly it works!  Very happy!</li>
            <li> The product lives up to its name!  My 2.8 year old was an avid thumb sucker:  while playing, watching TV, traveling, before and during sleep.  One taste of Mavala has continued to deter her from it.  It has been 3 weeks now and still working.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve had to continue using Mavala, applying every three to four days, as she &#x27;taste tests&#x27; her thumbs to see if they are yet &#x27;clean&#x27;, in her words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s working for me and I&#x27;m thoroughly thrilled how effective this product has been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need is one bottle.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product helped our daughter (age 3) stop sucking her fingers.  She hated the strong taste and even odor.  It dries fairly quickly on the naila nd even finger area underneath the nail.  It worked for us, so yes, we&#x27;re very happy!</li>
            <li> My son was a big time thumb sucker and he used this product three times and has kicked the habit.  The bitter taste stays on the skin for two days and it really deters the user.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who is 3, has sucked her two fingers since she was 4 months old.  They were ALWAYS in there, especially when she was tired.  It never bothered me too much until I signed her up for some classes at our local Y.  I saw her holding hands with other kids and then immediately sticking her fingers in her mouth-YUCK.  So I was determined to find a way to stop this.  My husband purchased THUM from the drug store and she said her fingers tasted good, so I went searching online and found Mavala.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the reviews that said chronic finger suckers stopped in days.....until I tried it.  The first day I painted it on my daughter&#x27;s nails she put them in her mouth and immediately started spitting due to the awful taste.  But later that day I&#x27;d see her go to start sucking, and think about it and stop.  I was completely amazed.  After a few weeks of virtually no sucking I thought she was done, but gradually the fingers crept back in.  No matter how many times a day I paint her fingers now they are back to being in there all the time.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, I really thought this stuff worked wonders.  I guess my daughter somehow became immune to the taste so I&#x27;m off to research more products.</li>
            <li> My husband has been biting his nails since he was a child (he is now 26). He wanted to stop, but it was a subconscious habit that he just couldn&#x27;t shake. So, we decided to try Mavala Stop. For the first couple of weeks he used it, I could always tell when he tried to bite again, because I&#x27;d hear this awful \\&quot;AHHH!!\\&quot; as he&#x27;d be running to the bathroom to wash out his mouth--it tasted awful! Once, I accidently got a tiny bit of it on my finger and ended up tasting it...it is absolutely horrible stuff! But that is a good thing, because it has completely cured my husband&#x27;s habit. He used it for over a month and has now been off of it for a couple of weeks. He hasn&#x27;t bitten since, and his nails now look so much nicer and healthier. We are so thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff must taste terrible (I won&#x27;t try it!) because my daughters stopped sucking their thumbs after the first application. It&#x27;s been over 2 months since we first used it and we&#x27;ve had no relapses. It really worked!</li>
            <li> My college age son asked me to find something to help him stop biting his nails. I went on line and found Mavala. He applied some each day and it totally cured his nail biting in less than 3 days- and he even survived exam week without biting!</li>
            <li> I ordered Mevala Stop off of amazon, and my six year old daughter hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since it arrived.  I placed a small amount on my thumb, and then after about 5 seconds used a towel to try to wipe it off.  9 hours later (including a shower along with washing dishes, and scrubbing at it), my thumb still tastes VERY BAD! By very bad, I mean water is not strong enough to wash the taste out of my mouth....I needed soada to remove the bitter taste!  It even still lasted to morning!  This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great! I have a compulsive thumbsucker who&#x27;s 6. His permanent teeth just started coming in and as a childhood thumbsucker myself, I didn&#x27;t want him ending up with an overbite like I did. After doing some research, we ordered Mavala Stop and he quit sucking his thumb completely as soon as it dried. I put some on my finger with him the first time and it tasted TERRIBLE. Even after a shower and a nights sleep! After a week, we lost the bottle. We tried THUM (another stop sucking polish) and it did not work at all. I think he actually liked the taste. He asked us to reorder the STOP because he wants to quit sucking his thumb (now that hes a \\&quot;big boy\\&quot;). We&#x27;re back on the Mavala with NO problems. This stuff is like liquid gold for frustrated parents!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different products to stop nail biting and this stuff is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used.  It tastes horrible and an application lasts for days.  I put this on for the first time about 5 days ago and it&#x27;s still working.  I expect that after about a month or two of using this I&#x27;ll have broken the habit.  If you are going to use this and you like finger food watch out.  It makes most things that you eat with your hands taste terrible as well.</li>
            <li> I had serious doubts that this product would work for my nearly 7 year old, but it did the trick!  She finally stopped sucking her thumbs!</li>
            <li> Took one day,&lt;br /&gt;(tried positive reinforcement/rewards for 6 months with no successs)&lt;br /&gt;Prepped our child for its arrival.  Let her know she is big now and that she had to stop and we had medicine to help her.  Let her apply it to her nails since she is so big (never let her touch medicine so this was a big treat).  On the 1st night we both tasted a very very very small amount.  It is very bitter.  She woke twice the 1st night after putting her thumb in her mouth.  Applied it to the nails over the next 1 to 1.5 weeks but she never sucked her thumb after the 1st night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other things we learned:&lt;br /&gt;only apply it to the nail and wrap the bottle in a tissue.  The smallest drop will work its way to your child&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;If they do get it in their mouth.  Make sure the cup or sippy they drink from to clean their mouth out is also cleaned or change after drinking.  The cup will get the product on it, therby continuing the taste in their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, toothpaste was the best to get the taste out.&lt;br /&gt;The taste for our child was not horrible just annoyong and letting her apply it empowered her to be able to stop sucking her thumb by herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my child continues to suck her thumb even with a freshly-applied coat of Mavala Stop.  She complains about the taste, but isn&#x27;t deterred.</li>
            <li> I put this on my daughter&#x27;s fingers one week ago, along with some pale pink nail polish (for her liking) and she has not sucked her fingers yet.  She knows the nasty taste from accidently putting them in her mouth while eating.  She has only cried once and asked me to take it off....I told her I could not get it off and she was over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on myself for nail biting.  It is a horrible taste, I do not want to bite!</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works very well for even the most stubborn thumb sucking child (I can testify!) It is VERY, VERY HARD TO WASH OFF! I refresh it every two days while she is sleeping just to make sure she won&#x27;t start again. WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful now that my son is 8, this product would have worked.  When he was 3 we tried it and he would just cry and lick right through it.  I thought maybe now that he&#x27;s older he wouldn&#x27;t want to suck the thumb bad enough to have that awful taste in his mouth.  Unfortunately it works as well and Tabasco, Wasabi, regular nail polish, none of it works.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed, my last resort is to have the dentist put an appliance in his mouth that will cost me 500.00, after insurance, to hope it will work.  Just worried about his teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Our 3 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumb completely within 2 weeks.  We are now using it on our 5 year old son to help him stop biting his fingernails.  I highly recommend Mavala Stop!  It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> My son is 2 years old and has been sucking his thumb since he found it as a baby.  I really wanted to break this habit and have been trying for a year now.  I tried all the things I read about and nothing worked.  I did not want to wait any longer with hearing the horror stories of dental problems from friends that had kids that sucked their thumbs.  I tried tobasco sauce on the thumbs and it was just a taste that would stop him for a minute and then it would go away and he would have his thumb right back in his mouth.  I found an article about Thum and foud that many people said it didn&#x27;t work and that their children started to like the taste and I thought then it couldn&#x27;t be any better than the tobasco sauce and then I found this product.  I will admit when you first put it on and your child tries to suck his thumb it is hard to see him gag and his mouth water from the taste.  But I gave him a drink and let him get the taste out of his mouth and he has tried once more in the week and a half of using this stuff.  I put it on once every three days so far and it seems to be working.  I really thought I would never break him of this habit, if he was not eating one of his thumbs were almost always in his mouth while the other was playing with his toy or whatever he was doing.  It really does work, you just have to be willing to see your child the first time or two gag for a minute when they get that taste in their mouth.  I am hoping to only use this about another week and hopefully I won&#x27;t have to put it on ever again!!!!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 2 year old granddaughter who had sucked her thumb since birth.  Recently she started picking the skin off her nose with her index finger while her thumb was in her mouth. At that point we decided it was time to do some research and find a helpful product.  We ordered Mavala Stop and got it one week ago.  After the first time I applied it she did put her thumb in her mounth and made a horrible face.  I have not seen her suck her thumb once since then so I have to give this product five starts and say that it worked just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but I said to myself if this stuff works I will write a review so it would help other mothers.  I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter who literally has been sucking her thumb since she was in the whomb!  Any time she was tired or upset she would suck her thumb and twirl her hair.  I honestly thought I would never get her to stop.  I thought my only hope was to buy the thumbguard, but that is expensive and I thought she probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it anyhow.  So for $7.99 I found this recommendation on Baby Center.com.  I bought it here on Amazon and tried it the day we received it.  I told her it was special nail polish just for her.  I made up an excuse as to why I was only applying it to her thumbs, but she didn&#x27;t care.  A few minutes later she went to put her thumb in her mouth and took it out a split second later.  She told me it tasted funny and I just told her she shouldn&#x27;t suck her thumb anyway.  Well, its been over a week now and no thumb sucking!!  It really is amazing.  I&#x27;ve only had to apply it a couple of times just for precaution, but really it wasn&#x27;t even necessary.  I would recommend this product to everyone with a child who sucks their thumb.  If my daughter the queen of thumbsucking can stop, anyone&#x27;s child can!</li>
            <li> We used this product to help our 3.5 year old son get over the habit of sucking his fingers.  It worked the first time he tried to suck on them after the product was applied.  It has been one month and he is completely over sucking his fingers. We tried it before applying it to his fingers and there is no doubt that this stuff would work for anyone!</li>
            <li> Mavala helped our family stop three bad habits in less than two weeks.  My 6 year old stopped thumb sucking completely after only three applications, he was ready.  My 9 year old and 11 year old both stopped nail biting after using Mavala for only a week as well.  This product was exactly what we needed to get our kids over the hurdle.  We approached the challenge together as a family and it worked. I highly recommend it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been biting for 20 years and after 1 week of use, I already have longer nails than I&#x27;ve ever had before.  The taste is aweful and lingers long after the bite, making it truly awful and helping to kick the habit.  It also stays on through hand washing and other daily tasks...I apply every 18 hours or so and have been successful in not biting!</li>
            <li> I am 24yrs old and have been biting my nails since I was little. I applied two coats at a time and I think it was too much. I would forget the stuff was on my nails and put my fingers in my mouth and EWWWW! 2 weeks later I haven&#x27;t applied a new coat, I&#x27;ve washed my hands over and over and over again and I CAN STILL TASTE IT whenever I put my hand to my mouth. I don&#x27;t bite my nails anymore. I&#x27;m going on 3 months without even putting my hands near my mouth.</li>
            <li> My son had been biting his nails for years to the point that all the skin around his fingers was raw. It only took 1 application of this to make him stop. He hated the taste and hasn&#x27;t bitten his nails in over a month!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for 35 years.  I have tried many different ways to stop, including hypnosis.  None Worked.  THIS DOES! I have now not bitten my nails in over 6 weeks.  Even if I have forgotten to put it on for a couple days, every time I go to put my fingers in my mouth, some kind of reverse Pavlov&#x27;s dog effect happens and I just remember how NASTY this stuff tastes and how it lingers in your mouth and I end up not biting my nails.  YES, it tastes gross..that&#x27;s the point.  Yes, if you eat with your fingers, you will end up tasting this stuff with whatever you eat.  But bottom line is...it SIMPLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about Mavala STOP from many people and was so excited to try it to get our son to stop sucking his finger.  As incentive, I painted some on one of my fingers and it was indeed VERY NASTY tasting.  He licked his finger once and it was gross but not gross enough.  He sucked it off repeatedly!  We ended up stopping its use since it&#x27;s so high in chemical content and he was basically ingesting it.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.  I had to keep putting it on my son, after washing his hands, and showering.  He didn&#x27;t like the taste of it and it helped him to not suck him thumb, but I had to keep putting it on.</li>
            <li> Worked for the first week but no longer works.  He just pushes through the flavor to bite his nails and suck his thumb.  Very expensive product for a short term effect.  Probably works well for adults and older motivated kids.  Not effective for my 5 year old even when we painted twice a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great...once. I have purchased two bottles of this and I have only been able to use each once before the lids become impossible to remove. The one time that I can use it is effective in preventing my son from sucking his thumb though.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my 5 year old nephew who bites his nails til his fingers are bloody. Before purchasing it I had noticed it was for thumb sucking too but since I have tried EVERYTHING on my 3 year old daughter I didn&#x27;t even think about using it on her. Well once I saw how well it worked on my nephew I put some on my daughter. It worked!!!! She has calluses on both thumbs where her bottom teeth rub from how much she sucks her thumb. Her nails are so soft and moist that not even nail clippers will trim them sometimes. Now I almost feel guilty for putting it on her because I miss seeing her with her thumb in her mouth all the time. I&#x27;m so amazed on how well this stuff worked.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how well this product works.  I put it on my 3-year old&#x27;s thumb twice (over a 6 day period) and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  I told my 5 year-old that I was going to put it on her fingernails so that she would stop biting her nails and she was so scared of the product that she actually stopped biting her nails before the product even arrived.  I told her that it tasted really awful and she said that she would just stop biting her nails because she didn&#x27;t want me to put it on her.  I talked about the product for days before it arrived so that everyone knew what was going to be happening.  My 3-year old sucked her thumb a few times the first and second day and then decided that the product tasted pretty awful and I just kept reminding her not to put her finger in her mouth or it would taste awful.  Eventually (by the 3rd day) she just stopped.  I put the product on the first and 3rd day.  Hope this info. helps those of you that are thinking of using this product.  I would have paid twice the money to get her to stop sucking her thumb.  I&#x27;ve read that most dentists believe it is a good idea to get your kids to stop sucking their thumbs as early as possible.</li>
            <li> We tried a lot of things for years with no success. Then a friend recommended Mavala Stop. The thumbsucking stopped immediately, and within 2 weeks the habit was permanently broken and the product wasn&#x27;t needed anymore.</li>
            <li> I am 19 and have tried everything to stop me from biting my nails. I have gone to the nail salon and got fake nails to see if that would work, I have forced my self to stop (for a week). I would put bright nail polish on to discourage my nail bitting so I wouldn&#x27;t have nail polish pieces stuck to my teeth. Nothing worked until I saw this on Amazon. I haven&#x27;t once thought about biting my nails after I applied this. It does taste terrible! And I would recommend not eating finger foods with your hands, the taste always ends up in your mouth. Overall I love it!&lt;br /&gt;-bree</li>
            <li> working marvelously, my will not put his fingers anywhere near his mouth</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at how this would work, but based on the reviews, decided to give it a try.  My 3 year old was a horrible thumb sucker.  She always had a thumb in her mouth.  We were having such a hard time breaking her of this habit.  Within one day this worked.  It was amazing.  Based on previous comments I only applied a very small dab on her thumbs.  I reapplied 2 days later, just in case, but she really didn&#x27;t need it.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This was so very easy to put on my daughter&#x27;s thumb to get her to stop sucking it. She is 5 and has been sucking for a very long time. The dentist was recommending all these contraptions to put on her thumb but they were all so expensive. When we found this one, I was like, what could it hurt to try it. WE have only had to put it on maybe 3 times and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb anymore!!! It really works!! I even used it on myself and was able to stop biting my nails. It is an awesome product that is small enough to fit until your purse and go anywhere, is always there when you need it.</li>
            <li> Yes this will keep you from chewing your nails, it will also ruin a lot of other things. I was using this to keep my son from chewing clothing, and other things. While I had it I thought I would try it because I chew my nails a bit. Then I found anything I touched and trying to make dinner was impossible. Everything tasted like this stuff, had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have twins, both age 4, 1 boy and 1 girl. My girl likes to suck on her middle fingers, while my boy is addicted to sucking his thumb. We bought this as a last resort and it worked wonders with my daughter! SHE HATES THE TASTE!!! First few nights she woke up crying because of the nasty taste, and now, a week later she is finger sucking free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boy, hates the taste.... but when he&#x27;s asleep he doesn&#x27;t even notice it and sucks his thumb as usual. We tried double coating his thumb and that didn&#x27;t work either... we finally gave up and are just putting socks on his hands at bedtime. That has worked wonders so far. Will report back later on that!</li>
            <li> I was recommended to try this product by my cousin whose son quit biting his nails. After we tried applying Mavala Stop to my son nails he immediately realized how nasty his nails taste when he tried biting them again, but he continued returning to his habit as soon as the product effect would wear off. My son is 8 years old. He would continuously  realize that product had to be reapplied again in order for him not to bite his nails and he would tell me himself to reapply it again. So once again it has to be applied at least twice  a week in order to be effective.</li>
            <li> This works really well. It tastes very bitter and it lasts through many hand washings for several days. Definitely will help me stop biting my nails!</li>
            <li> I almost purchased this product... I mean the reviews are stellar. It sounds like it really works and I wanted to buy it. Interestingly I didn&#x27;t see reviews that questioning the safety of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched only the first ingredient, \\&quot;Ethyl Acetate,\\&quot; and here&#x27;s is just a tiny excerpt of what I found on the osha.gov website...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Affects on Animals: Ethyl acetate is a respiratory tract irritant and, at high concentrations, it causes narcosis and depression of heart function [Hathaway et al. 1991]. The oral LD(50) for acute exposure to ethyl acetate is 4,935 mg/kg for rabbits and 5,620 mg/kg for rats; and the 8-hour rat inhalation LC(50) is 1600 ppm [Sax and Lewis 1989].\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I needed to see. You can read the rest of the article here:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;I love my kid too much to risk using this crap, even if it does work.</li>
            <li> So far best money I ever spend for thumb sucking product. 8 years fighting and finally something is working.  Love it</li>
            <li> Used it on my (almost) 3 year old 2 nights in a row and he stopped sucking his finger. It&#x27;s been 6 months now and we have not seen a reoccurrence. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have the horrible habit of biting my nails. Been doing it for 15+ years and I got worse at it when I was pregnant. I have been doing this for just a week now but so far I have not bit one. The taste is pretty bad. You have to watch how you eat thing with your hands or you get that wonderful taste in your mouth on accident. I put nail hardener on first then apply this to the top of that every 2 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Only problem, is it gets on everything. Your child will accidentally get this stuff on his face and mouth, regardless of whether or not he chews, and it will make them gag and not want to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes everything you eat taste incredibly bitter, and requires multiple mouth, face, and hand washing a to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this stuff on my hand accidentally while handling the bottle, and I struggled to get it off my hands and face for days after.</li>
            <li> Tasted horrendous, prevented me biting my nails- but also made doing anything food-related with my hands a nightmare! The polish comes off onto things at the slightest chance of doing so, making eating a hazard. The worst part was after bothering me all day, it got onto the retainer I wear at night, couldn&#x27;t get it off! I wish I had known this would be a problem before I coated my nails in this. Going to try painting on a little less, see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later:&lt;br /&gt;After 20 years of uncontrollable nailbiting, I&#x27;ve nearly completely kicked the habit! I only spot my nails when I either notice I&#x27;m at risk to bite or catch myself doing so now, which is getting rarer and rarer! I just went 2 weeks without having to use it at all! It was really difficult to use at first, but I&#x27;ve learned to put small dots of the stuff where most effective, and to be cautious about putting my fingers near things that may go in my mouth. It really works, I feel so much better about my hands now.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has been pulling her hair and sucking her thumb since she was about six months. When she was 18 months my husband and I made the difficult decision to cut all of her hair off in order to break the habit. The hair pulling stopped,  and even when it started to grow again she didn&#x27;t return to pulling. However, the thumb sucking problem never stopped despite all the different things we tried. About 2 months ago, while watching tv, I saw my daughter reach up, pull some hair out and proceed to suck her thumb. Needless to say, I freaked out, and instantly started searching for something to help stop the thumb sucking once and for all. I came across Mavala Stop, and because of the great ratings started to read the reviews. There was one review that called the product a &amp;#34;lifesaver&amp;#34;. Their experience was identicle to my daughter&#x27;s situation. So I purchased it. And I am truly thankful for that review and this product. Mavala Stop was an absolute miracle. I explained to my daughter that it was time for her to be a big girl and that this special polish was going to help her do that. She let me put it on and was really excited. As she was going to bed she attempted to suck her thumb and was completely taken back by the taste. I quickly explained &amp;#34;I know it doesn&#x27;t taste good, and every time you put your thumb in your mouth it&#x27;s going to be nasty. Big girls don&#x27;t put their thumb in their mouths&amp;#34; She has not sucked her thumb or pulled her hair since that night. Her results were instant. My husband and I were absolutely amazed! I still apply it to her thumbs every two days because I don&#x27;t want the possibility of a relapse. I wish I could give Mavala Stop 20 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been married to my husband for over 20 years and he has always chewed his nails.  Nothing he has ever tried has got him to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He ordered some of this Mavala Stop and it has worked simply because his nails taste so terrible he can&#x27;t stand to have them anywhere near his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a catch to it - If he has it on his fingernails he can&#x27;t pick up and eat or prepare any food or the food absorbs the taste of it. Due to this nasty tasting side effect he has gotten to where he won&#x27;t use it all the time. However he did use it long enough to start to break the habit. Now he only uses it occasionally. When he goes too long without putting it on he sometimes starts to revert back to nibbling on his nails a little. When he does he reapplies it and he stops biting his nails.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  I may resort to tabasco sauce or something more drastic because my kid obviously doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of this stuff.  It has not once prevented her from biting her nails.  Ugh.  Maybe my kid is weird.</li>
            <li> Well, it works. My kids threw up all over the car when she put her thumb in her mouth and didn&#x27;t try it again.... Until it wore off after a few days and I lost the bottle. Guess I&#x27;ll be ordering another and using it only at home.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> Our little thumb sucker actually likes the taste! I hope you have a better experience, did not work for us at all</li>
            <li> My daughter has slowed her nail biting but it is not 100 percent successful. Good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 3 year old chronic thumb sucker and it has worked very well.  We were able to explain to him why it is bad to suck thumb and explained what we were doing.  while its a bit frustrating getting his permission to put it on, but once its done, the stuff lasts for days.&lt;br /&gt;So far we&#x27;&#x27;ve been using for 2 weeks and it is working very well.</li>
            <li> This scent seems to have been a bit more offensive than the last one we tried, but it&#x27;s not strong enough for a dedicated nail biter. I had optomistic hopes for this product based on the reviews of other users, but it did not turn out to be effective for my daughter&#x27;s nailbiting problem. She said it tasted gross, but not bad enough for her to keep her fingers out of his mouth. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that also were not effective but maybe it is good for others.</li>
            <li> We went through the entire bottle of this and my daughter is still sucking her thumb. At first she hated the taste and would suck her fingers instead. Then we put it on all of her fingernails so she started biting her fingers. We cut her of that habit before she could get addicted but somehow acquired a taste for the Mavala Stop and now sucks her thumb with or without it. I guess we&#x27;ll have to resort to something more before she causes permanent damage.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  My 3 year old son hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb for over 3 weeks now, since we started putting it on his thumbs.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old was putting her fingers in her mouth very often.&lt;br /&gt;Used Mavala Stop one time, and she stopped!</li>
            <li> So far, this product has worked well. It leaves an extremely bitter taste whenever you put your fingers in your mouth. The taste lasts for about 1 minute. The only downside (being a male) is that it has a slightly glossy finish.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter was motivated to break the thumb sucking habit, unfortunately her thumb went into her mouth reflexively all the time and she wasn&#x27;t having much success with other methods and reminders.  I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend and painted my own thumb and stuck it in my mouth.  I almost retched into the sink.  It tastes like ear wax times 40.  I told my daughter she would be disgusted by the taste.  She was motivated so she held out her hand.  The stuff goes on clear, dries totally and lasts about 3 days, so you reapply every three days.  They say it takes 21 days to break a habit.  My daughter was done sucking her thumb in 2 days!  The first day she put her thumb in her mouth without thinking over a dozen times, each time ripping it back out and spluttering a little.  Once she started to make the association with the aversive taste, she stopped sucking her thumb.  I did apply the Mavala stop every few days for almost 3 weeks just to make sure we didn&#x27;t have a relapse.  She was sooo proud of herself for breaking the habit and so happy with herself once she realized she didn&#x27;t need her thumb any more.  Of course, I rewarded her with a pony.  (American Girl pony, that is!).  You probably shouldn&#x27;t try this with real little kids, and it will probably be more successful if the child is motivated to top sucking.  One thing you should be aware of is that after you apply this, if the child eats finger foods they could get some of the taste co-mingling with the food.  This is why I am hesitant to try it with my next daughter to break her of her nail biting habit.  I would have to apply to all the nails, so not sure how it will go over at mealtime.</li>
            <li> This thing does taste nasty. We applied the solution on our 5 year old fingernails while he was asleep. In the morning he came complaining about the bad taste . We suggested that he stops biting his nails and it would go away. That&#x27;s when he realized we put something on his nails. Couple of days later he actually started asking for more solution as he managed to develop a taste for it.</li>
            <li> The product really works but  taste awful but works great. Stopped the nail biting&lt;br /&gt;I even used it on myself</li>
            <li> ATTENTION! Important! I tried it myself before putting it on my 4-yr-old daughter, which is good because I found that you need to apply just A VERY TINY BIT TO THE BASE OF THE THUMBNAIL.  This way, they&#x27;ll taste it when they suck their thumbs, but they won&#x27;t accidentally taste it when they eat fingerfoods.  It has a horrible, bitter-taste that stays in your mouth (eating food or drinking a flavored drink helps the taste go away). It has been at least 3 months since my daughter stopped sucking her thumb!  Hallelujah. I wouldn&#x27;t say it just \\&quot;helped\\&quot; her stop thumbsucking, it \\&quot;made\\&quot; her stop sucking her thumbs.  I gave some of it to a friend, and her daughter was also able to stop over a very short period of time. Anyway, to summarize I told my daughter that the Tooth Fairy knows how important good teeth are and that she makes kids&#x27; thumbs taste bad when she feels they&#x27;re a big girl/boy to help them stop sucking their thumbs.  She was excited about it happening.  Then, I painted the polish on while she was sleeping.  Long story short, she hated the taste so much that I didn&#x27;t even have to paint it on again (taste lasts for 2-3 days).  She was done with it.  I&#x27;m not saying it wasn&#x27;t challenging for her, but now she doesn&#x27;t even think about it anymore.  After it works for your child, let others know, so their kids can be helped by it.  My daughter&#x27;s teeth quickly looked noticeably better and moved back in quite a bit.  Pretty cool, eh!?  I was worried before I tried it because she used her thumb so much for comfort, but she did great, and your kid will too.  Try it, and then share the leftovers (there will be plenty) with others who need it.</li>
            <li> I have biten my nails for as long as I can remember and this is the only thing that has stopped me from biting my nails</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala Stop for my eight-year-old after trying the local pharmacies&#x27; cayenne pepper product, which stung his tongue at first, but not enough to prevent him from licking it off.  Mavala Stop is so bitter, and so easily transferable from fingers to food, that after one application and one ruined meal my son tearfully promised not to bite his nails again, and for a month now has not.  Since that awful experience he has also said to me several times, \\&quot;I really want to chew my nails now, but I&#x27;m not going to, because I know what will happen if I do.\\&quot;  For he knows that we still have a full bottle ready to use if carelessly bites his nails again.  Based on our experience, I strongly recommend this product to end nail biting and thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> This product is as described and it works great.  I warn though... the taste is horrible! Which is good because it def helps you stop biting nails!</li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 yr old daughter has sucked her thumb her whole life.  We&#x27;ve been trying for two years to get her to stop; we&#x27;ve tried rewards, having her sit on her hands, using \\&quot;Thum\\&quot;, putting band-aids on her thumbs but nothing worked for any length of time.  Finally her dentist told us she was going to be in braces until college if she didn&#x27;t stop NOW. I Googled to find solutions and found Mavala a Thumb Guard as options with good results.  I decided to go with the $10 option instead of spending $50+ on a thumb guard.  She sucked her thumb ONE time (at night) the first time we used Mavala and that was the end of it.  She told us the next morning that she woke up and tried to rinse out her mouth repeatedly b/c the taste was so bad.  Bad enough that she won&#x27;t even lick her fingers after eating food with her hands anymore.  It&#x27;s been 30 days now; I&#x27;m a believer and so grateful we found this in time to help my 4 1/2 yr old younger child who is also a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 4 year and 18 month old children. They hated it the first time, within a week they got rid of sucking habit. I wish i had known about this product earlier.</li>
            <li> It worked for a couple of weeks and then my son got used to it. He has been slowly cutting back on thumb sucking on his own without anything. We also have stopped asking him to stop doing it. He seems to be working on it by himself.</li>
            <li> Thus stuff tastes terrible, I give it that.  But if you have a smart child, they will notice that it gleams on their fingernails.  It lasted one night on my five year old&#x27;s fingers.  Then he noticed the gleam, and started scratching the stuff off.  It comes off like nail polish.  So- complete fail for us.  Maybe using it on a younger child would work, I dont know, but my 5 year old outsmarted the stuff almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for this product. We had been tryng for 3 years to get our 5 year old to quit sucking her thumb. We have tried so many different things with no success. My three year old was also sucking her thumb, but I just didn&#x27;t have it in me to try to work on both of them. How in the world do you get them to quit something they don&#x27;t even know they are doing...especially in their sleep??!?! My one year old son, didn&#x27;t suck his thumb, but he was chewing all the skin off the ends of his fingers..to the point of bleeding. I used this sutff on all three of them, and it has worked wonderfully. I used it for two weeks, and then gradually tapered off. None of them have sucked or chewed since then.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s disgusting, but like so many kids some of them are also nose pickers. YUCK! And we all know where they put their fingers after they come out of their nose. Right into their mouth. Again...YUCK! I decided to try it and see if it would help with that problem as well, and it does. It doesn&#x27;t burn their nose, like I was afraid it might, and they don&#x27;t dare put their fingers into their mouth. Apparently without that, picking their nose isn&#x27;t quite as much fun.&lt;br /&gt;I have referred countless people to this product, including adults who were trying to quit nail-biting. Success for them as well.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say, is this product is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold! And it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper than braces!</li>
            <li> Whew...one taste and you definitely won&#x27;t want to put your fingers in your mouth.  GROSS!&lt;br /&gt;My 5 year old son bites his nails. After I put this on his nails he unconsciously put a finger in his mouth...what happened next was definitely bittersweet...he started crying and promising me he wouldn&#x27;t bite his nails anymore. The taste is horrible.  I know, because I put it on one of my nails just to see how bad it really was.  I want to relate this to &amp;#34;cruel and unusual punishment&amp;#34;; however, it should do the job of keeping nails from being bitten.</li>
            <li> This product tastes very bitter (which is a good thing) but the taste doesn&#x27;t go away for hours. The first time my daughter sucked on her thumb (after I applied Mavala) she was crying and spitting the whole night. I tried it too and I had a bad taste the whole night. And if my daughter dips her thumb in milk or water or any other food the whole thing gets bitter and can&#x27;t be eaten. Not very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This did the trick for my 5 year old who bites her nails daily.  But it wears off by the end of the day, so I have to put it on every night for it to work.</li>
            <li> This stuff works--so would cutting your kids hands off. The residue of this chemical makes EVERYTHING taste terrible. If your kids eat food w/ their fingers, they&#x27;ll soon starve to death. And it does not wash off. I got it on my hands and my dinner was wrecked. Fried chicken, egg rolls, crisp brocolli--all tasted like the chemical. Peeps giving this stuff 5 stars must have worked at auschwitz.</li>
            <li> This product worked for my son for a while. He stopped sucking his thumb for a day or two. Unfortunately he then decided he would just keep sucking his thumb until the stuff wore off. Also it seemed to give him diarrhea.</li>
            <li> This product works but once my daughter figured out that she could wash it off it was continual work to put it on. She did not like the taste so it did keep her from sucking her fingers for a while.</li>
            <li> This worked great to break my daughter from sucking her thumb.  However, not so good with my son.  He has a strong gag reflex and he would gag and throw up from the taste.  My daughter figured out very quickly not to stick her thumb back in her mouth.  My son, not so much.  He would just do it over and over and then throw up over and over.  So, I guess you just have to decide if you want to take a chance.  Works for some, but not all.</li>
            <li> This works well, tastes awful, and is a good aid in relieving thumb-sucking and nail biting. We let our child paint it on his own thumbs to have more ownership of his choices about sucking his thumb. If you are looking for an aid in the finger sucking battle this is a good one.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the drug store version.  My son has totally stopped sucking his fingers now.  I hesitated, because I thought it would be too traumatizing, but it actually helped him and he feels good about himself now that he&#x27;s kicked the habit.</li>
            <li> My husband and two young daughters have been using this product. We have to put it on frequently but it does work!</li>
            <li> This worked great for us on our 4 year old son, who sucks his thumb mostly at night.  He did not get the gag reflex, but definitely did not like the taste.  Just putting it on the tip (which we tried first due to other reviews) did nothing.  When we applied to the whole nail, that&#x27;s when it started to work.  Though we were more likely to put it on each night, as if we missed a days, he would be more likely to put his thumb back in.  We did not have an issue with him eating as others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle got knocked a short distance to the floor and shattered.  In cleaning it up, it got all over my husbands hands and mine.  I definitely had the gag reflex, couldn&#x27;t stop dry heaving and could not get the taste out of my mouth.  It definitely lasted a full day or two.  My husband said it was nasty, but didn&#x27;t have the gag reflex that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need to get a new bottle, as he is sucking his thumb again since it broke (though not as much).  I have really liked the results to far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious...this &amp;#34;magic juice&amp;#34; as we called it worked so fast!  Within two days my son completely stopped sucking his thumb.  Homerun.</li>
            <li> This has helped to prevent my child from biting their nails.  It is very bitter so use only the smallest amount and I think you will have good results.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything to help me stop biting my nails and this is the only thing that I have found that actually works.  I am a male so I was initially hesitant to try this, however the polish is clear and not very noticeable so I have no problem wearing this in public.  I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and my nails already look better than they ever have.  I will occasionally still try to bite my nails but the taste of this stuff is just bad enough to remind me to stop but not so bad that I&#x27;m gagging.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old bit his nails to the quick. His fingers were always in his mouth.  This product ended that! The habit is broken and I only put it on once a week just as a reminder now.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> The problem I have now its that my husband doesn&#x27;t want to use it. He was telling me that it was because of the shinny look. I have discovered that also hates the taste (hahaha)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 15 years and this is the first time I&#x27;v been able to stop. This stuff tastes so bad that it makes you stop biting. The stuff stays on your nails like just nailpolish so it lasts a long time. I put on again each morning just to be safe. It&#x27;s clear color so it looks okay, just a little shine. My nails are finally growing back but I have a feeling I&#x27;m going to need to use this for a while in order to really break that habit. You also need a manicure to fix up your nails if they look bad but I can say that this stuff really works to help people stop biting.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory but my son cant eat any food without a fork because of the terrible taste. Not useful because of this !</li>
            <li> THIS WORKED INCREDIBLY AND NOW MY SON DOESN&#x27;T HAVE BLOODY STUBS FOR FINGERTIPS, YAY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> It is very good. Helps with exactly what it said. I have been using it for a while and it helps me to keep from biteing my nails. A very good product.</li>
            <li> Yes, buy this product as it works for thumbsuckers.  My son hates the taste and says it makes you want to vomit.  The flavor lingers in your mouth as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you buy thumbusters or another product that will cover the thumb while they sleep.  My son did this and it woke him up.  LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting off my fingernails for several decades now, and never been able to kick the habit.&lt;br /&gt;I realized the biggest problem I had was not the willpower, per se, but simply that when I got busy I would start biting out of habbit without even realizing it.  So it&#x27;s not that the flavor is so terrible that you can&#x27;t stand it.  It&#x27;s that it&#x27;s unusual enough to grab your attention, so you can then realize what you were about to do and stop.  The flavor is definitely no treat though. Makes me wonder if you could make something similar that didn&#x27;t taste quite as bad and have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest unexpected down side for me was that with any sort of finger foods (fries, chips, sandwiches, etc.) you inevitably end up getting some of the stuff on your lips and it lingers quite a while.  So you end up tasting it for hours after.  But it was worth kicking the habit.</li>
            <li> It traumatized him the first night. He woke up crying like he was in a painful nightmare. He&#x27;s used to sucking his thumb while he sleeps and it was heart breaking to watch my baby be so upset. My husband had to convince me to stick with it or deal with bucked teeth and overbites. I stuck with it. My baby did too. He got used to the taste and the polish did not stop him. Although he hasn&#x27;t completely stopped, he has slowed down just because we are always watching. The polish did not help.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. My 2 year old loved her thumb and her teeth/bite were pretty messed up because of it. I tried mavala around her 2nd birthday and applied it every 2 days for 2 weeks. She tasted it a few times and that was it. She ended up attempting to suck her thumb again when I stopped using the product so I started using it again for another 2 weeks and it worked! I&#x27;m so grateful as she is a different child, more social and talkative, not to mention her bite is improving! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> We tried this product for our two-year-old, and it didn&#x27;t work at all. She just kept sucking her thumb, despite the yucky taste. It clearly says on the box not for children under three because they would be less bothered by the taste.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has been sucking her thumbs so hard and for so long that they have become red and sore. I was looking for a way to stop the thumb sucking without having to use a cumbersome device. I came across Mavala Stop on amazon and after reading some great reviews I gave it a try. The thumb sucking stopped within two weeks. This product works. I also have to say that we didn&#x27;t experience any averse reaction to eating finger foods, like some reviewers stated might happen. The bottom line is if you need a solution to thumb sucking this just maybe it.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that keeps my toddlers finger out of his mouth! One taste and i knew it works lol</li>
            <li> My son sucked his finger. His dentist had mentioned twice that we really should get him to stop sucking his finger as it was moving his front tooth forward (you could see it and it was getting worse). Then my son got a scratch on his nose. As he would suck his finger he would also rub this scratch, which in turn got bigger and bigger and since he was rubbing it all the time it would not go away. I finally got so annoyed I started looking for something to put on his finger. I saw this product and the great reviews so I thought I would try it. I first put it on only his nail. It worked for a little while but not long enough. I then decided to put it on half his finger...it worked WONDERS. Almost immediately he wasn&#x27;t sucking his finger anymore. I still put it on every once in a while to make sure he doesn&#x27;t suck his finder anymore. THANK YOU for this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my daughter was sucking the skin off her thumb.  She was about a year and a half.  I know it says 3 and up, but, like I said, the skin was coming off.  I applied it right to her thumb nail.  She did not like the taste of it at all. But at 1 1/2, she would forget that it tasted gross and stick her thumb back in.  Even though it says every two days, with the way she kept putting her thumb in  her mouth, I ended up having to put it on a few times a day.  After about a week, she stopped sucking her thumb during the day, but I continued putting it on her thumb at bedtime, just in case.  Withing two more weeks, she stopped sucking at night as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this.  :)</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when I read the horror stories about this product, but it worked absolutely as advertised for us. Immediate results, and 3 weeks later the child is still not sucking fingers. My child didn&#x27;t like the taste, but had not wild/far out reactions, it seemed to be the perfect level of motivation to stop sucking without going overboard. I told a friend about it and they used it for their child with similar results.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! I bought this for my daughter (6 years old) and is still sucking her thumb. I put this on just her thumb on the night of Feb. 19th and by morning of Feb. 20th she is not sucking her thumb!!! It is a very bitter taste that last for a long time. I would defiantly recommend this for thumb sucker and nail biters. This really does work. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old and 2 year old twins could not stop sucking their thumbs.  I put Mavala Stop on their thumnb nails and they quit within 2 weeks.  You have to endure the agony of your child gagging on the nasty stuff, (I tried it, and it is nasty).  They are not going to be harmed by it, and the benefits are lasting.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I Bought this product for my 4 year old granddaughter and we were very pleased...she no longer sucks her two middle fingers!</li>
            <li> It took 3 wks to get my 3 yr old son to stop sucking his thumb. It wks great during the day when he&#x27;s awake &amp; reminds him to not suck his thumb. Mavala could not stand up to the pwr of thumb sucking in his sleep. You can spoil your meal while eating with your hands if you accidentally lick your fingers or just by eating with your hands in general. It leaves the fingernail with slight gloss but not like that of a clear nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 mths later my son is 4 yrs old &amp; occasionally we will find him sucking his thumb in his sleep or find evidence of it because his thumb is cracked &amp; dry, but during the day he is free of thumb sucking which is perfectly fine with us. We reapply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again. The 10ml (.3 fl oz) size was enough &amp; we still have plenty left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can chk the safety of ingredients @ [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. it helps the 1st day but one he has washed his hands and stuff it isnt as potent!</li>
            <li> it really taste awful!!! even if you wash your hands the taste remains!!! worked perfect in my 4year old kid!!!</li>
            <li> My niece who is 5 has been biting her nails (hands and feet) since she was 1 and when I went to visit for a few weeks I figured I would stop her habit. I tried a product I found at a local Riteaid/CVS type store. That didn&#x27;t work. Then I found this product and she stopped after about a day and a half! This stuff is bitter and nasty. You have to paint your nails with it twice a day so that it stays on there but once it&#x27;s on the nail and it&#x27;s dry, it does not come off. I even ordered it for my daughter as I&#x27;ve noticed she had started to bite one nail. Best product Out There!</li>
            <li> fixed the issue of finder nail bitting fast and works good. only had to use for a week to fix the issue</li>
            <li> Awesome. Tastes like poison, keeps me away from my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> It worked in one night although the one night was rough.  Nauseated after tasting it.  Otherwise it is very effective</li>
            <li> Clear so no show. Taste?? Must be bad. 7 yr old missed lots of sleep first night since started sucking as fell asleep then ended up trying to wash out the taste. Cruel? No. Better than alternative of future dental problems.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to cut my 4 year old son&#x27;s fingernails in over a year. 1 Month of sporadically putting this on his fingers and he no longer chews them at all. I actually had to cut all of his fingernails just 3 weeks after getting the product in! Now if I could get him to stop picking at his cuticles....</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought. This stuff is horrible tasting. Be careful eating anything with hands after applying because you can even taste it on your food from just touching it. I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for 20+ years didn&#x27;t bite them once for 4 weeks while I was using it and my nails finally looked good. One problem is that when I quit using it, I started to bite my nails again, so now I have to start using again until I break this nasty habit for good!</li>
            <li> My eldest son was a thumb sucker from the time he was 6 months old until a dentist warned us at 4+ years that he was changing his hard palate with his vigorous habit.  This product literally stopped his habit cold turkey.  If I did forget to put it on his thumb he would fall off the wagon, but would stop immediately when I reapplied.  I would estimate it took him a good 2 months to be done and not need it on his thumb.  I spoke with a pediatric dentist about it and he said for most kids it either works immediately, like it did with my son, or it won&#x27;t work at all.  I am glad we gave it a try.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always sucking her thump to the point of making it raw. one application of this and she no longer sucks her thump. worked great</li>
            <li> It works but the only thing is you need to keep apply it. Sometime i am not bitting my nails. I just accidentally touched my mouth and I get the ugly taste.</li>
            <li> It works miracles my son&#x27;s nails have grown in only one week and he no longer bites his nails.</li>
            <li> Completely stopped a 44 year old habit</li>
            <li> Great product.  I can&#x27;t believe that there would be a better product out there to help someone stop sucking their thumb or biting fingernails.  We purchase a second bottle.  Not because we used the entire first bottle, but because our kid dumped it out because she hates the taste so bad.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. My son was habituated with thumb sucking and we did all things to stop him for 3 years. He stopped putting his finger from the day we applied. It&#x27;s easier to stop if your kid knows wha&#x27;s good and bad and ready to accept.</li>
            <li> works very well!! makes finger foods taste nasty though when u use your fingers to eat with otherwise item works extremely well . my daughter loves painting her new long nails :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely works! 5/5 on that BUT it works too good! When I&#x27;m eating dinner (hamburger, French fries, hand food) it taste like the bitter nail polish. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I don&#x27;t want to bite me nails but if you touch your finger on a nail and eat, you better be ready for that treat! Haha. Others than that great job.</li>
            <li> My daughter started sucking her thumb in the womb.  Her father also sucked his thumb. Her father is also a dentist and begged me to start teaching her to stop sucking her thumb and recommended this stuff.  It was how he stopped sucking his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She sucked it whenever she was nervous or when trying to fall asleep.  She sucked her thumb a lot!  In addition, every time she sucked her thumb she twirled her hair with the other hand.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on like nail polish.  It&#x27;s clear.  I just put a dab on (thanks to other comments on here).  I put it on a few hours before bed and we talked about it.  I told her it wouldn&#x27;t taste very good if she sucked her thumb.  She understood and refrained from sucking her thumb up until bedtime.  She fussed a little in frustration and cried a bit.  Eventually she fell asleep with out sucking her thumb.  However, when she half-woke up during the middle of the night she subconsciously started sucking her thumb (full force) and immediately started sticking her tongue out and fussing.  Still half asleep and feeling stressed she stuck her thumb in her mouth again and sucked and got another big taste.  This woke her up immediately in full tears. And then she started gagging.  And then she threw up a little.  I was prepared for this because of past reviews so I had a towel ready and could quickly cover her mouth and keep things clean. After a hug and a kiss and a little time sitting together talking about it she was ready to sleep again.  No other problems that night.  The following night pretty much the exact same thing happened.  However, that was the last time.  She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since and as an added bonus,  she stopped twirling her hair!  Yeah! No more knots in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;So for effectiveness: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;For this item working on a type of shock therapy: 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how \\&quot;moral\\&quot; this way of getting a child to stop is, but it worked.  And rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  A couple of months after she \\&quot;stopped\\&quot; sucking her thumb she started back up again out of no where.  I think perhaps because one of her good friends in preschool still sucks her thumb so she started to, also.  But I put some more on her thumb and now once again she is not sucking her thumb. I haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb in quite some time.after she \\&quot;stopped\\&quot; sucking her thumb she started back up again out of no where.  I think perhaps because one of her good friends in preschool still sucks her thumb so she started to, also.  But I put some more on her thumb and now once again she is not sucking her thumb. I haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb in quite some time.</li>
            <li> I only had to use this once for my 4 year old.  This and the Bernstein Bear&#x27;s book &amp;#34;The Bad Habit&amp;#34; helped him stop biting his nails for good.  Worth the price even for just one use!</li>
            <li> We had used this product in the past to stop thumb sucking and it worked just fine.  Now our 7-year-old wanted help to stop biting her nails so we turned again to Mavala Stop.  And it worked!  It has been a week and she hasn&#x27;t bitten her nails and is very proud of how they are growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we first put it on, she seemed to accidentally get it on everything - her food, her face, her lips - and the taste is bitter.  But she learned how to avoid that and now it is working well.</li>
            <li> This works if you remember to reapply daily. If you forget when it wears off you will catch yourself biting your nails.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son was biting all his nails.  He took one bite with this on it and spit and gagged.  He stopped biting his nails for a few weeks and then we had to put more on.  I imagine after a couple rounds, we&#x27;ll have kicked the habit.  (I tasted it, too, and I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste either!)</li>
            <li> Great product but starts to dry out a little after a bit but still worked well!!</li>
            <li> I had heard of this from a friend of mine so decided to get some for myself. It works great! The first time he forgot it was on, and his thumb went in- he was reminded not to do so. It has a bitter taste but is safe. Now my son will even ask for it when he has the urge to suck his thumb. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works.  My 2 year stopped sucking her thumbs after applying it the first time.  She also had a little blankie she would hold while she sucked her thumb.  She gave up the blankie too.  I was hoping she would be dependent on the blankie after stopping the thumb sucking so she could sleep well.  However, now she doesn&#x27;t use either...AND we are having a VERY DIFFICULT time with afternoon naps and slight difficulty with bedtime.  If anyone has any tips, please share.  I feel so bad to see her struggling to go to sleep where sleep was never a problem for her since infancy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy for this product as it helped to quickly and easily stop a 1-2 year old from sucking thumb at night (which is the hardest!!!)  Must try for parents in this dilemma.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son to stop bitting his nails. It works, but must apply it once everyday.</li>
            <li> It is helpful but the bitter fading away just so quick and you would taste it at any time. I only use it once.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 6 yr old son.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. My daughter is 19 months old been sucking her thumb since 3 months. It&#x27;s been the second day with this product and it&#x27;s working wonderfully. The first day I saw her thumb in her mouth maybe 8-10 for like 3 sec and then she took it out. Today I saw it maybe twice for like a second. So maybe tomorrow I won&#x27;t see it in her mouth at all. Yay!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My seven year old stopped sucking his thumb the same day I applied the Mavala Stop.  We applied Mavala Stop regularly for the next few weeks, &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;, and he has never sucked his thumb again.  It worked great! I am extremely pleased with this product.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, this stuff is epic.  We originally bought it to get my then-two-year-old son to stop sucking his thumb as our kids were giving each other strep over and over.  We tried other methods before this one and he would just suck right through them.  The first time we used this he cried and cried (poor thing) and never went back to the thumb.  I decided to try it myself for my nail-biting habit.  I&#x27;m a nurse so I wash my hands a zillion times a day and even then this stuff lasted almost a week!  It was crazy!  The biggest drawback is that it&#x27;s so potent, if you find yourself accidentally touching your lips to it you will taste it for hours.  One thing is for sure though, it does the trick.</li>
            <li> 3 year old likes it!!! Arg!!</li>
            <li> We had heard of this product from some friends of ours. Stopped our daughter from sucking her thumb in just 2 applications. Great product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my 5 year old daughter at all. We ended up finding a pink fabric thumb guard that works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and my grandson no longer sucks his thumb. I didn&#x27;t have to use to daily. I applied it and he didn&#x27;t suck the thumb for about 4 days. I put it on again and no thumb sucking for a week. One more time and it&#x27;s been over 2 weeks and so far no thumb sucking. I think we have it beat. This product was recommended by his dentist.</li>
            <li> I am an adult - though I do behave like a kid. Thanks to this, I no longer bite my nails, so I do have that going for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s disgusting, horrific. I loved it.</li>
            <li> This product helped my little girls stop sucking their thumbs and my oldest from bitting her nails. I seriously began seeing results within the first couple of days!</li>
            <li> Save you money, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It worked for me after 45 years of biting and hiding nails.  The bitterly pungent, acrid taste of this solution is persistent and will put you off biting. Just be careful to apply it ONLY to nails and exposed nail-beds and NOT to fingertips.  l I got the first application onto my fingertips, then tried to eat a cracker -- bad idea!  The bitterness persisted for at least five minutes after it touches my lips or tongue.  I think if it came in a spray, one little poof on donuts or ice cream would make this a great weight-loss product as well.  Also, a little goes a long way.  Just touch the brush to your nails.  It&#x27;s not necessary to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; nails as with polish.  I used it for 4 weeks and the bottle hardly looks touched. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it on cookies next.</li>
            <li> This makes it downright impossible to bite your nails.  I am a grown man, and I finally decided to do something about my nail biting problem.  BOOM.  Done.  Not a problem anymore.  It makes you never want to put your fingers in your mouth.  10/10, would recommend for anyone with a similar problem.  There is more than enough in the bottle to last as long time.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to stop someone, maybe yourself, from biting nails this stuff will do the trick hands down. It takes one time and they think twice about sticking their hands in the mouth ever again. Our son stopped within a couple of days and hasn&#x27;t gone back since. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop works well to get kids or adults to stop thumb sucking and nail biting.  The product stays on the nails for about a day.  It tastes like &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34;.  When my kids accidently tasted it, they just ate something to get the taste out of their mouth.  Mavala Stop helped my daughter to stop sucking her thumb during the day.  At night it didn&#x27;t work because she kept sucking even with the yucky taste in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin weak nails, I tend to both subconcioulsy pick at them when the get rough or snag and when nerves are high bite at them as well. Sometimes it gets worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product now for several years and found it quite effective although it remains a maintenence issue and I occasionally need to re-apply, but that is no fault if this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really strong and can sometimes &amp;#34;bite you&amp;#34; even when you are not actually biting at your nails; I tend to even keep my hands away from my face more when using this which has the added bonus of not getting as many germs in your mouth from your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to apply with a toothpick rather than the included application brush, liberally applying under the nail and then come back and wipe the tops and exposed surfaces off with a q-tip soaked in alcohol or nail polish remover. This helps minimize accidently mis-haps yet is still very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Once They Got Adjusted to The Taste It No Longer Did The Same.</li>
            <li> I am using this on my husband and 3.5 year old son and it is WORKING.  Never thought I&#x27;d be glad to have to trim someone elses nails.  The only con is that it should be reapplied every 2-3 days because it wears off or something.  I forget to put it on that frequently but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> TRIED IT AND MY CHILD STOPPED NAIL BITING AND SUCKING HER THUMB. I RECOMMEND CONTINUING FOR 2 MORE WEEKS TO GET A LASTING CESSATION.</li>
            <li> The best product for prevention of nail biting and thumb sucking. It&#x27;s the worst tasting product ever. Made in Switzerland it&#x27;s safe fir 3 and older but I would think even younger kids should be fine as one taste of it and the nasty taste stays in your mouth forever.  I have tried various products but this one tops it all. The other products you have to use 2-3 times a day for them to be effective, thus one just once a day.</li>
            <li> My son bit both his hand and toe nails.... ya.&lt;br /&gt;This worked amazingly well, We only had to apply maybe 3 days in a row and he stopped biting his nails. Didn&#x27;t even have to use the whole bottle. Saving in case someone else obtains a bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give this stuff a try, it really works.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything people was telling me. One person told to put a tiny drop of hot sauce. Did that, he ask if he could have some more. when only did that for one time. than we tried explaning to him that big boys do do suck theirs thumbs. So one day I was looking on  Amazaon and come across Mavala Stop. He had been sucking thumb since he was three months. I was reading a about so I thought I would try it. This product really does work. I only put it on his thumb twice. and he complete stop putting his thumb in his mouth. I would recommand this product to any one who has a child that put theirs fingers in their mouth.</li>
            <li> This finally got my daughter to stop biting her fingernails. She is 17. The taste lingers over a few days and doesn&#x27;t just wash off easily.</li>
            <li> Stopped me biting in a week after 19 years of the habit. Tastes disgusting, which in this case is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider, people who get frequent headaches or migraines might be affected from it (I was slightly), and you occasionally get the taste in your mouth simply from touching your mouth/food during eating or trying to get food out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old daughter was a nail biter, and we tried every over-the-counter product we could find.  Finally I saw Mavala Stop on Amazon and bought it.  It does exactly what it says it does, and now we&#x27;re back to fighting about cutting finger nails!</li>
            <li> I learned to bite my nails at probably the age of 4 because all of my cousins did it. They all stopped but I couldnt kick the habit with anything. I got this 4 days ago and the bitter taste is literally so bad that its enough to keep me from biting. Even if you put your finger in your mouth for one or two seconds its still bitter for approx 10 minutes. Disgusting!! Great formula. Other ones of these are not actually strong enough to pass on that bitter taste. Yes, sometimes you can taste it when you eat if you aren&#x27;t careful about the way you put it on. BUT, its so worth it in the end if you kick a life long habit!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but this stuff isn&#x27;t very strong. I was expecting an overpowering terrible taste sensation when I tasted it. It&#x27;s not pleasant, sure, but it&#x27;s certainly not much of a deterrent  for an adult chronic nail biter.</li>
            <li> My 3.5 year old daughter sucks her thumb so much -- including while asleep -- that the dentist said she had begun to deform her mouth.  Applying this every two days has eliminated her thumbsucking going into week two.  I was amazed at how fast it worked.  It tastes so horrible that she doesn&#x27;t even such her thumb while asleep.  Having said that, I think if the child is older they would figure out how to scratch the coating off or otherwise remove it.  But with a young child, it works really well.  I&#x27;m going to keep this up for 60 days and see if the habit is broken.  So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE.... well, after about two weeks, my daughter figured out how to scratch this stuff off.  Thumb is back in mouth.  Amending my prior review to say it may work with kids not savvy enough to figure out how to scratch it off.  Back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for 35 years. Working with Children I have realized that this habit has got to stop! I bought Malva because a friend introduced me to it and I have got to say it helped a lot. I have stopped biting my nails due to the VERY bitter taste it leaves in my mouth. I would highly recommend this product to any one who wants to cure nail biting and or thumb sucking!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> My four year old son finally stopped chewing on his nails! He didn&#x27;t just bite them, he chewed on them to the point it looked like they were smashed.  I was desperate to find something.  I was even able to clip his nails last night.  This has not affected his appetite at all either.  Some of the other reviews talked about it making their food taste bad, he has not complained of that, though he won&#x27;t like his fingers!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. This really work I tried only for two weeks and my daughter  does not suck her fingers more. Amazing</li>
            <li> My little boy couldn&#x27;t stop biting his nails.  Nothing worked- incentives, bribery, commands (especially not commands), sticker charts.  When we got this I was worried about the potency and that he may develop food aversions as a side effect.  What we did, was when we saw him biting a nail, we&#x27;d apply it to that one nail.  He never complained too loudly, but he was really good about eating with a fork that&#x27;s for sure!!  Then when we&#x27;d see him bite another, we&#x27;d apply it to that fingernail.  We did it for a week, and it&#x27;s now been a month and there are no signs that he will regress.  It was effective and a great aid in helping him break a habit.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is an avid thumb sucker and the dentist said we really needed to nib it in the bud.  so when he was asleep each night I would put it on his thumb.  in 2 days he stopped, you would see him about to put his thumb in his mouth and then he would just move it past his cheek.  he never asked why his thumb had a funny taste.  for maintenance I&#x27;ve kept applying it every 2 days for about 3 weeks.  if I told him I was going to put this product on it would have been a fight, but doing it while he was asleep (made sure I monitored him for 2 min after I put it on so he didn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth while it was still wet.)  After reading even adult reviews of this product and how psychologically they thought before putting it into their mouth and it changed their behavior I knew it would work.  Don&#x27;t pass up this product - my sister went with the thumb guard route and I think it took nearly 6 months for her daughter to stop sucking her thumb (she was 6), I knew that a thumb guard wasn&#x27;t the way to go - especially because I knew my son would take it off and fight me putting it on.  you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Product is a good quality nail polish that prevents nail bitting or thumb sucking. I put it on once every two days and it is helping my daughter stop bitting her nails.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find Mavala Stop quickly at the beauty supply store near me, so I purchased Orly&#x27;s No Bite.  I put on my son who is a real bad nail bitter.  Long story short:  didn&#x27;t work for him, a few days later he was back at it.  Next I found and tried Mavala Stop, and that worked for him 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had both for over a year and sometimes he starts back up and I ask him for the \\&quot;nail stuff\\&quot; he brings me Orley&#x27;s no bite because it&#x27;s \\&quot;not as bad\\&quot; as Mavala Stop.  He knows it wont work and I ask for the other, he reluctantly gets it for me and the nail biting stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He will stop for months at a time and then might start back up, but Mavala Stop, nips it in the bud!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is 3 and the dentist stated she really needed to stop sucking her thumb because it was causing an overbite. I knew her blanket was part of the problem. So I first removed the blanket from the picture (probably a week prior to using Mavala) and then I put this on the thumb she was sucking. She told me it tastes like &amp;#34;toenails&amp;#34;. She didn&#x27;t have an awful, gagging reaction like other reviewers have stated. (Guess it depends on the child). However, daycare informed me that she was now sucking her other thumb. So I put it on there as well. I suggest putting it on both thumbs to avoid this. I put on application on her thumbs twice a day for a week and never had to use it again. She has not even slipped up once. I then was telling my co-worker about this. She has a 7 year old who was still sucking her thumb. I let her borrow this and her daughter stopped within 1 week as well!!!! This product is amazing and after being used on two children the bottle is still completely filled. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a thumb sucking child or problems with nail biting.</li>
            <li> Hello,  I&#x27;m an adult that had been trying to stop biting my nails cold turkey, with no success. This product has helped me to completely stop biting my nails! I used to do my biting without even realising it as a stress coping mechanism. This product helped me become aware of when I was biting and deterred me with the bitter taste. I highly recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s trying to kick the habit once and for all... now I actually have to trim my nails so they don&#x27;t get too long. Over 3 months no biting :)</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I purchased it for my child who has a nail biting habit. It has definitely helped to curb that habit.I do find that you have to use it more frequently for it to truly work.</li>
            <li> It works.  My daughter was biting her nails down to the quick and actually hurting herself.  I put one coat on her fingernails and she didn&#x27;t bite them for a week or so and her nails healed nicely.  I thought her nail biting days were over, but about two weeks later, I noticed her biting again, so I gave her another treatment.  Then I think we went about a month with no nail biting and one day I noticed one of her nails had been bitten down, so I used it one more time.  Now, we&#x27;ve gone a couple months without having to reapply it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3 yr old who sucks his fingers.  Everything tasted nasty when he tried to eat but didn&#x27;t stop him from sucking his fingers though.  He still put them in his mouth with nasty taste and all. He puked up And still continued to suck them. I tried And ill try again at a later time.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. We tried several different techniques to get our daughter from sucking her thumb to no avail, but with one application of this she quit almost immediately and now she doesn&#x27;t have any problem!</li>
            <li> I would almost say I wasted my money since I got it delivered, opened it, put it on my son&#x27;s hand one time, and never used it again...&lt;br /&gt;It worked so amazing that I have no used it since.  The only reason I kept it was because I plan on having more kids and I have never seen anything this great.  It is actually a clear nail polish that you can not see.  It lasts for a couple days and tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts about this product.I always believe the more expensive the better the product.Not the case here this cured my 2 year olds thumb sucking in 3days.Not a gimmick,he hasn&#x27;t even thought about his thumb and its been about a month now,&amp; this after sucking his thumb literally 24 hrs a day.</li>
            <li> This product tastes like sheep urine lol just kidding but it&#x27;s tastes so bad that I haven&#x27;t bite my nails anymore lol great product for nail bitter like meeee</li>
            <li> My 9 year old agreed for me to put this on and wanted to stop biting his nails.  The minute he tasted it he could not stop salivated and spitting.  He was nearly in tears.  He was spitting out the taste over and over for days.  I made him keep it on and everything he ate he could taste it.  I cannot put him through trying to force this on him again.</li>
            <li> Husband stopped chewing his nails after only a few days!</li>
            <li> 5 YEARS OLD AND NOTHING COULD STOP OUR SON FROM SUCKING HIS THUMB........UNTIL WE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;HE NO LONGER SUCKS HIS THUMB AND AS A BONUS, OUR 9 YEAR OLD STOPPED BITING HIS NAILS!!!!</li>
            <li> We put this off for a long time - but finally nothing would stop my son sucking his fingers so we tried this. We offered him a lego set if he wore it for 7 days. The first night he woke up a few times crying because it tasted so bad. The second night he work up once. During the day it kept his fingers out of his mouth. At the end of the week he was not longer a finger sucker. We stopped it after a couple of week but suggest you keep it going. He sometimes reverts which means we have to use it again. Definately give it a go.</li>
            <li> This stays on for 4-5 days and definitely has a horrible taste. The only downfall is when you accidentally get a taste of it. It really is awful. However, my daughter does not bite her nails when she wears it, and she likes to wear it because it&#x27;s shiny :)</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son found Malava Stop repulsive and felt it made anything he ate by hand taste bad. So he just stopped and it&#x27;s  been two months now.</li>
            <li> I hated having to try this on our daughter, but we had to do something because her thumb was getting blistered from her thumb-sucking when she slept. We have tried guards and other products so this was the last resort. It worked for a few nights, then, she went right back to sucking.  She has finally started weaning herself from this habit recently - we stopped pressuring her...  no polish, no guards.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our daughter who sucks on her fingers. It works like a charm! We need to apply it at least every other day but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Horrible taste, and has made me go the longest I have ever gone without biting my nails.  Only complaint is that it takes forever to dry, and seems like will smudge hours after applying.  So it never looks nice, but you won&#x27;t bite your nails.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product it did not work for my  5 1/2 yr old daughter (thumb sucker)  It was total waste of my money !!!</li>
            <li> Put this on my son&#x27;s thumbs once and he hasn&#x27;t  sucked his thumb in three weeks!!!! Thank you so much this stuff is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have never been able to shake biting my nails--32 years old but cannot stop it! Upon applying I noticed it had a smell quite similar to nail polish remover, but an even more unpleasant taste. The flavor is comparable to a cross between rotten grapefruit and the numbing gel the dentist puts on your gum before he injects it with novocaine. I have noticed that it each application lasts about 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is if you are eating something like chips or a donut and go to lick your fingers, you will quickly remember that Mavala Stop has been applied! This is good and bad since it is a constant reminder you are breaking your habit.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone as I have not tried biting my nails since I got this a week ago!</li>
            <li> I love this item so much. I have a problem with biting my nails whenever I am busy thinking or stressed. This stuff has a bitter taste  it can change even the taste if food you eat . My God it is ver bitter that now i think 10 times before daring to bite my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not try to use it for kids under 3 years old. It is transparent and it can be used alone or under the nail polish. By the way, it does not matter who many times u wash your hands to get rid of it. It takes at least 3 days to disapper. This happens when u always use water , otherwise it will take a week to go&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not make me stop biting. It tastes horrible but once you apply it its easily transferable to EVERYTHING! My food and especially when you&#x27;re washing your face, I hated that! It felt like it was reminding me that I shouldn&#x27;t bite but it was just too much to lick my lips or my girlfriend kissing me and we taste a horrible taste in our mouths that can&#x27;t be so easily removed with water and soap. It might work for you but it surely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Tastes nasty just like it should.</li>
            <li> My son bites his nails terribly and this is the only thing that stops him.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  50 years!  A few years ago, I didn&#x27;t get a job that I desperately wanted because the interviewer saw my fingernails and was disgusted by my bloody stumps.  I used to bite my nails when I was in school and I&#x27;ve had teachers tell me to leave the class because they couldn&#x27;t stand watching me chew on my fingernails.  My grandmother passed away in 1989 and one my memories is her giving me the evil eye when she saw me biting my nails.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve caught several colds over the years because of all the germs I transferred to my mouth from my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a year ago and it took me awhile to work up the courage to start using it.  I decided to stop on December 25.  It tastes awful.  What I expect lighter fluid or gasoline would taste like.  The taste definitely stays on the lips for a long time.  I was surprised at how often I put my fingers in my mouth, not only to bite my nails, but to dislodge food that was stuck in the back of my mouth or when I was eating a finger food like potato chips.  I see this as a positive because it will help me lose weight.  It&#x27;s been 11 days since I&#x27;ve bitten my nails.  I&#x27;m getting white on the end of my nails!  I used nail clippers on my fingernails for the first time ever today.  The temptation to bite is definitely there, but it is less every day.  I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve bitten, that I don&#x27;t want to break my record.  I&#x27;m looking at this as a personal challenge.  I know I&#x27;ll have to continue applying this to my nails for a long time and I&#x27;m OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a 5+ star product.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.. It&#x27;s helping my 9 year stop a very bad nail biting habit. She asked me to buy some more. What does that tell you ..</li>
            <li> Our 4-year-old daughter had been sucking her thumb since she was born. I didn&#x27;t know if we would ever get her to stop. After her last dentist appointment, we decided it was time to get serious about getting her to stop sucking her thumb before she ruined her mouth. I reviewed a lot of products online and Mavala seemed to have the best reviews. I was disappointed that it could only be purchased online, but I received it really fast considering I ordered it right before a weekend and Holiday (I ordered it on Friday, December 28 and it arrived Wednesday, January 2). I put it on her thumb right away. The first two nights were a little rough - she tried sucking her thumb and hated to bitter taste, so she kept begging for us to take it off so she could suck her thumb. It hasn&#x27;t been two weeks yet and she has only tried sucking her thumb just those couple of times in the beginning. As of now she has all together stopped sucking her thumb! She doesn&#x27;t even try since she doesn&#x27;t want that bad taste in her mouth. I&#x27;ve probably only reapplied it three times - she doesn&#x27;t realize that it wears off, so she doesn&#x27;t even try to suck her thumb and I haven&#x27;t reapplied it in over 5 days! This stuff really works, I&#x27;m amazed! I would recommend starting this on a weekend, though - she didn&#x27;t get much sleep the first night because she kept sticking her thumb in her mouth inadvertently and she&#x27;d wake up crying. I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants their child to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter broke from sucking her thumb in 2 weeks with this amazing product. She sucked her thumb for 3 years. I didn&#x27;t know it would this successful. Definitely worth the money. Now only if they had something this effective with potty training.</li>
            <li> 4 Days in and no thumb sucking from my 6 year old.  That pretty much sums it up.  I suggest this item.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has this bad (but sometimes sexy) habit of biting her fingernails and sucking her thumb so I figured this should work for her. She was hesitant at first but finally agreed when I explained to her how it looks like to other people seeing her that way. It worked for her. She&#x27;s still using it now but we have yet to find out if she is totally done and over with the biting and sucking even after finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li> My son is 3.5 and has been sucking his thumb since birth. His dentist noticed some changes starting and recommended we get him to stop as soon as possible. We bought and applied the Mavala Stop one day and he made the mistake of trying to suck his thumb twice that day--immediately asked for water after! He never sucked his thumb again and we didn&#x27;t even re-apply it! A few days after he tasted the Mavala Stop, he mentioned something about missing his thumb and wondered when he could suck it again. We told him he was all grown up and didn&#x27;t need it anymore. We thought we might need to re-apply, but never did!</li>
            <li> This product works. It really does. Just after the first time I used it it made me quit biting completely for over 3 years.... Now I&#x27;ve started again, and I can&#x27;t get past that this will transfer to any food you might touch with your nail. (You should also never, ever, paint your entire nail. Just the tip). Chips, wings, pizza.... Salad? Just be aware because this has ruined my appetite quite a few times.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been biting her nails for years.&lt;br /&gt;I tried lots of nasty tasting nail lotions from various drug stores).....nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;This product had good reviews so I thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;WOW  this really worked.  Just 3 applications.  I didn&#x27;t need any more.&lt;br /&gt;No bitten nails...I haven&#x27;t even been tempted to use any more of the product...no need!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy and the bottle is still full!  I will have to find a friend who would like to use it.</li>
            <li> Good idea, but my daughter figured out that you can peel the polish off after it dries.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a nail biter and managed to make myself quit years ago—but rather than stop, all I did was transfer my chewing habit from my nails to the skin around my nails. Gross. I&#x27;ve hated it for years and been unable to stop. I picked up Mavala Stop based on the strength of the reviews, in the hopes it would help me even though you apply it to the nail, not the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only a week in, but it&#x27;s working amazingly well so far. By applying Mavala to my nails, I still get hit with the terribly, terribly bitter taste if I try to chew a nail. Worse, it gets on my lip, and I taste it for 15-20 minutes. Awful, but effective! I haven&#x27;t chewed a finger in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, the taste is extremely bitter but not nausea-inducing.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how fast my 13 year old stop sucking his thumb. I had tried some other devices and cures but nothing worked. I noticed the difference within a week of using Mavala and I am so pleased with the results. It took me almost 12 years to break the habit. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this for our 3 year old who was absolutely addicted to his thumb. We had been talking to him about his thumb sucking for several months, so he knew he needed to stop...he just really didn&#x27;t want to and I didn&#x27;t blame him. But his teeth were already getting wonky from it and it was time to take the next step. This stuff worked with one application. ONE. We put the stuff on his nails once, and that was it. He hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb since. He didn&#x27;t freak out or cry, though bedtime was a little difficult for a couple of days while he learned new ways of soothing himself to sleep. He woke up crying for the first few nights. But he really wasn&#x27;t very upset. I still can&#x27;t believe it worked so well for our son, but I&#x27;m glad it was so simple.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY.  I am 25 years old, and after 22 or so years of biting my nails, I was absolutely SICK of my disgusting, infected nails.  I couldn&#x27;t bear to look at my own hands, let alone point things in books out to people because I didn&#x27;t want them to see my nails.  I was so embarrassed and I knew I had to do something.  I read the positive reviews regarding this product and ordered it right away.  I bought it a year ago.  I&#x27;ve applied it once.  I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since.  The full bottle is still sitting on my vanity, as a constant reminder of that horrible, terrifying, disgusting taste should I ever slip and bite my nails again.  This stuff works, GUARANTEED.</li>
            <li> This is a good deterrant for my son is who trying to stop sucking his thumb.  I put a little bit on his thumb nail every other day and he has stopped completely.  He hates it of course, he calls it &amp;#34;that yucky stuff&amp;#34;, but I think that it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s the only thing that we&#x27;ve found that works for a stubborn 5 year old thumb sucker!  It also helps me from chewing my fingernails.</li>
            <li> The answers in Q/A section saying this nail polish had some shine but barely noticeable were the reason I bought it. How was i wrong! It not just shiny, it&#x27;s VERY shiny with mirror-like gloss! I found it quite flamboyant for a man in his 40s who&#x27;s trying to break the habit. If you are looking for naturally looking matte finish I recommend http://www.amazon.com/Bite-Easy-Stop-Nail-Biting/dp/B0084U5TEU/</li>
            <li> This works great for my two little nail biters in the house! We actually can see fingernails growing!!!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old stopped sucking her thumb (which she was doing since she was about 6 months old) after a week of using this product. We tried bandaids for months beforehand with no results. Be warned it is very strong. We started with a small dot on each thumb and gradually increased it to a small swipe.</li>
            <li> I simply stopped bitting my nails. For someone who has had this disgusting habit for more then 33 years this is huge. Thank you!</li>
            <li> While my thumb sucking kid hated it the moment he licked it the first time, i love it for having stopped him from sucking his thumb any longer. Great product and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  He kept sucking his thumb despite reapplications as directed.</li>
            <li> stopped my daughter&#x27;s sucking thumb habit in just a week. Just applied it on her thumb nail every night and it works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It does its job but I think a child must be ready to quit sucking.  I put this on my daughters thumb as instructed and put her to bed.  Within hours she was screaming and crying and gagging.  The product was working but she was so upset, I ended up taking it off.  We tucked it in the closet and will try again in a few months.</li>
            <li> Gross enough to make you realize you&#x27;re biting your nail but not gross enough to stop. Wish it was more potent.&lt;br /&gt;Also&lt;br /&gt;Unless you eat everything with utensils and cook in gloves, this will get in your food. And it will taste awful.</li>
            <li> This has a bitter taste and it can linger long after you use it.  I would recommend, might help with dieting too!:-)</li>
            <li> my kid does not like this product so that must mean that it works. she says that it tastes horrible. that is the point. she is 4.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best product I have ever used to stop biting my nails. I have tried other products that didn&#x27;t work at all, but this stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Keeps your fingers and hands far away from your mouth. The taste of this nail polish is awful and it does its job! Great product</li>
            <li> Helped my daughter stop sucking on her thumb in under a week</li>
            <li> My only issue with this product is that if you go, say, for a month without using it, it becomes impossible to open. I ended up soaking in hot water, and that did the trick. But this stuff really works! My 3-year-old stopped sucking his thumb at nighttime in one day.</li>
            <li> This product is the best! I have tried all other nail polish &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; out there. My daughter is 11 and has sucked her fingers since she was born. Two applications of the Mavala stop and she no longer does it. I recommend this to everyone who needs a nail butting, finger sucking cure.</li>
            <li> If you bite your nails, this stuff will work!  I have never tasted anything so nasty and I am no longer a nail biter!  I would never use it on young children though - they have their fingers in their mouths all the time!</li>
            <li> Oh my is this stuff amazing!!! I purchased this for my 3yr old son who had been biting his nails since 18 months. He would bite so much and often and make is fingers bleed etc. Put this and in about three days done!!! I continued to put on for a bout 3 weeks just in case. Now he has nails that I have to actually clean and trim. Hadn&#x27;t done that in a long time since didn&#x27;t have any nails. Definitely recommend this 100%!</li>
            <li> This works well, but it needs to be applied every couple days.</li>
            <li> I hope it works this time I think she may be immune to taste which mean it won&#x27;t work we shall see</li>
            <li> tried socks, gloves , bribery, medical tape, thum, scare tactics with the dentist/orthodontist and negative reinforcement. This worked in one try. We bought more just to give to fellow struggling parents!</li>
            <li> I am 33 years old and I have had a severe nail biting problem for my entire life, literally. To give you an idea of how bad my nail biting is, two months ago I only had about 5 1/2 nails out of ten.  I am showing you a &#x27;before picture&#x27; below. The other 4.5 nails were bitten half way down or less. I&#x27;ve never met anyone in my life with nails as short as I am. To make matters worse, I am a minister and I would find myself regularly feeling insecure or embarrassed if someone noticed my nails... Over the course of the last 15 years I have bought one other product again and again to help me stop biting my nails (I didn&#x27;t know about Mavala or other products). While this product helped for a little bit, I found that it was very easy for me to chip off my fingernails and start biting again.... About a month ago, after two days or REAL bad biting, I decided I needed to find a way to stop biting again. I came on Amazon and stumbled across Mavala and decided to order it because of the good reviews. Let me tell you, IT IS HELPING ME! Here are two major reasons I like this product over the other product I tried. One, I can&#x27;t pick it off. It goes on clear and it STAYS on my nail, even if I pick at my nails. TWO, the taste is 2x worse than the previous product I used. Even if I don&#x27;t apply it for a day, the taste is still terrible. Right now I am going on about 2 weeks straight of nail growth. While I still have months to go for my nails to regrow, I am taking one picture a day to document my success story with Mavala. Thank you for making such a quality product.</li>
            <li> wow- it works great- well the first few times I have used it. biting nails is super hard to break. I am on the 3rd bottle (over like 5 yrs) so hopefully this time it will work for me (again). warning- don&#x27;t touch anything with your hands after applying for like 24 hrs. especially not Thanksgiving Day biscuits everyone else would (have liked to) eat. It kind of gets over everything you touch and then put in your mouth. and unless you have some tolerance to it (like I do now...) then well it can be really unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it would be best to break your kid of the habit before they ruin dinner at a later age....</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this and worked for a while . My nails were the longest they had ever been. Then I stopped using it and started up the dreaded habit. Then when I tried to start using it again it accidentally leaked in my pocket because I didn&#x27;t screw the cap tight enough and i lost most of the polish.  I eventually ordered another bottle and am trying to be consistent with it but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from wanting to pick my nails in lieu of biting them. Oh we&#x27;ll I&#x27;m gonna keep trying because this stuff makes you wanna stop whatever it is you are doing and drink water or other liquid . It&#x27;s like that.  So this is my only hope.</li>
            <li> Worked in a week to stop my five year old from sucking her thumb.  But don&#x27;t stop using it right away because she started sucking again after a few weeks.  Drys quickly.  Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people who complained that the taste got in their food, I would suggest to not use it until your child is 3 or 4 years old and they can use utensils.  The child needs to be old enough to understand what is going on. Also, I only painted it on her thumbs.</li>
            <li> Perfect item for purchase!  and, it WORKS!!!  Yes, a nasty taste but it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter hates the taste, but asks me to apply it daily since it does a great job of reminding her to stop biting.  She desperately wants to stop biting, but is unable to on her own, as she does it without thinking.  From other reviews, I was heavy-hearted about trying this, expecting her to vomit, gag, or develop negative food associations.  However, she did none of the above - she licked it on her own, said it was gross, and then went about her business.  She never bites with this on.  When nibbled nails appear, I know that it&#x27;s time to reapply.  Given that she hasn&#x27;t reacted as strongly as other reviewers&#x27; children, I&#x27;m wondering if it will be as useful for curbing her thumb-sucking habit, which is the next hurdle on our list.  I&#x27;ll update my review at that time.  But, one battle at a time.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! My 3 year old stopped biting her nails!! :))</li>
            <li> My 4 year old had somehow developed a severe nail biting habit, seemingly overnight. He had already kicked the habit of gum picking which has permanently damaged his oral health but he did it for so long... I needed to get the nail biting under control. I heard about this product from another parent (I am a pediatrician...) and decided to try it. As with any &amp;#34;quit&amp;#34; you need to be motivated, so we set a quit date for nail biting and we all decided together ... no one could have &amp;#34;hands in mouth&amp;#34; in our family from here on. So the product... It is gross. It takes hours to get the bitter taste out of your mouth. I tried it before I put it on my son. It worked immediately. We used it 4 weeks and now just at random to ensure compliance. It says every other day, we started every day and the last 2 times it was about every other week. The memory of grossness must be motivating... No more nail biting, no hands in mouth... Yay!  I used it on myself out of solidarity.</li>
            <li> The product works,  Mavala Stop helps to remember in the critical stage to start recovering from this habit. My 11 year old understands this is helping him to avoid nail biting.</li>
            <li> It is not working at with my kid. It does taste bitter, but my kid used to the taste after first try.</li>
            <li> This absolutely works. Helped my 5 year old stop sucking her finger in 3 days. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff is borderline child abuse!! My son touched my lip while I applied it and I got it in my mouth and I can&#x27;t get rid of the taste!! It&#x27;s terrible!! But your child probably won&#x27;t suck their fingers anymore!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work AT ALL to stop our child from sucking his thumb. In fact, not only did he suck off all 3 coats we put on him EVERY SINGLE NIGHT for a week, he started sucking on his other fingers too! Will never ever use again if future children have this problem.</li>
            <li> This worked on my son.  He stopped biting his nails after two weeks and now I am happily back to clipping his nails routinely.</li>
            <li> Great at helping break the thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> This product worked like a charm! Our 2 1/2 year old daughter was sucking her thumb all the time and I was getting really tired of it, so I decided to give this product a try. I applied it when she was sleeping, so that it would be easy and she wouldn&#x27;t know what was up. The very first time she tasted it, she cried but I gave her some water and she was OK. I explained to her that she shouldn&#x27;t suck her thumb anymore if she wanted to avoid a repeat of the experience, and she quit IMMEDIATELY! She did have several relapses within the first 1-2 weeks, so I kept applying it at night. But by the end of two weeks she was DONE sucking her thumb. It&#x27;s six months later now and she hasn&#x27;t gone back to sucking. One of the best things I ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say this approach is cruel, but she really didn&#x27;t seem to suffer much, and it was probably way easier for her than having to listen to us nagging her for months about quitting.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she sucks on her thumbs sooo much. We love this product since it does the job its supposetoo BUT!!! if you are using this for a toddler, make sure you have a bib or towl close by, my daughter is drooling all over the place.  The first time she sucked her thumb, she gagged and almost puked,i kept a trash can near her so if she needs to spit she does it in there.  This stuff works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**  my daughter i guess got amune to the taist, shes back to sucking her thumb :( i duno how!! because this stuff taist nasty!  i must have one tough toddler.. :(</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for my 3 year old daughter. In less than a month she had stopped sucking her thumb completely.</li>
            <li> Our 2 year old son has had a serious attachment to thumb sucking since birth.  He has blisters and calouses at the base of his thumbs.  We decided it was long enough and want to avoid any potential issues with his teeth, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We first tried the Thum brand liquid polish that tastes like hot peppers.  I think my son&#x27;s going to grow up being a hot sauce junky because he just sucked it clean off his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried this after reading the reviews; immediately following the first application he stuck his thumb in his mouth and spit it right out.  He then tried the other; he was not happy.  For the next 24-48 hours, he only tried a couple of times to place his thumbs in his mouth before finding other things to do in order to occupy and soothe himself.  He did vomit once that first night due to him sucking on his thumb just long enough while falling asleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been just over a week and the last time we applied it on his thumbs was 4-5 days ago.  He&#x27;s completely stopped trying to suck his thumbs.  There was a few days where he exhibited noticable frustration at the inability to put his thumbs in his mouth but he&#x27;s gotten past that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are curoius what this tastes like, the best way I can describe it is a strong bitter soapy taste in conjunction with that horrible taste in your mouth after licking a few dozen envelopes.</li>
            <li> I use this on my child every few days , so far it works like a charm.  It does taste bitter.</li>
            <li> I got this to help my wife stop biting her nails and so far it seems to help.  Also used it on our 5 year old niece and it worked very well for her.</li>
            <li> Taste awful! I have been a nail biter for over 20 years- this stuff really works! I do have 2 complaints: it is expensive  and if you eat finger foods you can taste the horrible polish on the food. When I make my kids sandwiches they can also taste on the bread.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I have try to get my child to stop sucking her thumb. I have tryed everything.  I will recommended this product to any parent.  It only took me putting on her thumb four times and the habit was kicked.  She doesn&#x27;t even think about sucking her thumb&lt;br /&gt; Recommended : the first time make sure you are in area that is easy to clean. The taste is bitter that it made my child vomit her breakfast.</li>
            <li> We tried to use this on our 3 year old when she turned 3 after the advice of our pediatric dentist.  She sucks her fingers all the time.  It seemed like it deterred her sometimes, but she seemed to just suck them anyway and complained of her stomach hurting. We stopped using it and decided to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is now 3 years and 8 months and we decided to try it again.  This time it seems to be working very well.  She will not suck her fingers when it is on.  We have been using it almost a week and take it off with fingernail polish remover at night and nap.  We will start leaving it on full time after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there is a note about younger kids not minding the taste on the instructions, but I think some kids may fall into that category well after 3 years old depending on their motivation.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for about 25 yrs just bought this product and dont go near my nails, it tastes horrible and I want nothing to do with biting my nails, plus they say it strengthens the nails also and that is a bonus. If there is one negative thing it is that it makes your nails looks kind of glossy. I think after a few weeks of this I will no longer have the urge to bite my nails ever again. Wish I knew of this yrs ago! It also has an annoying numbing effect on your tongue which in this case is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Used it and it works. No more nail biting for the time it was on the nails....need to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to stop my 3 year old from sucking his thumb.  This got such great reviews, even a friend of mine had success with this when nothing else worked.  However, it didn&#x27;t even phase my son.  I tried it myself and it sure would keep me from biting/sucking.  YUCK.  Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> We tried absolutely everything for my daughter&#x27;s thumb-sucking habit and nothing worked...until Mavala!  I would highly recommend this product if you want results.</li>
            <li> My son had been sucking his thumb since he was born.  He would never take a pacifier.  We tried to stop him over the years to no avail.  He turned 8 and the dentist said his palate was deforming due to the thumb sucking and his teeth were spacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again in vain to get him to stop, even going so far as to show him pictures of the medieval torture device they call a palate spacer.  No good.  I tried Thum, which was about as good as putting water on this thumb for all the good it did. I was losing hope that I could get him to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started doing some research and found this product.  I can not believe how fast it worked!!!  The first night I put it on, he had to keep a bottle of water next to his bed because he would start to suck his thumb in his sleep.  The taste would wake him up and he drank it to wash his mouth.  The next day, he didn&#x27;t suck his thumb at all and that night, didn&#x27;t ask for water.  I put some on again the third day but it wasn&#x27;t necessary, he had completely given up the thumb sucking!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is very potent so make sure to follow the directions and only use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a hard core thumb sucker, this is definitely the product to cure them!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. It has a very bitter taste and is absolutely the best anti-biting I ever used.</li>
            <li> I used this for my 3 year old son who kept sucking his fingers. I brushed it on the finger nails and the next time he tried to put them in his mouth those fingers came right out. I reaplied it every two days for a month and that was it. he was done sucking the fingers. he is now 7 and he has not gon back to sucking them ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed to find out this isn&#x27;t as awful as many of the reviewers made it sound. However, I do think it might be enough of a deterrent to at least make me aware that I&#x27;m biting my nails. For me, it seems to be a subconscious habit as opposed to something I know I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;ve been doing it for 25+ years and have half hazardously tried to stop several times to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important to note that just using the nail polish to kick the habit probably isn&#x27;t going to be enough. When I was younger my parents tried all these nasty polishes and I just kept trying until the bitter taste finally subsided. I was determined to keep biting so their efforts were never enough. It&#x27;s important that the nail biter WANTS to quit. This is just a tool to help aid in reminding you to reach the goal of quitting. Using it without the true desire to stop will probably not be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish tastes similar to hand sanitizer but the chemical taste lingers for several minutes longer. A glass of water will make the taste disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product IS shiny and not matte. However, after 2-3 days it will lose it&#x27;s shine. For me, the taste sticks around well after a few days primarily because I have been making a conscious effort not to bite. It&#x27;s been about a week and I think this product has helped but I still have quite a ways to go before I can say I&#x27;ve kicked the habit.</li>
            <li> My son is about to turn four and has sucked his thumb since he was a baby. This product was my last resort to get him to stop before moving onto the thumb guard contraption. I had little faith, thinking it similar to another \\&quot;paint on\\&quot; product that had no effect, but the reviews were good, so I tried it. He vomited the first time he placed his thumb in his mouth, and didn&#x27;t try again until the morning when, out of habit, he did it again. Only a gag that time around. The next day, no thumb at bed time or in the morning! I just applied it to his nail again tonight (per instructions to wait two days then reapply) and no attempts to suck his thumb again. No complaints...nothing! This is way too good to be true! I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed, but I am on cloud nine thinking his thumb sucking days might be over. So, be wary of a little sickness especially if your kid can&#x27;t make it to the toilet fast enough yet. We found out ours can...well mostly.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that this worked immediately and my three year old stopped sucking her thumb.  To people who say it&#x27;s cruel I say: thumb sucking is subconscious and what this product does is bring the process of thumb sucking to the conscious level.  My daughter liked it because it&#x27;s nail polish. I also gave her rewards when we put it on every two days.  We used it for three weeks.  She hasn&#x27;t gone back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but in this I will because the reviews that I read did help me decide to make this purchase (pay it forward concept:) I have used acrylic nails for about 10+ years and decided to remove them once and for all. My nails are weak and on top of that whenever I get nervous my fingers end up in my mouth. I have used this product for 2 weeks now and it is just as advertised. I have not chewed on my nails since!! I apply it once a week and it lasts!! The taste is horrible which serves its  purpose. I would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers were in constant pain because I never let the nails grow to a healthy length. This stuff works so well you only need a tiny bit on the end of your nail to be effective. It works so well that I actually cringe when I see someone on TV lick their fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides include being unable to floss and not being able to touch my hands to my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Upside &#x3D; MY HANDS DON&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE!</li>
            <li> My 3 year-old stopped sucking her thumb immediately!!  She was cranky for a few days, but I worked great,  after using so many other methods and failing.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4, and as active as she is it tends to rub off if not applied at least 2 times a day.  It dries quickly which is a plus.  Some reviews have said they threw up... Wow, way over the top.  It&#x27;s a taste that stays in your mouth for an hour most, to remind your brain chewing your nails is disgusting.  I have used this for 3 weeks straight and she is still biting her nails.  Product works like its supposed to, expensive in my opinion, but maybe she&#x27;s not ready to stop? I&#x27;ll use all of the bottle and hopefully it will work over time.</li>
            <li> Good product to help us start the process!! Didn&#x27;t solve the problem as my child was sucking her thumb a week later with 2 full coats of polish on each thumb. It has bn a good start.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews not lying when saying Vomit inducing. I felt I put very little on the 1st time when I lightly coat thumb nail but she threw up in the 1st 30 min. I only dabbed after that. Immediately we noticed her not putting thumbs in her mouth. Great start!! A week later I needed to apply a 1-2full coats as she got used to the product. I found her sucking her thumb in the middle of the night with a full coat on thumb nail.  Now we are using band aids around top of her thumbs &amp; only at night. Another couple of weeks &amp; we will have this licked - pun intended!</li>
            <li> It definitely is bitter and the taste lingers for awhile.  We had tried another product (Thum) to get my daughter to stop her thumb sucking but it didn&#x27;t work at all.  This worked right from the start.  She did not like the taste and so far it&#x27;s been about a week and no thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Good Lord, this stuff is bitter, I don&#x27;t doubt this will work to quit nail biting. The instructions say don&#x27;t apply to skin, but I applied it to my cuticles and fingertips and it is effective. I forgot I had it on and the taste was so bitter I puckered up and cringed. Eating something sweet (like soda) will get rid of the taste but some of it was still on my soft palate and I could taste and smell it a few hours after I had taken a chomp.</li>
            <li> I bought the Mavala Stop for my son who sucks his thumb.  I tried the stuff on my nail and it tastes awful!!  It only worked the same day I put it on his thumb.  By the  next day I guess it wears off because he is right back sucking again.  Good product but you may have to apply it everyday for good results.</li>
            <li> My 8-year-old daughter sucked her thumb since she was born. Her mother took her to an orthodontist and was about to have a $3500 appliance fitted in my daughter&#x27;s mouth to stop the habit. I bought this as a last resort, and it *worked*. We have tried all sorts of home remedies and none have been successful, but this product did the trick. She stopped sucking her thumb on the first day and hasn&#x27;t done it for a month now. I think she&#x27;s home free. Thanks Malvala. You guys did the impossible.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 2 1/2 yr old who has a habit of sucking on his 2 middle fingers, but also is constantly is sticking all of his fingers in his mouth. I mostly got this b/c of him sticking his fingers in his mouth all the time, since we have a newborn and don&#x27;t want the entire household to be sick all the time. It worked the first time I applied, but he didn&#x27;t nap that day b/c he usually sucks on his fingers to sooth him to sleep, and then said he was sick b/c of the stuff on his fingers. I left on that evening, and it took him FOREVER to go to sleep. The next day, the same thing, so I removed the w/finger nail polish remover before bedtime, because he was showing signs of having a cold. So I tried a week later after the cold was gone and it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all! He still was sucking on his fingers. I&#x27;ll try again tomorrow and see what happens....</li>
            <li> We bought Mavala Stop per the recommendation of our dentist.  Our 4 year old sucked her thumb constantly and was developing quite an overbite.  Within three days of using this she stopped.  After about a week or two of not using it I did catch her sucking her thumb one night.  The next day we painted her nails all pretty again and used the Mavala Stop as a top coat.  She hasn&#x27;t tried to suck her thumb again.  So far so good and we barely used any.  It tastes terrible but that is the point.  We are very happy with the results and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 3yrs old son. The taste was really bad so he threw up almost all the time he put his finger in his mouth. I could see this product working for an adult, but not someone so young.</li>
            <li> Finally one of these &amp;#34;no bite&amp;#34; nail polishes that actually works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had tried another brand and when my daughter put her fingers in her mouth she said &amp;#34;mmmm, tasty!&amp;#34; Let&#x27;s just say she doesn&#x27;t do that any more. She hates putting them in her mouth now, and it really does help her to remember to keep her fingers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the taste is so strong she feels the need to spit in the sink after putting her fingers in her mouth. This is probably not something you want to put on really little kids fingers, but it works great for our 4 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful for you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Stopped my 3 year old from bitting his figure nails</li>
            <li> Mother of 8... 3 of my kids sucked their thumbs.. Trust me it works.</li>
            <li> We had tried several things on our son so he would stop sucking his thumb. From the reviews we were warned that this was very strong for my son however after the first 2 days my son was fine and could bear the taste and continue sucking his thumb. I&#x27;m running out of ideas to make him quit his habit</li>
            <li> Im 26 and ive been biting my nails bad, to where they bleed for as long as i can remember. Ive had this stuff for  almost  a week amd i havent touched my nails. Ive only applied it 2 times. The taste is disgusting and stays in ur mouth for quite a bit. It makes u think fast about putting ur fingers in your mouth. I would 100%recommend this product. Ive tried orly no bite but i could just bite through the taste with no problem. With this stuff there is no chance in hell im biting through this stuff. Only negative thing is even just the slightest touch of your lip, and u have that taste there for a while, which i just apply some chapstick over if that happens. And also if u dont watch how u eat your finger food it will get on it and into your mouth. But for me its totally worth it to kick this disgusting habit</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 ur old who sucks her finger. I read the reviews and was very cautious at how I put it on her fingers. I just put it on the tip of the nail but it still made my daughter throw up. However it did work. She does not put her finger in her mouth before going to bed. There have been times that she wakes up and forgets and puts her finger in her mouth and wakes up crying bc of the bad taste. She also gets out of bed earlier bc she doesn&#x27;t lie in her bed and just suck her finger in the am. However, I did have to reapply everyday instead of every 2 days. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars bc it does work but it does stink to know that you are the cause of making your child get sick. Be prepared.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 5yo who has been nail biting since 2. 😖 She did say it tasted gross, however she must be too stubborn. Very disappointed after reading such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for over twenty years and tried one other nail polish product.  I got used to the taste of the other polish but this one is absolutely horrible.  Sometimes during flossing I will inadvertently touch the inside of my mouth and I lose my mind.  I do wish it would last more than two days, though.</li>
            <li> This product deff has a really really bad taste - plus it lingers in your mouth. The only problem is if you eat anything with your hands (chicken fingers, sandwiches) its impossible not to get this in your mouth which basically makes the food taste really bad. If it wasn&#x27;t for this I would love it. So unfortunately, i&#x27;m going to have to stop using it. Its way too intense.</li>
            <li> The taste is harsh.  Very strong and difficult to get the taste out of your mouth.  I guess that&#x27;s the point though.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 8 yr old son!! Took about 3 applications to stop the nail biting!</li>
            <li> I am a nail biter of 27yrs and I am determined to stop because I noticed my 2yr old starting to bite hers. I have tried it all. But this stuff is so bitter. I apply it once a day and my nails are really starting to grow.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very small bottle but it only takes a little bit so it last a long time if you need.&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall is that it gets on everything your fingers touch. So I had to alter the way I did some of the things for my kids like their foods. I could not touch anything they are with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;So give up finger foods for a few weeks while you fight the habit.&lt;br /&gt;I have used so many other products and they never work. Mavala Stop works!! I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can give it less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My 6-year old continues to bite his nails even with multiple coats of this on. He says it doesn&#x27;t taste bad. Guess we&#x27;ll move on to something stronger!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 10 yr old thumb ducking lord knows how much I wanted it too</li>
            <li> It definitely deterred him for a while, but I find that I have to put it on his thumbnail 2-3 times per day.</li>
            <li> None of the store products worked so we tried this.  It worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE WAS HALF EMPTY..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried one or two other thumb sucking deterrents but this is the best! We&#x27;ve used it with our daughter (5) and son (3.5) and it has really helped. Just a little drop will do. Be careful, though, not to get it on the pads of fingers or else anything they touch while eating/brushing teeth will taste aweful! In my experience, we just need to be consistent and use it nightly. As long as it&#x27;s on, there is no thumb or finger sucking.  I&#x27;m hoping that my daughter&#x27;s urge to suck her thumb or finger will dissipate over time, but at least we can help her control the behavior with Mavala Stop. For my son, just the thought that it&#x27;s on his finger is enough! It&#x27;s not traumatizing, just not something they want in their mouths. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.This product definitely has helped my daughter break the thumb sucking habit.It worked first time we put it on.</li>
            <li> This helped very much! I tried everything OTC and even hot sauces but my daughter still kept sucking her 2 fingers so her doctor said to try this and OMFG IT WORKED! Just put on a very tiny amount! It is very strong! I tried it my self and it tastes nasty. It took my daughter 1 week to stop but I still put a little every other day just in case she might want to start up again. I swear by this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I tried everything with my daughter.  And I mean everything (!) to get her to stop sucking her thumb.  I heard about this from another mother, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well.  I don&#x27;t know what it tastes like, but it must taste pretty bad, because my daughter ran to the bathroom and drank a whole bunch of water after she put her thumb in her mouth!  She stopped within a day.  I kept it on her thumb for a week, just to be sure the habit was broken, but it was more like 24 hours and she was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else - this is perfect!</li>
            <li> My kids are still sucking there finger to the point I put it on their fingers everyday and still they continued. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I sucked my fingers till I was 12 so when my son started sucking his fingers we tried to get him to stop but nothing worked. He would suck \\&quot;thum\\&quot; off and not even flinch so with him being in 1st grade we need him to stop immediately. This product stopped it the first day! It has also helped with the booger eating issue too. Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail bitter since I was young, and I&#x27;ve always wanted to stop so I bought this product. I put it on and it went on nice and clear. However, when it came time to floss, the nasty taste got in my mouth. I thought that because the nail polish was on my nails, I would still be able to floss as long as I didn&#x27;t put the floss around my nails. Unfortunately, somehow the nasty taste got onto my floss! I can&#x27;t do without flossing at least before I go to bed, and so I had to remove the nail polish with nail polish remover and then floss. I put the Mavala Stop on my nails the next day but I had the same issue when I tried to floss. I couldn&#x27;t deal with it so I stopped using it. My mom wanted to try Mavala too. I didn&#x27;t tell her about my flossing problem and I allowed her to try it. She also complained about the flossing problem and stopped using it after one try! And she also said that finger foods tasted terrible because the taste go onto them as well. Since most young children do not floss, they will probably not have the flossing complaint I have. I am glad that this product has worked for so many children and adults, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with it. I&#x27;ll have to look for another solution. Right now I am trying willpower because I know that Mavala Stop will be too much of a problem when it comes to flossing. I bought this product for $11 and I am disappointed that I paid so much and now have this nail polish that didn&#x27;t solve my problem. If anyone has any recommendations for me, please share.</li>
            <li> This product does what is states it will do but I can&#x27;t use it for my boys because it leaves too much of a shine on their nails. One student at school asked my son if he had nail polish on!?! I can&#x27;t use it on them and need to find another product with no shine.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this for me because he&#x27;s so sick of always seeing my picking at and biting my nails. My parents, at this point, have given up all hope. I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this but it&#x27;s only respectful to at least try a product that is given to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply... disgusting. Wretched. Dear God why... My boyfriend told me about some of the reviews so the first day I was REAL good about not biting them, which incidentally makes me not want to pick at them either because of the temptation that brings to bite them. First thing this morning, without even thinking about it, I went to bite of the smallest little piece of nail. I didn&#x27;t even realize I was doing it but that God-awful taste sent a shocking inexplicable surge. My immediate reaction was to spit into a cup but I didn&#x27;t have one so I spit down onto my feet, which I&#x27;m pretty sure scared my passenger-boyfriend. It certainly makes me a lot more conscious of how often I bite them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the taste, but I would say more like a chemical taste. It kind of burns for about 30 seconds, but not like an acid burn. The only down side is that since my habit was so bad, I kept doing it by accident and my sense of taste was altered for most of the first couple of days because I had basically embedded it into my lips and tongue. But I can honestly say, after about 20 years of nail biting it actually is becoming rapidly less appealing to me. I&#x27;m not getting the same enjoyment at all, and quickly becoming conditioned to equate nail biting with BAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on real shiny and clear and really does last for two days as advertised, but it does start losing a little of its potency so I&#x27;ve been applying it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review. This product has already helped me a lot in the last few days, and is more jarring than when my mom and boyfriend smack me for doing it. I can only imagine how it is for little kids that suck their thumbs.</li>
            <li> Used this to help my son stop sucking his thumb. After only a day, day and half he stopped. He is so proud of himself now that he had broken that habit.</li>
            <li> We put this on our daughters nails and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  Make sure you only put in on the nails.  Some of it got on her fingers and made her sandwich taste bad.</li>
            <li> My friend little girl was adduced to suckin her thumb for 2 years. However, as son as she was introduced to Nacala she hasn&#x27;t sucked it since, she tried but the taste was too nasty. Ill admit it is very nasty I had the taste n my mouth for lik min b4 I could get rid of it so buy buy buy the product. If your child can suck the thumb knowing it has the stuff on her thumb then the child it&#x27;s tough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself for not giving this a shot a couple years ago- to help break my nine year old of thumb sucking...yes, he&#x27;s nine!  He stopped immediately and has never gone back.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> my boyfriend always bit up his nails and I put this product on his nails. he has stopped biting his nails after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the market to stop fingernail biting or thumb sucking.  I have been a fingernail biter for a long time.  You won&#x27;t do it more than a couple of times if you put this on your fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is bitter and long lasting.  It&#x27;s meant to stop you in your tracks and leave a lingering reminder to not be stupid and try and put your finger or thumb in your mouth again.  It takes a while to get the taste out for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my son to stop his finger sucking.  Two coats work better than one and it lasts about 3-4 days with full \\&quot;flavor\\&quot;. Reapply afterwards.  It only takes a few weeks if you stick with it and the thumb sucking/fingernail biting goes away.</li>
            <li> I have really mixed feelings about this product. So far it has really helped me not bite my nails because of the terrible taste. However, I can&#x27;t even eat finger foods anymore because I can taste it even after not using it for a couple days. Chips and Guac Gone...Cereal Gone..I hope once my nails grow out the taste will eventually go away because I can&#x27;t take much more of this. My brother used this too to stop biting his nails and the same thing happened to him. He won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my 3 year old is either too young or too stuborn. However, he sucked this thing right off, told me it was awful tasting but kept right on. I know they say that the young children may not have their taste buds fully developed yet so I will wait another 6 months and try again.</li>
            <li> I have a real need to stop biting my nails. This will do it. The only problem is if you do put your fingers in your mouth, the taste transfers to your lips and stays there.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! I have struggled my whole life with nail biting. It was always so embersing to have chewed nails and gross cuticles. It helped me stop immediately and I haven&#x27;t since. It tastes awful! The taste stays in your mouth, and coats you lips, which is good if you truly want to break the habit. I would recommend this to everyone who bites their nails. It is one of the best things I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingernails continue to grow whenever the nail polish is applied to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it did not prevent my habit of biting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the nail polish comes off my fingernails, I go back to my old habit of chewing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will still recommend the product however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip: only apply nail polish to the tip of the fingernails. Will prevent your fingernails from shinning which can be awkward if you are a guy (it also saves a lot more nail polish for continual use).</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the good reviews. I am a horrible nail biter and have been since I was a kid (I&#x27;m 38 now). Mavala Stop is just ok. The problem I have with it is that it wears off too easily and too quickly. When it&#x27;s first applied, it is effective. But you need to reapply it more often than I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead I recommend a very similar product called \\&quot;Bite It\\&quot; that you can buy at CVS for $4.99. It lasts longer and is equally effective, not to mention less expensive. You can also buy it on Amazon too, but it is much more expensive than at CVS. Here is the amazon product link: [[ASIN:B0084U5TEU Bite It the Easy Way to Stop Nail Biting]]</li>
            <li> oMG  this product works!! Knowing how much germs and sickness is passed around in preschool, I was stressed and desperate to help My 3 yr old stop sucking her thumb. Definitely strong stuff, so you only need a little for tip of nail. I prepped my daughter a few days in advance before using the product... Telling her how much she&#x27;s growing....and that one day a her thumb is not going to taste good anymore.... That a fairy will come at night and sprinkle her fairy dust to make her grow up.  While she was fast asleep, I put just BARELY a little on. Sure enough, she woke up crying, saying her thumb didn&#x27;t taste good, almost threw up...but eventually I calmed her and reminded her that the fairy came. And she was happy, and acknowledged that she must be growing up.  In less than a week, she stopped. My bottle was barely used!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible taste is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does wash off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to remind me to keep my fingers out of my mouth and this is perfect.  I don&#x27;t always realize that I am putting my hands in my mouth.  It&#x27;s a very absentminded habit.  With the Mavala, I don&#x27;t pick at the nails, bite them, or use my fingers to pick at my teeth.  It helps me be more polite all around.</li>
            <li> Helped my nearing 3yr old to stop sucking his thumb in just a week or two.  However, we did have to use more on the knuckle of his thumb as well as his nail because he would still suck his thumb occasionally, but the added mavala stop put an end to it pretty quickly. He sucked his thumb from birth and after no more than 2 weeks he was completely thumb free!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!  My kid is 11 years old and has had this habit since birth, it was getting to the point where it was affecting his speech and the shape of his mouth.  We are now at day 40 and no relapse, only had to put in on every other day and IT WORKED PERFECTLY!!!</li>
            <li> I used it on my 6 year old and 4 year old and by the end of the week they were both broken of sucking their thumbs.</li>
            <li> I used Mavala Stop on my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s thumb and she finally quit sucking her thumb for good since the first application.  I put it on her thumb for 4 days, and that&#x27;s all it took.  Great product.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product on our 3 year old son since December 8, 2012. Once we put it on, just a little bit, he tasted it once and has not sucked his thumb since that day. It took a few nights for him to get adjusted to falling asleep without sucking his thumb, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bad. It may have also worked because I discussed with him that he needed to stop sucking his thumb and that we were going to buy something to help him. He kept asking me when we were going to buy this product, so he was ready to stop sucking his thumb and just needed some help. We haven&#x27;t stopped yet, because we fear that if we stop too soon, he might revert. I think we will do this for another month. Overall I am very please so far and this was way less expensive and cumbersome than those thumb guard contraptions. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to help their child to stop sucking their thumb. It&#x27;s a good first step rather than going straight to the thumb guard contraptions. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product works incredibly well.  It is funny because most people don&#x27;t believe it could be that bad so they&#x27;ll let my daughter put her finger in their mouth...it takes about 10 seconds or so before they&#x27;re trying to find something to drink or eat to get rid of the taste :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware that it will cause problems eating with your hands if you let your fingernails touch your mouth...everything will taste horrible.</li>
            <li> I am 26 and have been chewing my nails all of my life. Chewing them until they hurt. This product worked 100%. I didn&#x27;t think the taste would stop me, but it is a punishingly disgusting taste that lingers. I really really recommend this for nail biters.</li>
            <li> My child started projectile vomiting after tasting this product on her nails. I have done what was stated in the manual would remove it by using nail polish remover but that did not work.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to me for my 6 year old daughter who loves her thumb.  I bought it and then let my daughter tell me when she wanted to try it.  She actually put it on herself.  The first night she was up a couple times to get a drink to take the taste away.  (Try it out on yourself first...it is horrific and it stays on for days!  It does not wash off.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been sucking her index and middle fingers on her left hand since virtualy birh (now 4 1/2).  The mavala stop keeps her from sucking them for 3-4 days before we re-apply.  Application is as easy as normal nail polish and her habit is slowly getting broken.</li>
            <li> WOW! I have a 4 y.o. who sucks his thumb. It is a nasty habit and had to be stopped. I heard a lot about Mavala and ordered it with big hopes he will stop this terrible habit. It took him one time to taste Mavala - and voila, no more sucking. We are talking about hours not days. I still apply it in case he reverses, but so far no sucking. I tried the product - it tastes very bitter. Thank you, Mavala!</li>
            <li> I have two kids aged 8 &amp; 10 who I am using this product for.  One needs to stop thumb sucking and the other needs to stop nail biting.  Mavala has been wonderful for both purposes.  I would recommend this product for other kids who are ready to get help breaking &amp;#34;hand in mouth&amp;#34; habits.  We sill keep using until we achieve success!</li>
            <li> The dentist was putting pressure on us to help our 3 year old stop sucking his fingers.  For a while we kept trying to remind him, but it never worked and he just felt bad.  We were desperate and decided to try this.  I got his buy-in prior to putting this on his fingers.  We have been applying it for about 3 weeks now.  We apply it after bath (3 nights per week) and it works great!  It is just like clear nail polish; you cannot see it on his fingers.  Every now and then he puts his finger subconsciously in his mouth, but removes it immediately.  Yes I tried it....it tastes horrible!  My son is very proud of his success.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> We only had to use this twice before my 11 year old daughter quit sucking her fingers. That said, I am not sure it was really the Mavala Stop that did it so much as her orthodontist telling her she would end up with so much damage they would have to do painful surgery to correct it. That really motivated her; the M.S. was more of a reminder not to do it (like when asleep). As many others have said, it DOES make finger food taste terrrible.</li>
            <li> Tryed other brands that didnt work. This brand did the trick. We now have a little girl who doesnt bite her nails. Sucess!</li>
            <li> My two year old daughter immediately stopped sucking her thumb after using this. I also ordered the Berestain Bears book &amp;#34;Bad Habit&amp;#34; and I read it to her daily, a week before I used Mavala Stop. (I replaced the story plot with &amp;#34;sucking her thumb&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;biting her nails&amp;#34;.) She LOVES getting her nails painted but I never paint her thumb because of her thumb sucking. With that being said, I told her that I can FINALLY PAINT HER THUMB and she was ecstatic! I painted her nail with the mavala stop and her other nails pink. I told her that the mavala stop will help her be all done sucking her thumb. She skeptically looked at me and didn&#x27;t fully understand until she tried to suck her thumb at nap time. She tasted the BITTER taste and immediately took her thumb out. I told her that it was spicy and that she needs to keep it out of her mouth. She was extremely moody the entire day, as thumb sucking is her way to soothe herself if she is upset, but after day one: her thumb REMAINED OUT OF HER MOUTH! I have had it over a week and I only apply it every other day because she is officially done, but I want the taste still there JUST IN CASE. Overall I rate this product a 5 because it does the trick! It is not designed for children who are not aware of their problem. It is designed more of a REMINDER for those kids who know they shouldn&#x27;t be sucking.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old sucked his thumb constantly, no other trick had worked. Then someone recommended this stuff to me. We put it on his thumb nail one evening six months ago and he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb since then.</li>
            <li> I am a 20 year old male who is trying to stop biting his nails. I finally decided it was a nasty habit, and it was time to stop. This stuff tastes awful. Truly, it should not be used with young children if you don&#x27;t want to chance them not liking any food they eat and accidentally touch their fingernails to their mouth. The first time I put my fingernail in my mouth after I did this I immediately used another fingernail to try and scratch the taste off of my tongue. The result was about ten minutes of washing my mouth out, and about an hour of regret. I can still recall vividly the situation, months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is only the first step in stopping to bite your fingernails. As long as you wear this nail polish, you won&#x27;t bite them. However, if you don&#x27;t use the time to build up good habits of cutting them, you will go right back to biting them as soon as you stop. I made the poor choice of having my fingernail scissors in a difficult to get to location. I almost immediately regressed back into fingernail biting. I have enough control due to the substance that I have been able to use scissors most of the time now that I have relocated them, but I still bite my nails occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note of warning, if you like to lick your fingers after eating popcorn or chips, you will not be able to for the entire duration of this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works, if used correctly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can fail to work if good habits aren&#x27;t put in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neutral facts:&lt;br /&gt;Tastes AWFUL&lt;br /&gt;will not be able to put fingers near mouth for any reason&lt;br /&gt;you eventually get a little bit used to the taste due to small amounts getting near lips or on things that go in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This stopped my 3 yeard old from sucking her thumb in just a few days. The first couple of nights were rough because the taste is pretty awful, but all in all it worked when so many other methods had failed!</li>
            <li> My husband has had a life-long habit of biting his knuckles...which not only drives me crazy, but his gnawing just leaves gateways for all those nasty germs that are out there to hop on in.  I kept threatening him with getting this stuff (I remember my Aunt used this - or something similar - to break her kid of the finger sucking habit).....I finally bought it and I have to say, even though this is the first day we&#x27;ve used it, the taste is just gross enough for him to keep his fingers out of his mouth!! Works for me....he&#x27;ll probably start trying to chew on his knee or something....but I&#x27;m not above putting Mavala Stop there too should I have to!! ;-)  SO I&#x27;m here to say this works for any age (cause my big baby&#x27;s in his mid 40&#x27;s!!)</li>
            <li> This works real well. My daughter didn&#x27;t like the taste n her nails did grow fairly quick too.</li>
            <li> We used this to stop thumbsucking.  Our orthodontist recommended it.  According to the kids it has a disgusting taste, which is great because it works.</li>
            <li> Only had to use this solution twice to get rid of my skin biting. Amazed at how effective this product is. Mind you I&#x27;ve had this bad habit for 10+ years! Was able to break out of it in 2 weeks time!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best anti-nail biting product I have tried.  Tastes dreadful and after a few &amp;#34;forgetful&amp;#34; tastes, I completely stopped messing with my nails. I have nails for the first time in 30 years!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried almost everything on my daughter, who will just go and rinse off or wipe off what I placed on her thumb. Just within a couple of days not she was thumb sucking free. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I have bit my fingernails for years and this stuff is so vile I can&#x27;t stand to put my fingers anywhere near my mouth. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have an eight year old and a six year old who have sucked their thumbs since they were newborns. This worked immediately. No More Thumb Sucking! :-) :-)</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly. My five-year-old lifetime thumb sucker quit after one application. However, we still applied more to ensure there wasn&#x27;t a relapse.</li>
            <li> Loved this product, my youngest daughter sucked her index and middle finger a lot and my oldest daughter bites her nails, this made both of them stop within a day. Two years later and they haven&#x27;t done it anymore.</li>
            <li> One application is all it took for my 14 year old son.  He now has some nails.</li>
            <li> worked for a short period of time them went back at it again!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> I never thought my son would stop sucking his two middle fingers and I even had my doubts about buying this product but only after one use my son stopped the sucking. Mavala is a miracle worker and I am amazed at it success. Of course with the first use my son started throwing up, screaming, and crying from the horrible taste but having his mom next to him the whole time comforting him and helping him to get through the night without his fingers made things much easier for him. Mavala has such a horrible taste that he does not dare to put his fingers even near his mouth.</li>
            <li> Only took one coat on my daughter&#x27;s thumb to stop her from sucking her thumb! I was totally amazed that it actually worked and I am so relieved. I highly recommend this to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing!! My daughter sucked her thumb all the time until she was 7, and nothing would break her of it until I found this product!! Mavala Stop broke her of it in 3 days!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it!! I tasted it &amp; it is totally disgusting!! I put some on my friends&#x27; daughters&#x27; thumb &amp; she quit after the first application as well!!! You Must Buy This!!!</li>
            <li> my 4 year old wont stop, tried everything and I mean everything. other than a glove pinned to him 24-7. the dentists told me to get this. well at first he hated it even threw up. I thought perfect. but then he liked the taste and instead of every other day I have to put it on every other hour. I guess its an orthodontic thumb guard in his future.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old son has chewed his nails for 10+ years. I think this is finally going to help him break this nasty habit!! It has only been one week, but I haven&#x27;t seen fingers in the mouth, as this stuff is really nasty.</li>
            <li> My daughter just won&#x27;t stop picking her nose, and I&#x27;ve tried so many incentives and threats. She just can&#x27;t seem to help herself, and agreed to try this. I put some on my own fingernail in solidarity, and when I licked my finger after eating a snack I got to see how vile this stuff is, as I had to try rubbing my tongue on my sleeve to get rid of the taste. I was afraid when I picked my daughter up from school that she would be mad or tearful about having spent the day with it on her nails. Fortunately she was able to laugh about it, and our shared disgust with the taste had us both in stitches. It hasn&#x27;t trained her to stop the compulsive picking, but when I use it on her she does keep her fingers out of her mouth. I also found another benefit; I have a conure that likes to give a hard bite when he doesn&#x27;t want to step-up, and sometimes he won&#x27;t let go. I coated my finger with this and when he went to bite me he let go a lot quicker and chose not to bite me again when Inext asked him to step-up. His expression also said he found the flavor rather yucky. I noticed him running his feathers through his mouth for a while afterwards, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dentist suggested this after THREE years of trying everything you can think of under the sun to get her to stop sucking her finger (something she has literally been doing since being in the womb-got ultrasound pics to prove it).  I talked to her about it as soon as I placed the order to get her ready for it and when it came I let her paint it on herself.  She&#x27;s six so she was about ready to drop this habit, but just couldn&#x27;t do it on her own.  The first time she put her finger in her mouth she came straight to me and told me it was awful, but she didn&#x27;t do it again.  I even sat up watching her sleep one night and she would stick her finger up to her face, but not once did it go in her mouth-and that was IN HER SLEEP!!!!!!  I am so proud of her and THANKFUL for this miracle product!  Six years of finger sucking CURED in literally TWO DAYS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If I put it on my daughter after she falls asleep it seems to work. But she won&#x27;t let me put it on when she is awake. It I put it on at night, it is ineffective by morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rough couple of days in the beginning but it&#x27;s worth it.  It has been a few weeks now and we reapply every couple of days on the nails just in case she tries to suck her thumbs.  (We actually do this when she is sleeping.)  Our daughter is almost 4 and had we heard about this product earlier we would have done it a little sooner maybe 2 1/2 or 3 years old.  However I&#x27;m glad we got it done as soon as we did.  At almost 4 she shouldn&#x27;t really remember the trauma of it when she is older.  Beware it is sad to see them have to go through it but I think it would be more sad to see them come home from school crying because they got picked on for sucking their thumb!</li>
            <li> Its a fantastic deterrent for nail biting. I like that it doesn&#x27;t start off right away or after one hand washing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t taste the nasty taste for about ten or fifteen seconds...too late!  Nail already bitten.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say they will send you a program on request to help you quit biting your nails in 33 days.  I requested but am still waiting for the plan or an acknowledgement of my request.  Maybe they meant they would send the program in 33 days.</li>
            <li> No for thumbsucking, but 3 year old like to bite wrist when frustrated.  A teeny tiny bit goes a LONG WAY!  Now no more biting! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> My daughter hated it but stopped sucking her thumb after 2 or 3 times. You won&#x27;t regret it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Our 2 yr old daughter would constantly suck her two fingers (middle and ring) until we used this product. I was about to buy the expensive plastic glove thing, but ended up using this instead. She stopped sucking her fingers almost instantly! We had to apply it about 3 times before she completely stopped (it would wear off in about 2-3 days or so and she would start sucking her fingers again). She said &#x27;Yucky!&#x27;. My wife was worried I was being cruel, so, I tried some. The taste? Like very burnt horrible stale coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Her speech has markedly improved, as well as her attitude. What a difference!</li>
            <li> My fiance insisted I buy this for his niece as he can not stand the sight of her chewing on her fingers all the time.  She will be going to school soon and we hoped this would stop a bad and nasty habit.  I applied the product several times and she said it did indeed taste horrible.  However, after a few times, she began to bite her nails anyway.  She said it tasted bad but, would often just keep doing it with a disgusted look on her face.  I do believe this product would work for any child that isn&#x27;t so insanely stubborn.  I think she just needs an attitude adjustment but, she isn&#x27;t my child lol.</li>
            <li> We purchased Mavala Stop to help both our almost 3 yr old daughter quit sucking her thumb and our 4 yr old son to stop biting his nails and fingers. This product has successful stopped both completely. We have been using it for a week, applying liberally every 1-2 days and the kids hate the taste and thus do not bite or suck on their fingers! I am truly relieved to have stopped these bad habits early on. I will continue to apply Mavala every 1-2 days to for a while to make sure they don&#x27;t start again.</li>
            <li> I tried various stuff to stop my daughter&#x27;s thump sucking, nothing helped. She stopped within 2 weeks. I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old sucks her thumb non stop. This product doesn&#x27;t stop her. It does taste awful. I think it would work with adult but not kid.</li>
            <li> The product leaves more of an after taste.  I don&#x27;t realize I&#x27;m biting my nails until I&#x27;ve already taken the first bite, then I can&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth for an hour.</li>
            <li> I have a 19 year old niece that has been struggling with her nails since she was a little girl and she tried several things but this one was the only product that really helped her! But you have to re apply as soon as the taste is gone... She loves her nails now! and it&#x27;s been a year since she started using it!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my 8 year old girl too as she started doing that when the school started this year... and it worked great as I started right away!!!! She hates it! but that is what makes it effective!</li>
            <li> it works!! it really does!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great so far...</li>
            <li> works great for about three days then need to re-apply</li>
            <li> This works great. The kid tried to suck her thumb about 4 times (had to brush her teeth after each try) but it greatly reduced the thumb sucking in a matter of a couple of weeks. Had to keep applying it until it really sank in. But know that kids are smart haha. She learned that if she couldn&#x27;t smell it, it wasn&#x27;t on. We just gave her the option that she can try not to do it on her own, but if she does it again, we have to apply it. Only had to do it a couple more times. She is doing great now :-) This really does help.</li>
            <li> It works well. Wish bought it earlier.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! The taste is absolutely horrible therefore, it was a great deterrent to thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> it was crazy bitter as promised, and it really helped my stop biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Got my husband to stop cold turkey</li>
            <li> Really strong! Much better than the Thum stuff at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Initially, I was worried that my girlfriend&#x27;s monsterous child would become addicted to the awful taste, but it deterred her from biting her fingernails...and toe nails!  What kind of kid bites their toe nails!!?  Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> This absolutely tastes terrible and worked for a short time to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Tastes foul&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;She got used to the bad taste after two days and started sucking her thumb again</li>
            <li> is doing SO well using this product! Our dentist recommended it and I&#x27;m SO thankful!! He started sucking his thumb at 6 months old and now at 6 years old and losing his first tooth I became desperate to help him stop (before those permanent teeth came in). He still says he can&#x27;t wait to stop using it so he can suck his thumb again, but I told him I&#x27;d put it on him till he was married if I had to! LOL  Well worth your money!</li>
            <li> Apply it once a week and it lasts for the entire time. Tastes terrible. Its a great deterrent for my thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything to get our son to stop sucking his thumb and finally someone told us about this. Our son tried to suck his thumb after we had put this on and it was a pretty rough hour or two while he really struggled with the terrible taste but he has not sucked his thumb since! I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time with anything else!</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my 10 year old son.  A bit hard at first as he could not eat with his hands at all, would get in his mouth even when he was not biting his nails.  But...he stuck it out.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My daughter said it does not taste good but she continue to sucks her thumb.  did not work for us.</li>
            <li> worked quickly to help my 4/5 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of stop-bite and none compare to Mavala.  It&#x27;s got a flavor that has to be munched on to believe.  You sure won&#x27;t wanna taste it ever again.</li>
            <li> I bought it in the hopes of curing my 3-year-old from sucking her thumb.  No luck.  She finds the whole thing fun, and asks me everyday to put the nail polish on her so she could taste it!</li>
            <li> Heard this worked for others but my 2 thumb suckers, age 7, just endured the bad taste until it was gone.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from my daughters orthodontist.  Her first application was hilarious are putting it on my daughters thumb as she didn&#x27;t even suck her thumb but somehow got a taste of it in her mouth not knowing what it from was spitting all over the floor.  It took one application and she said she was done sucking her thumb, but we still applied it every other day for a week.  We&#x27;re pleased to say that within one week out 6 1/2 year old whom sucked her thumb a lot to the point she created a major overbite is no longer sucking her thumb.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It has almost got my son from bitting his nails.. but he still bits them sometimes.. I would tell friends about this</li>
            <li> I used this on my child when he was about 4 years old because he would occasional suck his thumb and it broke him of the habit in about 8 days.  Well now that same child is in high school with the pressures of essays and test and sports so he is now a nail biter.  Well this time it worked in 2 days.  I applied on Friday night and by Sunday no nail biting. You will simply have to keep applying because eventually comes off like nail polish, but this definitely works.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son bites the skin off of the back of his fingers, mainly his pointer finger. I couldn&#x27;t find anything to stop that directly, but decided to try Mavala since I figured he would get his nails in his mouth as well while chewing on his fingers. It works.  Lately I have been putting Mavala all over his finger tips. I am sure it wears off of skin pretty quickly as opposed to nails, but it is doing the trick. He hates it and now fights me when I need to reapply it because he knows he cannot succumb to his habit when it is applied. I am truly happy with this product. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because we haven&#x27;t fully cured the problem yet. I am hoping that after using this for a while, the habit will subside.</li>
            <li> I am 29 and have bitten my nails since 2nd grade.  I am also a germaphobe and figure that, if I can control myself enough to wait until after I wash my hands to bite my nails, I should be able to stop with a little discouragement from this product!  This stuff does work because it is GROSS tasting to an extreme.  However, as an elementary school teacher, I would NOT put this stuff on a child.  The taste is so strong that even sampling cheese or eating a cracker with your hands will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  That wouldn&#x27;t normally be an issue, but I have found this stuff to give me a sore throat akin to strep in severity.  It is awful.  Even weeks in, after I put my fingers in my mouth considerably less, I have a terribly sore throat.  I can&#x27;t imagine doing this to a child.</li>
            <li> This product totally works! My daughter has been sucking her thumb since she was a baby.  She agreed that she would stop sucking her thumb when she turned 4, but two weeks after her 4th birthday she was still having trouble stopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could she that she wanted to stop and most likely just needed a little help.  Mavala did the trick, by day two she was done sucking her thumb. We were amazed since she wasn&#x27;t an occasional thumb sucker, she did it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never was it stressful or hard. My daughter was able to stop on her own with the help of this product and no one had to nag or push her to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Worked within a week for my 10 year old for a thumb sucking kid.  A sure recommend from a pediatrician</li>
            <li> The first time we used this on my daughter, it was 2 weeks of no thumb sucking before it started to wear off and had to be reapplied.  Since then we&#x27;ve only reapplied it twice and I haven&#x27;t seen her sucking her thumb in weeks!  We tried everything before this and nothing worked until we bought the Mavala Stop.  Well worth the price of the bottle and then some!</li>
            <li> Works.  Taste lingers  But you must apply every 2 days to make sure it hasn&#x27;t chipped off. But definitely works.</li>
            <li> You will achieve your goal as long as you don&#x27;t stop applying for months to truly break this habit. The taste it appropriately terrible and does not come off after one hand wash. This product will essentially condition you, if you unconsciously chew like I do, to stop yourself.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a MAJOR thumbsucker - and I was skeptical. I painted her thumbs and painted my own to be sympathetic. This stuff tastes terrible and boy you really do all you can quick to keep it from entering your mouth. Within 5 days I must say she stopped completely sucking her thumb - and it has been 4 years since! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My  3 yeard dauther leave the thum sucking since the first day, I put Mavala each 2 dya for 10 days, this really work!!! I never thou my litter will leave this habiat in only 1 week, thak you very much for  selling this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend because i wanted him to stop biting his nails. he bet me $20 it wouldn&#x27;t work... im $20 richer now ;) i would paint it on his nails 2-3 times a week. he hated the taste.... BUT it works like magic and now he doesn&#x27;t wear it anymore and he still doesn&#x27;t bite his nails :) this was a win-win product!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old had been broken of the thumb sucking habit expect during the night.  That one was a toughie.  We tried taking things away from her to get her to stop.  That of course did nothing but upset everyone.  Her thumb is such a shredded mess from her sucking, not to mention how her teeth are moving as well.  I didn&#x27;t want to go the thumb guard or glove route, I was worried about her hurting herself or just taking the glove off.  So I decided to get this for her and only put a little bit on her thumb nail the first night.  I had read some other reviews about the kids getting sick from it so I didn&#x27;t want to push it.  I had her put her thumb in her mouth to taste it after it dried.  She said it tasted yucky.  Well, I worked like a charm until I forgot to apply it the second day.  That every 2 days is important.  Now I just coat the entire nail.  As long as we keep reapplying every 2 days, she should be good.  It&#x27;s important to note that she does want to stop, so I think that helps some.</li>
            <li> My daughter quit sucking her fingers instantly.  I continued to put in on her fingers for 3 weeks, but she honestly quit in the first day. Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff taste terrible and I try to apply it every day - it definitely helped me stop my bad habit!</li>
            <li> We have tried other similar pruducts but this one has worked best. Wd have learned that the younger they are the less developed the tastebuds, so it can be very hard to discourage very small kids.</li>
            <li> I bought this for  my six year old. it was not sealed  in any way and the box looked like a sticker price  was removed.</li>
            <li> My three year old sucks her two fingers and we have tried everything.  This stuff certainly tastes bad, but she would still be sucking her fingers in the morning.  My guess is it would work better with other kids, but no luck with mine.</li>
            <li> My daughter just went to her first dental appointment and the doctor advised she stop sucking hey thumb immediately. We have been discouraging her from sucking her thumb for months but although she knows it&#x27;s bad for her teeth and she doesn&#x27;t want to do it, comfort prevails and she continued the bad habit. We bought her a book, showed her pictures of crooked teeth from thumb sucking, and tried to put colorful band aids on her thumbs. She liked the bandaid but eventually would pull them off and suck. I would even try to hold her down with her arms away from her face so she would fall asleep without sucking. I was hesitant to try this because I thought it would be cruel but after trying so many things, just decided to go for it. She liked putting the polish on and even asks for more but we only put it on her thumbs because the taste does come off on food and she still sometimes finger feeds.  It was funny watching her the first time she tried to suck and hard not to pretend something was different. Eventually that day she asked me to wash her fingers off. But we told her it would help her stop. And it did. I found we had to reapply once a day. I tested it on my pinky and it lost its effectiveness by end of day. She is sleeping now without sucking although it does seem harder to put her down because she doesn&#x27;t have a comfort mechanism now. She asks for story after story.... But it has worked. I will continue to apply for another week to make sure she&#x27;s weaned completely.</li>
            <li> If you want to stop your child from sucking there thumb, this is the product to use. Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else. My little boy had a terrible problem, we even had our dentist install an appliance in his mouth with no luck. Mavala stop him from sucking his thumb in less then one week. it also stop my seventeen year old from chewing his finger nailing. Seriously folks for ten bucks stop reading my review and buy some. It really works.</li>
            <li> This item was fantastic.  It helped me in a matter of days.  I must be a good responder though as I have heard of other people still having problems after using similar deterrents.  So, not sure if it will work well for everybody but it certainly did the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son first off it didn&#x27;t stop him at all. When I put it on him I also put ONE swipe on my nail to see how it worked or tasted. I understand it&#x27;s supposed to taste bad. The taste was not what I expect it. It wasn&#x27;t like you put her finger in your mouth you taste it. Everything your hand touches gets covered in it. With ONE swipe on my finger I tasted it for DAYS on everything. It made all my food taste bad, I couldn&#x27;t lick my lips or put anything in my mouth with my hands. I could see why it didn&#x27;t help with thumb sucking since I couldn&#x27;t tell what was causing it. So there is no way a child could go, Gosh my finger tastes bad it was like Everything in the world tastes bad. My snacks, my lunch my lip, my thumb or figures. Everything....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get my 7 year old to stop sucking his thumb. This stuff worked! It tastes really bad and kept his thumb out of his mouth at night. He complains that the taste lingers so if he&#x27;s eating and his thumb touches his mouth, he&#x27;ll complain about it.</li>
            <li> SO I saw wonderful reviews about this product.  I was excited to start using it on my 5 year old.  It did work for about a day.  Then she trudged past the taste and kept sucking her fingers.  In the mean time, she started sucking on her hair, which she never did before, now she sucks her fingers and hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for years, and of all the products i have tried, this one is the only one that works. the bad taste lasts for days, unlike most other products which need reapplying twice a day, also once the taste is in your mouth, it is hard to get rid of, deterring you from biting them again. i find this product really works.</li>
            <li> My son turned 5 recently and I&#x27;ve been telling him for months that he can&#x27;t have a birthday party unless he quits sucking his thumb.  He was trying really hard to remember, but it&#x27;s just like second nature, so was really hard.  Well 3 weeks before his birthday, I got this product.  I started on a weekend, as I had read reviews here .. and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The night that I put it on he woke up 3 times asking for juice, to wash out the &#x27;yucky&#x27; taste.  I hadn&#x27;t realized that he sucked his thumb so much in his sleep too.  Then I waited until the next weekend to apply it again and continued putting it on everyday .. because by now he would remember to not put it in his mouth.  He would take his thumb up but remember just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product .. for a kid trying and willing to quit.</li>
            <li> I have a 7-year old boy who HAD been biting his fingernails constantly! I knew things were serious, when I caught him biting his TOENAILS because he really couldn&#x27;t get a \\&quot;good gnaw\\&quot; going on his fingers anymore!!  Talk about disgusting!! Unfortunately, his 3-year-old sister had followed in his footsteps and had begun to bite HER fingernails. That&#x27;s when I ordered Mavala.  I applied a heavy coat on both kids&#x27; fingernails the first night I received Mavala in the mail. Neither child minded very much, UNTIL they tried to bite their nails &amp; discovered the HORRIBLE taste!!  My boy actually cried when he realized that he would have to taste the Mavala every time he got his fingers near his mouth...including when he ate pizza, popcorn, chips, or any other snack food. Within a day, both kids were headed for a cure of their nail-biting.  I assured them that if they grew their nails back out to regular length, I would stop applying the Mavala (which I had been applying about every other day).  After 10 days, I removed the Mavala with fantastic results!!  Both kids have quit putting their fingers anywhere near their mouths!  I still have 2/3 of a bottle left, so they know I can repeat the treatment if they backslide!!  Thanks, Mavala!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get MAVALA Stop to help me stop biting my nails. It worked for about a week, but I could not stop biting my nails since it is such a horrible habit. The taste of it is disgusting, which kept me from biting a little, but overall it did not stop me. Biting my nails has been a habit my whole life, and it did not make me magically stop. Only buy this product if you will follow through and re-apply it every few days because it fades away easily. I recommend this product to help stop biting nails, but only if you can stick with it, which I was unable to do.</li>
            <li> My almost 3 year old was chewing his fingernails and toenails so badly that they would bleed. He would then move on to the skin around them. It was painful and looked horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ONE DAY, he no longer attempted to put his fingers or toes in his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked for my 10 year old until he discovered that he could soak his fingers and scrape it off the nails. I solved that problem by re-painting after bathtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over a month and I only had to apply it for about a week and a half. No more nail biting in this house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very strong and it lingers. I tried it myself and it took about five minutes to get the taste to go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that this product saved my baby boy from pain and potential infections.</li>
            <li> My nephew has a bad habbit of putting his fingers in his mouth.  He does it so much that he tears his skin.  His mother bought this for him and it works very well.  He does not like the smell or the taste.  Only time will tell if this product will help him keep his fingers out of his mouth!</li>
            <li> My 2.5 year old son sucks his thumb when he&#x27;s sleeping.  I tried this product hoping it would stop him from sucking his thumb &amp; it did!  The first time I put it on his thumbs was before his nap.  He cried for 20 mins saying his thumb was grody!!  I coat his thumb nails in the morning before he leaves for daycare &amp; at night before bed.  I&#x27;ve only had the product for about 2 weeks but it has worked wonders.  I would highly recommend this product to parents who child has a thumb sucking problem.  He actually ask for me to paint his nails before bed now &amp; says I don&#x27;t suck my thumb.</li>
            <li> We decided to try this product because we couldn&#x27;t get our 13 year old son to stop biting his fingers and our 5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. In the past 4 weeks we have had amazing results. Our daughter has stopped sucking her thumb even at bed time. Our son is doing a lot better with biting his fingers and they are healing. He even asks us now to paint his nail because he likes how healthy his hands are looking. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem with nail biting or thumb sucking. It really works!!!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old daughter has sucked her 2 middle fingers since she was 2 months old. We tried a product called THUM as well as diluted tabasco. We tried band-aids, gauze tape as well as positive reinforcement. She wanted to stop but just couldn&#x27;t. This product has been so wonderful. I tried it on my own finger and it does taste awful but that is what was necessary to stop this habit. Her baby teeth are a little flared from all the sucking; her 2 fingers looked terrible and she was always getting colds and viruses. Our dentist suggested a hand guard but it cost almost $100. With her baby teeth falling out and permanent teeth coming in, we were desperate to help her break this habit. We put it on as she sleeps each night. It doesn&#x27;t wash off with handwashing so a once-a-day application is all that is needed. This is key- it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily so it is long lasting throughout the day.  She hasn&#x27;t sucked her fingers in almost 3 weeks now. She is so proud of herself.  I recommend this whole heartedly. I honestly thought we were never going to get this habit under control and in a short time it has stopped altogether!</li>
            <li> Our four-year-old son has sucked his thumb since day one.  We are very concerned about this and have tried various methods to get him to stop.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the many glowing reviews of this product on this and other websites, we decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing we noticed about the product we received was that it looked and smelled like acetone or nail polish remover.  Alarmed, we contacted our dentist and pediatrician, both of whom advised us that the smell comes from solvents in the product which evaporate after application and should not pose a risk.  With some trepidation, we decided to try the product anyway.  The next things we noticed were that the product seemed to wear off rather quickly with our son and that he was willing to put up with the residual taste at prime thumb-sucking time (such as when he was tired).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerned about the frequency of application required, we then contacted the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to see if they had any information about the product.  The FDA informed us it has not evaluated the product for safety or efficacy and advised us to submit a MedWatch Report for possible follow-up investigation.  The official who responded to our inquiry seemed concerned about the solvents and alcohol that form the main ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the FDA official did not indicate that the product was necessarily dangerous.  However, the official did seem to think that further investigation was warranted.  For the record, our son does not seem to have suffered any ill effects after 4 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son was recently promoted to the \\&quot;big kids\\&quot; class at his pre-school, and we&#x27;re very anxious about the physical and social effects of his thumb-sucking.  We&#x27;re as eager as anyone to find a magic bullet to fix this problem, but we have concluded that using alcohol and solvents of unknown efficacy and safety is too high a risk.  Note too that because the product is made in Switzerland, holding its makers accountable for any adverse effects that might occur would be difficult.  Before using this product, you may want to ask yourself whether you want your kids to be guinea pigs for the untested products of a foreign chemical company.tzerland, holding its makers accountable for any adverse effects that might occur would be difficult.

            <li> Let me start by saying this product is wonderful for my 6 year old and my 3 year old.  My 6 year old has sucked her thumb for years and nothing has stopped her from sucking her thumb until we tried this.  She does not like the taste so it stops her from sucking her thumb even at night.  I know that I need to reapply it when she starts sucking her thumb again.  My 3 year old sucked his thumb and bit his nails until they bled.  He stopped biting his nails and sucking his thumb if we applied it every other day like instructed.  If I see him biting his nails, that usually means that I forgot to reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I only gave it 4 stars was because I tried it with my 2 year old twins who suck their fingers.  As soon as I applied it and it dried, they put their fingers in their mouth.  Once they tasted it they both started crying and vomited.  It took us a long time to calm them down and they kept putting their fingers back in their mouth and it started all over again.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to wait until they are 3 and they can make the connection that when I put my fingers in my mouth it will taste bad, so I need to stop putting my fingers in my mouth.  My 3 year old understood and it was wonderful for him.</li>
            <li> I agree that it works but only for the period of time it stayed on, I guess it is because I&#x27;m an adult and old habits are hard to break.&lt;br /&gt;Also it would transfer the taste onto food I cooked so I would have to remove it and then re-apply it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my daughter stop sucking her thumb. We were both hesitant that it wouldn&#x27;t really work and she would be able to just rub it off or at least wash her hands and it would come off. BUT NO!!! It was wonderful. It stays on through hand washing and she said it tastes terrible. And it must have because she stopped sucking her thumb in 3 days! We continued using it for a week just to be certain. If anyone needs to stop biting their nails or sucking their thumb, buy MAVALA!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle!  My four year son had been sucking is two fingers at night and when he was tired forever.  I started using Mavala Stop and he has not sucked his fingers in over a month now.  The first couple days are a little tough, but it was amazing to me how well it worked because he was VERY dependent on sucking his fingers throughout the entire night.  The dentist was also very happy too.  Incredible product!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do - keep thumbs and fingers out of the mouth.  I use it on my 3-year old because our dentist said it was best to break her thumb-sucking before turning 4.  We bought the silicone thumb splints ($95!) from the dentist but she&#x27;s strong and smart and could pull them off no matter how snug we put them on and we didn&#x27;t like to keep them on all day and ultimately ran out of bands before she broke the habit.  We apply Mavala every day because she takes long baths and the taste was not strong enough to keep her thumb out of her mouth after one bath.  I&#x27;ve read it takes a month to break a habit like this so we plan to apply this daily for at least that long.  I tried the product on myself as others have and it tastes like it smells and definitely keeps her thumbs and fingers out of the mouth.  I worried that she may protest and make it difficult to apply but she willingly lets us put on her \\&quot;nail polish\\&quot; every night after bath.  I  caution using this product if your child eats a lot with their fingers but otherwise strongly recommend it if you are willing to apply daily.</li>
            <li> I have been a fingernail chewer for 29 years! I did a bit of research and decided to try this. After 2 weeks, I was amazed as I stopped applying the stuff and only occasionally applying it.&lt;br /&gt;  This is also the first Amazon review I have ever written as I would recommend this to anyone.  I will also agree with other users of this product is to be aware with finger foods or what your nails brush up against.&lt;br /&gt;  The worst example of this was when I was in an airport and my nails accidentally touched the cap or the mouth of a water bottle! I soon became aware as its a bitter, nasty taste you wont forget. It was finally gone though after eating dinner!&lt;br /&gt;  That said, it is worth it and for me it worked wonders. Great product.</li>
            <li> Our daughter (3.5 years) sucked her thumb constantly. Our dentist suggested a thumb guard, but we wanted something a little less obvious(her preschool teacher thought it would draw attention at school). We used Mavala Stop on Friday night, and in 2 days she was done. The first night was rough- she HATED the taste, but we hung in there and by the second night she remembered what would happen. After a week we stopped even applying the product because she wanted nothing to do with her thumb. The great side effect of using it was that she could not eat with her fingers at the dinner table because sometimes her thumb went in her mouth! So it helped with table manners too :)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to.  My daughter stopped sucking her thumb after one application.  Highly recommend this product if you have a thumb sucker or a nail biter.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Within an hour of trying it out my 2 year old was back at sucking his thumb like there was no tomorrow. I&#x27;m still trying to figure it out. I tried Mavala and THUMBS and both did not work.. A complete waste of money and shipping was expensive.</li>
            <li> The product should work, it taste horrible! It did seem to work well for my son - not so much for my daughter. Just depends on the kid.</li>
            <li> Daughter has sucked fingers since a child to 4 years old, we tried a lot of stuff and it never worked.  Finally ordered Mavala Stop on Amazon and used it just 1 time and she stopped sucking fingers.  We should have used it sooner, simply amazed at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> My kid didn&#x27;t even notice there was something on his fingers. I tried all the way from one drop to 2 coats on each nail</li>
            <li> MY 5 YR OLD SUCKS HIS FINGER... BUT NOW THAT I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT ON HIM FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS... HE IS NOW JUST ADJUSTING TO THE TASTE AND SUCKING IT ANYWAY. EWW... BUT IN THE BEGINNING IT DID STOP HIM COLD. I TRIED IT AND THIS STUFF IS NOTHING TO PLAY WITH. TERRIBLE TASTE IN UR MOUTH.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 2 year old daughter&#x27;s random thumb sucking. Once we got rid of the pacifier she instantly inserted the thumb and we wanted to nip it before it became a habit.  My husband tried a taste just to see and claimed the rest of the night cause he couldn&#x27;t get the taste to go away. So the verdict- it works- unfortunately we have to put the \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; on each nail because she just decides to switch fingers. She is persistent and will suck the bad taste away- I think consistency will be the key.</li>
            <li> We tried everything to get my 6-year-old to stop sucking her thumb, and this Mavala is the only thing that has worked!  It tastes sufficiently awful, and she was broken of the habit within a month.  It stays on for 3-4 days, have only had to reapply after swimming.  I have recommended this product to many other moms!</li>
            <li> My son is 3 and his nail biting got so bad and subconscious that there wasn&#x27;t a second that went by where his hands weren&#x27;t in his mouth.  No, motivation, even from himself was enough to stop.  It was definitely a coping mechanism, where he&#x27;d sooth himself.  I wanted to nip the problem in the bud before it got too difficult to deal with. Luckily, this product worked for just that.  They say it takes 21 days to break a habit, and it has totally been by the book.  I rewarded him with a candy to put it on and he never gave a fuss.  It&#x27;s been about a month since I stopped using it and he doesn&#x27;t put his fingers in his mouth or bite his nails.  So far, so good.  I still have about 95% of the bottle left, so if there ever is a reoccurance then I&#x27;ll be ready.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t appear like women nails. I recommend this product to prevent stomach deseases.</li>
            <li> I might have liked this product but I&#x27;m not sure because it arrived COMPLETELY SMASHED! When I opened it after it was smashed it got all over my hands and did not wash off for an entire day! It was awful, I wish that I could buy this product in a store so that I would not have this problem again!</li>
            <li> My daughter is about 4 Years old and she had the habit of thump sucking.  so I tried this based on reviews and its worked! She stopped in 3 days.:-)</li>
            <li> My almost 3 year old has sucked his 2 forefingers since he was a baby. It was hard for him to remember when watching tv or pre-nap. Once we put this on, he stopped! It honestly tastes so bad you want to rinse your mouth immediately. I reapplied it 3 days later when he was sleeping so he wouldn&#x27;t know and might do it one more time but I haven&#x27;t even seen him try to put his fingers in mouth! Awesomeness. Super disgusting but it does work!</li>
            <li> My big dog would NOT stop licking his paw that had been injured out in the yard.  I even tried the cone of shame on him; which did NOT work.  He could still reach his paw.... awkwardly, but still.  So, this product was next.  Evidently, the taste is bad enough that he finally left the paw alone to heal.  It was really bad.  The usual blackness of one of his claws was GONE.  He&#x27;d worn it down to a flesh colored nub.  I&#x27;m so glad this stuff worked!</li>
            <li> This worked great to make my daughter stop sucking her fingers in her sleep. The finger sucking did not bother us, but after she turned 3 or so, she started to do it very aggressively where she would hurt her fingers with her teeth. This product worked great. 4 days is all it took. (We had tried another product called Thum earlier, but she liked it and would ask for applying more on her fingers).</li>
            <li> After reading previous reviews, I was worried this product would be very strong and I just applied a little bit to the top of his thumbnail, and we went outside to play - it kept his thumb out of his mouth which was great since he likes to play in the garden and then will suck on a dirty thumb - reminders for 3 year olds only go so far.  Of course, there are dental concerns - some people hate the idea of putting a liquid repellent on, but it&#x27;s better than saying over and over &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; and driving your kid nuts.  This worked but by nighttime he had a bath and the liquid seemed to have worn off.  I applied it to how thumb nail for an afternoon and it seemed to work much better.  I guess it&#x27;s easy to take off.  I tried it myself and put some on my nail - it tastes pretty gross, but a good teeth scrubbing and nail scrubbing makes it all go away.  So if you use it after a bath or are washing your hands all day at work or home, make sure you reapply since it is very easy to get rid of the product on your nails.</li>
            <li> My son just turned 3 and had chewed his nails as short as he could possibly get them. He only bit them for about 6 mo. I applied this to his nails a few times a week and by week 3 his nails looked as if he never bit them before. The taste is awful, but not to the point of him ever gagging as I had read in other reviews before purchasing it. I&#x27;m so thankful I bought it. And highly recomend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This has exceeded my expectations. My son cave get past his fingers entering his mouth, much less bite his nails.  I&#x27;m so happy his poor chewed up finger nails can finally grow normally, while keeping unnecessary germs out of his mouth</li>
            <li> Mavala has helped my daughter reduce the amount of time she spends thumb sucking. However, it would be wonderful if it was made of natural ingredients such as aloe vera which is bitter ang good for one&#x27;s health. The ingredients in Mavala are most likely harmful to children.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who was still sucking her thumb at 3 1/2. I haven&#x27;t seen her suck her thumb since then. I continued putting it on every other day for ten days or so just to make sure the habit was broken. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and it ended up being so simple!</li>
            <li> My 2-1/2 year old has been sucking his thumb since about 2-1/2 months old...Everyday, night and all the time... I actually thought it was the cutest thing to see, just adorable..BUT when the dentist said that he needed to break the habit and stop sucking his thumb, because of interference with his top jaw and teeth growth.. I KNEW it was time he had to stop and I&#x27;d never see him suck his thumb again :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried just putting a band aid on it- but at that age, it gets ripped off with-in minutes..I tried talking to him about it, telling a story about it..Nothing worked.. A tough age to try to convince! Especially something he loved so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked into different products to help- and hesitant to try because of reviews..Some say their child gagged, and or threw up, stopped eating favorite foods etc! I was VERY HESITANT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT- I decided to try Mavala Stop-there were so many HELPFUL  reviews,TIPS and high ratings from lots of consumers which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a total of 3 maybe 4 applications so 6-8 days of ONLY a SMALL DROP of Mavala Stop on the TIP of the FINGER NAIL! a drop goes a LONG way- He tried sucking his thumb the first 3 applications-spaced putting it on every 2 days- THEN remembered how nasty he said &amp;#34;SPICY&amp;#34; it tasted. The first few tries of thumb sucking he said it was &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; and wiped his tongue off with a towel and wanted water. But he was physically just fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put it on, I told him why I put it on and that it tastes bad- Then I put band aids on over his thumb. He ripped the band aids off- but was reminded that there was &amp;#34;nasty flavor&amp;#34; on his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he ate food- I put  a band aid on and I also encouraged eating with the other hand..Since any taste of that flavor pretty much transfers if they are eating a finger food! I tasted it to see what it was like- definitely gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERY CHILD and personality is different, so you may experience something different-this is just my experience..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone decide if they want to try it.may experience something different-this is just my experience..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone decide if they want to try it.</li>
            <li> I tried the other stuff from the local drug store and it didn&#x27;t even phase my finger sucker. He couldn&#x27;t stand this stuff. Only took three applications and he was completely broken of the habit.</li>
            <li> It worked, eventually. We found it had to be applied a lot more often than it said, and very consistently, along with reminders to the child. I didn&#x27;t taste it myself, but it wasn&#x27;t apparently THAT gross.</li>
            <li> Started applying this right away, it works great for my 5 year old, as long as I apply it every day! Would totally recommend, wish we had started at 3. I think it would have already kicked the habit by now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails and fingers since very young, and I&#x27;ve tried all methods I can to quit but not successful. This nail polish helps control my biting to minimum level, if not completely. My nails and fingers have improved greatly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would, but it does. I&#x27;ve bitten my nails my entire life and was skeptical. But now in my 30&#x27;s I hated the way my hands looked and gave this a try. It reminds me of the aftertaste of vomit. And it will get on any food you eat or prepare. I keep it around in case I &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been chewing my nails all my life and I am almost 50 years old. This stuff is so bitter. All those reviews of everyone saying it is? They are absolutely correct. I still sometimes forget and put my finger in my mouth, but I soon realize it was a big mistake. My nails were so bad it is taking much longer to grow than normal but I see a few of my nails longer than ever before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to try to stop and this stuff is so disgusting that it only took me three tries to avoid putting my fingers in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very potent, the only downside is you&#x27;ll have to eat finger foods with forks.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with nail biting forever, and tried  an inferior product in college that just wasn&#x27;t enough of a deterrant.  I am so glad that I read about this on Amazon and gave it a try.  It has been two weeks and I have nails now!  Still short ones, but yay!!!!!  This product will stop you from either mindless or intentional biting.  The clear coat is a little shiny and looks nice.  The shininess wears off in 1-2 days which is perfect, because it reminds me to reapply.  And with the other product, whose thick coat never wore off until it chipped, that made me want to pick at it which was counterproductive.  This doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  It also keeps me from nibbling on finger foods or licking frosting off my fingers...must use a fork and knife especially at first, which is better for eating mindfully too!  Very occasionally that is a problem, but can be solved.  Give this a try!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this back in 2012 for my then 18 month old who was sucking index and middle finger. Everytime we put it on her finder for the frist 5 nights she would cry and hide the finger under her pillow and therefore we had no finger sucking for 5 days. These were the only glance of hope we had that this formula would work in our favor, unfortunately 1 week later she started sucking her finger even after we applied the liquid on her nails and even on her fingers. My daughter is now 4 1/2 years old and she still sucks her fingers. It has worked for some but I guess our daughter will stop this bad habbit on her own terms!</li>
            <li> We had tried EVERYTHING to get our 5 year old to stop sucking her thumb once and for all, from reward systems, bribes, discipline, several other nail polishes for thumb sucking, but nothing worked.  Our dentist finally recommended this stuff and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> My son is five, he was eating his nail so bad that he start bleeding, this product did the trick his nail are growing back and he stop eating his finger nail, now i have to order another one because his eating his toes nails</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who is a nail biter.  Very glad that we got it, seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Worked on my 5 year old who was an exsessive thumb sucker since birth. After the first application wore off, he did reverto to old ways so be sure to be consistant and re-apply few times. After the 3rd application he was no longer a thumb sucker. (Each applicatiom lastes on him about a week.) I am going to use it next foryself with nail biting.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old had a HUGE problem sucking her index finger. The dentist informed me at her last appointment that it was beginning to affect her teeth and he recommended Mavala Stop. I ordered it the following day and got it within a week. I put it on her two index fingers while she was asleep and the following morning she complained that her finger tasted funny. I told her that she&#x27;s a big girl now and your fingers start to taste bad when you get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She lapsed into putting the finger in her mouth a couple more times over the next couple of days. I put it on her fingers again two nights later and she has not even thought about putting her fingers into her mouth since then and it&#x27;s been about a month now. I did put it on a few more times just to make sure, but it seems like the problem was stopped after only 2 applications! I&#x27;m pleased with how quickly it worked. Hopefully we stopped it in time to avoid the costly expense of braces down the line.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 yr old daughter, we have been trying to break her habit of sucking her thumb for quite some time. This worked for about a week and then she just seemed to get used to it :/</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old who is constantly biting her nails.  The first day she complained that it tasted horrible and begged me to take it off, her exact words were, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s disgusting!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I thought, finally success!&lt;br /&gt;The following day she went to preschool and when I picked her up, I asked how her day was and if she did good not biting her nails.  She responded with, &amp;#34;Mom, this nail stuff is delicious!&amp;#34;  And for a week now she has proceeded to bite her finger nails even with me reapplying the Mavala Stop daily.&lt;br /&gt;I have a stubborn one as I think it tastes horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Time to try something else unfortunately.  Looks like my daughter is one of the few that this didn&#x27;t work on.</li>
            <li> 8 yr old finally quit! We put a band aid over the thumb as a reminder but if she takes off the band aid it will be very yucky. Only took a couple of nights to be cured. Nothing else worked for us.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I used it on my 3.5 year old to help her stop sucking her thumb. She would pretty much suck her thumb all day and night. I tried to reward her for not doing it, constantly remind her and other things that never worked. She then told me that she was trying but it was very hard and didn&#x27;t know how to stop. So that&#x27;s when I did some research and found this. She has been asking me for a while to paint her fingernails but I would say not till shes older. I surprised her with glitter nail polish and she was very excited. I did a coat of Mavala stop on top of that. I told her this special polish taste bad so don&#x27;t suck your thumb. She didn&#x27;t all day till bedtime. She cried and cried saying she wanted the glitter off because she wanted to suck her thumb. Well it only took one hard night and its been 3 months and she has not sucked her thumb ever again! We only applied it that one time and it was bad enough for her to stop for good. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> After battling my daughters thumbsucking habit for years - this finally did the trick!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Taste terrible which is great but after you wash your hands a few times it wears off so as long as you don&#x27;t mind reappling it will work</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old sucked her thumb quite a bit.  I put this on her thumbs, and like the other reviews have said, they get it in their mouth and start dry heaving and borderline throwing up.  However, she stopped sucking her thumb after about 3 days.  I continued to put it on there for 2 or 3 weeks.  A couple times, we found her sucking it while she was sleeping.  I don&#x27;t know if she couldn&#x27;t taste it while she was asleep, but that was only twice.  It&#x27;s been 2 months now, and she hasn&#x27;t restarted.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I was about to see a dentist to have an appliance placed in our 5 year old&#x27;s mouth to break the thumb sucking habit.  She has started losing teeth and we were advised by the dentist to do something about it NOW.  I decided to try this first (a much less expensive and less invasive alternative).  My expectations were not high, but we are now on day 12 with no thumb sucking day or night!  The taste is very bitter, but simply reminds her of what she already knows....that she should not be putting her thumb in her mouth.  I would agree that for a younger child who cannot fully understand what it is this may not be the correct course of action.  But for our older child who wanted to stop, this did the trick in giving her the little push she needed.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has been sucking her finger since she was in the belly. I couldnt believe she stop sucking her finger the first day of the application.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for over thirty years, and tried to quit repeatedly. I was constantly ashamed of them, even when handing money to a bank teller. I was heartened by the reviews, which hilariously ranged from 0 to 5 stars for the exact same reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ZERO STARZ  MY TODLER THRW UP 4 A WEEK &amp; CULD NOT KEEP HIS CHIKEN NUGETZ DOWN\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Five stars. I applied this miraculous salve to my embattled fingernails and found that the merest contact with my tongue would provoke an Aetnaean response, causing me to reflect upon the error of ungular mastication and cease forthwith my foolish antics.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took merely one-and-a-half weeks of before I got the message. Entire batches of meals were ruined by merely touching their component ingredients. Touching my mustache and swimming would result in foul-tasting water leaking into my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been three weeks, and my nails have almost fully grown back. The urge to rip them to shreds with my teeth has passed, though I am confident that if it should return, I can simply reapply this product and defeat this foul habit.</li>
            <li> My almost-7-year old who had ZERO desire to stop sucking his thumb. I told him I ordered this and he didn&#x27;t really respond. The night it came, he wanted to put it on before bed. I was hesitant because I thought he would be up all night. He didn&#x27;t wake up at all. Reported that he tried to put his thumb in his mouth the next morning and immediately took it out again. Put it on again 2 nights after the first night. He never sucked his thumb again and never needed another application. Part of it is his personality, but a big part is whatever it was that made this stuff nasty and stay on his thumb. Yay for no thumb-sucking!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve a 6.5 yr old daughter &amp; we&#x27;ve been trying desperately to stop her from sucking thumb. She is old enough to realize &amp; wanted to stop but it just wasn&#x27;t easy as its right there with her all the time. I tried a similar product when she was around 3 yrs old but didn&#x27;t have any luck with it. I tried pink color thumster but when she very badly wanted to &amp; during nights, she could easily remove it &amp; start sucking, so that didn&#x27;t work either. This was my last shot before spending $70 to get thumbguard. It worked like a miracle :) i got this product, had the same old long talk with her and applied it on her finger before entering a movie theater to keep her mind off of it, she licked it a couple of times, gagged &amp; ran to the bathroom to wash her mouth. That is it, never again sucked her thumb. The first couple of nights she was whining all night &amp; crying at times so i was with her consoling her &amp; the taste is really bitter too. I didn&#x27;t have to use it anymore as she doesn&#x27;t even remember to suck :)Now she is very happy &amp; proud of herself that she stopped sucking &amp; ready to start her school with confidence :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product to curtail my nail biting. It worked great for a few weeks. Eventually I just got used to the taste and starting biting my nails regardless. At that point I just stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try eating finger foods either... It ruins them.</li>
            <li> My daughter quit sucking her thumbs in less than 3 days with this product!!!!  Wish I had found it several years ago!  Don&#x27;t serve any finger foods while the child has the polish on.  It tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. i tried so many different items off amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the third night. my son was no longer sucking his thumb. After about a month..i caught him in bed and after another application, he was so longer a thumb sucker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT. IT WORKS 6 stars</li>
            <li> Worked great! It successfully got my 7 year old to stop nail biting. Only problem was, he was smart enough to hide it. We&#x27;re back for more.</li>
            <li> Ok so it started well and then it faded out. My 4 yr old is back at it again sucking on her index and middle finger. So frustrating.</li>
            <li> My six year old was sucking his fingers virtually all day and night. After trying for over two years to help him break the habit, I finally bought this. And two weeks later I realize I haven&#x27;t put any on his fingernails for four or five days, but he hasn&#x27;t been sucking his fingers anymore. No crying, no whining- just done. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and have been biting my fingernails my entire life. Once you put for fingers in your mouth with this stuff on them you will be scared to do it again. The only downside is you will need to eat everything with a fork or else the taste can transfer to food.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my daughter (2yo) was ruining her teeth from sucking her thumb. We used only a small dab on the cuticle of her thumbs and that was it. The toughest part was at night when she was falling asleep and throughout the night. She would try to suck her thumb but immediately remember she couldn&#x27;t. She cried throughout the night for like a week. But she never cried afterwards. We only had to reapply once. This was the best $12 we ever spent. Only regret was that we didn&#x27;t do it sooner.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My youngest son just turned 3 and chewed and sucked his fingers continually and as a result was getting sick continuously.  Our Doctor told us that it is a nervous condition that he will grow out of but in the mean time he will pick up germs and bugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this being used by other parents online and thought  I would try it.  It worked amazingly fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when applying it.  It only takes a tiny, tiny amount on each of the fingers being treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By accident  i got some on my fingers while applying it to Thomas, oh, it is awful stuff!  I couldn&#x27;t eat a sandwich while it was still on my fingers.  It didn&#x27;t make any difference if I washed my hands, it stayed for 4 days or so.  It is a bitter chemical taste that stays in your mouth for several minutes after you first taste it, no wonder it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s face was priceless the first time he tasted it!  He hated it and demanded a drink to wash the taste away, that doesn&#x27;t work BTW. Once in your mouth it is there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas was treated about every day days for 18 days and it worked.  We stopped using it 4 months ago and he no longer sucks his fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, we have about 3/4 of a bottle left so whenever my wife falls asleep on the couch i paint her nails with this, lets say she doesn&#x27;t think it is as funny as I do.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! My 8 year old son stopped biting his nails and hasn&#x27;t bitten them since we started this product 12/23. I put it on his cuticles and nails and it worked. I also tried it on myself and it works well. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails longer than him so once it wears off I start biting again. The product lasts for 24-48 hours. It tastes like nail polish remover but had no smell. It&#x27;s nasty!!! You don&#x27;t want your hands anywhere near your mouth with this stuff on it.</li>
            <li> My son has sucked his two middle fingers since birth.  The doctor suspected he probably even did it in the womb.  It wasn&#x27;t a problem when he was younger but now that he&#x27;s five, the dentist told us it could start to impact his teeth and jaw.  We tried gloves, rewards, etc. and couldn&#x27;t get him to stop.  For me, the worst was at night he would suck them LOUDLY in his sleep and the sound became like nails on a chalkboard for me.  I did some research and ordered this Mavala Stop.  I told my son a few days ahead of time what we would do with it.  We put in on just his nails the night I got it.  It didn&#x27;t hurt his fingers or nails at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 hours into his sleep, I heard him really crying.  He had put his fingers in his mouth and the taste was horrible.  He said it didn&#x27;t burn or anything, just horrible.  He must have cried for about 10 minutes.  Then he went back to sleep easily. AND I&#x27;VE NEVER SEEN HIM SUCK HIS FINGERS SINCE THEN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application.  One night.  Cured 5 years of finger sucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly wish all the parents out there the same luck we had with this.</li>
            <li> Our six year old has been a life-long thumb sucker.  As she would say \\&quot;Why do people pick on me?  I was born this way.  Can&#x27;t they just love me the way I am?\\&quot;  Though she is completely correct, we still were seeking options to resolve this issue.  Her teeth are beginning to misalign and she gets colds more frequently because she is putting germs directly into her system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried another thumb sucking medicine that can be purchased at the local drug store (can&#x27;t recall the name).  Our daughter hated the taste but found that if she washed her hands enough in a day, she could eventually tolerate the taste. We had to re-apply daily.  In short, it was a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews about Mavala Stop and decided to give it a try. What did we find out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The taste is bad and it lingers in your mouth for a good 20 minutes.  I know because I had to help her open a plastic food wrapper from a popsicle that she had been trying to open.  The wrapper was damp from condensation and the taste got on the plastic and I ingested it.  Water did not wash it away.  Gum worked okay.  She had to learn to eat food with her other hand to avoid touching her thumb to her food or her face.  If your kid sucks both of his/her thumbs interchangibly, I might suggest that you work on only one thumb at a time.  If you don&#x27;t, you will end-up with a child who is both traumatized and on a hunger strike because of the horrible taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Our daughter can not suck the flavor off or wash it off. She tried - multiple times.  It appears to last at least 3 days for her.  I refresh it with one brush stroke after day 3 - I no longer paint her entire nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)If you have a small child (3 or under), start with a small amount and assess the affect before jumping in and painting the entire fingernail. You can always add more...but it isn&#x27;t easy to take it off. Personally, the taste is bad enough that I don&#x27;t think I would have applied this product to a child that was under 2.5 or 3.  Not to criticise anyone who does, but my children are tiny and making sure they got enough daily nutrition was of concern to me at that age.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to jeopardize calorie intake in a smile child. I also believe that 2-3 year olds should be allowed to sooth themselves anyway they can.  A six year old should be working toward eliminating the habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)Though we didn&#x27;t need to do this, I think a person could easily re-apply on a child who is sleeping. It dries rapidly and is not thick like a typical nail polish.  I did consider doing this with my six year old if she threw a fit during the re-appication process.  Fortunately, she only threw a minor fit during her second application.  Her third appication occurred with little protesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I have been exceptionally pleased with the results thus far. We will continue using this product for a while longer to ensure her success. Good luck to all the parents out there that are in our situation.  It is highly likely that the first 3-4 days will be the roughest but you can help your little person get past this addiction with patience, love, and a little Mavala Stop.a child that was under 2.5 or 3.

            <li> First time in my life that I can paint my nails and feel confident about it</li>
            <li> In trying several similar products, this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across. It actually does coat your nails in a clear coat so that if you are a male, it does not look like you have polish on your nails. The taste is bad enough that it gets you to stop biting the nails themselves. You will have to reapply every 2-3 days to keep enough on your nails.</li>
            <li> 30 years of nail biting... Stopped immediately.</li>
            <li> I tried other products that did not work. I gave this a shot and after painting my nails with this product for a week and a half I completely stopped biting in my nails for good. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my whole life and I&#x27;m 28 yrs old. The taste really make you regret life. It motivates you to stop because eating finger foods will suck because you will taste this product. The mystery taste reminds me of a Walmart tire and rotting home depot wood section.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail about a week ago, but as soon as i painted my daughters nail with this product, she ended up sucking her thumb as soon as it dried, the taste of the nail polish did not faze her at all. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my title says it all...this product definitely works!  Granted it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks, but so far so good.  Nice to finally have some fingernails!!!</li>
            <li> Taste is bitter. Not awful as some say. Is isn&#x27;t stopping my five year old from thumb sucking. We will keep trying.</li>
            <li> Quick Shipping by the seller. The product works better than what we found in our local stores. Have been applying it once every 2 days to my sons fingers to keep him from biting. Seems to be working as I can tell his nails are growing..</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 2 year old who constantly bites her nails. Worked great for a few hours till it was dinner time, she was so disgusted with the taste on her fingers (not so great with her fork, handfuls of food are way easier!) she wouldn&#x27;t eat anything. I even took the polish off and tried to get her to eat and she wouldn&#x27;t. Decided to put some on one of my nails and I didn&#x27;t think it was horrible but my boyfriend almost threw up from the taste. It will definitely keep your nails out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I get it -- it&#x27;s supposed to taste gross.. but imagine eating finger food (pizza, ice cream cone, sandwich, etc) and having the ever-not-so-slight taste of whatever nastiness is in this stuff.  It definitely kept me from biting my nails, but was a little TOO effective.  I only used it once.</li>
            <li> Very strong - the first time my daughter put her fingers in her mouth she actually gagged and threw up. It fixed the problem immediately. She won&#x27;t even lick food off of her fingers. :)</li>
            <li> This totally worked! We had tired a similar product once before when our daughter was younger, but at that time she told us &amp;#34;it tastes yucky but I am used to it.&amp;#34; She&#x27;s four now, and we thought we should try it again. Mysteriously, her lovey disappeared around the same time. After 3 weeks, once all traces of the habit seemed to be gone, the lovey came back. She is really proud of herself, and we are no longer grossed out of her wet thumb! :-)</li>
            <li> Very good product. You have to make sure that you keep applying it every day or so till you kick the habit. The problem is sometimes I have literally damaged my hands to the point where a bandaid is more effective and to apply this would be salt on a wound. The key is to make sure that you do not reach that point. I definitely see this ultimately working as it has significantly curtailed the habit. You need to stick with it is all. Worth the meager investment to not be in pain, bite your nails like a mental patient, and look like weevils chewed away your hands.</li>
            <li> I tried many different tactics with getting my 4 year old daughter to stop biting her nails. After about 3 weeks, she&#x27;s finally growing nails!</li>
            <li> I am adult nail biter and let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve fought this battle since I was little. I have went in and out of phases where I bit my nails, sucked my thumb, etc. since the womb! After wearing acrylic tips for about 10 years, I finally said enough was enough. I bite my nails, especially during peaks of anxiety and I needed something that was going to help counter than anxious habit. After reading reviews, I bought the Mavala Stop and I am glad I did! It has been two weeks of use and let me say, it works. The polish DOES NOT taste good at ALL and it does leave a horrid taste in your mouth. Eating foods with your fingers is tricky because this polish makes your entire finger taste something terrible. I usually only need to apply about two coats per day since I wash my hands a lot and use hand sanitizer frequently. To counter the smell, I let the Mavala dry for a few minutes and then apply some natural, scented lotion to my hands so shaking hands during business meetings won&#x27;t be awkward. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I can say I see some growth coming in and I haven&#x27;t bit my nails. I have tried but the taste is repulsive!</li>
            <li> I used it once on my daughter and she never sucked her thumb again it was a awesome!</li>
            <li> It works, and it tastes horrible,  however it tends to bleed onto anything our daughter&#x27;s hand touches. So if she touches her nails to food she eats the food inherits the horrible taste. Our daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind it that much, but idf she touches soemthing I am eating...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway we use it all the time and it single handedly stopped our 3 year old form sucking her thumb. I am only taking off a star due to the fact that it clings to everything she touches.</li>
            <li> We told our 3 year old thumb sucking daughter that this was a &amp;#34;reminder&amp;#34; to help her remember not to suck her thumb.  She was starting to get self conscious about her habit but she couldn&#x27;t break it.  After a day of wearing mavala, she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb again...that was a few months ago.  This definitely worked for us and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am giving this product five stars because it DEFINITELY works! The only issue some may have with it is that it works a little too well. Every time I put my fingers near my mouth, even when eating, I got this nasty taste for a good 5 minutes that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. To say the least, it kept me from snacking too much so I think I lost a little weight using this product as well. Lol. That being said, I&#x27;m going to post a pic in the photos above of my nails after less than a month of growth. I removed the Mavala once because I got sick of it messing with my snack food flavors and I immediately bit a nail... so I put it right back on. :) I haven&#x27;t used it the past two weeks because I&#x27;ve lost the urge to bite. Should it ever come back, though, I&#x27;ll have this stuff ready! It&#x27;s very thin and goes on like water, so you won&#x27;t go through a lot of it. I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;ll ever have to buy a second bottle of it. Best of luck in quitting your habit, be it nail biting or your little one&#x27;s sucking their thumbs!</li>
            <li> not stinky enough to prevent my daughter from biting..</li>
            <li> 26 yo male here, desperately wanted to stop biting my nails.  this worked perfectly, dont hesitate, just buy it now.</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful clear coat ... but even if im not biting my nail .. (id be eating) and taste it. Its yuck !! I know the taste is what helps you not bite.. but it would make eating a disappointing as well.</li>
            <li> It broke my sons 3 1/2 year thumb sucking in one week! Works so well I should have done it sooner.</li>
            <li> My daughter bites her nails and I can say she asks for this stuff like nail polish.  It definately isn&#x27;t strong enough for her habits.  I can see it stops her for a bit but then she just gets over it and goes right back to it.  Not sure what I can do next.</li>
            <li> Amazing Amazing Amazing ... I just used it ONCE and it amazingly worked.&lt;br /&gt;My 2 and half year old kid get used to suck her thumb since she was 2 months old and was still suck it just before I use Mavala Stop. her thumb became so sensitive, ugly and irritating that&#x27;s why I decided to use a treatment so she will feel better. I thought its gonna be too hard for her, specially she was used to suck it so she can sleep. but she was totally OK and get used not to suck it.&lt;br /&gt;The flavor for Mavala Stop is strong and last for almost 2 days even if u washed your hands over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it to all of those who suffers from thumb-sucking :) Good Luck</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for 54 years! During that time I have tried many many products along with willpower to stop - all failed. My daughter had been recommended Mavala stop by a friend and odered me a bottle. I tried it with little expectation. I must tell eveyone IT WORKS!!!! For the first time in my life I have nails! My hands are no longer an embarassment and I love choosing nail varnish and painting my nails - something I have never done until now! I am so impressed have recommended to my other &#x27;nail biting&#x27; friends. They too are well on the way to achieving beautiful nails and hands. I cannot praise this product enough!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says but transfers onto everything.Forget cooking or eating anything with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have tried every trick in the book with my eight-year-old. This is the only product that worked. After the first application she realized that there was no way to get it off. I had to reapply it at night while she was sleeping every other day. But it worked!</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this but are worried that the taste will get on everything and ruin your day... Don&#x27;t let that stop you.&lt;br /&gt;The taste doesn&#x27;t spread to all the things you touch like others might mention. I am able to eat burgers and french fries without getting the taste in my mouth at all. Granted you don&#x27;t lick your fingers when you&#x27;re done...&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes. I don&#x27;t even bother putting my fingers near my mouth anymore. I always seem to remember that this is on my fingers so I don&#x27;t even have to deal with the bad taste. Just knowing that I shouldn&#x27;t be doing it is enough to stop me from continuing.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing, it&#x27;s finally allowing me to let go of my 25 year habit.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe how quickly my 3 year old stopped sucking her thumb. We just put a dab on the end of her thumbnail two times in a week and she has not sucked her thumb in over a year! I still have the product but doubt i will ever need it again.</li>
            <li> Our son is 2 3/4 years old and would not stop sucking his thumb no matter what.  He has had an infection under the nail from sucking, lost the nail a couple times and his skin was so cracked and dry that it bleed.  Our pediatrician recommended Mavala Stop.  We couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally - thank you Amazon!  We started applying the product on a Saturday morning and by lunch he wasn&#x27;t sucking anymore.  He put his thumb in his mouth once or twice and hasn&#x27;t sucked it since!  He made one or two comments that he didn&#x27;t want it but ever since the first day he is happy to have it put on his thumb.  We call it his thumb medicine and he always tells us how his thumb is &#x27;getting better&#x27;.  This stuff stays on for a long time too - through baths, handwashing and everything.  We try to apply it every 3-4 days but sometimes it goes a week and he still doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb.</li>
            <li> We got the product very quickly, and so far it has really helped! It does wear off fast though, so you had to apply just about every day, but it has been working. My daughter hates the taste and I&#x27;ve seen white on her nails again! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My 19 month old daughter had a severe addiction to sucking on her 1st 2 fingers of her left hand.  Her fingers where always in here mouth day and night.  We couldn&#x27;t get her to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, one day with this stuff on her fingers and she was done sucking on them during the day.  As far as night time goes I had to put it on her fingers every other night and did that 3 times before she didn&#x27;t do it at night anymore.  This stuff does taste awful and the taste stays in your mouth for quite a while even if you drink something. I think that is what makes it so effective though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been over a month and she is going great, no relapses or anything.  This stuff worked great!!!  I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s child had a problem sucking on their thumb (or fingers like my daughter did).</li>
            <li> We bought this for my 3 year old who would not stop biting his nails.  We first bought the product, Thum, and that did nothing.  I read some reviews on Mavala Stop here on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Within a few days he stopped biting them for the most part and then within a week he was done biting them altogether.  He couldn&#x27;t stand the taste on his nails.  Even a month afterwards I joked with him and said, \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t you taste your nail to see if that stuff is gone yet?\\&quot;  He adamantly refused!  :)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading all the reviews...my 3yr old son loves his thumbs !!! 1st it was a pain to keep him still while i waited to the stuff to dry. then he would pick it off his nails..then he just got used to it and would suck his thumbs anyway. really bummed it didn&#x27;t work...1st two days it worked but after that it was a no go. :-(</li>
            <li> This Mavala stuff is great.  I have tried so many things over the last few years to quit biting my nails. I&#x27;ve been biting since I was four (I&#x27;m 25 now) and I&#x27;ve tried Orly No Bite, and the other Bite No More brand and they taste pretty much the same.  The taste from these two products wears off fast and is too easy to get used to.  I&#x27;ve tried Thum, which also didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ve tried painting my nails, thinking if they look pretty, I won&#x27;t bite them, and that didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve also tried sheer willpower, sitting on my hands until I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  This Mavala stuff is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that showed any promise.  The taste is strong, and lasts for up to a week.  It lingers in your mouth until you go rinse.  It gets under the nail and onto the skin around the nail, so I also think its good for finger chewers.  I think as long as I keep using this stuff, I won&#x27;t have any more problems with my nail-biting.</li>
            <li> This works- period. I tried all different kinds of ways to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb with no luck. Using this it only took one day to break her of the habit. Because really, it tastes aweful. And now she says shes a big girl and has given up her security blanket as well. Two birds, one stone. I am so thankful to have found this and would recomend it to anyone who needs to stop biting their nails or sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> We used this on our 3 year old which has sucked her thumb since birth.  The last 6 months while sucking her thumb, she would pick at the top of her nose and face causing scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 days of using this, she stopped! She doesn&#x27;t even make the motions of putting her thumb in her mouth any longer.  The first few nights were hard as she kept getting up to tell us her mouth taste like soap and no being able to comfort herself....but it quickly passed and we are home free now :)</li>
            <li> This product worked on both my kids. It lasts a while, so application did not have to be repeated after a simple handwashing. We applied it just once every day or two. It kept both of them from biting their fingernails,</li>
            <li> It really helped my son to stop biting his nails. The bad flavor did get onto what ever food he was picking up and eating.</li>
            <li> Our daughter had sucked her thumb (mostly at night/with lovey) for over 7 years.  This curbed the habit wwithin a day or two and she had stopped even complaining about taste and wanting her thumb in about two weeks.  Wish we would have done it years earlier!</li>
            <li> Stopped my 8 year old...doesnt like the &amp;#34;poopy&amp;#34; taste.  I threaten to put it on the 5 year olds if he puts his fingers on his mouth....it stops him before  he gets a bad habit.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was a child. I am what they call a mindless nail biter. I do it and I don&#x27;t even realize I am doing it. It got to the point where some of my nails were completely gone or deformed. I had used different products before but they would wash off and I was back to biting without knowing once again. I used band aids but you can&#x27;t do anything with them on your fingers all of the time. This stuff stays on for days at a time and really tastes terrible but that is a good thing in this case. For the first week I would would bite but stop because of the taste reminding me not to. The second week I would put my hand up to bite but instantly remember that my nails taste bad before doing so. I am on the third week and I just never try to bite my nails and have no desire to. So far the habit seems broken and my nails are well on there way to not looking like a mutant&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> only lasts a day or so and forget about eating with your hands</li>
            <li> Stopped thumb-sucking in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Instantly helped our 4 year old stop ducking her thumb at night.</li>
            <li> worked for a while, the bitter taste stays with you.  may cause some kids to not eat anything</li>
            <li> I gave this a try skeptically, thinking that I mostly pick at my nails rather than bite them. But this will quickly make you aware how how often you put your fingers near your mouth unknowingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only got better about not biting my nails, but I also was more conscious of licking my fingers, touching my face, and eating food with my fingers. Anytime your fingers touch near or around your mouth, a signature bitter tastes resides. It goes away and is easily washed away, but it&#x27;s enough to keep you conscious of what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, it helps form hygienic habits. I&#x27;m about two weeks in, applying every 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> It worked perfect for my daughter of 7 yo. The finger braces did not work. She either suck her thumb with it or would take it off. This took care of the problm in few uses. She said it tastes nauseating awful. I have to mention that she somewhat mentally was ready for stopping though.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my 3 year old daughter at all.  I put it on and she sucks her thumb as usual.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and ran out so that is why I ordered it again. It works real good and I like the product because when I put it on I don&#x27;t bite my nails and I know how nasty it tastes so it deters me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> It sure does taste bad, and it makes me aware of what I&#x27;m doing with my hands. I apply it every day just to be sure it works. It&#x27;s done wonders. You might not want to eat chips and salsa with this stuff on your hands...</li>
            <li> Simply stated, this product really worked for me. I applied it every other day for two weeks and broke an over 50 year nail-biting habit. For the first time in my life, I now have actual fingernails that have to be filed and shaped. I will add that I was highly motivated to succeed this time and that is always a key step in any transformation process. However, the bad taste of Mavala Stop kept my fingers away from my mouth during those critical first two weeks when I was tempted to bite. After that, the motivation of seeing actual nails growing from the tips of my fingers provided additional reinforcement to continue the process. This was (very little) money well spent for such great results!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product for a long time, was really glad when I found it on amazon. And it works, no one could possibly bite their nails. It is so bad tasting. Just make sure you keep putting it on.</li>
            <li> Works great.  But dont eat finger foods without a knife and fork. Ive eaten sandwiches, cheeseburgers and fries, and i get that bitter taste in my mouth. ANd if you kiss anybody after, they will get it too.</li>
            <li> I used to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.  Based on reviews of children getting sick, I wore the polish for 3 days and &amp;#34;tasted&amp;#34; it frequently.  The bad flavor lasts for 2 full days with a less effective 3rd day.  I applied polish every other day (as directed) in the beginning and then less frequently after a week.  I had no issues with feeling sick after tasting the polish, nor did my daughter.  I asked her permission to use the polish to help remind her and she agreed.  I applied sparkly nail polish first to make if fun and then a coat of the &amp;#34;stop&amp;#34; on just her thumb (obviously you&#x27;ll want to apply to all nails if you have a nail bitter).  The first night she forgot and put her thumb in her mouth quickly removing it.  After a few weeks it broke the habit and she has never sucked her thumb again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ve tried plenty of things but this product actually worked. Very satisfied with the outcome because I have nails now...</li>
            <li> Helping my five year quit sucking her finger. Thank you wish I knew about this sooner to break her habbit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my almost 6 year old son to stop his thumb sucking after a friend recommended it.  I have been using it for 4 weeks and we have not had ANY thumb sucking.  I just paint it on his thumb every other night while he is sleeping.  It only takes a tiny bit - the first night I covered his nail and he woke up twice crying and gagging a little (the crying I think was due to the fact that he couldn&#x27;t suck his thumb so he was having a hard time sleeping) The next two nights he woke up once. We have not told him we are doing it - we just said it must be his body&#x27;s way of telling him it is time to quit thumb sucking.  We have not done anything else to discourage him - no discussion,charts,bribing,etc...  I will continue to use it for a while just to be sure, but he has not had any problems even though I have accidentally gone three nights in between applications 2 or 3 times.  The first few days he did notice a bad taste on his food but he figured out quickly it was only his right hand so he began picking up food with his left hand.  My older son had to have an appliance put in his mouth when he was four to stop thumb sucking - this is so much less traumatic and inexpensive!  5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I was excited at the idea of using this on my 4year old thumb sucker who had pushed his teeth out of position, thinking that yes the end is in sight! I painted his thumb liberally with it the first day telling him it was simply awful and not to have an accident. He did great, just the idea of how terrible it would be and me saying it won&#x27;t wash off kept him from sucking it for some 24hrs... but then he had an accident and subconsciously sucked it whilst watching tv. And discovered it wasn&#x27;t that bad. In fact the stuff from our local chemist we&#x27;ve tried before was worse. So he was quite happy to just suck it right off, even though it&#x27;d only been an hour since I&#x27;d reapplied it. I  was shocked so I tasted it on my own nail and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I had anticipated. I put it on my daughters fingernails thinking it would help her stop biting (trying to get my moneys worth since it didn&#x27;t work on master 4) but she came back and said it didn&#x27;t taste bad at all.  I tried shaking the bottle, putting on several coats, didn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;So I took matters in to my own hands, went out the garden and picked a chilli and painted his nail with fresh chilli juice. I did it twice daily. It only took 2 weeks and he doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb any more.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm for our nail-biting 7 year old son. Highly recommend this stuff</li>
            <li> Stopped thumb sucking in one week!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Tastes horrible...exactly as it should!! Even after showering and hand washing the taste remains disgusting! I&#x27;m so excited, after years of nail biting I actually have nails!!! The results are immediate!! You&#x27;ll never put your hands near your mouth again!!</li>
            <li> This product is what I have been searching for these last few years.  The only thing that stopped me from biting my cuticles were band-aids and that only lasted a short time.  I was even embarassed to get a manicure, but not anymore.  This stuff tastes so nasty and is so strong, you really think twice before putting your fingers in your mouth.  So glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  We tried Everything to get our son to stop sucking his thumb!  I was skeptical, but after I applied Mavala Stop once he stopped sucking his thumb completely. I did reapply every 2 days for the first 10 days.</li>
            <li> I have a 3yr old thumb sucker and nothing was working. I decided to try this nail polish and it has been doing good so far. She thinks Im painting her nails so she has no clue that its for her to stop sucking her thumb. I haven&#x27;t seen her put her thumb in her mouth since the first day I applied it, which she told me her finger tasted nasty! So lets hope this last and the thumb sucking ends :)</li>
            <li> This is the absolute WORST tasting stuff there is...I&#x27;ve tried them all...every possible brand.  This is the only stuff that worked for me and I am a life-long nail biter.  It only about a minute for me to keep my fingernails away from my mouth. You have to watch out, though.  If you eat any finger food the taste WILL transfer to whatever you&#x27;re eating.  But, again, worth it to stop the habit.  This stuff is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was working and we were very excited about it. Ultimately, after a few weeks, our son just put it in his mouth even with the bad taste and so, we stopped using it thinking the chemicals were bad for him to keep putting in his mouth. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I started biting my nails in high school, and seemingly nothing could get me to stop, despite my multiple attempts over the years. I only had to apply the Mavala Stop three times (it lasted about 2 days with each application) and the taste was SO. INCREDIBLY. VILE. that I haven&#x27;t bitten a nail or cuticle since. (I am now 4 months free of nail biting!) I only wish that I had found out about this product years ago!</li>
            <li> This product is not as bad tasting as the Stop Bite that you can get from the local drug stores.  It wears off relatively quickly and has to be reapplied at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying that I&#x27;ve never been so impressed by a product that I&#x27;ve been compelled to write a review...UNTIL NOW!  My son recently turned 3 and has been a CONSTANT thumb sucker since birth.  His teeth were starting to get messed up, his thumb was callused, cracked and bleeding from the constant wetness from his mouth.  With his 3rd birthday in the horizon, we knew it was time to do something.  We purchased Mavala Stop after reading reviews about it and I will admit...I was sceptical.  If it was this easy to stop thumb sucking and nail biting and cost so little...then why doesn&#x27;t EVERYONE use it??  So, for $10.99 + free shipping we figured that it was worth a try.  The first day I painted it on, my son tried to suck his thumb...he announced that it was UHHSCUSTING (disgusting)and has not tried to suck it again.  Yes, you read that right...HE HAS NOT SUCKED HIS THUMB AGAIN!  Not even while he is sleeping.  I am truly amazed by this product and by the affordability.  I have recommended it and will continue to recommend it because it really works.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Actually this is my second time to use mavala stop,first with my older daughter and now with the second one both of them are thumb sucking,first time i use it when she is around 18 month(after asking her doctor)coz it says not recommend for less than 3 years but the doc said if u used once a week it should be ok,i used it once and she stopped immediately it was like a miracle,with my second i put for her twice,at the first time coz she kept trying to suck she throw out a little and she was very stubborn she keeps trying for 5 or 7 days but once she put it in her mouth she remember and stop trying until she completely stopped...</li>
            <li> I never thought my husband would stop biting his nails, but this stuff is working amazingly well! It tastes horrible and lasts for quite a while before it needs to be reapplied. It also arrived in a timely manner, which I very much appreciate. Since nail biting (and thumb sucking) can be subconscious habits, this helps remind the nail-biter/ thumb-sucker of what they are doing. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have been biting my nails since I was in grade school. My nails look terrible and the front teeth are starting to wear from the years of bitting. I haven;t tried anything else in the past for this but now that  am 31 years old I figure it;s time to break this habit for good.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this stuff daily and IT WORKS! It&#x27;s the worst tasting stuff when I am conscious of when Im about to bite my nails I stop myself and the few times today that I have forgotten and unconsciously tried to bite them I am bitterly reminded of why I need to keep from biting. I&#x27;m hoping to be broken of this habit very soon. Only bad thing is that it will get onto finger foods and make whatever you are eating taste funny; otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for us...my child would just keep right on sucking that thumb without missing a beat! We ended up getting a device at the dental office that actually helped stopped this habit. It wasn&#x27;t cheap ($200) but it was the only thing that worked for us!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old daughter after seeing a dentist and he told me that I needed to get her to stop sucking her thumb.  She was developing a cross bite and if she continued to suck her thumb it could cause permanent damage.  The first night I put this on her thumbs she tried to suck her thumb but immediately started to spit and said she needed to brush her teeth.  The taste is pretty bad (Yes, I had to taste it after seeing her reaction).  Its been almost a month and she hasnt been sucking her thumb.  For the first few weeks she asked me every night if her thumb was still yucking and when I said yes she would just so okay and didnt suck on it.  She doesnt ask at all about her thumb anymore.  The only issue I would have with this product is that when she would eat things with her fingers she would taste it and think the food tasted bad and wouldnt eat it.  I had to explain to her that she needed to always eat with her fork or spoon or the yucky stuff on her thumbs would get in her mouth.</li>
            <li> This was the first and ONLY stuff we tried for our almost five year old.  Within 5 days she had stopped putting her thumb in her mouth!  This stuff works!  It was kind of funny the first day we applied it, I knew every time she tried to suck her thumb because she would run to the trash or toilet to spit out the bitter taste!  I will definately be using this on her younger brother who is also a thumb sucker!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been sucking her thumb religiously since birth. Now that she&#x27;s almost 3, we needed to break her of the habit so she may have straight teeth. Our dentist recommended Mavala. After reading some of the other reviews, I was a bit concerned that the product would affect her eating habits. I didn&#x27;t have to worry. The Mavala broke her of the thumb sucking in about a week. I am still pretty amazed. I thought it would take much longer to break her habit. I didn&#x27;t notice any issues with her eating, although I can see how it might cause some concern with young children, since almost everything is finger food.</li>
            <li> After trying almost every product and method to stop our son&#x27;s thumb sucking, our pediatrician recommended Mavala Stop. In a matter of days, the habit was gone. This stuff works, hands down-literally!</li>
            <li> It does not  work at all my son steel biting his nail.</li>
            <li> I have an autistic child who was bent on mutilating her nails by biting them until the bled, became infected, and hurt.  She would complain her fingers hurt but just couldn&#x27;t stop her biting.  This stuff WORKED.  She didn&#x27;t like the taste and it helped her to break her habit.  Her fingers and nails look 100% better now.  No longer red, irritated, infected, and painful from biting.</li>
            <li> This product initially helped our 5y son, to stop thumb sucking when he watches TV or goes to sleep.  For a couple of months he stopped.  This product was just a reminder of what he already knows is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he started again thumb sucking and now he seems to be used to that flavor!!!!  I have to apply several coats of the nail polish and apply it every day.  It seems to get off easily when they bath or wash their hands</li>
            <li> We used this on my orally fixated, thumb sucking 4 year old and it worked perfectly! He was upset once or twice the first day when he would forget it was on his fingers and put them in his mouth, but other than that it worked without a problem. My son was the type to have his thumb or fingers in his mouth very often so I was quite skeptical that this would work, but after reading review and at our child&#x27;s dentists recommendation I&#x27;m so glad we tried it out. No more thumb sucking in this house!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 and I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my entire life. After 3 weeks of this bitter polish, I&#x27;ve completely kicked the habit. I&#x27;ll wear it for one more week just to be sure, but I haven&#x27;t even tried to bite my nails in days. I&#x27;m so happy, this has worked where nothing else did before. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> 3 weeks without chewing my nail. It is my new year resolution.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I can totally quit it. This is a very useful tool for people have years of chewing nails habit.</li>
            <li> Perfect for two seven year olds. One had an obsession with sticking his fingers in his mouth all the time and biting his nails. The second had just started biting his nails when I bought this. They both have stopped putting their fingers in their mouthes. And they are more careful to not get their fingers in their mouthes when they eat too.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 3 year old who sucks her thumb a lot! When she is bored, in the car, when she sleeps. Her thumb sucking has already affected the shape of her teeth. I used Mavala Stop on her and the first couple times she tried sucking her thumb it pretty much stopped her. She said it hurt her mouth. But apparently not enough to deter her further. I even re-applied it several times thinking it had already worn off (in less than a day) and she just suffered through. It is pretty nasty stuff, but a three year old can conquer it! Just disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is a little better than the standard cyan pepper kind. It has a bitter taste and will certainly remind someone to stop a bad habit of nail biting. I think it would be safer for a young adult than a child though, as children tend to put anything in their mouth and I am not sure this might make them sick. So I would not recommend this for infant and small children sucking their thumbs. For teens and adults though it will definitely remind them to break a bad habit. That is really the purpose of this stuff. The taste will set off some bells and make the individual think of what they are trying to subconsciously do. It is a little pricey, but again the taste is a little worse than the standard pepper kind.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for my nail biting toddler. not a thing. complete waste of money. my husband thinks it&#x27;s disgusting, but the point was for our child to stop nail biting and.. nothing. he said it doesn&#x27;t taste bad. really wish i could return it.. or get my money back.</li>
            <li> My son is, scratch that, WAS an avid thumbsucker after 1 application before nap time and one at bed he was done! Seriously. I did take the suggestion of another reviewer of only putting a small dot application on his nail so it wouldnt hinder his eating.  He tasted it a couple times and then never went back.  I still have a FULL bottle and will us this for my daughter as well.  For my son we used this at 2.5 years old and I will be using it for my daughter around the 2 year mark. ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Finally found something that worked for my nine year old son, didn&#x27;t think it was possible at this point. Even an expander in his mouth for braces didn&#x27;t stop him but this did....</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken when I received it so I&#x27;m not sure how well this product works. Tried to contact customer service</li>
            <li> Honestly, I did not think this stuff would work. My daughter is 8 1/2 and has been sucking her thumb all her life. We&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked, until now!  We are on day 7 and it&#x27;s been great. She is so happy and so are we.  The first day she put her thumb in her mouth a few times and gagged.  She said it was the worst tasting stuff ever. We had tears on day 1, but smooth sailing after that.  HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this together with a thumb sucking guard. Let&#x27;s just say that the combination worked wonders on my 3 year old!&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s no longer sucking his thumb. He did throw up twice and he is a picky eater so I wasn&#x27;t so happy about it. But I&#x27;d rather he lost appetite for a couple of days than having him suck on his thumb on his wedding night! jajaja!&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I have a lot of this remaining so I will give it to another child sufferer.&lt;br /&gt;It does work wonders for kids.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son is a bad fingernail biter. After trying another brand (which didn&#x27;t work) and getting antibiotics for two infected fingers, we got this bottle. WOAH it&#x27;s NASTY!!! You can still taste it after repeated handwashing and spending time in the pool. Repeat after 48 hours.</li>
            <li> This product worked great. The key is&lt;br /&gt;to put it on while they are asleep. My son has not&lt;br /&gt;been biting his nails from the first application.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars!!This kick my 2 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking habit in 2 days!Its been over 2 months and she hasn&#x27;t put her thumb in her mouth.What a life saver!!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s made to do, I bit my nails for the longest time, it was easy to quit with this!!!</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful!!! i had to comment on it. my son (17 months) has (had) a very bad thumb sucking habit and we wanted to stop it before it goes on till hes much older, and probably ruin the natural dentistry of his teeth. we applied this as directed, every 2 days or so. we only put it on the thumb fingernail. it is pretty bitter so make sure its completely dry before your kid runs off or else he will get it on his other fingers and then all his fingers will taste bad, then he will eat less since food tastes so bitter with this on. (trust me i tried) it took about a month of constant use but he doesnt suck his thumb at all anymore! we previously used &amp;#34;thum&amp;#34; from the drugstore which is a joke, dont even bother getting it. if thumbsucking is an issue for you, make sure you get this and you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very good, really taste baaad. Is like ear serum.good good good&lt;br /&gt;La use para que mi hija no se coma las u&amp;ntilde;as</li>
            <li> My four and a half year old has been trying to stop chewing her nails and cuticles for about a year.  She chews and doesn&#x27;t even realize it, this gets her attention and helped her to stop in about a week, then we stopped using it and she started again so we started again and I think we need to do it for a long time.  It is a nice size bottle and tastes gross, but doesn&#x27;t make her gag or throw up.  She just rinses with water and is fine.  I would recommend for a child who is hurting themselves by chewing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a coworker as a joke but it really it working! His nails are not stubs anymore.</li>
            <li> When my daughter developed a nail bitting habit I wanted to act fast before it got too bad. This product worked well the first few times. But, after that she would just chew right through like it wasn&#x27;t even there. I even tasted her nail to be sure it was still there. She&#x27;d simply grown used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely bitter, and the taste will linger on anything it touches (like finger food etc.) Subtle shine, easy to apply (even on a sleeping kid!).</li>
            <li> It did not seem to work on my 3 y/o with the first application, but after the second application the finger sucking behavior went away and did not return!  Now what to do with the 99% fluid left in the bottle?</li>
            <li> This stuff was working well for my 3 yr old she did not suck her thumb for few days.. Later she slowly started to suck even after applying which  is not good. I applied it to my finger and it did taste that bad when it first arrived ..seems like the powerful nasty taste was gone.. We ordered another one eagerly waiting for it to arrive. My 3 yr old keeps on sucking now..not sure if anyone had the same experience..</li>
            <li> This stuff is NASTY!  It dries on clear (a little shiny at first) and it lingers for days.  Just when you think it has worn off, you&#x27;ll get a disgusting little surprise.  Re-apply every other day(or even every day) if you&#x27;re an aggressive biter like me.  Use this for a month and you&#x27;ll be cured - though keep the bottle around in case of a relapse like any bad habit.</li>
            <li> My just turned 4 year old sucked two of her fingers at once, on a daily basis, from the time she was an infant. I could see that it was starting to change the development of her upper jaw, so we needed something other than telling her not to suck. She sucked her fingers while watching tv, while falling asleep, and to help her fall back asleep when she woke early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until she was asleep for the night and her fingers had fallen out of her mouth. I put some Mavala on each fingernail and a tiny bit on the skin part of her finger that would rest on the tongue as she sucked. It smells and looks just like clear nail polish, so I was not sure it would do anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 5:30am, I heard crying coming from her room. She&#x27;d awaken, tried to suck her fingers, and she told me, \\&quot;My fingers are so yucky!\\&quot;. She had drooled a LOT due to the bad taste, we had to wash the blanket she was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We told her that she was a big girl now, and once you are a big girl, your fingers taste yucky. It only took that one application, I am SHOCKED! It&#x27;s been a week, and she has not put her fingers back in her mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did have some issues the next two days eating finger foods. She could taste the \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; fingers, so we just gave her different food that she needed a fork to eat.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter was a thumb sucker and her teeth were starting to shift because of it so we had to put that to a stop.  We bought this product showed her what it tasted like and she then proceeded to try and get the taste off of her thumb.  So after we put it on her thumb she already knew it would be bad so she didn&#x27;t put her thumb in her mouth at all.  Her thumb sucking has completely stopped and it took about a week.</li>
            <li> My wife is gorgeous but has chewed her nails down to nubs since we&#x27;ve dated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well. She has nails now and is proud of herself. 10 stars.</li>
            <li> My purchase of this item was fulfilled by Safe Sellers and I received a completely different product. I ordered the Mavala Stop because my 3yr old has recently started biting her nails. I got something called Duri Rejuvacote, which is simply a product to help nail growth. It has no recommendation for children or use as a biting deterrent.. Non returnable/refundable. Awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. It really helps with nail biting, the only thing I have a complaint about is the way it stays in your mouth. If I wipe my lips or scratch them and lick them after the taste gets in your mouth even if you weren&#x27;t biting your nails. It&#x27;s a marvelous product though! Defiently will get you to stop biting your nails!</li>
            <li> This helped my husband to finally stopped biting his nails when nothing else worked. He was a nail biter for years. He said the taste is disgusting and a couple of times he accidentally got a taste of it while eating finger foods, so be careful when doing that. Otherwise it serves its purpose!</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son was still sucking his 2 fingers which he had done since birth.  The doctor&#x27;s advice &amp;#34;he&#x27;ll grow out of it&amp;#34; did not apply to us.  I was becoming more and more concerned as he was becoming more and more comfortable sucking his fingers at home and even in the presence of some friends, but not at school.  At school, he fidgeted a lot since he couldn&#x27;t calm himself by sucking his fingers.  We tried a few approaches (reward charts, positive encouragement, constant reminders, etc).  I was a bit reluctant to go the route of the Mavala Stop; his habit was so soothing to him, I felt somewhat guilty taking away his calming mechanism and thought this could be too abrupt of an approach that might backfire on us.  Knowing that we would be away visiting relatives for a month I thought perhaps the change of scenery along with the Mavala Stop would be a good combination.  We started the Mavala the day before we left.  That was the last I saw of him sucking his fingers.  I could not believe it.  He even asked for the Mavala about a week later saying it had come off and he needed it to help remind him not to suck his fingers.  I am just amazed.  I think he was ready but needed a reminder to help him stop since it had just become so common for him to put his fingers in his mouth.  I just can&#x27;t say how thrilled we are that we are to this point in kicking this dependent habit.  And what a confidence builder it is for him to have succeeded in having control of this.  Great product for us!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my daughters dentist. I have accidently put my finger in my mouth after applying this to my daughters thumb ad its gross but doesnt stop her :( It also becomes hard to open after a while.</li>
            <li> I bought another, cheaper, brand of this stuff - for my son that kept chewing his nails.  I ended up finding/buying this and it&#x27;s worked wonders!  You should apply it daily, but it&#x27;s clear and you can&#x27;t see it.  My son has since stopped chewing on this nails altogether!</li>
            <li> We tried this product when my son was 4 years old unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work then, but he also hadn&#x27;t had any taste buds he&#x27;d eat anything.  Since he turned 6 and started to say yuk I don&#x27;t like that about food I thought hmm I&#x27;d give this another try.  Instantly he stopped sucking his thumb.  He tried putting his thumb in his mouth once and said he&#x27;d never try that again and he was done sucking his thumb all together.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY different methods to stop nail biting and this is the ONLY product that has worked for me! It does not have a smell to it but if you lick your finger, touch your lips with your finger or bite your nail there is an incredibly horrible taste left behind.  It is enough to keep me from even placing my hand near my mouth.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!  As an added bonus it leaves a nice gloss on your nails.</li>
            <li> I am a chronic biter for mg entire life. After purchasing mavala stop I started seeing my nails grow longer than I ever remembered! After about a month of not biting I stopped using it, and unfortunately the bad habit kicked in yet again. My advice to nailbiters is that this product DOES work. But dont believe the folks who claim it takes 30 days to break a habit. Get in the habit of slobbing this stuff all over your fingers for at least three months. Let your nails grow long and keep putting mavala on.</li>
            <li> After a life long habit of nail biting this product has deterred me more than any other. I have tried the &#x27;spicy&#x27; or &#x27;bitter&#x27; ones but after a while I got use to the taste or would stop putting it on my nails. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and have not been biting. Once you put it on the taste lasts for a few days and what an awful taste it is. I mean just terrible. I regret every time my fingers touch my lips. Unfortunately this includes when I am eating finger foods. The taste rubs off on my fingers and my lips. I&#x27;ve had to change my eating habits a bit but so far it has been worth it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 4 year old daughter. She had been biting her nails and sucking the thumb for over an year. We had tried &amp;#34;Thumb Liquid&amp;#34; and puts tapes on her fingers, but it not work. The first day we covered the thumb and fingers nails with the solution. She hated it and was vomiting. We then removed it with the nail polish remover at night. The next morning we just put a drop instead of covering the  entire nail. We would put this in the day and remove it in the night for the first 3-4 days. After that we would let it stay. It would last for couple of days. Now after couple of weeks, she has stopped biting our sucking the thumb. She would bring it near to her mouth and then stop there. I believe she will stop doing in another couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The down &#x27;n&#x27; dirty:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works as advertised, period!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Long Story:&lt;br /&gt;I have a child who was a hardcore finger sucker until the age of five. My wife and I tried several &amp;#34;home remedies&amp;#34; such as bandages, soap, hot sauce, and caster oil. None of them seemed to be consistent or highly effect deterrents. We tried positive and negative reinforcement, but both proved fruitless. It seemed as though the habit was too strong to break, having been in practice for those five years since birth (our only child that preferred his digits over a pacifier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the recommendation of a friend of my wife&#x27;s, we decided to try Mavala Stop. Initially, we were skeptical, but decided it was worth a try. To our great surprise, the very first application effectively negated the problem for a good three weeks to a month. What was more amazing was, even while he slept, he didn&#x27;t dare put his finger in his mouth! Impressive, to say the least. However, the after that time, I suppose the strength of the habit kicked in, and he was at it again. After another application, the problem was mitigated for a considerable while, only happening during sleep several weeks later. After one last use, the problem ceased to exist, even a year later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, this product has delivered on its promise. From interacting with other users, as well as reading reviews, I understand that the results will likely differ based on the child and the strength of the habit. Some people have had the fortunate &amp;#34;one and done&amp;#34; scenario, while others had to stay at it a bit longer. I would theorize that the sooner you use it, the better. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to break the habit (in my case, about four years overdue). I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The point of this stuff is to taste horrible so you wont chew your nails. I have chewed mine for 27 years and for the first time in my life, I have nails. I was able to use this product for a few months and now have basically stopped chewing completely. I still do at times, but just re-apply some. The biggest complaint is if eating a sandwich of other &amp;#34;finger&amp;#34; type food, you end up tasting this when not even biting the nail.</li>
            <li> Our 4yr old daughter stopped sucking her thumb in one day -- no joke.  She was constantly sucking her thumb, when she was tired, bored, scared, hungry, and all through the night.  We tried everything else like bandages, gloves, positive and negative reinforcement.  But nothing was going to come between her and her thumb.  One taste of the Mavala Stop on her thumb and she never wanted to put her thumb in her mouth again.  A week later we&#x27;ve stopped using it and the habit is broken, no more sucking.  I know this product won&#x27;t work for every child, but it was the perfect solution for our child.</li>
            <li> My 5-year old had a horrible nail biting problem- couldn&#x27;t stop putting his fingers in his mouth, biting his nails as soon as they grew long enough, etc. It was difficult to watch. I had tried other products like this, but nothing worked. Within a WEEK of our first application his nails were growing and he was no longer putting his fingers in his mouth! Now a month later, we&#x27;re just about ready to cut his nails for the first time ever. Of course, we used a lot of encouragement and positive feedback as well...but he is now so proud of himself that he was able to get this habit under control. Definitely recommend this product FULLY!</li>
            <li> I found this on amazon just before we were planning to get a 600 dollar device put in my 7 year olds mouth to stop thumb sucking.  We had tried everything!  Just went to the orthodontist and dentist and they were both amazed and were sure to write down the name of the product.  Her teeth have moved back a bit in the 3 months since she stopped!  I think the fact that it makes one gag really associates with the habit and helps break it. It may seem harsh but my daughter is really proud of herself.</li>
            <li> Ive been biting for years! now 23 i wanted to stop. Use this product all the time, ruins finger food so just eat with a fork or something. Or like i did i forgot and kept eating finger foods with it on and it trained me to not bite my nails. Pretty awesome</li>
            <li> I got it right on time and started using it. I stopped biting my nails after a couple of days;)</li>
            <li> I hired a speech therapist for my 2 1/2 year old son. He has tubes in his ears as he suffers from recurrent ear infections. He was a thumb sucker as well. During her speech evaluation, she recommended Mavala Stop to me as her son was a thumb sucker and had many orthodontic problems and facial asymmetry as a result of it. I tried it and it worked after the first application. He attempted to suck his thumb but could not bare the taste. He has not sucked his thumb in 3 weeks. He likes getting his thumb nails polished. He thinks its something special. I am grateful for this product. My son&#x27;s thumb sucking was a big problem for me. I am so happy. I&#x27;m glad I found a solution early on. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheaper option to get my son to stop sucking his thumb, figuring it was worth a shot.  It worked immediately!  Amazing.  It has been almost 2 months and he doesn&#x27;t even think of his thumb anymore, whereas before it was permanently in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I started biting my nails when I was 7 years old I have tried every trick in the book (rubber band on wrist, bad tasting nail polish, acrylics, etc) but no luck. I ordered this on a whim, wasn&#x27;t too optimistic... It was the most horrible tasting polish I could ever imagine! I only put my fingers in my mouth twice and that was all it took. I took the polish off first the first time in about 2 weeks yesterday and I still have lost all desire to chew my fingernails. It was a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, this is incredibly strong. I don&#x27;t know if I would use it on kids without trying it on myself first. My poor boyfriend made the mistake of kissing me on the cheek after I had scratched my face with my nails. AWFUL! I couldn&#x27;t eat finger foods or scratch anywhere near my lips while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it DOES work! I just painted my nails for the first time at 25! What a treat!</li>
            <li> My son is 3,and has an extreme overbite,due to thumb sucking,so I needed to do something to get him to stop sucking his thumb.I tried socks,and tape,putting tape on his fingers and all that good stuff,and it didn&#x27;t work.So,when I got this,it worked immediately.However,you can only use it once every two days.When I put it on his finger he would cringe when he tried to suck his thumbs so he stopped,but the next day he was at it again,and sucking the hell out of his fingers.So now his teeth are affected,his thumbs get really chapped and red,and sometimes he won&#x27;t even take his thumb out to talk.I guess its that good!Hopefully,someone out there makes something that will work everyday,all day.</li>
            <li> Tried it on our four year old who had problems suckin her thumb. She no longer sucked her thumb. It was a great reminder for her and the taste was really bad. Tried it myself. It was yucky enough to help her stop. Was NOT so yucky that she threw up though. Read reviews that it made other children vomit. I think that is probably because the children wanted to vomit and knew it would make the parents stop using it. Kids are smarter than we give them credit. My child once tried making herself vomit to get out of eating a dinner she didnt care much for. My advice is to try it. Its only $11.00 and it may save you hundreds on dentristry later.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is tended to! The nail biting stops instantly. it taste horrible!!!! and the tast lingers in your mouth so you are sure to keep your fingers out!..only down side is that if you like to eat with your hands you may taste it when sticking fingers in mouth</li>
            <li> Finally a product was strong enough to break the will of a stubborn 7 year-old with a 5 year habit of biting nails!!!!  Tried the weaker versions at major drugstores and multiple other ideas with no success. Co-worker recommended this and added idea I read off another Amazon review for a shopping trip (x5) for nails getting long enough to trim. We are 3 shopping trips in and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to spend the $$$. She has no desire the bite her nails. The stuff is nasty. Must be applied at least every other day. Finger foods are out as long as it is on.</li>
            <li> My son is a nail bitter. He does not like sitting still in school and watches the clock until the end of the day, he is 9 yrs old and continually bites his nails in school. Well, I put this on once and problem solved. First time he forgot it was on, he spit for a few seconds, and now he learned a lesson. However, it does only last a certain amount of time, and even though he promised not to bite his nails, he has forgotten so on with the Mavala again.</li>
            <li> Another unsuccessful product, this did not work at all for my child. Even after days of trying. Back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> my kid loved it, the smell was bad but i don&#x27;t know whata happened with the taste, well not for my kid</li>
            <li> The only problem I found is it it wears off on everything they touch!  You can take it off with fingernail polish remover</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that made my 6-year old stop sucking his thumb, I can&#x27;t believe it.  I don&#x27;t even think he tasted it...it was just the fear of having something on his nail to make him keep his thumb out of his mouth! I only applied it twice!</li>
            <li> doesnt really work as well as shown. I used it for a month and still am biting my nails. It was worth a try</li>
            <li> Started using this a week ago to stop the thumb sucking habit for my 3.5 yr old daughter. So far it seems to be quite effective. The first time I applied it to my daughter&#x27;s nails she gagged a bit and spit rightaway when she tried to suck her thumbs,  but it seems to have had a big effect on her. She has completely stopped thumb sucking for almost a week now, and I only had to apply it one more time after the initial application (2 days after the initial one). So far very happy with the product. The only slight concern I have is about the chemical ingredients in the product even though it hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse effects in terms of health.</li>
            <li> Not only did it stop my 7 year old daughter from sucking her thumb.  I have bit my nails for 30 years.  It worked for me as well.  Great product.  Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> I have a sonogram of my son sucking his thumb in my womb. By the time his third birthday arrived, I had already researched and purchased Mavala Stop for fear of having a 9 year old thumb-sucker (I&#x27;ve seen plenty). I applied one coat on his thumb since I didn&#x27;t want him to be overwhelmed by the taste. He gagged and salivated all day, so I gave him a washcloth to help him get the taste out and to absorb the crazy amount of saliva he was producing. I got a taste of how awful this stuff is when I kissed him. The taste lingered all day and I had no desire to eat, but his appetite was not affected. He did, however, manage to push a chair across the room, snipe the bottle of mavala, and dump it down the drain after out second application. I used what was left in the bottle (about 2 ml) and by the end of the week, he completely stopped thumb-sucking. It has been 6 months and he has not gone back to sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> Mavala did the trick. My 6 year old no longer sucks his two fingers. Took about a week for him to stop the habit. He was on board with the decision to stop and I think that helped. Lost one star because the taste can rub off on food. Yuck. Just be sure to put on nails only and let it dry.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 6 months old (she is 3 1/2 years old now).  We have tried several items to break her habit.  None worked.  Her new pediatric dentist recommended Mavala.  After ONE week of application, she stopped sucking her fingers.  It has been 2 months since she last sucked her finger.  Sweet victory!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked for my daughter in 3 days! I was super skeptical but it worked. I would recommend this to anyone. Taste horrible and was totally sake for my 3 year old. I dont think she even ever tasted it. All I had to do was put it on her thumbs, tell her what it was and why we were doing it, and she stopped.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son sucked his thumb constantly, day and night.  We put one application of this on his thumb Saturday morning and by Saturday night he was no longer sucking his thumb.  I have not reapplied it and he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb in 2 weeks.  We should have done this sooner!  I honestly cannot believe it worked so well.</li>
            <li> This thing is disgusting and that&#x27;s a good thing! I was worried about the polish irritating my eyes as I handled my contacts. No worries there. It works just like clear nail polish and doesn&#x27;t get in the way of putting in contacts. It has a very strong and bitter chemical taste that stays with you.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few weeks, than my daughter got used to the taste. I even waited an extended period of time before using it again and now she can suck right through it.</li>
            <li> My 5th grade daughter bites her nails. She wanted to try this product in hopes it would help her stop biting her nails. However, she says that it doesn&#x27;t taste that bad, and she continues to bite her nails anyway. (I personally think it tastes awful, but I&#x27;m not the one with a nail biting problem.)</li>
            <li> Not only did this help my daughter stop sucking her thumb, it also stopped my other daughter from biting her nails.  Success!</li>
            <li> Exactly like nail polish, put a thin coat on the nail (as well as the surrounding skin), when you try and bite your nail, a really disgusting taste will STAY in your mouth, you&#x27;ll want to wash it out with gasoline or old milk... hard to describe the taste, it&#x27;s how I&#x27;d imagine french kissing the Queen of England would taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-it works. seriously. I hate biting my nails now. It brings back memories of &#x27;Nam, and I wasn&#x27;t even born yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION!&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-you can&#x27;t remove the taste from your nails right away, it&#x27;ll slowly fade (usually gone by day 2 or 3, but you can reapply a fresh coat!), so if you&#x27;re going to have any lady friends nibbling on your hands, you should probably warn them...&lt;br /&gt;-eating finger foods? not anymore. I had chicken pizza, touched the pizza with my Mavala-coated fingers, ate the pizza, and guess what I tasted. That&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s tongue.</li>
            <li> The Mavala Stop product seems to be working.  My daughter has constantly commented on how \\&quot;icky\\&quot; the stuff tastes, and has not sucked her thumb is 2 days.  Will keep applying and working to stop!  I recommend the product.  It&#x27;s easy to use (like applying nail polish) and we&#x27;ve not yet noticed any change in her diet (due to transfer of the taste to her food).</li>
            <li> Yay, I bought this for my 4 yr old son, who sucked his thumb ALL the time. Yes it worked great. Though here is the warning...the first two nights were miserable!!! He woke up several times because he put his thumb in his mouth and it tasted awful, therefore, he kept needing a drink of water. After several days, he was cured! No thumb at all!!! He tells everyone that he is a big boy now and doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb. He is very proud of himself.&lt;br /&gt;It has been over one month, and I do have to say we are still adjusting. Before, when he threw a tantrum, he would cry for a couple of minutes, and then soothe himself by sucking his thumb. Now that he doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb his tantrums seem to be bigger, and last a lot longer. :( But over all, I bought Mavala to help him stop sucking his thumb, and it definitely worked, so I will give this product 5 stars. Good Luck to you. :)</li>
            <li> This works well for young ones to get them to stop sucking the thumb.  Lasts for several days, at least five before needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my 6 year old daughter...I tried other brands, but they didn&#x27;t stay on as long or taste as bad.</li>
            <li> For year i had been trying to stop my oldest from sucking her finger. Finally I found something that worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old daughter, who has a serious nail biting habit. So far it&#x27;s only been a few days, but she hasn&#x27;t bitten her nails once since we got it. I&#x27;ll keep putting it on her until I&#x27;m sure the habit is kicked for good!</li>
            <li> This will help cure a bad habit.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my 2 1\2 yr old. I tried it and it is nasty tasting but not for her.</li>
            <li> We bought this product after hearing it works to stop thumbsucking.  Our 4 year old boy and 3 year old girl stopped sucking their thumb after one day.  Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. I have been a stress induced nail biter since I was a child, but after putting this stuff on for less than a week, I had not temptation to bite my nails anymore. I use to bite my nails to the point of drawing blood sometimes, but nothing that I ever tried before worked long term to stop nail biting. This stuff has a bitter taste similar to nail polish remover, but lasts up to three days before needing to reapply. It tastes nasty to the point where within the first day, I already would stop myself before my finger was even near my mouth just remembering the disgusting taste. I do occasionally resort back to nail biting when life is particularly stressful, but then putting this stuff on for even just one day &#x27;cures&#x27; me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, this stuff tastes completely useful, so it can make eating finger foods a bit challenging, but definitely worth it in the long run :D.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help fight my child&#x27;s thumb sucking habits, except at night when she is sleeping. One bottle should be all you need.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to try this product on my two daughters but with no options left I had no choice.To my amazement this product worked in three weeks time. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, my THIRTEEN year old daughter has finally kicked the sucking thumb habit, something I had tried to do since she was a baby!My other daughter is eight and she also exhausted all my ingenuity in stopping thumb sucking but thanks to Mavala Stop I will save a lot from not having to buy bracers. Thanks Mavala Stop, it really works!</li>
            <li> The liquid itself works great...but the liquid got around the bottle top a little as normal but mine adhered together and when finally loosened to open it actually broke the top and the liquid all dried up and it cannot be used now. I had use it maybe three or four times so it was full and waisted..&lt;br /&gt;And that also says not much had to be around the top for it to adhere itself.</li>
            <li> My 4yr old son doesn&#x27;t even want to stop and we have tried about everything. I read great reviews and ones that said it didn&#x27;t help. Figured it was worth a try. He stopped sucking his thumb for 2 days, we applied it morning and night. Then he just didn&#x27;t care and went back to sucking his thumb. I admit, when I first noticed him sucking it again, I licked his thumbnail and ICK the Mavala Stop was still on as strong as ever...he just sucked it anyways. On to something else I guess.</li>
            <li> This is not my first try with this sort of theory.  I was hoping this product would be much more terrible tasting than the last product I tried but it seems the same.  My daughter just sucks it off even when we painted the entire finger.</li>
            <li> Worked really well!!! Definitely recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s child sucks there thumb! We tried other products, but this was the only one that worked for us. My daughter was 7! It only took about a week for her to kick the habit!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work, because it was too strong. Basically, everything I touched now tasted bitter. I couldn’t eat or touch anything with my hands even when I used very little of the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only tastes awful, but it stays on through frequent hand washings. I have not bitten my nails in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The taste of this product is absolutely awful! I will stay my nail biting stopped immediately but only until the product wears off... anything you touch (including food) tastes awful so I stopped using it. This is for desperate measures but obviously not for finger foods.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of my children bite their nails and cuticles and I remember my parents putting this stuff on my fingers (it did not really work for me), so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a show of support, I put it on both my son&#x27;s fingernails/cuticles and my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days, I have doubts I will be using it again.  The taste transfers to any food item we touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my son quickly discovered that it does not really affect his nail biting because when he does so, his tongue does not touch the nail, so the only effect is that it makes his lips taste bad after the fact.  Plus much of their destruction occurs with finger to finger peeling, which bitters have no effect on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no discouragement at the moment the absent minded nail/cuticle biting actually takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is working wonderfully for our dog whose paw is currently bandaged for two weeks while his surgery heals.  We both hate dealing with that huge flea collar and slathering this stuff on his paw has kept him from bothering it while he is hanging with the family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old female, and have been biting my nails my entire life. Any time there is even a little bit of &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; at the top of my nail, its gone within the day. I&#x27;ve tried to stop many times, but I&#x27;m the type that bites them when I&#x27;m sitting idle (at a movie, watching tv, etc). It&#x27;s a gross habit and I&#x27;ve wanted to stop many times but have not had success. I&#x27;m getting married in June and decided I want to quit this disgusting habit once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed, but skeptical, at the large number of glowing reviews on Amazon about this product, and the bad reviews were a result of improper use or not following the directions. I decided to give it a shot. I ordered it and it sat in my house for about a month. I was SCARED of what it might taste like! Finally, I decided to give it a try. The first two days I didn&#x27;t get a taste of it at all as I was very conscious about putting my hands anywhere near my face. However, by the third day, I didn&#x27;t really think that much about it. I got some vegetable dip on my thumbnail and when I went to lick it off... YUCK! This stuff is gross, and it definitely does linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 weeks now. While the urge to bite my nails isn&#x27;t gone, I am happy to report that I have not bitten them while the product was on my nails. I did go through a four-day period after my first week using the product where I didn&#x27;t apply it at all and promptly bit all my nails once the polish wore off. Darn it! But after reapplying, I&#x27;m back to letting them start to look nice again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found what works best for me is to paint them a pretty color with a good quality nail polish (one that won&#x27;t chip easily) and then continue to paint the Mavala on every morning during the week. I&#x27;ve found that if I can&#x27;t see the whites of my nails growing longer, then the temptation to bite them is not as strong. This, coupled with the Mavala, is finally making my nails look normal. My cuticles also look healthier overall. I am hopeful that with continued use of this product over the next few weeks, the urge to bite them will finally be gone (and I can start eating finger foods and dips again).o look healthier overall. I am hopeful that with continued use of this product over the next few weeks, the urge to bite them will finally be gone (and I can start eating finger foods and dips again).</li>
            <li> My son had a bad habbit of biting his nails. Once I put this on his nails for the first time, he about gagged when he bit his nails. The downside about this product is once you put it on your nails, you taste it when you eat food with your hands. My son stopped biting his nails for a while until I guess he got used to the taste. The polish chips off easily so you have to re-apply nightly. I put some on one of my nail and it tastes HORRIBLE!!! It gets the job done!</li>
            <li> is a good product my son liked thumbsucking but after this what you are thinking, this tastes awful is durable and also definitely think I&#x27;ll buy again</li>
            <li> Best stuff in the world!  It helped my son quit from sucking his thumb...literally in one application!  Now for me to get some more for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 month old son who was sucking his thumb to the point that we were concerned about the possible loss of his nail (yuck). This worked immediately. We re-applied every three days for a while and the issue appears to have been resolved now. Be careful though, without realizing it I had gotten some on my own hand and yes - it tastes horrible and you cant get rid of the taste for a while.</li>
            <li> My goal was to stop biting my nails, and this stuff works! I&#x27;ve used it for two months and my nails are absolutely growing because I&#x27;ve stopped biting my nails. The taste is simply awful, which is what is needed to help you stop biting your nails! If you really want to stop, BUY THIS STUFF. You will hate your self, but love what happens to your hands and nails....</li>
            <li> Greatly appreciated it really works used it for 2 days and stopped socking thumbs. For a 8 years old child.</li>
            <li> My son would not stop sucking his thumb. We tried everything, even braces and he would take them off even in his sleep. 3 days of this and he hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb since - it&#x27;s been over a year. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> my daughter has learned how to lick the nasty tasting stuff off so that she can still suck her thumb. and trust me, it tastes DISGUSTING!</li>
            <li> Like it. It tastes very bad and keeps my 2 year son from Thumb Sucking.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever used.  It is cruel to put this on any part of a child&#x27;s body. The horrible taste from it stays in the child&#x27;s mouth for hours. Find some other way to help your child break bad habits; ANY other way.</li>
            <li> Gave it a star since I couldn&#x27;t give it no stars!  Just a tiny bit applied and my 3 yr old paid a price, worked a few days but it gave her a rash around her mouth.  The rash  did not go away even after I took off the application and scrubbed her umbs vigorously....high price to pay for a habit that will wear off eventually.  Buyer beware...money down the drain!</li>
            <li> It helped in the beginning.  My daughter seems to not mind the taste anymore, she&#x27;s just a voracious thumb sucker at seven years old!</li>
            <li> I applied this as directed and the first time my son put his fingers in his mouth he started to vomit. He was sick all day. He has not put his fingers back in his mouth but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Really works. Stopped my three year old from biting his nails almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I am a 39 year old woman and have NEVER had natural nails of any shape or length.  I used to blame it on my nails being weak and brittle.  So not the case!  I started using this about 2 weeks ago and am getting nails - beautiful strong nails.  Who knew?!?!  I highly recommend these.  The taste is awful and doesn&#x27;t come off your lips very easily.  If you chew on your nails out of habit, you&#x27;ll notice for hours to come.  I&#x27;m also trying to break my son of this habit as well.  It&#x27;s been great to encourage and tease each other along the way.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Helpful tip: The gloss from the polish will rub off after a few days (especially if you wash your hands with soap a few times). As a male user of this polish, I certainly did not want everyone around me to think I wear clear nail polish. However, the coating (what provides the bitter taste) stays on for weeks after you apply the polish. My nails have now grown out and I have Mavala Stop to thank for that. Since one coat is barely a 1/10 of the bottle, I suspect this small bottle will last me a few months, if not years.</li>
            <li> This worked really well to help my 3 year old stop biting his nails.  I only put a drop on each nail, but 3 weeks later and he has stopped biting them.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my then three-year-old daughter, who had a very bad habit of sucking her thumb. I typically put this on her before she went to bed at night, and usually had to reapply within two or three days.The thumbsucking completely stopped about one month after applying the first application. I definitely recommend for thumb sucking and or nailbiting habits.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old  grandson had a fair amount of upheaval in his short life.  His thumb was what he used to calm and soothe himself.  He wanted to quit sucking his thumb but just couldn&#x27;t.  I felt so bad for him.  It was ruining his teeth and his thumb was beginning to flatten.  His dentist suggested the Mavala.  When it came in, he started to cry because he said he was going to miss that thumb.  I didn&#x27;t force him, I told him when he was ready we&#x27;d try it.  Two days later he said he was ready and I painted it on his nails.  1 1/2 weeks and he was done with that thumb!  He was so proud of himself, thanks to his dentist and Mavala, he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about being embarrassed in front of his friends.</li>
            <li> Product worked great!  Our daughter is 4 yrs old and has always sucked her thumb.  We tried using rewards, putting band-aids on her thumbs, etc. with no success.  After about a week of using this product she now doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter who has been biting her nails for years. This product worked perfectly. It lasts for a few days before having to reapply. Wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT!!!!  It tastes horrible and after tasting it, you will never want to taste it again and you stop biting your nails!  I HIGHLY recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is straight up gross.  But as a person who chronically bit her nails for the past 25 years, I&#x27;m grateful for the extra motivation to kick this nasty habit!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for my daughter - she just kept sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> we have applied it only two times for my five years old..He stopped thumb sucking forever..</li>
            <li> We tried wearing a thumb sleeve and the cayenne pepper nail polish with no luck at all.  This did the trick!  Our daughter never wanted to suck her thumb when this was on.  Within a week she was cured (finally at age 5!)</li>
            <li> my bf stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li> Tastes gross!  Worked for me.  I now have pretty nails, so thank you.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well, I stopped biting my nails the day i put it on, however it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> My daughter was ready to stop sucking her thumb (almost 3yo) and this stuff helped in a matter of 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did sputter a LOT when she accidentally put her thumb in her mouth, but was cured of thumb sucking in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if I could !! Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> ended up using maybe a total of 3 times, because my babies. Twins. Decided that they like the taste of the stuff, when it actually tastes I bit hazardous and toxic in my opinion (though I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t be) I was too scared to continue because they just suck it right off, and Keep right on sucking their fingers.</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned four and told us she wanted to stop sucking her thumb, so we tried everything (really, seriously, everything!) and nothing seemed to stick. This put a bitter taste in her mouth and worked from the very first time we used it, we&#x27;re on day 6 of no thumbsucking (day and night) and she is getting a party to celebrate her success. As you know thumbsucking is very psychological, so I think it worked, because she wanted to stop and it tastes gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these products and this one is the best.  You just brush it onto your nails and it tastes terrible.. wow it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> Bought this for my nail biting daughter. Tastes terrible I&#x27;ve been told &amp;  it really works great! As long as she rea</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for 37 years and had thought that I had tried everything- nothing had worked.  This product is amazing!  Yes, it tastes horrible and it lasts for days!  The best surprise with this product is that it actually strengthens the nails!  I cannot believe it.  My nails are growing and they are growing strong, therefore I do not expect them to break and tear.  I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially people who believe they have tried it all!</li>
            <li> My son is high-functioning autistic and began biting his nails way down past the quick. Nothing seemed to stop him. It might be an OCD issue. Whatever the cause, his nails looked horrible, were painful for him and were bleeding. I ordered this and started using it a week ago and not only did he stop biting his nails immediately but they are starting to grow. I told him we would have to continue using it until his nails grew back. Then we&#x27;d see if we&#x27;ve still need to use it or not. I highly recommend giving them toothpicks and/or utensils for finger foods as once they get a taste of it, they will most likely not want their fingers in their mouth again (my son has not). I did a taste test on it myself and while it&#x27;s not the most horrible taste I&#x27;ve had in my mouth, it was nasty enough to make me want use nail polish to remove it right away. It does not have a horrible smell to it.  Make sure you re-apply a coat or two every three days. I gave my son a choice between using this or soaking his fingers in hot sauce. He chose the polish. He argued that I didn&#x27;t trust him to stop. I told him I did trust him and I knew he wanted to stop but that he needed help being reminded. I will update after his nails have grown more. Right now, I&#x27;m very pleased with this polish.</li>
            <li> This is great product although I do recommend reading some reviews so you can get a good idea of what to expect or so...&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience was great I used it on my 3 1/2 year old. I did not tell her I was going to use this product I used it after she had fallen a sleep and applied a thin coating the next day my baby sitter did not see her suck her thumb at all. I was content and completely ignored the fact that I need to re-apply another coat in two days until she started sucking her thumb again, so just make sure to be consistent just like the label states otherwise the bitter flavor does fade away. As far as her diet she has been doing well she has not refused to eat any of her normal food due to the bitter taste of her thumb. I do think that it is important though to make sure you only apply the mavala on the nail bed only try not to touch the skin, my theory is that this will help not to have the bitter taste while she eats and touches the skin. I hope this was helpful and GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is hard to believe that it works so well to stop thumb sucking. It worked for us. However, our daughter then stopped her calming mechanism to go to sleep. She started staying awake very late and thus, not being rested the next day.&lt;br /&gt;So there is a hit and a miss, be careful with what you ask for...</li>
            <li> I have unsuccessfully tried to get my youngest to stop sucking his thumb since he was just an infant. Because I had so much difficulty with his older brother (who didn&#x27;t stop sucking until he was in elementary school and it already had moved his permanent teeth), I was determined to snip this one in the bud. However, nothing I tried worked (and I tried a LOT of thumb sucking remedies). I even got him to stop sucking one thumb, and instead he started sucking the other. However, due to the problems I had had with my older son, I thought it would be worth trying Mavala. I thought it would take a full month of using Mavala to get my three year old to give up his habit, but it took less than two weeks! It has been several months since, and he hasn&#x27;t gone back to sucking his thumb. I love that it stays on for more than a day and doesn&#x27;t require constant reapplication. I will say though, that the taste must be awful; the first night my son used it he ended up throwing up because he kept sticking his thumb in his mouth. It wasn&#x27;t that the product itself made him throw up, but I think he just finally gagged from the taste.</li>
            <li> I finally have nails! This product sure doesn&#x27;t taste like it smells, there is no strong smell, but the taste is just awful.</li>
            <li> Thanks great product, fast transaction and shipping</li>
            <li> mavala stop  did a great job.This product helped my 2 1/2 yr old to break thumb sucking within 5 days.</li>
            <li> Working great so far.  She doesn&#x27;t have issues eating finger foods but we have went 3 days and nights without finger sucking.  Plan on giving review to dentist as soon as we see him again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money on other products - just use Mavala stop and your issues with thumb sucking/fingernail biting/ chewing on fingers will be over.  It tastes AWFUL which is exactly what you want.  It lasts through hand washing, showers, baths, etc.  We typically apply it once per week and it helped our children break the habit quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It totally worked for my 3yr to stop sucking both her thumbs.  She mostly did it at stressful or sleepy times.  It tastes really bad so I did just a tiny bit on the tips of nails and when that wore off I painted the whole nail a couple times a week. After a couple weeks she remembered to never suck her thumbs again and its worked ever since.  I am definitely using it again with my other daughter when the time comes for her to stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, it tastes awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note is that if you eat with your hands it can accidentally get in your mouth. The taste also transfers well to things you touch and since I work in the food service industry, I had to make sure to get nail polish remover!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so disgusting it will make your brain and body shutter anytime you try to bite your nails! If you are a committed nail biter - you will make that mistake. Probably maximum of three times! Than your brain will shout at you if you get your hands anywhere near your mouth - &amp;#34;no, no don&#x27;t do that! Drop it! I said drop it! Did you forget already?! Drop it!&amp;#34; And you will. The taste is amazingly bad and it lingers for a LONG time. It&#x27;s also great for dieting. You will stop snacking on any finger foods - unless you can eat chips with a fork.&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning - when preparing food with your hands - especially for kids - I would recommend wearing gloves. It does transfer on foods and it completely turned my kids off from strawberries (that I had cut and placed on a plate for them).&lt;br /&gt;I have been biting my nails for about 20 years. This helped me stop in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Applied twice and her fingers and she never put it back in her mouth. Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> (2013 &amp; 2014)I was very disappointed because after a while of trying this every time that I would put it on she would keep sucking her finger or try to rub her fingers in the bed to take what I had put in her nail to take it off but when I found out she was doing that I would wait for her nails to dry. But after months she got used to the taste and it was not stopping her. (2015)So this year I bought in March something that is called: Thumbkin&lt;br /&gt;Stop Thumb Sucking Complete System With Step by Step Parent Guide.  &amp;#60;---This is the best honestly no chemicals or nothing. Go check it out. After only 4 days my daughter stopped sucking her finger. As of now I am blessed she has not tried to suck her finger at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! My dentist told me about it. However, be careful how you use it.  If I put it on my child&#x27;s fingers to condition him to keep his fingers out of his mouth, I make sure to wash his hands thoroughly before he eats anything because he will taste it on his fingers and stop eating. You don&#x27;t want that! I find it works great to put it on objects that he won&#x27;t stop  putting in his mouth. He is not a toddler. He&#x27;s over the age of six and on the autism spectrum.</li>
            <li> Has worked so far on GF only thing is you have to stay on the ball with reminding whoever is using it. They will &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; to apply it haha</li>
            <li> 2 Weeks, no more thumb sucking.  Tastes awful, warning.  Do not eat with fingers!  Yuck.</li>
            <li> 1 application is all it took! My 4 yo has refused to stop sucking her thumb. The dentist suggested that I get this product. 1 application is all it took for her to give it up. She doesn&#x27;t even do it when she&#x27;s sleeping.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter really wanted to stop sucking her fingers, but she said she didn&#x27;t know how to stop. She&#x27;s been sucking her fingers so long that she has tooth marked scars on two of her fingers where her teeth meet the flesh of her finger.  She cried because she really wanted to stop sucking her fingers but couldn&#x27;t control her finger sucking impulse. We put Mavala on and she stuck them in her mouth. She screamed and cried that she wanted it off, even though we told her it would help her stop.  At first we thought maybe we didn&#x27;t make the right decision by telling her it was bitter nail polish and what it was going to do.  Even though we&#x27;ve continued putting it on her nails for about two weeks, after the first time she tasted it, she never again put her fingers in her mouth. One taste cured her finger sucking! She&#x27;s very happy and proud of herself that she&#x27;s not sucking anymore.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to help at all. We would put it on our daughter&#x27;s thumbnails, and maybe 10 minutes later, she&#x27;d be sucking it again, not bothered at all by the taste.</li>
            <li> The reviews do not lie. This got me and my 4 year old son to stop biting our nails! I have been biting my nails for 30 years!!! And tried everything!! This did the trick!!! Now I have long beautiful nails. I actually use a nail file. I get manicures. I paint my nails... Nothing I&#x27;ve ever done in my whole life.. .</li>
            <li> My 7 years old son was sucking his thumb since birth. We did everything we could to stop him including assistance from his school. Nothing works. I came across Mavala while doing search online to find out if my son was the only one in this situation. I purchased it and used it and it works well. In two days, he stopped completely sucking his thumb and his teachers at school asked me how it happened and what I used.&lt;br /&gt;My advice for the first day or days depending on your child age: the first time you apply make sure you have time to stay with your child to monitor him or her as the need to suck is already a habit for him or her. In my case to help remember not to put the thumb in his mouth, I wrapped a very soft tape below the nails to remind him not to put the thumb in his mouth. If you do not have time to monitor, wait until he or she sleeps and apply it on the nails. By the time he/she wakes up, it will be completely dried which is good as it may be sticky before it get dried. Remember the first day, the child may be aggravated for not doing the habit. Find a pleasant game  or activity the child likes the most to occupy him or her to pass this time.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this well&lt;br /&gt;Barry from  New York, USA</li>
            <li> Effective! Took a few days for my 4 year old to stop and after 2 weeks she never even thought about sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> This shipped out and delivered quickly. I used one time and my kid stopped sucking her thumb. A month later I caught her biting her nails so I used it again and she hasn&#x27;t done it since. Mavala Stop works!!</li>
            <li> Obsessive thumb-sucking 3yo.  Kicked the habit instantly with this stuff.  It tastes so nasty and lasts all day, sometimes two.</li>
            <li> My daughter stop it, in a week!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I lost 5 lb and had no side effect. I recommend this to everybody. You will not regret</li>
            <li> this stuff works. it&#x27;s gross, and you have to train yourself the hard way to keep you hands out of your mouth, but that&#x27;s the point. it stays on your fingertips even after one shower. one problem, but minor, when you&#x27;re eating finger foods it does get on the food so you have to place your fingers somewhere like on a sandwich and keep them there, and not eat that part..minor.</li>
            <li> Our son began biting on his cuticles when he entered junior high...nervous reaction.  After a time, it became a habit even though he was no longer nervous at school.  He knew to stop, he just kept going back to doing it, unaware. After using this product for 2 weeks, he was totally broken of the habit.  This works very well.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for the better part of 25+ years. My nail biting was so bad that I started getting acrylic nails off and on beginning in the 5th grade. I have been using this product for a week and have not taken one single bite out of my nails. The taste is so bad that I have stopped putting my fingers in my mouth all together. Even though it has been a week, I don&#x27;t have the urge to bite my nails anymore. I think it is safe to say I am officially no longer a nail bitter!</li>
            <li> My 5-year daughter was struggling with thumb sucking until we got this.  Within about three days, she stopped sucking her thumb intentionally.  After a week, we found her unintentionally putting her thumb in her mouth.  She teared up when we mentioned this nail polish and she stopped completely on her own, just because she did not want another application of the Mavala on her nails.</li>
            <li> Well, we tried it because of the high, high rating.  But it didn&#x27;t phase our 3 (almost 4 year old) &amp;#34;thumb-sucker when she&#x27;s tired/sleeps&amp;#34;.  A few hours after we put her to bed, she was sucking, and she woke up sucking.  The next couple of nights, we put it on heavier and even tasted it ourselves (YUCK!).  It didn&#x27;t phase her.  When probed, she just said, &amp;#34;Yeah, it tastes kind of bad, but I kind of like it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff taste horrendous (as designed) and yet my 4 year old laughs in it&#x27;s face. Sorry Mavala but just hasn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> Thank&#x27;s for the WORKING ITEM, my girl&#x27;s nails ar beautiful again !!! I really recomend who have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Due to stress, habit, and who knows what else, I was biting my nails non-stop to the point of pain most of the time.  I ordered this after reading all the reviews (mostly describing how awful it tasted but that it worked).  They were spot on.  It does taste AWFUL!  But it totally made me stop biting my nails or even putting them near my mouth!  They started growing and look healthy again.  What I liked the most was that the polish stayed on for a few days.  I had to re-paint but the fact that it was consistent for a good period is what helped the most.  I am so glad I ordered this!!!</li>
            <li> After couple of weeks of use my little girl completely stopped bitting her nails! Great product! Would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> Get the expected result in only 2 days ! Perfect product, last for a long time on nail. No side effects and completely safe. My daughter is 6 years old and stopped thumb sucking in 2 days only but:&lt;br /&gt; - don&#x27;t tell your kid that you are using it as (s)he may work to remove it.&lt;br /&gt; - Your kid preferably to be 5+ years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mavala !</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he has completely stopped biting his nails. He says it is the perfect reminder to get your hands out of your mouth</li>
            <li> This product is so much better than any of the others.  It must really stay on there, because my 6.5 year old says he can taste it for a day or two after I paint it on--even after washing his hands.  We have used it in conjunction with the Stop Finger Sucking with Finger Guard Kit (Size Medium/Ages 5-6) to kick a 6.5 year finger-sucking habit.</li>
            <li> my child still bites her nail the taste does not bother her, it may not be for ever one with children who don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> My son is now 6 and has sucked his thumb for years.  He also twirls his hair simultaneously and was developing a bald spot on the top of his head.  We decided before he was 6 that we had to get serious.  I had bought the glove with the thumb covered several months ago, but that didn&#x27;t work, his teachers have tried forever, but with just a dab on his thumbnail every other night for 2 weeks (with his agreement, of course - he got a 3DS out of the deal on his birthday), he&#x27;s no longer sucking or twirling.  It must taste truly terrible.  Highly recommend, and I NEVER write reviews.  Note that I followed the advice of one Mom who said don&#x27;t put too much on.</li>
            <li> We wanted something to help with nail biting for an 11 year old and this worked.  It took a week of applying it every other day and then coming back to it once a few weeks later, but the nail biting has stopped.</li>
            <li> This thing works! It did not take long for this to work on my 4 year old. Since my son mainly sucks his thumb at night or when he is tired,  I decided to apply it a few minutes before bedtime.  He was really upset when he first tasted it and it took a while to get him to sleep.  He woke up at 3am on his stool in the bathroom trying to rinse it off.  That was tough. The direction said to apply it every 2 days, I did it every 3-4 days and it took only 3 tries.  It has been about 2 months since my son sucked his thumb.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> was exactly what we were looking for to get our 4 year old to stop biting his nails.  worked instantly and didn&#x27;t aggravate him while getting him to stop biting</li>
            <li> It worked. My daughter tasted it on her thumb when she went to suck it. The first couple of weeks were rough with her going through withdrawal. She doesn&#x27;t think of even sucking her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> MY SON WHO HAD AN ISSUE WITH BITING HIS NAILS STILL CONTINUED ON AFTER APPLYING THIS. IT DIDNT PHASE HIM AT ALL. MAYBE IT JUST WASNT FOR HIM. THANKFULLY HE HAS STOPPED ON HIS OWN ACCORD.</li>
            <li> This tastes very bitter, as advertised, but that didn&#x27;t seem to stop my daughter too much.  When we first put it on her she avoided her fingers, but slowly got used to the taste and now it doesn&#x27;t bother her at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your child doesn&#x27;t get used to the taste this could work very well, but it did not for us.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product after my child&#x27;s 4th birthday. We didn&#x27;t want her to go to kindergarten while still sucking her thumb. We sat down with her and offered to put on &#x27;special nail polish&#x27;, but in return would also paint the rest of her nails for the first time. She was so excited. Obviously this tactic prob won&#x27;t work for boys. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple hours later, she went to bed and instinctively put her thumb in her mouth. Wow, she made a terrible face. We got out of bed and rinsed her mouth. After about 5 minutes she was fine. That was the last time she sucked her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We kept using the product for 2 weeks, just in case, but she never relapsed. A year and a half later and everything is great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our 3 year old. He ended up just biting anyway and the stuff seemed to wear off quickly once that started. We&#x27;ve tried is on several different occasions now over the course of a year and he still bites.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!  I am a 33 year old nail biter and have tried EVERYTHING to stop biting. This stuff is awful tasting and lasts a long time. Even after multiple hand washing.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders. She hated the taste which kept her thumb out of her mouth we used it for about 2 months we now have a 7 yr old that doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> My son has had a habit of sucking on his pointer and middle finger together at once since he was 4 months old. He was sucking on the fingers so much that he has sores on both of those fingers and the nails are extremely soft and brittle. Now he&#x27;s 2 years and 8 months old and I desperately wanted him to shake the disgusting habit. I put this on both nails and 15 or so minutes later he stuck his fingers in his mouth. He shuddered and pulled them back out. It&#x27;s been a week and his fingers haven&#x27;t gone back in his mouth, not even while asleep. I&#x27;m still putting it on him every other day just in case but this was definitely money well spent! I just want to add that part of the reason this worked so well for us is firstly because my son is very sensitive to taste and secondly because once I ordered it, every time his fingers went into his mouth I would tell him that if he didn&#x27;t stop his fingers would start to taste bad.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old didn&#x27;t like the bitterness for about 24 hours.  After that he doesn mind it as long as he can suck his thumb and bite his nails.  I even reapplied daily and he still doesn&#x27;t mind the taste.</li>
            <li> I got this to help me stop my nail-biting, and it definitely has a gross, bitter taste every time my fingers touch my mouth. I reapply each morning, and so far, it&#x27;s serving its intended purpose. My only issue with it is that eating finger foods can be a little tricky, but otherwise, I&#x27;m on my way to stopping my nail biting.</li>
            <li> Both my 9 year old daughter and my 6 year old son stopped sucking their thumbs.  This stuff works and very quickly!  I suggest to just put it on the base of their thumb...this stuff is really powerful.  I found this helps the next day when they are eating because my kids kept tasting it while they were eating.</li>
            <li> Since I bought this, I stopped biting my nails! THANK GOD!</li>
            <li> I have been nail biting for a decade and this stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product works. Our 4 year old is still a pretty heavy thumb sucker and also a nail biter. Got this on the recommendation of his Pre-K 4 teacher. It definitely put a stop to it. Unfortunately our 6 year old broke the bottle and our 4 year old regressed, so we are in the process of reordering. It is true what others say about transfer onto food so don&#x27;t be liberal with it when you apply. I found myself on the receiving end by accident at one point and it definitely taste horrible.</li>
            <li> I initially reviewed this and gave it 5 stars after about a week as my 3 year old son had virtually stopped sucking his thumb about 90% of the time.  But, he quickly learned how to suck through the smell/taste and now does it all the time.  So we&#x27;ve stopped putting it on him and will try again in a few months.  We may resort to the clear cast thing for night time.  I have no idea what we&#x27;ll do for daytime if this stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> absolutely stopped my daughter from sucking her thumb, highly recommend this for nail biters or thumb suckers! thank you so much</li>
            <li> It really works and effective! i have identical twin girls! one is doing nail biting and the other one is thumb sucking! But now, they stopped since first week of using Mavala Stop! My only regret is I wish i bought Mavala stop right away!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> The taste is awful which is a good thing unlike others. Only drawback is that it has a shiny tone and is NOT matte finish.</li>
            <li> I hate to love this product because it tastes so terrible that it works amazingly! I have been a life time nail biter, but with this stuff i do not want my fingers near my mouth!</li>
            <li> Been using this product on my 4 year old son for 2 weeks and is not even slowing him down on sucking his thumb. Used as recommended in the instructions.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our 6yo daughter who still sucks her thumb.  This seems to work great and the small size will still last quite a while, even with regular applications.  Whenever it&#x27;s applied, we&#x27;re usually good for several days before it wears off.</li>
            <li> Finally something that has helped me with the worst habit of mine! After years of biting my nails, the fear of having my nails close to my mouth has paid off!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with STOP!!! It has been around for ever and it does the job!!! I tried everything for my toddler and STOP did exactly what it says STOP!!! Great product</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm. It comepletely stopped the thumb-sucking from my child. i reccomend this for kids with thumb sucking problems</li>
            <li> My five year old son rubs it off before it sets or scrapes it off. He outsmarted me :( Wish it was quick drying. Two stars for vile flavor, but it&#x27;s not quick drying.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! No more fingers in the mouth! Thumb be gone!</li>
            <li> I had a thumb sucker I never thought would ever quit. We used all over the counter nail polishes and nothing worked. We paid $75 for thumb guards which broke, caused sores and got strange looks as we went into public. This Mavala Stop, actually worked. Cured thumb sucker. I wish I would have gotten this long ago. My wife says only use a little though as she had a taste from using it to stop biting her nails....she is now growing nails out for the first time.</li>
            <li> Just as many other reviewers I bought this from my child&#x27;s dentist to stop him from sucking his thumb. He is 3 1/2 and has sucked his thumb his whole life. I applied it one time and he has never sucked his thumb again....and I really mean never even put it in his mouth. His dentist told him that three year olds thumbs start tasting bad. We talked about that for a couple of days then I painted it on his thumb while he was sleeping, which sounds really mean but I honestly didn&#x27;t want him to associate me with this horrible tasting stuff! He woke up a few hours later gagging and screaming and no matter how many times we brushed his teeth and gave him water it still seemed to taste badly. It was an awful hour to calm him down but it worked. Now I say to use caution because you don&#x27;t need to apply that much, to the nail is plenty. Do not put it on their finger at all it is very very strong. My only concerns now that he doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb (it&#x27;s been about three weeks) is he has stopped napping even though I really think he still needs the nap. This could just be his age because I know a lot of three year olds don&#x27;t nap but it seems to be coinciding with not sucking his thumb. His other issue he has now started biting his nails. I haven&#x27;t resorted to painting this on for that habit but I might if it continues!</li>
            <li> Great product against nail biting and nail health. I used it for two months and helped a lot to stop.</li>
            <li> i never write reviews but i feel this is important. I have been biting my nails for as long as i can remember and it has already stopped me and i&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week now. I can see my nails already growing back. But it is a little too strong. It is very hard to eat finger foods, because when you eat all i can taste is the bitterness, its bad if you get hair in your mouth because you will also taste the nail polish trying to remove the hair. If you accidentally touch your lip it the taste stays on your lips and in your mouth, so i have been chewing a lot of gum recently to combat this. The taste lingers in your mouth far too long and its quite annoying, but it is definitely stopping me and that is the goal.</li>
            <li> works perfect. my problem is that I dont know when I&#x27;m biting my nails and with this you just have your fingers close to your lips and taste horrible. this is good!</li>
            <li> Worked on my husband, but risks our marriage doing it. Minimal results on his 5yeaf old son whom I believe would put a dead skunk in his mouth, but I digress. Weigh the risk vs benefit here. Hubby is none too pleased with me at the moment.</li>
            <li> My son thought it was gross, but can i just reapply the product every few days without cleaning the previous application off first .</li>
            <li> My 3 year old had been sucking her fingers from when she was a baby.  The habit was so ingrained she dudnt even realize she was doing it anymore.  We had tried about everything.  I asked for recommendations from the dentist, and this was what they suggested.  My daughter was not pleased to try this, but it worked wonders!!!  Within a week, yes habit was gone.  She requests it&#x27;s now if she feels she might go back.  Strongly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I put this on with her, and &amp;#34;tasted&amp;#34; it in front of her.  It is nasty, and the taste lingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> my 20 month old  son would suck his thumb so much that he got marks on his thumb from it...but after using this just for less than a week it worked like a charm...highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> It is effective. The only bad side is that you have to apply every 2-3 days. I like it!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a nail biter so I was willing to give anything a try to get her to stop.  She always did it as she was laying in bed at night and then would yell for a Band-Aid because her fingers hurt.  Super annoying.  She hated the taste of this but didn&#x27;t mind me putting it on because it goes on as if you are putting nail polish on her fingers.  She accidentally stuck her finger in my mouth and I can attest it is an icky taste that definitely would make me not want to put my fingers in my mouth.  A week worth of using this, we haven&#x27;t had any problems with her biting her nails.  Crossing my fingers it is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Helped stop the nail biting. Even after it dries if you eat food (with your hands, obviously) you will taste it!</li>
            <li> Need to remember to use this stuff. Bad bitter disgusting after taste. Made me think twice. I have bitten my nails since I was a kid. If I could just remember to put it on, it would work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really useful to correct the nail-biting.&lt;br /&gt;And it also protect the nail at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend !!</li>
            <li> It works. I have been sucking my thumb since I was 3 days old. I am now 40 and needed a change. I didn&#x27;t want to spend my whole life sucking my thumb. I needed to stop my 8 year-old daughter from sucking hers too. I agree with some of the other reviews where they state that it gets on everything. You can not like your fingers or thumbs with this stuff on it. I have used it for a little over a month and have officially stopped sucking my thumb after all these years. My daughter has stopped as well. It was great to have that buddy system going with her. I needed something safe and harmless but did the job and this is it. I suck on hard candy now when I need that sucking satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Our son is almost 4 years old and mainly sucked his thumb at bedtime or for comfort when he was upset. We tried discouraging the thumb sucking since he was about 2.5 years old with very little success (that was when he went from sucking his thumb all the time to only at night and when upset). At his last dentist appt, his dentist recommended Mavala. It was amazing to see how quickly this product worked without any frustration or heartache for us and our son! We talked to him about it before using it and he was resistant but within the first week he stopped sucking his thumb! We applied as directed every 2 days for about a week and a half. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks now without any thumb sucking. I thought for sure we would need one of those horrible (and expensive) thumb guards, but nope! this did the trick! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My ten year old had developed a nervous habit of biting his nails. But from the first application I knew this stuff was the ticket. He really dislikes the taste and stopped biting. And it seems to last. I only applied it for a week (before the bottle was mysteriously misplaced? - Hidden??) Anyway, he has stopped and if we have the problem again, I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> My niece just turned 3 years old and was an avid thumb sucker.  She sucked when tired, when watching tv, walking through the house, constantly. She gave no signs of wanting to ever give it up.  I read some reviews about various products and read many positive ones about this product. I ordered some and gave it to my sister for my niece.  We told her we were using it to remind her that she is a big girl and doesnt need her thumb.  We also gave her a soft stuffed kitty to cuddle.  She stopped in 2 days!  The first day she tried to switch to her other thumb, but she didnt like that and didnt try it for long.  She still puts her thumb to her mouth out of habit, but removes it quickly!  AMAZING</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Mavala for my daughter (when she turns five) because she said it worked on her daughter.  Well, I didn&#x27;t wait until she was five, I waited until she was two and a half and it did not kill her.  Astonishingly, she stopped sucking her thumb immediatly.  She had a moment where she cried in my arms and said, \\&quot;mommy, I just want to suck my thumb!\\&quot; crying and crying.  I told her, honey, your thumb doesn&#x27;t taste good at this age and it&#x27;s time to stop.  That was the end of it.  Within a week, I didn&#x27;t have to apply another drop.  It has been over and month and she is thumb sucking free!!  I was talking to co-workers about it and she friend bought the rest of the bottle.  I didn&#x27;t have to use much.  She paid me for the remainder, so the Mavala paid for itself essentially and now both of her boys (two and three) are also no longer thumb suckers.  Love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  Just FYI, put it on their thumb when they are sleeping.  Children are clever and can put two and two together.  Nailpolish on thumb&#x3D;bad taste and want to wash it off.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  We followed the directions.  After 10 days, my daughter had nails growing!  I did notice that once we stopped using it she began biting her nails again, but only some of them.  We plan to repeat the 10 day application.  My daughter did not like the taste which helped her stop biting her nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dentist recommended this product a couple of years ago to help her quit sucking her thumb. I should have bought it when he first told me, it would have saved thousands in orthodontist bills and braces!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 4 year old who has been sucking her thumb from about the time she was born. It took 4 days and she stopped completely! I am so grateful for the friend who recommended this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ... the only thing I did notice is that I had to put it on everyday and not every other day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old who kept biting his nails. My kid hates it. So I guess it does what it is suppose to do. I am not sure if this is what fixed my son&#x27;s habit but we use this as an effective threat when he comes back from school with bitten nails. He still does it occasionally but we found this to be good deterrent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for about 15 years now and have never been able to stop.  Applying this to your nails definitely stops you!  My issue why I have not broken the habit yet though is I don&#x27;t always apply it so I can wane off it, and I so far have failed.  But when it is applied it absolutely does its purpose!  I&#x27;ve tried polishes like this where I would still bite my nails despite the bitter taste because it was tolerable enough.  THIS one is not! Who would&#x27;ve thought that saying something tastes awful in a review means it gets 5 stars! It lasts a long time as well, and it dries in minutes and is clear, so men (like me) can use it and not be worried :p</li>
            <li> This product works well, but you have to keep using it!  lol!  It tastes bad, and will get on whatever your fingers touch, including food.  It also stays on your nails for days!</li>
            <li> Works wonders my son has nails now.</li>
            <li> worked great for a few days on my 4 year old&#x27;s fingers - he claimed he was cured and would never suck them again. then his desire to suck them overcame the distaste and he was immune to it. no amount of application works after that.</li>
            <li> Definitely works!  My 9 year old finally stopped putting her thumb into her mouth! It took a few weeks because my daughter is swimming every day and you need to reapply daily since the chlorine seemed to neutralize the effects, and we kept forgetting to apply.  But if your child is not swimming, one application should last about a week.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have been a nail biter for as long as I can remember. This broke my habit. It took about 4 weeks for me, and I  usually have to use it during finals week and things like that, so I don&#x27;t go back to my old ways. The nice thing about this product is that the taste of it is so overwhelming, even if you consciously want to bite your nails, the effects of the product are not worth the satisfaction of biting. There are also a few expected downsides. One, the taste lingers for about 5 minutes after it touches your mouth, so if you are eating dinner, the food will taste awful. Secondly, this clear nail polish has a sheen to it, so being a 21 year old guy, I get a few people that look at me with a weird face asking, &amp;#34;dude are you wearing nail polish?&amp;#34; Aside from that I would discourage the use of this product with infants or kids young enough try cry when they taste something horrible, because this product is super potent. I personally find that to be a good thing. All in all, very effective product.</li>
            <li> It works great!  My son stopped biting his nails.</li>
            <li> You had to reapply more than was recommended. Our little thumb sucker would not be refused!</li>
            <li> It worked for me, I endured it for about 3 weeks, but not for my 4 year old. It&#x27;s a nasty taste! I don&#x27;t like it because I can also taste it in my food if I eating something that doesn&#x27;t require utensils. My 4 year old daughter also bites her nails and she didn&#x27;t seem to be bothered by the taste. She&#x27;s still biting but I stopped using it on her because she eats many finger foods and although she continued to bite her nails she stopped eating because she said her food taste nasty.</li>
            <li> Tastes like an old wallet.</li>
            <li> Works great when we remember to use it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so nasty it works.  It&#x27;s like eating ear wax (lol). I mean, the aftertaste has an aftertaste,  on top of its aftertaste that leaves one more nasty aftertaste.  I brought this for a family member who can&#x27;t keep their thumb out of their mouth.  But before giving it to them I tried it, and oh my goodness!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- We had tried everything else. This worked. The behavior took only a month or so to extinguish. It was a bugger before this. Verbal warnings, hot sauce, nothing else worked. We tried really hard too. I&#x27;m not a fan of &amp;#34;miracle products,&amp;#34; but this is!&lt;br /&gt;- The recipient (a 6 year old former nail-biter) doesn&#x27;t mind it being applied. He DID mind me putting hot sauce on his hands.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s enough to treat a family of 10. If you only have a few nailbiters in the house then you will be set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (minor):&lt;br /&gt;- The 6 year old likes bitter things. He claims he is not deterred by this stuff, but he acts sick if he puts his hands in his mouth with this applied. Eh, whatever, it worked...he no longer chews his nails or sticks his hands near his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;- I tried eating the 6-year old&#x27;s leftover fried chicken (which he eats with his hands) while this stuff was on his nails. It was darn bitter chicken.</li>
            <li> Amazingly potent and impossible to ignore.  It works for me and I&#x27;ve tried it all!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with my 4 years old pay for two days now and it&#x27;s working very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it first day and he really hated the taste, I even tasted it and I can say it&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;By night I saw that he was able to afford and suck his thumb from now and then quickly so I applied it again next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I can see great improvement as we tried many ways before such as covering his thumb and even talking with him but it didn&#x27;t work , he gave up for few hours but then he comes back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the third day of applying the product and not sure how will it take my son to give up the bad habit, now I see that he raises his thumb to suck it but then he remembers and lower it again, I feel sorry for him to be resisting something but it&#x27;s all for his own wellness and the dentist told that sucking the thumb near to 5 or 6 years can affect his permeation teach growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review with the results later.</li>
            <li> After using for 2 days, my 3 year old stopped sucking his thumb and never tried to again.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old (26 month old) to be exact has been sucking her two middle fingers since she was 5 months. At first I thought it was cute.  Then I realized it is a major bad habit. Her teeth started protruding out and I realized I need to nip this in the bud before it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I originally bought this product when she was 18 months. I read the disclaimer to only use it on kids 3 years or older. I also smelt the product and deemed the smell too strong and actually threw it away without even using it in on my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later, my daughter finger sucking got progressively worse. She would suck on her fingers during car rides, before meals, before bed, during her sleep, a large part of her day was her sucking her fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I got her a brace for $75. That was unsuccessful she would cry and rip it off her hand. I felt hopeless. Nothing was working&lt;br /&gt;So I thought why not give the mavala stop another try. I ordered another bottle and told my daughter that she is a big girl now and it&#x27;s time to stop sucking on her fingers. At which time I applied the mavala stop.  And of course the first thing she did was put her fingers in her mouth to only find the strong bitter taste to be so displeasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We began the process on a Saturday morning so we could monitor her and continuously apply the mavala stop for the whole weekend as she attends daycare during the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was almost instantaneous. She was reluctant to put her fingers in her mouth because of the strong bitter taste. From start to finish, the process only took one week with the major part being 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes she was more cranky because she wasn&#x27;t able to self soothe but as a mother there is a huge burden lifted from my shoulders because she has stopped this bad habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. Of course every child is different and results will vary but if you are consistent it does work!</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bad habit of sucking her middle fingers and had for almost 3 years. We had tried Thum but it did not dissuade her. This stuff works. It is SO NASTY. I accidentally got some on my fingers and got it in my mouth and it lasted for hours - blech. Tastes like when you accidentally bite a pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the trick, very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLECH. It&#x27;s nasty!</li>
            <li> This helped my son stop biting, he always bit my arm near my elbow when he was upset with me. I put some of the polish on my arm and the next time he bit me he hated it! It only took two times and Im hoping that he is done with biting finally!</li>
            <li> in less than 1 wk (only 4 applications) on my 3.5yr olds thumb nail he was done, we are 2 months thumb sucking free now!</li>
            <li> This did not work for my 4 year old despite the recommendation from our pediatrician.</li>
            <li> Bought this in hopes that it would deter my five-year-old niece from putting her fingers in her mouth and biting her nails. It does go on easy like nail polish and dries fast, The taste is bad enough to stop anyone from putting their fingers anywhere near their mouth however if you eat anything with your fingers the taste rubs off on the food and makes the food inedible. I would recommend this product only for someone who eats solely with a fork or spoon...No sandwiches, wraps finger food etc....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help at all.  My three year old sucked the stuff off and just kept on biting.  It may be better for adults or order children.  I tried it on myself first and it is disgusting!</li>
            <li> I am sure the product works great for others, but our daughter was so obsessed with thumb sucking and nail biting that she would sit and scrape her nails and thumbs to try to get off as much as possible, then would put up with the taste until she has bitten and sucked it off.  Braces didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will not work on psychological thumb sucking or nail biting.</li>
            <li> This product works as intended.  The polish tastes terrible and can last up to several days and repeated hand washing.  As someone who has been biting his nails for more than 33 years, this product has provided me with more success than anything I&#x27;ve tried previously.  While I certainly can&#x27;t advocate for it having a very pleasant flavor, that&#x27;s pretty much the point.  It is a flavor that is extremely difficult to unconsciously (or consciously) chew through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to working well, this small bottle might as well be a lifetime supply.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and the bottle still looks as full as it did the day it arrived.  Presumably most people won&#x27;t even need to use it as long as I&#x27;ve had (my habit is extremely stubborn, and even when I stopped using this product because I thought I had defeated the habit I found myself making mistakes unconsciously time and again), but the longevity of the product means it&#x27;s always available when I start to slip up and need it&#x27;s not-so-gentle reminder again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. I tried other products for my 5 year olds nail biting problem and this worked on the FIRST DAY. I personally haven&#x27;t tasted it but my sister who is a nail biter tried it and said it&#x27;s disgusting. It&#x27;s not spicey but just tastes bad enough that you won&#x27;t ever put your fingers in your mouth again. Just be careful, a little of it goes a very long way. And it was something that I would reapply maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old who has been sucking her index and middle fingers since she was 2 months old. This child sucked  her fingers so hard that they were cracked/red as a toddler, and she traumatized one of her baby teeth so bad that it didn&#x27;t even grow a root. We didn&#x27;t know that was even possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Mavala broke her habit overnight ... literally, overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finger sucking was great when she was an infant ... no getting up in the middle of the night to put back in her pacifier ... but became a problem as she got older. Her permanent teeth were starting to come in, and we had to break the habit. We tried band-aids and other bitter nail polish when she was a toddler ~ no luck. In fairness to these methods, she was just not emotionally ready to break the habit. It was a self-soothing mechanism for her.&lt;br /&gt;So we read the reviews on Mavala, and we tried again a couple of weeks before she started Kindergarten. We snuck it on her fingernails while she was sleeping, and it was absolutely miraculous. She was actually glad that her tongue &amp;#34;felt spicy&amp;#34; whenever she put her fingers in her mouth. This stuff does taste like earwax .. wicked, bad earwax.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helps if your kid is emotionally ready to stop the finger-sucking because this really works. She hasn&#x27;t put her fingers in her mouth for three weeks straight ... so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Bit my nails for 30 years.  This helped me stop.  I wore it for a month or two.  It&#x27;s been about 4-5 months now and I seem to be good to go.</li>
            <li> Been a nail biter since 2nd grade. Am now in my 50&#x27;s. Got tired of fake nails --the cost and look. Decided to try this after reading the reviews. It works. No one can believe my pretty nails are actually my own. Note: makes things you eat with you hand taste funky. Good news: I lost a couple of pounds too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy bitter- and really works! One application was enough to discourage my nail biting child. A word of warning, this stuff affect pretty much anything you touch- don&#x27;t try to eat anything with your hands or you will get a mouthful of bitter taste. My child brushed back her hair with her hand and I kissed the top of her head shortly thereafter- and got a dose of the bitterness!</li>
            <li> Good product my two year old  son doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb anymore</li>
            <li> It works on my 5 yr old grandgirl!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old used to suck her thumb day and night. I applied mavala stop to her thumb for about 3-4 weeks and she is no longer a thumb sucker. She now uses a teddy bear to sooth her at night!! Great product it really works!!!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old son sucks his thumb so much and this does work for a couple of days.  You then need to re apply it again because it wears off because my son starts to suck his thumb again.  But, as long as it&#x27;s on he doesn&#x27;t. It is a horrible taste which is good to not sucking thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!! Used on my sons nails and he put all his fingers in his mouth just to be smart and try to prove it wouldn&#x27;t work and ended up feeling ill. Hasn&#x27;t put his fingers in his mouth since!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my 8 year old son that would not stop biting his nails.  This product really works like they say.  I painted it on his nails for a few weeks, the taste was so bad every time he put his fingers in his mouth that he finally stopped.  The polish goes on clear so no one can tell it is on.  The taste is perfect to make your kids stop sucking there thumb or biting there nails. This really works so give it a try.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and as expected, tastes extremely bitter when you get it in your mouth which is a great way to make you stop biting your nails however it does make eating finger foods a little difficult.</li>
            <li> It helps my 9 years old daughter fight with the habit of nails biting. I make her nails few times per week to keep them smooth and short and then I paint them with the Mavala Stop. Her nails look much, much better than 2 years ago:-)))</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  The taste is so horrible!!!! Your nails will definitely grow quickly and it also works as a hardener.  I have been a nail bitter for most of my life and could not find anything to help me from stopping.  You can take showers and days later the bad taste remains on your finger nails.  If you rub or touch your nails with your fingertips, when eating something that you picked up with your hands, you will get to taste the horrible bitter taste of this product.  Happens to me all the time and I think eventually the bad taste will remain in my mind that when my product is all finished I will not want to place my fingers anywhere near my mouth.  Definitely recommend this for nail bitters and thumb suckers.  I have been using this product for about a month and have not put my nails in my mouth.  Excellent!!!!</li>
            <li> bought this to get our 2 yr to stop sucking her fingers. worked perfectly -- just a tiny dab and in a week or so, she stopped. great product.</li>
            <li> Seriously awesome. Our child chews her fingers constantly. Not anymore!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  It can last up to 2 days per application.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product worked for the most part, although it seemed to lose most of it&#x27;s strength after a couple of hand washings.  Other similar products I have used in the past lasted through weeks of being in water, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this brand again due to that.  And it seemed as if the product became more thick and difficult to use the longer I had it.</li>
            <li> Does not stop my daughter from biting fingers.</li>
            <li> We have one child who sucks his fingers, and another who is a thumb-sucker.  We thought for sure this would work when we put it on the first night, because neither one wanted their fingers anywhere near their mouth.  But the seemed to get used to the nasty taste, and it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend. It lasts on her nails for about four to five days then she manages to eats through the intolerable taste of the polish. It work when it&#x27;s on there, I just have to apply another coat after a few days go by. Think earwax and copper.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes nasty! One of my children stopped biting his nails in less than a week. The other child, however, suffers through he grossness and continues to bite his skin and nails...:/  This may work for some children and not others. It is worth the try though and lasts through hand washings.</li>
            <li> in hot water they wash off. but it does it job. im not using it because when i eat i can taste it which is bad. but is highly effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful this product exists.  I&#x27;m a 30 year old male.  I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember and it&#x27;s always been so embarrassing for me.  I&#x27;ve tried so many times to stop and it just kept getting worse and worse.  I&#x27;d find myself doing it at the most inopportune moments and people would look at me funny.  My nails were always worn down into the cuticle because I could not stop biting them.  It was awful.  A friend recommended I get \\&quot;that stuff you put on your nails that tastes bad.\\&quot;  I found it on Amazon after some searching.  I&#x27;m pleased to report I have been free of nail biting for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, Mavala Stop tastes so awful and so bitter that it&#x27;s impossible to bite your nails while it&#x27;s applied.  It applies like nail polish and lasts for a few days.  I reapply after two, as per the instructions, to keep the taste as foul as possible.  It&#x27;s clear, but slightly glossy (not as glossy as regular clear nail polish, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer stated, it makes you conscious of what you&#x27;re doing.  Every time you go for the nail-bite, you get that taste and it reminds you \\&quot;hey, you&#x27;re biting your nails.\\&quot;  For me, nail biting was almost a subconscious thing.  I did it without even realizing it.  It&#x27;s such a filthy habit, but I could never stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, as pointed out, is hell on finger foods.  I just avoided them when I had it on my nails.  French fries?  Grab a fork!  No problem by me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have never looked better and I even go in for a manicure now.  Being 30 years old now, having a habit most people broke when they were 12 has always been a source of shame and Mavala Stop ridded me of it.  I keep the bottle around and I apply it any time I find myself thinking about biting my nails and it reminds me never to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words can&#x27;t express how happy I am with this product.  It&#x27;s changed my life for the better and I recommend it to anyone who wants to stop the nail biting habit.  You&#x27;ll be glad you bought itYou&#x27;ll be glad you bought it</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old was biting...now she&#x27;s not...not sure if it was the product that helped her stop, or her own decision...she did figure out very quickly that it peels off when it&#x27;s dry...probably works fine as a reminder for a kid that wants to stop, but it&#x27;s not much of a deterrent for a kid that wants to bite</li>
            <li> My 3 year old would not stop sucking her thumb, I tried bribing her......didn&#x27;t work. I tried threatening her........didn&#x27;t work. My dentist recommended this and it WORKED!!!!! I had to use it for about 2 weeks because when it would wear off after about 2 days I would catch her sucking her thumb again. But after a week of not letting it wear off it worked. She hasnt sucked her thumb since. It&#x27;s a miracle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product could be as awful as the reviews but it was terrible.  I used it daily for a week and now 3 weeks later I have nails that are very nice looking.  Would recommend to anyone who has tried to stop biting their nails but didn&#x27;t realize when they were doing it.  Made me very aware of when my hands made it to my mouth.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Our son was a chronic thumb sucker and the dentist told us at 3 it&#x27;s time to break the habit once and for all. She recommended this product and after applying it to both of his thumbs one time, he stopped sucking his thumbs and hasn&#x27;t started since. We only had to apply the product ONE time. We still have a full bottle leftover. LOL</li>
            <li> Works great my grand daughter finally stopped sucker her thumb once I started using this product but you do have to reapply every other day like the label says.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old stopped thumb sucking very quickly.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this on my son, it worked. But now, the taste doesn&#x27;t really bother him and I still catch him biting his nails.</li>
            <li> It did not stop my 3 year old from sucking his 2 fingers, even tho he didn&#x27;t like the bitter taste. Did not work</li>
            <li> It worked for my 2yo. My kid had an obsessive thumb sucking issue and we stopped it in one day. Acoording to some reviews i put 2 layers of mavala on her thumb ( and all nails), then she asked for one more layer. It was to much , she threw up, and everything tasted very bitter for 2 days. My baby shakes and spits now when she looks at her thumb and she is more active now , her speech is improving as well. So be careful how much mavala you put on, start with a little bit and increase as needed. We are reallly happy and relieved that it worked so great for us!</li>
            <li> Worked for us when others did not.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> i am 58 years old and my hands were so ugly.  i was desperate to find a product that would prevent me from putting my hands in my mouth.  this problem was so way beyond just nail bitting and had progressed to cuticles and beyond.  i was a nervous wreck that couldn&#x27;t stop.&lt;br /&gt;  i researched many products online before making a decision.&lt;br /&gt;  the mavala stop arrived 4 days after purchase.  the fact that i did not have to pay sales tax was a bonus too!&lt;br /&gt;  i applied the polish immediately to my nails and cuticles and waited for what was next.&lt;br /&gt;  of course at some point in time, my fingers were in my mouth and my taste buds were instantly assaulted by the most foul, bitter taste ever.  do not be fooled and compare this bitter taste to a lemon, lime or bad pickle.  this stuff makes you want to run for anything that will get the taste out of your mouth NOW.  just a head&#x27;s up....water won&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;  it has been 5 days since my first application which i reapply everyday to keep the taste as disgusting as possible.  in less than 1 weeks time, my nails have improved beyond belief!  i actually have white at the end of my nail beds again and the skin on my fingers is starting to heal.&lt;br /&gt;  i think 1 bottle of this product will be enough.  all i have to do is look at the box and cringe!&lt;br /&gt;  instead of avoiding jewelry that might draw attention to my hands, i am looking forward to a manicure next month.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few days and have already seen a huge improvement in my daughter&#x27;s nail biting. She used to have her nails in her mouth constantly, but I have only seen her bite her nails once since she has had this product on.</li>
            <li> I applied the nail polish and within a day, my daughter stopped sucking her thumb.  It was immediate!  When she starts to suck on a finger, I just apply the polish again and the problem is stopped in its tracks.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is effective, however it was unexpected to find it looks like glossy, clear fingernail polish when applied.  If that was known, it probably would not have been purchased.</li>
            <li> I am a compulsive nail biter and before this product I have tried numerous products available at local pharmacies to try to help me stop biting my nails.  They just weren&#x27;t awful enough.  This product is awesome.  After you put this on your nails, you will slip up at most one or two times before you will begin to think twice about biting your nails.  This stuff tastes AWFUL and you will be spitting and making an awful face trying to get the incredibly bitter taste out of your mouth for 5 minutes.  Do not use this and then feed your lover grapes or strawberries or anything like that because if their lip accidentally even touches your finger nail they will be gagging and hating you for a good 5+ minutes.  One slight drawback I have noticed about this product is that it comes off easily during showering, so every few you will have to apply a new a coat.  But with this product, a nail biter for many years, I was able to get gorgeous and groomed and manicured nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading its previous reviews for my nail biting seven year old daughter. I put it on every 2-3 days and it is working great!. My daughter&#x27;s nails are growing and the taste is disgusting as I have experienced the residual of it from my nails after applying it to my daughter&#x27;s. I will keep using it until I am absolutely positive my daughter&#x27;s habit is gone for good!! This product is the best so don&#x27;t hesitate on the purchase!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old.I tested it on myself first. The taste is strong yet bearable. My opinion is it&#x27;s a Great product. He no longer bites his nails.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, this product is great at making a yucky taste on your thumb/fingers, and the yuck lasts for days, even after washing hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That part is good.  What I don&#x27;t like about this product, or this method of control is there are times the fingers go in the mouth for things other than nail-biting, thumb-sucking.  (Like licking food off your fingers).  At these times, you are grossed out with the taste, and the taste will then linger in your mouth for hours.  You get \\&quot;punished\\&quot; for really doing nothing wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re ok with this, go for it.  If not, you might want to find another way to control these issues.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutlely amazing. I thought I would never get my 1yr old daughter to stop sucking her fingers. After the 1st day she had already completly stopped sucking her fingers. I totally recommend this product for any parent that is trying to make their child stop sucking their thumbs or biting their nail. The nail polish tastes horrible I couldnt even stand the taste of it.</li>
            <li> Only had to use it one time!  After the first taste my daughters thumb never went back in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Love it! My daughter hates it but it has definitely worked.  She no longer sucks her thumb or bites her nails with this product</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was a very small maybe about four years old. I used to bite my nails until my fingers would bleed and hurt for days and i could not stop. Once I started working dating my boyfriend he has helped me to not bite as much, but i still bite my nails and most of the time i dont even know that I am doing it until it is to late. I have tried so many other products for nail biting and they would work for the first few days and then it would not bug me and i would bite my nails again.&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Stop stays very strong. So strong that it makes you want to gag if you put your fingers in your mouth so you know where your fingers are once your hand comes up near your face. It also has a smell to it, it is not a very loud smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad thing about it that keeps it from a five star rating. If your rub the ends of your fingers together like I do even hours after putting it on then your whole finger will taste of it. The other bad thing is if you hand wash dishes like I do the soap and warm water will wash off most of the taste of it so you will end up having to put more on or hope you dont bite.&lt;br /&gt;If you cook things that you have to touch wash your wash two or three times before touching the food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;list of the good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;Really bad bitter taste that makes your want to gag (might be bad for small kids for put their hands in their mouth all the time, but works for big nail biters like me.)&lt;br /&gt;Dose not take alot to get the job done.</li>
            <li> IF you or you want someone to stop biting nails or whatever this will work. gross tasting stuff but sure makes me think again about biting. i use it whenever i start biting again. i grow nails! Yay!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this works! My 5 yr old boy sucked his thumb since birth and I didn&#x27;t know how he could ever stop. I talked to him about it at first and explained he would feel proud accomplishing this and he would be rewarded....I even let him paint his own nail...The first day I painted just the thumb he sucked but that night he used his other thumb to go to sleep. So the next day I painted both and he never sucked it anymore, (besides a couple times in his sleep and after 1 taste it was out)!. Of course he has had a harder time going to sleep without it but he has adjusted and has officially quit the thumb! We made a huge deal about it so he would feel proud.  I made him a sticker chart and every day he went without it he got a sticker and after 3 weeks we took him out for a prize for accomplishing something that was really hard. Of course he was very cranky for a while trying to adjust to such a big change, but that&#x27;s like any habit someone tries to quit.  I would have never thought this would work so well but it does! Just reapply every 2-3 days! I was amazed!</li>
            <li> This works almost too well. My son has stopped sucking his thumb within 7 days. Also, if you spill it on your hands and then bite your nails....beware! You will get a taste of the bitter. I have recommended this to a few friends.</li>
            <li> It is amazing really help because the test herbal 😷😷😷</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d tried this stuff sooner.  After 55-yrs of nail biting, I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since the first application almost a month ago--it&#x27;s unique bitterness is unpleasant enough to keep the fingers away from the mouth after just a few exposures, but not toxic tasting or odorous.  Wish I&#x27;d tried it sooner; wouldn&#x27;t have had to hide my nails at a lot of job interviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that stops my son from biting his fingers and nails.</li>
            <li> My dog licked his front paws raw.  Vet called it OCD.  After a year of antibiotics and frustration I ordered this product and applied 3 times a day and it totally cured him from licking a MIRACLE!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to start off by saying that I had many talks with my daughter about stopping sucking her thumb before I tried Mavala. She was ready to stop and even asked for help from her &amp;#34;special nail polish&amp;#34;.  I do have amazon prime and told her it was coming in 2 days but for some reason it took over a week to get here. She was very impatient. The first night we were up all night getting drinks because she forgot to not put her thumb in her mouth. The second night was much better. I put it on every 2 days for the first week just to make sure she was done. Now she asks for it on when she feels she needs to such her thumb. Like I said before she is 5 years old so it was easy to talk to her about it and the taste was horrible so it worked.</li>
            <li> The stuff tastes really bad, but it helps to keep me from chewing my nail. Great product, would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Works for my 8 year old who likes to put his hands in his mouth and drives me crazy about it.</li>
            <li> It works!! It&#x27;s a great reminder for my daughter when that thumb hits her mouth. It tastes bad,  so she pulls it right back out.  Over time,  it should break her thumb sucking cycle!!</li>
            <li> This worked instantly with my 5 year old daughter. The taste is so bad she thought sucking her thumb was giving her cavities. I usually paint my daughters nails for play and girl time. I used this as the top coat and didn&#x27;t mention a thing about it to her. It worked great!!! She hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb for 6 months!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE from my original post- THREE YEARS LATER SHE STILL ISN&amp;#34;T SUCKING HER THUMB ANYMORE!! IT WAS A REALLY GOOD CURE!!!</li>
            <li> The best solution or cure to thumb sucking</li>
            <li> This works great when I am able to put it on my daughters fingernails. Unfortunately once she figured out what was causing her fingers to taste bad she refuses to let me put it on her.</li>
            <li> This worked well for a few weeks, but then our daughter simply ended up sucking off the polish pretty quickly &amp; continuing her thumb sucking routine.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and I have been trying to get her to stop sucking her thump for the longest, I would put this on her thumb, 2 minutes later her thumb is right back in her mouth, should would frown a little bit but it did not stop her frrom sucking her thumb. She has stopped sucking her thumb throughout the day but still tries to do it at bedtime to soothe herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began putting sucks on her hands at night to keep her from sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Used it on our almost 3 year old son who never stop sucking two of his fingers...worked like wonders just in two days...will recommend for my friends too...</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm when all other tactics failed!!</li>
            <li> This product really worked and it stopped me from biting. My nails for months until I relapsed but this was great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old. It totally helped. You have to reapply it if they take a bath and make sure not to put too much on their nail or it will affect their food. Put it mainly on the base of the nail, but it works</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have been a nail biter for 20 years and I have finally began to quit! Every time I put my hand up to my mouth without thinking about it I smell the horrible rancid smell and remember how Bad it&#x27;s gonna taste. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Our 2 year old was sucking her thumb all the time. After trying numerous methods, we got to trying Malala Stop. Within 2 weeks, problem solved! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Awesome! My child sucked her thumb ALL the time, we never thought she would stop. Mavala, worked from the first night we put it on her thumb!!</li>
            <li> Very very bitter. Applied as directed and my kids wouldn&#x27;t eat. Everything you touch or try to eat will taste like this.</li>
            <li> Wore it on my nails for 2 weeks and i mo longer bite!</li>
            <li> Mavala stop has my little girl on her way to stop sucking her thumb before I used this product my daughter was sucking her thumb every day now it&#x27;s like she barely sucks it mavala really works thanks mavala</li>
            <li> Only had to put this on my 3 year old daughters thumb nail once and never again has she even attempted to suck her thumb! After I put it on her and myself just knowing it was on there you didn&#x27;t want to bite your nail or suck your thumb again! Amazing stuff! My daughter was going to need serious dental work done but its going to avoid us of that! Nasty taste for sure though. But it definitely worked for us!</li>
            <li> This is powerful stuff and works!</li>
            <li> Cured our 2 year old of his thumb sucking in 2 days. It is very bitter, so we just painted the bottom part of his nail to keep him from tasting it when he ate. I just wish I would have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> This product did help our son getting rid of his nail biting habbit, but we had to do our part too.  We had to make sure we don&#x27;t forget painting it every night, gently reminding son of his bad habbit by reading a social story and a lot of support and encouragements throughout the process.  It is difinitely not a quick fix or majic.  One caution is it has a strong odor while painting.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes horrible, but has really helped me stop biting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;After years of trying to do it myself, a few weeks of wearing this and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s annoying, makes eating finger food (like potato chips, crisps, whatever you want to call them) not very much fun, but the results are worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product works so much better than any other product I tried for my daughter.  The cheap drug-store nail biting/thumb sucking products either didn;t work or stained, etc., none were as good as Mavala Stop which is why I purchased a replacement bottle.  (My daughter dumped out the first one; the flavor is truly that awful!)  Very effective.</li>
            <li> Zero effect on our four year old&#x27;s thumbsucking. He sucked it off like candy. Absolutely a worthless product! Do not buy.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sucked her thumbed since she was in the womb. After realizing that she most likely was getting sick (colds/ flu) from preschool germs by sucking her thumbs we tried this product. After 10-12 times of putting her thumb in her mouth the first day she stopped entirely by the next day. She complained of the bad taste and sipped water to get rid of it but that was the worst of it. The product works.</li>
            <li> This worked really good for my 5 year old grandchild.  It took about a week and put it on every 2 days.</li>
            <li> But once she figured out she can just lick it off in several short attempts, it was  done deal...it became more of a &amp;#34;I got you, you didn&#x27;t fool me&amp;#34; war, we stopped using it.  It just became annoying.</li>
            <li> So far it is working for my nail bitters and thumb sucker children...but I have to apply every other day</li>
            <li> Worked immediately for my 3 year old that wouldn&#x27;t give up her thumb.  Dentist noticed her upper palate was changing because of the thumb sucking, so by her pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation we are doing this.  And so far, it IS working.</li>
            <li> needed this for my 5 year old son to get him to stop sucking his thumb. worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> It is bitter &amp; won&#x27;t make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;But my son would still suck on his thumb until the bitter taste goes away!  Good product, but just might not work for stubborn toddler like mine...</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my daughters doctor told me about it. It took one application to get her to stop sucking her thumb. I heard her in her sleep trying to suck her thumb and started gagging. After that she never sucked her thumb again.</li>
            <li> Tried this when my daughter was 2.  Her mouth and teeth were starting to be affected by her habit.  What they say about tastebud development is true bc she would suck right past the taste. Tried again at 2.5 with an application on both thumbs every day for 2 weeks. She stopped sucking her thumb!  We are now about 4 weeks from when we started and we still apply every morning just to be safe another habit doesn&#x27;t start.  She hasn&#x27;t put either thumb in her mouth in over 2 weeks.  This works. I&#x27;m thankful. Might have just saved me from thousands in orthodontist bills and saved her from ridicule from unattractive teeth.</li>
            <li> My son used to chew on his finger nails, after using this product for only twice in a week, he stopped. He complained that food tested bitter the first couple of days, but after that he was ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;I can’t believe it was that simple.</li>
            <li> The box was wrapped carefully, but the inside bottle is broken. I haven&#x27;t had chance to use it yet. I guess they should have checked whether the bottle inside the box is broken or not.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been sucking her thumb since she was 3 months old.  She is now 5 years old.  The dentist recommended this and I am so thankful.  She stopped sucking her thumb!!!  She has also stopped biting her fingernails!  This works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li> im not biting my nails, it helps but tastes like complete garbage oh it is so groos but it works</li>
            <li> Started using this product about 3 months ago and now my nails are long strong and never chip. I am definitely cured of being a nail biter!</li>
            <li> I tried it to help kick off my nail bitting habit. However it didn&#x27;t work for me. I expected a bitter taste, not a toxic taste that causes upset stomach. It was a major issue for me because I eat with my hands(finger foods) a lot, in addition to that I cook just about every day and this chemical contaminated everything I touched and ate. Foods didn&#x27;t taste good. So I stop using it. Working on breaking this life long habit on my own. It&#x27;s not worth the risk, I am not sure what&#x27;s made off because the ingredients are not listed on the container. So for me it&#x27;s a health concern. I definately will not use it on a child. In my opinion, the best way to stop a child from sucking his or her finger is to stop them while they are new borns by wearing mittens.  I am now working on kicking the habit on my own, it&#x27;s been almost a week of no nail bitting, longest I have gone.</li>
            <li> My 13 year-old son had an issue with biting his nails. Since we&#x27;ve been using this, he has stopped biting his nails totally and completely. I am amazed! I would&#x27;ve never thought something would be able to stop him from this bad habit. He&#x27;s also amazed... he goes around tapping his newly grown nails on every surface in the house... I would highly recommend this product if you practice the really bad habit of biting your nails...</li>
            <li> My toddler stopped sucking on her fingers within a few days. I would recommend it to any parent.</li>
            <li> Probably would be great for adults trying to stop nail biting.  I ended up with a tiny bit on my hands that I washed right away but still made my food taste horrible.  However for my 5 1/2 year old whom I coated his nail, he didn&#x27;t mind one bit and sucked his thumb within a few minutes.  The product does have on the label &amp;#34;Small children.....may like the bitterness of product.&amp;#34;  As I assume there are not many adults that suck their thumb, this product should probably just be for nail biting and not thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my daughter to stop sucking her 2 fingers for 2 yrs now but to no avail. I read some reviews and decided to try this out...OMG ! I only used it once and never needed it again. She stopped sucking her fingers after the first coat. I would so recommend this product !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for my wife, who bite her nails for 5 years. although she is still doing it, but it has improved a lot</li>
            <li> This stuff works! It is some of the best we have tried.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer then expected but within a month we were done</li>
            <li> It really works, my daughter has not even attempted to stich her thumb in her mouth and its been over a month and I have only had to use this for a week.</li>
            <li> Worked for the first 3 to 4 applications... My son developed a tolerance for it after a few days..</li>
            <li> I put one coat on my 6 years old nails every couple days, she does not bite her nails anymore, &amp; they are growing in beautifully. What a relief!</li>
            <li> I put the nail polish on my baby&#x27;s nails, and as soon as i put my baby stopped sucking thumbs! I did not think it would work this fast! I put every other day for a couple of weeks and now its been over 2months and my baby does not even remember about sucking thumbs! Great product!</li>
            <li> I never thought I would give 5 stars to something that tastes so nasty, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bit my nails for years and years, but finally kicked the habit when I became a nurse and realized how disgusting a person&#x27;s hands can be. Unfortunately, I have been stressed lately and started biting again. It&#x27;s such a gross habit, and I knew I had to quit again. But I just couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In stepped Mavala. It is so disturbingly gross that I have to be careful even when eating things with my fingers to ensure I don&#x27;t accidentally get any in my mouth. You do get *slightly* used to the taste, but not enough to allow you to want to purposefully put your fingers in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works on pets, too! lol. My brother&#x27;s dogs kept chewing on a corner of a hammock stand. I slathered the stuff on it and the chewing stopped right away. Just a thought.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I had a non stop chronic nail biting 4 year old. Although hesitant to use, I did and it worked wonders. I tried it on myself as well and the bitter taste definitely will deter you ftom biting your nails! Just be careful while eating hand held food as you might get a little taste on your tongue. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this STUFF is NASTY TASTING!! Works great on fingers (just don&#x27;t floss your teeth after you put them on your nails.... YUK!!!) but its does work. my 8/6 year kids don&#x27;t bite their nails anymore.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t taste like anything.</li>
            <li> worked immediately--although our daughter did get sick one time in the middle of the night when she went to suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> I mean, wow. My daughter had been sucking her fingers for 2 years. I couldn&#x27;t wait until she was 3 years old (the recommended age to start this product) and literally within 4 days of applying this product she stopped sucking her fingers. I would catch her about to suck her fingers and then suddenly stop, like a mental trigger went off in her head reminding her of the awful experience she had when she tasted the Mavala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly worked. She never looked back, and neither did we!</li>
            <li> It did not work with my son (5), It doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> Okay so I purchased this to stop my own nail bitting. It was successful in that. But the taste has lingered in the back of my throat for days on end. It&#x27;s extremely painful and I think it has to do with my allergies which act up this time of year. I really think the products gets stuck in nose and throat causing me to want vomit and cough.&lt;br /&gt;While it works, I would caution anyone who has allergies before using this.</li>
            <li> Very useful and easy to use and now my daughter spends less time with her hands in her mouth!</li>
            <li> I love this product, we just started it yesterday with my 4 year old and she is doing great she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb at all today!</li>
            <li> it worked ok. we used mavala to help our five year old stop sucking her thumb. she hated the taste (i tried it too, and it is DISGUSTING), but she loved sucking her thumb so much that she powered through the bad taste. mavala discouraged her from sucking her thumb, but it didn&#x27;t stop her entirely. with mavala, a band aid on her thumb, and an ace bandage on her elbow she finally kicked the habit.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 4 years old and has sucked her thumb since birth. I put this on her nails under the guise that it was polish. I completely forgot about it. About an hour later, we were driving and she spit up everywhere. That was the first and the last time she has sucked her thumb since. That was about a week ago ago. I still apply the substance every two day, in case she gets the urge, but I don&#x27;t think I need to. She does everything she can to avoid putting her thumb or fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> i used to bite my nails so bad they were almost gone thanks to this i stopped biting in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This has surely help to curve the habit of my daughter sucking her finger in less than a week</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS!  I Purchased a like product at a national chain drugstore.  It did not work at all.  BUY this product.  No hyperboli, this stuff works.  Our child would not stop sucking her thumb.  Within 3 days she was done.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This worked very well, very quickly.  It does come off with multiple hand washing, which more savvy kids will catch on to.  This also comes off when kids are eating with their hands, so they taste it with their finger foods.</li>
            <li> I am a nail biter and decided to try this product in a last ditch effort to stop the habit. The liquid tastes bitter and disgusting and is a constant reminder to stop biting my nails. Another unconsidered advantage is that I am constantly aware of putting my hands to my face, which is a good thing to avoid in cold and flu season. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We purchased this to help stop our 3 year old son from putting his hands and fingers in his mouth. He has this bad habit of sucking on his fingers, not just his thumb, and I&#x27;m trying to break it. We thought this might deter him, so we put it on all of his nails. I figured after the first couple of times he put his fingers in his mouth, he would stop. He would grimace and start asking for water or juice at first. After a while, he just kept putting his fingers in his mouth and saying, &amp;#34;Ew, yucky!&amp;#34; He was purposefully trying to taste it. I don&#x27;t know how, I tasted it and it reminded me of chewed up aspirin. Anyways, we stopped using it, it was just making his habit worse.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 5, I haven&#x27;t cut her nails for almost A YEAR since she chewed ALL of her fingernails  - and toe nails (yuck!) off.&lt;br /&gt;So I finally stumbled across this on Amazon. I red the reviews and thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;And it worked - I have been cutting nails for two months now!!! The first time we put it on and she didn&#x27;t think about it and tried to chew on her nails she was horrified!!! She gagged and kept whining for hours that she couldn&#x27;t get the yucky taste out of her mouth. (She tried everything - candy, brushing teeth). I felt horrible, I thought I had scared her for life. However, two days later she proudly announced that she hadn&#x27;t chewed on her nails in a full day. And now two months later we are still putting it on, just in case. She actually comes herself and reminds me to put it on her fingernails and toe nails. And sometimes she asks me if she can do it herself, and that is totally fine with me. :) She was so bad about biting her nails and I thought it would be impossible to get her to stop it, but with this it took about 2 days...... Thank you Mavala!!!!</li>
            <li> Helped our 5 year old give up her thumbs.  She was on board with the plan so that helped.  Reapply weekly.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is absolutely nasty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely revolting taste. But you get used to it.  Which is a good and bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;The disgusting taste lasts for days if not a week per coat!&lt;br /&gt;Top coat looks shinny and nice.  Would look great plain or over nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;This tiny bottle will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Will make finger food taste bad if you accidentally taste your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;If you are an avid nail biter, you might just ignore the revolting taste and chew on your nails anyway.  Willpower is a beautiful thing.&lt;br /&gt;??? No more cons.  This stuff is great.  Wish it was an add on item.</li>
            <li> My son had a problem sucking his fingers... applied this for 2-3 weeks... no more finger sucking!  But it does taste awful!  :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I had been biting my nails for as long as I could remember.  I tried to stop on many occasions but would inevitably \\&quot;relapse\\&quot; within a couple of weeks.  I tried Mavala Stop after seeing other positive reviews, and it has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I have tried other bitter tasting nail polishes, but they were not strong enough to deter biting.  This stuff tastes absolutely AWFUL.  It is so strong that even eating a sandwich, crackers, etc would allow enough contact to get a full taste of the bitter flavor.  The taste then lingers in your mouth and is difficult to get rid of.  I stopped bringing my hands even close to my mouth within only a few days of use.  It has been over a month and a half now and I have not bitten my nails even once.  It does begin to wash off within a couple days and needs to be reapplied but even so the single bottle has been more than enough.  Fantastic, very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she bites her nails. Didn&#x27;t work, but I also tried rubbing hot peppers on her nails and that didn&#x27;t work either. My son had spent a day with his cousin and began sucking his fingers. One use and he was cured of the habit. I have a 4 month old now and she sucks her thumb. When she gets older, if she has problems, i will give it a try. She&#x27;s obviously too young and a long ways off from this type of thing. I also used it on myself. I used to bite my nails but still had my fingers in my mouth. About a week and I was cured of the habit too. Stuff tastes aweful. Overall I would recomend it. It&#x27;s cheep and worked for 2 out of three people. Stuff last for longer than two days to.</li>
            <li> Ok, my daughter has been sucking her thumb steadily and she is 5 years old!!! ughhh....We tried everything we knew to thwart her thumb sucking ways to no avail....We dipped her hand in hot sauce and vinegar in hopes she would stop sucking her thumb, not happening. She would just wash it off and get back on the thumb. We tried painting her nails more and she would just tear past the paint with not a worry in the world. We tried putting band aids and tape on her thumb, nooooooo, she ripped through that like a tornado through a stack of leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, we were told about Mavala. We were skeptical all the way until the small box was delivered on our doorstep. We opened the box immediately and called for our daughter to come see the product that may change her life. We applied the Mavala on both thumbs just in case, but her left thumb is the choile Filet Mignon in her little mind. She was blow drying the Mavala with the biggest smile on her face not knowing what was to follow. She promptly asked me if she could suck her thumb as soon as the Mavala had dried, and I obliged with a smile on my face. She commensed to inserting her little lifeline thumb and before she could get cozy with her thumb she spat it out and had the look of utter disgust plastered all over her mug. My wife and I looked at each other and thought this just might work. She tried washing off the Mavala with Zero luck. We have applied some Mavala on her thumbs every other day for three weeks and she has stopped trying to suck her thumb. We now have gone a week without applying it and she appears to have forgotten about her old habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply Amazing, I never thought this day would come.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for my 4 years old son. He sucks his thumb since he was a newborn, at night he didn&#x27;t mind the nasty taste at all...I will just keep trying! I guess it all depend on the child!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old was a 24/7 thumb sucker. My husband did not read the directions and applied the polish to the entire thumb. We had a really rough 1st  night. He would wake up every hour complaining about the taste and crying. The next day he remembered not to suck. Presto day 3 his fingers were out of his mouth. Has been a month now and he has never sucked his thumb again. He has now started to pick his nose, we give him a warning about the nasty polish and he stops. Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for 2 of my children, age 10 and 12 yrs. They both bite their nails. We used it for a couple of weeks, as instructed, applied it every 2 days. It made absolutely no difference. They didn&#x27;t even complain about the bad taste and continue to bite their nails. It is a disappointment, back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> Only 6 different applications! No more thumb sucking! Wow....we tried everything.</li>
            <li> Weither it is mind over matter I have not bitten my nails in 3 weeks. It also could be from the bad taste of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> This product works great if you are disciplined!  You have to reapply it as it does tend to wear off after a couple of days, but the taste is so horrible that anytime you bite your fingernails the vial taste automatically reminds you not to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it makes eating any finger foods impossible because the taste stays on your fingers and when you lick your fingers it taste so nasty and the taste even stays on your lips.</li>
            <li> This is the best !  I have tried everything to stop my 12 year old from sucking his thumb.  This works!</li>
            <li> I must have a stubborn kid because I can&#x27;t get her to stop sucking on her finger. I tried this polish and the thumb polish from Walmart and also tried finger sucking gloves... None of them work - if anyone has other ideas, that would be great. She is 3 and she started when she was about 9-12 months old. Just can&#x27;t get her to stop.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and its nasty- I&#x27;m surprised that she still sucks.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. I put it on my 3 year old twice and she will not mess with her nails now. Her nails are finally growing!!!</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I gotta say, as a long time nail bitter this stuff is kinda weak. It washes/flakes off much faster than some of the others I have used. Not sure what the deal is, use it just like I did the others. But otherwise, its quite tasty... does help...</li>
            <li> No one would ever want to taste this again! It reminds me of those stimulated Reponses that we learned about in psychology class. That&#x27;s the effect it had on my friends 6 year old son. We talked about how he was getting sick all the time in kindergarten and we assessed that its because he kept sucking his thumb with the thousands of germs on it from the school yard. So I found Mavala Stop on Amazon and the rest is history!</li>
            <li> Bought this for our son to curb a bad habit.  It worked well for the first few days and we had a glimmer of hope, until he consecutively tore right through his nails even with this stuff freshly applied.  Maybe it&#x27;ll work for you...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son +1  Mavala -1</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker until the age of six.  This product got him to stop sucking his thumb in just a little over one month.  Two years later, and he hasn&#x27;t gone back to thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Many similar products can easily be sucked off, but not this one.  We&#x27;ve had two thumb suckers.  When they got too old we just told them that their thumb would start tasting bad when it was ready to be left alone :)  After they fall asleep we sneak in and put just a dab on the fingernail and they won&#x27;t touch it.  It only needs to be applied every few days for a couple weeks and the problem is gone!</li>
            <li> i used this on my 9 year old because he has a habit of using his fingers while eating.  So, I applied one coat on his nails and he just couldn&#x27;t even eat anything b/c anything he touched, it tasted very very bitter!  poor thing couldn&#x27;t even eat pizza!  So I guess you can say that it workedlike a magic.  However, the reason why I bought this in 1st place was for my 4 year old who started to bite her nails when she went to preschool.  I applied same amount on her nails as I did to my 9 year old, and it didn&#x27;t bother her a one bit!  She said things taste nasty but it was OK.  So, I decided to put 3 coats and put one extra coat each morning.  It took 2 weeks+ with lots of these on her nail to make her finally stop.  Be aware, it taste nasty and whatever you touch with this thing on your nail, it will taste nasty too.</li>
            <li> Came off on my food that I was preparing with my hands multiple times. Am asking for a refund. Beware, you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;return&amp;#34; this item because of the &amp;#34;flammable&amp;#34; label. Why this is an allowed product for CHILDREN I have NO idea.</li>
            <li> Really unpleasant taste deters kids from putting fingers in their mouths. My daughter, 3, was a thumb sucker. She doesn&#x27;t do it anymore. Paint on like polish and lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> Tastes truly awful, and takes a while to set completely, so only apply after a meal.  Generally deters my child, who is a rabid nail biter, but only if we use it intermittently.  If I put it on continuously, she will get used to it and chew anyway.  This product was recommended by my pediatrician, and seems to be the best option on the market.</li>
            <li> The Good: This product does as advertised, it leave a very strong bitter taste in your mouth if you bit your nails or cuticles. It will definitely deter anyone from biting as the taste is very very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: It does get in the way of some daily activities. For certain things like even eating chips, or flossing, your nails may accidentally brush your lips or mouth, and you will get the undesirable taste. For me this is why I stopped using it, coupled with the fact that I enjoy cooking and was concerned about it rubbing off on my food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product, and does what you will expect. I would recommend it for kids definitely.</li>
            <li> This product worked for about a day and half until my daughter (2 years old) decided she liked it and proceeded to bite her nails anyway. In all fairness there is a warning on the box that this could happen. I am sure it works for someone just not us.</li>
            <li> I kid.  It is absolutely awful.  Fixed two children of thumb sucking.  I tried it first and can attest to its staying power and awful taste.  The product works very well, but it is designed to taste awful.  You should try it out before putting it on your children&#x27;s nails though.  It&#x27;s only fair that you know what they&#x27;re going through.</li>
            <li> I have to apply it almost nightly though. It does not stay on for several days. After 1 day of handwashing, my daughter can no longer taste it so I apply nightly before bed.</li>
            <li> The taste of this is so disgusting that not only do I not bite my nails when it&#x27;s on them, I don&#x27;t eat any finger food either! If your nails accidentally touch your lips, you will be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I remember to apply this every few days, I have no temptation to bite my nails.</li>
            <li> It works for my four-year-old!</li>
            <li> Works great!  A word of advice though, use as directed.  Going to long between coats will not prevent kids from biting their nails.</li>
            <li> This product only made my 3 1/2 year old make a disgusted face and then continued sucking his thumb. Its been a battle getting him to stop and I though this would help, but it did nothing. A waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with my 9 years old daughter and it&#x27;s working! We are both Very happy with the results...</li>
            <li> Worked Great!!!  Worked in one night!!  Thank you my son stopped sucking his fingers overnight :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome.</li>
            <li> Used for maybe like a week and my daughter has stopped sucking on her fingers. It has a very dull bitter like taste and will stay on the hand for at least a couple of days and this is with my daughter constantly washing her hands at school. It</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, who wants to quit biting his nails.  Because I like to do terrible things to myself (apparently, at least), I put a tiny, tiny dab of this stuff on one of my fingers - not even my finger nail, just a random place on the top joint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned is that, while I may not bite my nails, I put my fingers in my mouth a lot.  At the very least, I put them in my mouth twice within an hour, and let me tell you - I did not put my fingers back in my mouth for the rest of the day, especially because this stuff doesn&#x27;t just wash off.  I have no doubt that if I put it on my fingers tomorrow, I wouldn&#x27;t put them in my mouth later that day, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s terrible, and since that&#x27;s the whole point...great job, guys at Mavala.  That was disgusting.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well on my 2 year old thumb sucking daughter.  Even when we put it on she still sucks her thumb.  The bad taste does not stop her from sucking.</li>
            <li> If I remember to put on my daughter, it works. It&#x27;s awful. That being said, remember to be careful yourself, if you get any on your hands your in for it! The lid sticks often though, that sucks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my child sucks her thumb. I wanted something safe, yet effective and did a little research. This product received a lot of good reviews. I applied this to my child&#x27;s thumb and she slowed down on sucking the thumb for a little while. I believe she was a bit too young for this product at the time because she didn&#x27;t stop. I did further research and found that certain taste buds do not fully develop until a child is over 3 years old which probably attributed to the lack of good results.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I accidentally got a drop on my nails and although I washed my hands over and over, I could still taste this bitter liquid. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, in our case. Our three-year-old just started sucking his thumb out of nowhere, and it quickly became an all-day, all-night habit. Nothing else worked, and his dentist recommended this. I told him that as little boys get to be big boys, their thumbs would start to taste bad, and that is why big boys don&#x27;t suck their thumbs. A few nights later, I snuck into his room while he was sleeping and painted this on. The next day he didn&#x27;t mention it, but didn&#x27;t suck his thumb. The next day, he said he thought he must be a big boy. The next day, he sucked his thumb again, so that night, I reapplied. Had to apply it again one last time a few days later, and that was it. He&#x27;s cured. I&#x27;d absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful - did the trick to stop biting nails!</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders. I only had to apply it to my daughter&#x27;s hand three times and she stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Mixed results. It worked for a while with my son, not so much with my daughter. My bigger issue is I&#x27;m not very happy with the chemical ingredients in this; if this is something there putting in their mouth, I would hope for more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Tastes NASTY and that is what I need. I have been a nail bitter for over 50 years....this stuff was recommended to me by my step-daughter, who deterred her daughter and yes, IT works.....Nasty stuff.... :)</li>
            <li> This worked so well to get my 5yo off of her thumb.  Easy to use.  Apply to skin and the taste will have them stop immediately.  Such a great product!</li>
            <li> This product is super amazing! My daughter was 2 when we used this product on her thumbs to avoid her avid thumb sucking. She stopped very quickly and it really only took 2 weeks! At bedtime I would lightly paint only her thumbs, and the first time she tried she immediately stopped putting it in her mouth. It tastes horrible but that&#x27;s the point. Also on the bottle I believe it said 3 and up so I was worried it would not work, well it absolutely did! Our daughter is now five and has never sucked her thumbs again. She ALWAYS had her thumb in her mouth prior to Mavala  Stop, seriously! I always recommend this product to friends with kids who are thumb or finger suckers, or nail biters! I hope it works for your family it really did for us!</li>
            <li> This worked really well.  6yr. old stopped sucking thumb within days and husband now uses it to keep from biting his nails.  Taste is horrible and lingering! May try it with 9yr. old nose picker as well.</li>
            <li> Less then a week my daughter stopped sucking her finger! It really works</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS!  My son was still sucking his thumb at 2 1/2 years old.  It was such a strong habit that he had his thumb in his mouth any time he wasn&#x27;t using it--either one!  We put this on both thumb nails and it worked immediately.  He wasn&#x27;t even sad since we had the &amp;#34;you&#x27;re a big boy now&amp;#34; conversation ahead of time.  We kept putting it on for about a week just for good measure and the habit was GONE!  I&#x27;m back 2 years later buying some for my older son who has taken up a nail biting habit!  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work for this too!</li>
            <li> it works cause it tastes real bitter.</li>
            <li> Does not work for kids....at all</li>
            <li> It worked! My daughter who is almost 5 did not like the taste. In two days she stopped sucking her thumb and wore the thumb guard we had, just in case. In about a week she stopped even that.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  We tried this when our daughter was 2 and she was just too young.  Still sucking her thumb at 4 years old, we decided to buy this again and it worked in one day.  I could not believe it.  As soon as I put some on her thumb, she popped it right in her mouth and decided it was no fun.  I would recommend this stuff to anyone, but recommend you wait until your child is at a place when they want to stop to habit. She is so proud of herself and hasn&#x27;t even tried to suck her thumb in weeks.  MAGICAL!</li>
            <li> Stopped my 5 year old from sucking her thumb instantly. I put a new coat on one a week. Be careful to only put a small amount on the thumb nail and not the surrounding skin. I got some on my hands and it made my dinner taste very bad.</li>
            <li> Finally i found a way for my 5 years daughter to stop suck her thumb....from first day i apply on her nails. She stops sucking</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails for 28 years. I now have a beautiful french manicure. This stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> In just two weeks of using this product I have stopped biting my nails altogether. Sure, some urges from a habit are still there, but they&#x27;re getting less and less noticeable. One bottle was more than enough to coat my nails through the whole process and was more than effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few downsides to applying polish to my nails, the most notable being the shine and smell of the product. After a hand wash or two, the shine actually faded while the repulsively bitter taste remained. The smell, too, also faded after one or two hand washes. I applied a coat to all of my nails once every two days for two weeks and still have most of the bottle remaining. The taste can only be described as bitter with no other notes... trust me, it will keep your fingers out of your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside, and a perfectly fine one in return for finally kicking this awful habit, is that the bitter taste tends to find its way onto things other than your nails. I wiped my face one day only to realize I must have gotten some residue on my lips, only to lick them and taste the extremely bitter polish--all of this happened with completely dry nails. Same went with face washing and also eating hand-held foods; face washing seemed to run the polish a little, leading to bitter tastes on my skin and occasionally I would lick my finger while eating a taco or popcorn or something... I just had to be more careful and eventually it wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me put it this way. Looking down at my nails right now, any minor issues are completely excusable. I finally have normal looking, not gnarly nails, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> This stuff almost works too good!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, but you need to re apply it every day to really kick the habbit. I would do this for a month to really stop biting you rnails.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old started biting her nails a few months ago, out of the blue. Any time I would remind her not to, she thought it was a game and would stick all of her fingers in her mouth. She started getting sick all the time because of the constant influx of germs from everything she touched going right in her mouth. Everyone had suggestions- from vinegar, to lemon juice, even tobasco sauce on her fingertips to keep her from biting. First, I thought that was just plain mean. Second, I worried about what would happen if she rubbed her eyes with that stuff on her fingers- she is only 3, afterall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Mavala Stop through an online search. I ordered it, thinking it was worth a shot. I am so thankful for this product!! I put it on her like nail polish. Within a day, her fingers were out of her mouth. The taste is more like a little zap- and it lingers a little, but not enough to make her cry. PLUS, it doesn&#x27;t rub off if she rubs her eyes. I would highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I used it to get my  son  to  stop  sucking his  thumb  and  it  worked.  so  far I have  applied it 3  times  only  and he has  not  tried  to  suck his  thumb.  it  really  works.</li>
            <li> Works well but have to reapply every couple days.</li>
            <li> I used this several years ago for my son who was a notorious thumb sucker. It stopped him after one treatment! My 9 year old daughter was a bit more of a challenge. She would sneak ino the bathroom and scrub until  the bitterness was at an acceptable level to her. I had to convince her that as a big girl, she should try to stop on her own and the &amp;#34;nasty polish&amp;#34; was just to remind her. This worked for her! I swear by this stuff and highly recommend it to anyone who has a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I have a seven year old that bit her nails and a four year old that sucked her fingers. I made sure they were ready and wanted to try it, I tried it first. Then we put it on every few days, under polish when I had time to make it fun! After about three weeks I would forget to put it on and they still didn&#x27;t revert back to old habits!</li>
            <li> help cured my friend&#x27;s decade old nail biting habit. to note if put on too thick little bubbles can appear. put an even layer on and it takes just about 15 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> works really well is really bitter so u can be sure that you will notice if your nail go to your mouth</li>
            <li> My son sucked his thumb for over seven years. He started using this product and less than one week he broke the habit. Five months later and still no thumb sucking. This product is a must for all thumb suckers it really works and it dont take long to kick the habit.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for years (I&#x27;m now 20 years old). I get so frustrated not having nails but when I get so nervous or anxious I start biting, sometimes when I&#x27;m not fully aware. I decided it was time to do something, so I bought this. I love it. When I first got it, it smelled like nail polish. I have bitten through nail polish before, so I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work. Turns out I was wrong. When I tasted it, it was almost like fish oil (very salty and strong). If you want to stop biting your nails, I would recommend this. It really works.</li>
            <li> Ordering and shipping were fast and great.  The product itself did not work for our daughter.  We got it to hopefully stop her from sucking her fingers.  She would just suck through it, didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.  She does have a different palate so I&#x27;m sure that played into it, i.e. she likes spicy food, and more grown up flavors that most kids do not like.  Both my husband and I tasted a little bit and found it awful---so even with her palate this should have been at least unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly from the moment we used it. My 3 year old hasn&#x27;t sucked his thumb yet!:)</li>
            <li> I have been an avid nail biter for most of my 29 years.  Not sure if its an anxiety thing or a boredom thing, but most of the time I don&#x27;t even realize that I&#x27;m doing it until someone&#x27;s like \\&quot;stop biting!!!!\\&quot;  So I looked up on google what the best product was to deter nail biting and this came up.  The reviews weren&#x27;t TOO helpful because most of them were about kids sucking their thumb and it was mixed on whether it worked or not, but I got it anyway....I was sick of hearing my boyfriends man hand jokes.  I can honestly say I don&#x27;t know how the kids from these reviews muscled through the taste of this product all in the name of thumb sucking. When this stuff comes into contact with my mouth, it ruins my day. It&#x27;s an awful bitter taste that lingers for what seems like hours. I&#x27;ve had to use a fork when eating finger foods to avoid the horror of accidentally brushing my nail on my lip. This stuff works wonders!! I was scratching my boyfriends back in no time!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend applying it once a day, you can use it as a top coat, but its not as shiny as a top coat... If you think it&#x27;s too matte (which I don&#x27;t think it is) when your nails get long enough you can put the product under your nail a little to avoid messing your manicure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!! I would absolutely recommend this product.....(I&#x27;ve also used its powers for evil....my boyfriend was snoring one night so I put my finger in his mouth...the taste actually woke him up!! Haha)</li>
            <li> I bought this to help our 3-year-old stop sucking her thumb.  We put it on, and she never sucked her thumb again!  It&#x27;s been almost 2 months, and we still reapply every other day just for reinforcement.  It also worked awesome for our friend who&#x27;s been a LONG time nail biter.  Highly effective, and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great product, worth your $$$&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for my 2 yr old but thats a warning on the box. Supposely on little kids is less effective.</li>
            <li> This was the ONLY product that worked for my 5 year old son... he NO LONGER bites his nails after 4 years!!!!!</li>
            <li> Instant is the only word comes to mind....</li>
            <li> very happy with this dentist recommended it and it worked. My three your old picked up a bad thumb sucking habit and this mavala stop cancelled it right away. be sure to put it on all fingers every other day cause my daughter tried to move to other fingers so its good to paint all fingers. applied it consistently for about two weeks and now thumb sucking is a thing of the past</li>
            <li> I am using it on my 20 month old daughter who was always sucking her thumb. Despite the warnings. It works. Stays on for 2 days and then I have to put it on again while she is sleeping. she has not quit her habit (because if I don&#x27;t put it on for a few days she goes back to the habit), but I think she will once I do this for more than a month.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3.5years old. This is not use for her. She still suck her thumb especially where shi is asleep.</li>
            <li> 3.5 year old daughter stopped sucking her thumbs in the first day. She knew that there was something on her thumbs to &amp;#34;help her be a big girl&amp;#34; and she was ready to prove it. I have not seen her even try it and has therefore avoided the bitter taste. Mavala is a good deterrent. Too bad I had to spend $12.</li>
            <li> It is insane how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my 2 year old, even though I read reviews of it possibly not working, due to his developing taste bud and him probably liking the taste of it, but it worked for me, so I see no problem with any other parent taking the same leap of faith I did when I decided to try.  Within 2 weeks my son completely stopped sucking his fingers and he sucked both his index fingers, which I thought would be hard to stop him form doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I tried it............</li>
            <li> Child has sucked her thumb nearly since birth.  We&#x27;ve tried thumb covers, positive encouragement, Thum (pepper) nail polish big incentives (American Girl Bitty Twin) and nothing worked could cure her of the instictive need to suck her thumb for comfort. After just two nights of Mavala, we&#x27;re seeing a vast improvement! I&#x27;ve watched her sleeping and bring her thumb close to her mouth and remember to pull it away. I tried it because I didn&#x27;t want to use something on my child without experiencing it myself. It was bitter to the point of nearly vomiting. Nasty stuff, but it works.</li>
            <li> This bottle is too big for a child to get rid of such a habit. It took my child about one week to forget about biting her nails!!! I tested Mavala Stop on my nails and it really tasted terribly. I could not eat anything with my hands, everything tasted bitter. Sorry for kids who have to suffer like this because of this habit however I&#x27;m glad that my child has beautiful nails now!!!</li>
            <li> I put this on my 6 year old and he can&#x27;t stand to bite his nails now.  I also tried it at the same time and I couldn&#x27;t even eat finger foods because I went to lick bbq off my finger and yeap, it was awful but it works.  It also helped my friends child stop picking his nose and well you know putting in his mouth.  You don&#x27;t have to be a nail biter for it to work.</li>
            <li> My eight year old stopped sucking his thumb the moment we put it on. It will definitely help break bad habits. I was skeptical about the directions saying apply it every other day but after two days it was still strong. After 10 we kept forgetting to put it one but he never went back to sucking his thumb. He was a very willing participant and was grateful for something that would help him break the habit. We were too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. I have chewed my nails for 10+ years and this has helped me stopped!</li>
            <li> Used this on my 3 year old to stop her thumb sucking and literally worked overnight!</li>
            <li> Is ineffective after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my granddaughter. You do need to apply it every couple days or so. But it really is helping her to stop bitting her nails.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Our 6 yr old has struggled years to stop sucking her thumb at bed time.  She&#x27;d put band aids on her thumbs and inevitably pull them off.  So we finally told that wet thumbs taste bad when they don&#x27;t want to be sucked anymore.  At night after she would fall asleep, I&#x27;d sneak into her room and paint her thumbs with this stuff - a small dab is plenty!  She&#x27;d wake up the next morning and come running in so excited because the yucky taste meant her thumbs didn&#x27;t want to be sucked anymore!  I may not get parent of the year, but she was relieved that her thumbs were helping her to stop the sucking habit.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts at least 2-3 days with regular hand washing and baths.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing!! Wished I had tried it years ago. My daughter was a big thumb sucker and after this product hit her thumb, I have not had a problem. Used it for 1 week and that&#x27;s all it took. So happy, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and have been biting my nails my whole life.  I bite so badly that it&#x27;s painful for me to use my fingertips (to type, to open Tupperware, to open zippers).  As an adult, manicures helped, but stress could still set me off.  After each episode it took weeks to heal my fingers. I was ready for desperate measures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff IS a desperate measure.  Putting a nail in your mouth will ruin your whole morning.  It&#x27;s the most horrible, nauseating, bitter, awful flavor I can imagine.  Even touching your lips is a bad, bad idea.  And don&#x27;t apply lip gloss with a fingertip.  (Ask me how I know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also ruins finger food.  I don&#x27;t just mean chicken nuggets.  I mean apples, grapes, sandwiches, pickle spears, burgers, french fries.  Literally anything you touch will become inedible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is so disgusting and such a pain, you need to be devoted to personal change in order to force yourself to reapply it daily.  If you do, however, you will succeed.  It&#x27;s kind of like Antabuse but for nailbiters instead of alcoholics.</li>
            <li> Stopped my four year old from sucking his thumb. Worked great!</li>
            <li> works amazing and tastes terrible HAHA</li>
            <li> Great!!!!! stopped my kids from sucking their tum in three days.</li>
            <li> The product is great! My daughter no longer had nails, she would bite them everyday! Now her nails grew back and hopefully they will stay that way. Loved it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stop the finger sucking</li>
            <li> This was completely ineffective in trying to stop my toddler from sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> We tried this on my now 4 year old who has officially stopped sucking her thumbs with the help of Mavala Stop! We did try this on her at age 3 with not much luck! She would suck it right off! I&#x27;m pretty sure she was not giving her thumbs up for anything but needed that comfort of thumb sucking a bit longer! We did try it occasionally with some luck but she&#x27;d go right back to sucking her thumbs as soon as we stopped applying it! We waited till 3 months ago and applied it every night with amazing luck! She has not sucked her thumbs day or night since the first 2 weeks of this! She absolutely hated even having her hands anywhere near her mouth! It also helped her to not eat with her fingers and to use her fork &amp; spoon when eating!! Her teeth are looking much better also! They are not sticking out as they were 3 months ago! Yay to fewer dental/orthodontist bills later down the road!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nineteen and I&#x27;ve had a lifelong nail biting problem. It was quite terrible. This stuff works perfectly--it has a horrible taste. One annoying thing is that it wears off after a couple days, and I have to keep reapplying it, but that can&#x27;t be helped. It&#x27;s worth it. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another annoying thing is that if I&#x27;m not careful with my fingers, the stuff might end up on my lips, and then my food. But touching your lips is also a bad habit, so that&#x27;s kind of a plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes foul and lingers although I don&#x27;t think it was so overpowering that it makes you gag. It&#x27;s hard to describe the taste since nothing I have ever tasted is like this. Very effective because as soon as that taste hits you realize you put your hands near your mouth. As some other people mentioned you can taste it on food that you eat with your hands. It also lasts through hand washings. I gave it 5 stars because even if I don&#x27;t stop biting my nails this stuff does exactly as it claims. It also says it is not effective for kids under three right on the package so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for people to be giving less stars if it didn&#x27;t work on their younger kids.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! After a week of using this stuff, my daughter no longer sucks her thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff always works for me. Tried 2 other kinds from a beauty suply store but they didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who had bitten his nails and the skin around his nails for as long as I can remember. He painted 2 coats on his nails one time and that was all it took! The awful taste was enough to make him stop biting his nails and skin around them within days! I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> If this won&#x27;t stop them from sucking their thumb, Nothing will. the only problem is that it spills easily. Make sure the top is on good and tight. Will take the finsish off of any sealed wood.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter for 50 years and was cured in ONE WEEK.  I have tried Thum, Tabasco, anything I could think of.  This stuff tastes SO bad.  The tradeoff is everytime you lick your fingers or touch your lips, the taste is DISGUSTING.  You will be looking for somewhere to spit.  On the plus side, it teaches you to keep your hands away from your mouth.  I have not bitten a thing since July 4.  And I have learned how fast your nails actually grow!  :-)  Now I am working on stopping the cuticle picking habit I have always had.  Any ideas would be great!</li>
            <li> I put this on our son who is 6 and was getting picked on because he always had his hands in his mouth.  We tried all sorts of methods before resorting to purchasing this product, because other reviewers said that the product transferred to their food- we thought that it was kind of- mean to use this stuff, but we couldn&#x27;t solve the problem any other way and we were desperate to stop the finger sucking before he ended up one of those kids who are always getting picked on.  We put it on him on a Friday after dinner, he actually didn&#x27;t put his fingers in his mouth at all that evening because he was afraid of the taste- even though he hadn&#x27;t tasted it yet!  He told me the next morning that he put his fingers in his mouth while he as asleep and the horrible taste woke him up and he took his fingers out right away.  He said that \\&quot;my brain remembered that taste for the rest of the night\\&quot;  Well, I re-applied every 2 days like the instructions said, but I don&#x27;t even think I needed to- he hasn&#x27;t put his fingers in his mouth since!  I only used it for a week and I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence of him sucking his fingers- even since we have stopped applying!</li>
            <li> I was trying to product to get my son to stop sucking his thumb.  I previously tried others, but this did the trick.  At first he fought me about putting it on, but after the second night, he would just hold out his hand and let me put it on.  When all else fails, this really works.</li>
            <li> Really works! The flavor is really bad, not something I could get used to. The flavor is very powerful and it is easy to taste if you are eating something with your hands. Moreover, the taste doesn&#x27;t go away easily once you have it in your mouth. This product causes a lot of discomfort and this discomfort was what helped me stop bitting my nails in less than a month.</li>
            <li> My son has sucked his 2 fingers his entire life until the age of 3-1/2, we started with a baseball glove, which worked only at night time, we then bought a product similar to Mavala Stop called Thums, this product did not work at all, has hardly any taste, I quickly ordered Mavala Stop after reading many good reviews, tested it out my self, then tried with just a small dab on one of his fingers, he stopped finger sucking within a day. Its been 2 weeks now, and he doesn&#x27;t even attempt to suck anymore. Great product!</li>
            <li> We had tried EVERYTHING in an attempt to get my 7yr old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  Her habit was starting to effect the roof of her mouth.  The dentist had suggested an ace bandage at her elbow...didn&#x27;t work...a glove on her hand...she pulled it off in the middle of the night.. I also tried finger splints, band aids..you name it, we probably tried it.  When discussing the problem at an orthodontist&#x27;s office, he suggested this product.  Within 2-1/2 weeks, she was done.  It has been 2 years and no looking back.  Recently, a friend of mine was telling me that her daughter was having difficulty giving up thumb sucking.  I still had a lot of the nail polish left, so I let her use it.  Within 2-3 wks, she had also stopped.  Thumb sucking and nail biting are difficult habits to break.  This product seems to give a person that added reminder to help break the unwanted habit.</li>
            <li> My 8-yr-old son has white at the tips of his fingernails for the first time since he was 2! Somehow in the busyness of having two young kids, I didn&#x27;t notice he&#x27;d picked up the habit of chewing them as a toddler. I glanced down thinking it was about time to cut his nails, and he didn&#x27;t have any. That was six years ago, and we&#x27;ve tried everything -- alternate chew options, gum, painting his nails with other stuff. Nothing worked. He doesn&#x27;t bite from stress or anxiety -- it&#x27;s merely a habit when he&#x27;s bored or intensely focused.  We&#x27;ve now been using Mavala for about three weeks, and he has nail growth on all his fingers. Occasionally when it&#x27;s worn off a bit (maybe after 4-5 days), he&#x27;ll catch himself starting to chew, and then we put on another coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that this was NOT pleasant. He&#x27;s highly sensitive to tastes, and so when we first put it on, he cried and howled and swore he&#x27;d never let us do it again.  But then when he couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t bite the nails, he started to see it as a challenge. Then he came to show me the white growth, and he is SO proud that he now lets us put it on without a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We turned to this as a last resort because he&#x27;s going to need early orthodontia, but his orthodontist told us that she wouldn&#x27;t put anything on his teeth until he stopped biting his nails because that could undermine the quality of the braces. So we had no choice -- he had to stop biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very rarely write reviews on Amazon because I don&#x27;t usually have much to say. But I am thrilled with the results of this.</li>
            <li> Worked right away!  My son stopped biting his nails immediately.  It must taste terrible because it works.  we had tried other products but this works the best.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t think it was possible to stop our daughter to suck her thumbs.  We decide to give this a try.  My daughter loves to put the &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; on her finger and ask to put them on every other night.  At beginning, she still put her thumb in her mouth while she was sleeping. But then she should pull them out right away and cry.  We asked her what happened?  She told us &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34;. With in a week, she stop sucking her thumb, but still wanted her nail painted. Another week later, she stopped sucking her thumbs.  Once awhile, she still asks to her nails painted.  We put pretty pink nail polish (speed dry) on her toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend friends and family to buy it.  In fact, I even recommend other mother to try them too when saw the kid suck their thumbs in the mall.</li>
            <li> I am currently 30 years old and I have bitten my nails for as long as I can remember.  And I am not talking about a little nibble here and there, I am talking I would bite them until it was they were bleeding or it was to painful to continue, then I would move onto the next finger.  When I was out of fingers I would then move into my cuticles.  I had a real addiction problem to it and I have tried everything imaginable to try and stop the habit.  I would  never last more than a couple days without starting up the habit once again, I had gotten to the point where I had accepted it as a way of life.  Out of nowhere one night I decided to look up new treatments for nail biters, thinking maybe some new miracle cure has came out.  Really not knowing what I would find I searched nail bitting on Amazon and found this product and the reviews were amazing, I figured if anything had a chance it would be this product. I figured for the price if it didnt work I wouldnt be out much so I placed my order and it arrived a couple days later. First thing is first, this product is advertised as having a bad taste to curb your desire to bit your nails, so I painted it onto a finger, let it dry for a couple minutes and then took a lick, at first nothing at all, I thought the product was a failure.  Then the taste hit me in the mouth like a run away freight train!! It is one of the worsts tastes I have ever came across, and it was not just a wow that was gross and then the taste went away, this disgusting taste lingered for a good 5 minutes or more!  I did find it strange that the taste was delayed maybe 1-2 seconds or so but maybe it has to do with location of your bitter taste buds on your tongue? Regardless, I am not saying I am cured yet, but I went from a highly addicted nail biter to now I have not bitten my nails or cuticles in the past 2 weeks and I have almost zero urge to do so.  Both my nails and cuticles are growing out and have actually required trimming and shaping.  Something I have noticed is that I now catch lifting a finger to my mouth and think if I bite that nail I am going to taste that nasty stuff and I quickly put my hand back down haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this product daily.  I found that even after washing my hands several times a day and even taking a shower the taste still will linger for a second day though it is not as strong.  I feel that if I did not apply it daily I would bite my nails on the second day and just deal wit the faint bitter taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product, which I can not blame the product for but it must be noted.  You need to be careful with finger foods! After eating a couple french fires the only taste in my mouth was the bitter nail stuff, it ruined my entire meal! Again not the products fault, its doing exactly what it should be doing, but just something to be aware of in advance because it will sneak up on you!ing I have noticed is that I now catch lifting a finger to my mouth and think if I bite that nail I am going to taste that nasty stuff and I quickly put my hand back down haha!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying this product daily.

            <li> My little 3yr bites his nails terribly, and would even go at his toenails when he&#x27;s done with his finger nails.  It was easy to apply, smells horrible, tastes worse.  My hubby complained about the lasting aftertaste it left.  But after all that, my son still bites his nail.  He did throw up from the first time he tasted it after trying to bite his nail. It deterred him for a day, but even after daily applications for a couple of weeks, he still bites his nails. So will have to find something stronger.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything out there to get our daughter to stop sucking her fingers.  It took us two weeks with Mavala Stop and she never sucked them again!!</li>
            <li> I have a 13 year old who has been a nail biter most of her life.  I am talking about down-to-the-quick, hurts-to-look-at-her-nails nail biting.  She has not bitten her nails since using this product (over six weeks now.)  I do not know how much of this was internal motivation, and how much was due to the Mavala Stop, but it has worked.  I will say that I tasted the product myself (I would not subject my child to something without knowing how bad it was, and I certainly would not use it without her consent.)  I found it very unpleasant, but not as bad as many reviewers have said.  It is definitely unpleasant and bitter, and the taste is very long lasting.  In fact, the rim of the jar had gotten sticky and I cleaned it myself earlier this week and apparently got some on my fingers. I got the taste in my mouth and it lasts for hours.  It certainly would motivate me.  So, six weeks in, I would say it is worth every dime and then some.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s 7th birthday was fast approaching, he had permanent teeth coming in and there was no sign that his thumb sucking was slowing down. I ordered this product and showed him pictures of people who were never stopped sucking their thumbs and he agreed to try. Our only mistake was not covering his hand that first night. He put his thumb in his mouth while sleeping and the taste woke him up (it really is awful). After that, he put a sock on his hand before bed and we had no problems. After about a week, he stopped using the sock and has never looked back.</li>
            <li> This was for my Nephew, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to stop sucking his thumb?&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think he likes the bitter taste!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sometimes does get frustrated with it at night and thats it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in other words it may work for your kids but I won&#x27;t but this again... Sorry</li>
            <li> All my friends said this was THE product to stop thumb sucking. My three-year-old is a serious finger sucker. I put Mavala Stop on her fingernails and she just sucked on them anyway. She hated it, but she alternated between sucking her fingers and wiping her tongue on her shirt until the Mavala Stop finally wore off. I tried it for weeks and finally gave up because I was afraid it was bad for her. The only thing it did was prevent her from taking a nap during the day. However, it wasn&#x27;t a total waste.  It cured my 7-year-old son of nail-biting, but he refused to eat any kind of finger food during the process--no sandwiches, cookies, crackers, carrot sticks, etc., because it made the food taste bad. I tried it and it really is awful stuff. I was pleased with how quickly the nail biting was cured. This may be the best product on the market, but it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> My son sucked his thumb and bit his nails for 5 years until we began using this product. We had tried everything including the bar across his upper palate. But this did it! He started remembering to stop all on his own. He used about half the bottle and it took about two weeks to reduce and two more to quit. Very very happy! We recommended this product to the dentist. We also gave the other half to his Kinder teacher who bites her nails. Totally worth the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Worked in one try with my son!</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb and started biting her nails, this stopped her in 2 weeks of wearing it.. She actually stopped the day I put it on her but I kept it on her for 2 weeks to break the habit.</li>
            <li> We have been applying this product to my daughter&#x27;s fingers three times a day for the last three weeks and it does not bother her at all.  She still sucks her thumb and bites her nails.  We are sad because were really hoping this would work, and it has not phased her at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter was sucking her finger in the womb and at the age of 8 was still going strong.  We tried everything...products, bribing, appliances, etc. and nothing worked...she would be back at sucking her finger the next day!  Literally put this product on her finger and she stopped sucking her finger after one taste of the stuff!!!  Never, ever went back after that!!!!!!!!!  I accidentally got some on my finger while painting hers with it and tasted it and I can see why she stopped....the taste lingered for days even after brushing teeth!!!!  Best product out there in my opinion!</li>
            <li> My 8-year-old daughter has been biting her nails since she was about three. The only thing that has worked to curb her habit in the least was making her wear gloves all the time. And even then, she has to take them off to eat, use the bathroom, practice the piano, do her homework, and read. Then of course she would forget to put them back on. I had tried a few products that I had heard worked for others - Thum, Bite It, and Barielle. She admitted these products didn&#x27;t taste good, but they didn&#x27;t stop her from biting. Mavala Stop worked! After only a day she stopped biting. I asked her what she thought of it after wearing it all day and she looked at me with her big serious eyes and said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s awful!&amp;#34; I continue to apply Mavala Stop every day if I can (every other day at least), but after a week I have finally been able to trim her nails! I am really happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> My son is 7 years old and was sucking the life out of his thumb. I purchased this product because of the reviews I read and it was also in my budget.  According to my son, I was the worst mom in the world for about one day. He got over it and he has also stopped sucking his thumb. I only had to use the product twice. He only complained about the taste when he ate fingerfood. I think it has been over two weeks. So far, So good!!</li>
            <li> After recommended by our dentist both our kids stopped sucking thumb only 3 times after using this.</li>
            <li> It is very bitter. It does however leave your nails with a slight shine, me being a male this leads to a few questions or strange looks. The second day the shine fades away a little and bitterness remains. You do learn to use utensils really quick with this product too.</li>
            <li> Ive been biting my nails for my entire life. I&#x27;m 25 yrs old. I bought this and i have not been chewing my nails for the past 10 days, which is certainly a record for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that this stuff tastes aweful. If you use this product and continue to bite your nails with it on, you have my respect because you are truely dedicated to your habit. I suppose the only issue would be remembering to re-apply it every two days like it asks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when eating. If your finger goes in your month with this stuff on you will regret it. Trust me, this will be a major disturbance. But like i said, it has been working for me so far. Good luck everyone</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting, works well on my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well. Its been three days. The taste is very gross but you must apply it every two days or so. I hope it works and so far It has!</li>
            <li> After my daughter sucked her thumb for basically her entire life (4.5 years) we had this on for about a week and there&#x27;s no more thumb in our house.  Warning:  the first night, she did suck her thumb and the taste was so bitter, she threw up.  Small price to pay to avoid the habit, if you ask me!</li>
            <li> 4 year old has not sucked his thumb in over a week now.... We call it his &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34;.  So it&#x27;s not a punishment for sucking his thumb, but an encouragement to stop. Worth every penny. Fast shipping. HIGHLY recommended</li>
            <li> Used this on my son (3 years ) to stop his finger sucking. I put it on him in the mornings when he first woke up and before he went to bed, if needed. He learned real quick not to put his fingers in his mouth. Took him I would say maybe 3 days to stop completely. I think he was sucking out of habit at night the first night.</li>
            <li> Worked great! My daughter who has been sucking her thumb since birth now has no desire whatsoever (after the first night I applied Mavala) to suck her thumb. I cannot believe it, I am more than excited to write this review. I am happy I found this product..</li>
            <li> I purchases this for myself to help me stop biting my nails. It does taste very bad, so it prevents me from mindlessly gnawing away while studying. The main downside is that you have to eat and if you touch your food with this on then your food will taste bad too. Even if you&#x27;re not digging around in your food or licking your fingers, for some reason the bad taste doesn&#x27;t seem to restrict itself to my fingernail where I painted it on.  For some reason my whole fingertips tasted bitter too (maybe from touching my nails after they dried or rubbing them together during hand washing? b/c I was very careful when they were wet)  and this transfers to food.  I finally gave up using it because I became so frustrated trying to eat and prepare meals without making things taste poisonous.  I was pretty careful to let them dry thoroughly and not touch them when wet but somehow the taste still was all over my fingers.</li>
            <li> It definitely works! I never wanted to bite my nails again after putting this on. I have bitten them once or twice because I forgot to apply the product, but when its on, you are immediately aware of what you are doing when a finger goes into your mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to try to kick his nail-biting habit.  So far, the stuff seems to be working great.  He says it is disgusting and made me try it; I agree, it tastes horrible.  A very bitter sort of taste.  I would just say that you have to make sure to paint every 2 days.  Sometimes he says he doesn&#x27;t need it and it still tastes bad, but then I&#x27;ll catch him biting.  If we paint him every 2 days, he doesn&#x27;t bite.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My 5 year old son has been sucking his 2 fingers practically since birth, and we never thought we could get him to stop. We got Mavala Stop 3 weeks ago and other than the first time he &amp;#34;tried it&amp;#34; and one more accidental taste he has not sucked them since. My 3 year old sucked her thumb at night and we figured what the heck and used it on her too - now she no longer sucks her thumb. My 7 year old had a rather gross habit of picking her nose and eating her...you get the idea. End result - she doesn&#x27;t do it anymore either. I recommend this to anyone that is trying to get their kid to break the habit. It tastes truly disgusting to them, and it is not water soluble so they can&#x27;t wash it off immediately. Best 12 bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li> Used it on my 4 year old daughter who has been sucking her fingers ever since she grew some in the womb. Literally!! Put it on her fingernails and she quit the next day. After a few days she would ask for more on her fingernails because the temptation came back but she&#x27;s never sucked them again.</li>
            <li> We tried everything to get our 3 1/2 year old to stop sucking his thumb without any luck. Our dentist recommended this product and it was amazing! After one application...no more thumb sucking! It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks so I think it&#x27;s safe to say this product works and we are so thankful!!!</li>
            <li> My 23 month old did not approve of the taste at first, but became accustomed to it by the second day and continued to suck her thumb. I would not recommend for children under 3 because their taste buds are not fully developed and can easily adapt to the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> Great product with a horrible aftertaste</li>
            <li> the product did warn that kids may get used to the taste/smell and go back to their old habits.  my 3 1/2 year old sucks his thumb and this product was recommended by his dentist.  it worked for a few weeks but alas, he got used to it and even after applying it to his thumbs, within minutes, he&#x27;d be sucking them again.  will have to look for another alternative :(</li>
            <li> Product was effective for only approximately one week with an every other a day application. Child became used to deterrent and then the application was increased to everyday. Product washes off in a swimming in a pool. This product is only a tool to solving nail biting and not a cure all.</li>
            <li> My nails are growning! After 37 years of biting my cuticles and weaking my nails, I have found something to help me with this awful habit. It does taste disgusting, and the taste lingers. It works!!!! I can&#x27;t imagine using this on a child, but I don&#x27;t have children. I just know how awful the taste is. I use it on top of nailpolish and it doesn&#x27;t affect my manicure. I recommend buying and giving it a try. This product is worth every single penny to me.</li>
            <li> My son stopped sucking his thumbs after a few applications.  It worked for us!</li>
            <li> my son threw up repeatedly after he put his finger in his mouth so I promptly tried to get it off with nail polish remover as the box said. I tried 6 times before I simply ran out of nail polish remover and the taste was still there! wish I knew before hand that this remedy for removal wouldn&#x27;t work. Now I have to send him to school hoping he doesn&#x27;t vomit...excellent. Does anyone have any suggestions???</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical if this would help my son, who was finger sucking addict.  Unless he was talking or eating or using his hands to play, his fingers were in his mouth.  I read the reviews about the kids who sucked their fingers even with the Mavala on it, and was convinced that would be him.  However, his mouth was starting to get misshapen, and the dentist told us to try the Mavala.  If that didn&#x27;t work, he said we would discuss putting an appliance in my son&#x27;s mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to report that it worked!  As long as we kept the medicine on his nails, he didn&#x27;t suck.  The literature that comes with the medicine says to reapply every two days, but I found I had to do it every day and a half or I would find my son with his fingers in his mouth.  The literature also said that it would take about ten days to break nail biting.  It took us over two months to break my son of his finger sucking.  Every week or so, I would not reapply the polish, and sure enough, when he got tired or upset, he would stick his fingers right back in his mouth.  Finally, after two or three months, I went more than a day and a half without reapplying, and I never caught him again with his fingers in his mouth.  Now, a few months later, even when he is really tired or really upset, he doesn&#x27;t suck his fingers.  I am one happy parent.</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old out of nowhere developed this hardcore nail biting habit--so bad he would chew his fingers raw and bloody.  We tried the Berenstein Bear book, a rewards system, constant reminders, but nothing was working.  I went to this as a last resort because I was nervous about some reviewers saying it turned their kids off of food and my son eats with his fingers a lot.  We put it on after his shower one night and I also put it on my husband, a lifelong nail biter.  My son was a little nervous but also excited to try it. He went to bed and the next day when I came home from work he proudly announced that he put his finger in his mouth once during the day but it tasted yucky.  Months have gone by and he has never bitten his nails again!  And he never mentioned anything about it making his food taste bad.  One application was all it took.  My husband on the other hand...he scrubbed it off and refused to put it on ever again.  Old habits die hard for grown ups I guess!</li>
            <li> We had tried almost everything to get our 4 year old to stop sucking her thumb including the $80 thumb guards and nothing worked. Within 3 weeks of using Mavala she stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails on and off ever since I can remember. I was always able to stop by myself by just getting my nails done and painting them. But even with that, I would still use my teeth to chap the nail polish from my nails and then eventually would get back to biting.&lt;br /&gt;Mavala Stop tastes really bad. Like, really. So even though I have my nails long, I still use it to keep my hands out of my mouth. It&#x27;s been helping me a lot, but it does bother me that finger foods are pretty much ruined for me right now. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to break the habit soon and not need it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> saved my kids nails..</li>
            <li> Really want my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.. We have tried everything. She doesn&#x27;t like the taste but apparently not enough to take her thumb out of her mouth.</li>
            <li> It worked great, my daughter has stopped biting her nails and sucking her thumb and we didn&#x27;t have to use it but for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I really do like the product and so far it seems like it will definitely work.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and amazing product!  The deaths of my dog and my cat were such an emotional loss that I started biting my fingernails every day.  I tried crocheting to keep my hands busy but I could not stop my nail biting.  I tried subliminal CDs... to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of suffering from this and scanning the Internet for cures and products I found &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34;.  This product has absolutely un-trained my brain to bite my fingernails!  It is a remarkable product!  When you paint your fingernails with &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; any chance that you put your fingernails near or in your mouth will have you quickly removing them.  &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; has a shockingly bitter taste.  &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; indeed works.  &amp;#34;Mavala Stop&amp;#34; is also shiny and protective on your fingernails.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Best thumb sucking remedy!!!</li>
            <li> Took les than a week for 5 year old to stop sucking fingers. This stuff has a nasty taste and stays with you for a while. Had to try before my daughter word wear.</li>
            <li> I am a 32yr old male and have been bitten my nails since middle school. I finally just said screw this I&#x27;m done. I went to CVS and bought THUM but it didn&#x27;t work at all. I was bitting my nails within 10mins of putting it on. So I was determined to find a polish that works. And I did. This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product that I was hearing so much about. The dentist recommended it for my almost 4 year old, who won&#x27;t stop sucking her thumb. I put it on &amp; was so ready to see her distaste for it. As the reviews said not to put too much on as it could get on her food &amp; she may not eat. Well I didn&#x27;t want that as the fact that she is really thin already, but eats like a horse!!! The thin amount I applied didn&#x27;t work, so I piled it on that thumb the next go round, she said she didn&#x27;t want it on her thumb because it was nasty. Well five minutes later she was sucking that thumb like I had put some candy flavored polish on it. So I guess my child is the exception to this polish not working!!!</li>
            <li> Tried this on our 3 1/2 year old and she didn&#x27;t mind the taste and continued to suck her thumb with no problem. Might work for older kids but not for younger ones who don&#x27;t want to stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 2 1/2 daughter because she constantly has her thumb in her mouth. I&#x27;ve  and read great things about this product and have tried many others, which have failed. Although this has helped reduce the amount of time she spends sucking her thumb when applied, the taste doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her enough to encourage her to stop. After applying it, I still find her thumb in her mouth</li>
            <li> I have had the horrible habit of biting my nails (off &amp; on) ever sinceI was a kid.  I think it&#x27;s mainly a nervous thing because I notice I do it more when I am stressed and I do it to the point that my fingers get sore.  When it&#x27;s that bad, I can&#x27;t stop it so I wanted to try to find something that would make me think twice about putting my fingers in my mouth.  This certainly does it!  You just apply it to your nails like you are painting them.  It&#x27;s clear.  Let me tell you, if you happen to put your fingers in your mouth, you will regret it.  This stuff is HORRIBLE and the taste lasts forever!  You even have to be careful when you are eating finger foods because if your finger happens to touch your mouth, you are in trouble.  There is nothing worse than eating french fries and then being hit with this horrific taste that lasts and  lasts and lasts!  I am proud to say, my nails are long and healthy.  I keep this around though because it works.  If you know anyone with a habit of biting their nails, get this and put it on their nails.  They may hate you BUT they will have nice nails!</li>
            <li> My six year old would not stop sucking on his fore and middle fingers. I heard about this product and decided to give it a try. It worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> Son stopped RIGHT away sucking his thumb. I would say that if you are eating finger foods and child happens to lick thumb instead of using a napkin the taste is aweful. I suggest putting bandaid on during meal.  This product deserves 5 stars and more!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my kid, when she was 2 y.o. and she stopped sucking her thumb. Now, she started biting fingers and I used it again. Same result: problem solved! Thanks Mavala STOP! (it works for grown ups too!)</li>
            <li> Works. Horrid taste.  Dreadful if you have to floss your teeth and get your finger tips in your mouth 0 an unforgettable experience!  A week later I bit my nails again and could not bring myself to re-apply it ...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. You have to commit to using it because it tastes horrible and trust me you don&#x27;t want that taste in your mouth if you bite your nails. One application really does last two days. I am 52 and a lifetime biter unless I do acrylics nail. I took them off and really tried to grow them out, but could not keep from biting them and the skin around my nail.  It did it!!!  in ttwo weeks, that was then end of it. Enough for them to grow some and the edges to be rounded, keeping me from biting and picking some more. Truly amazing product. It has been 4 weeks now since I stopped using the product and my fingers do NOT go in my mouth anymore.</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old daughter has a mean habit when it comes to thumb-sucking.  We have tried a variety of techniques and another brand of polish that did little to stop the problem.  So, I looked over the many reviews and ordered this product.  I cannot emphasis enough how effective this polish is at stopping thumb-sucking or nail biting.  It lasts a long time and has a terrible long-lasting taste.  I even agreed to try it for my own nail biting problems and I will testify that it stopped me cold.  If you even brush your fingers past your lips you can taste this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - effective, powerful, and long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;Cons - maybe to effective, powerful, and long-lasting, lol</li>
            <li> I bought this for 2 of my kids and I only had to put it once and they did not like the taste and stopped biting their nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 5 yr. old girl that has the nervous habit of chewing her fingernails...Now she washes her hands a lot and found the stuff washes off...Grandma has been out-smarted-If I could re-apply each time she washes it would work, but not even &#x27;I&#x27; have that kind of time!</li>
            <li> This really helped me stop biting my nails and helps my son keep his finger out of his mouth. It is still new to us but seems to be working.</li>
            <li> We used this to break our 2 and 4 year olds from finger/thumb sucking. It only took 2 applications for the younger child and she was done! The older child had to do it again a couple of weeks later when he fell back into the habit but 2 years later- they&#x27;re still not sucking fingers/thumbs  (and we only had to apply this 2-4 times!). I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have a nail biting problem, and it was time for me to face it. I looked up the best nail biting solutions that worked the most effectively, and this product instantly came up on top. I&#x27;ve used it maybe around 7 times, applying it every 4 days or so. I stopped nail biting altogether within the month. This product is absolutely amazing, and the taste is just horrendous. Every time I even think about biting my nails, I&#x27;m automatically thinking about the bitterness that was stuck in my throat for long minutes at a time. I would recommend this to ANYONE who has even the slightest nail biting problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; I have with this product is that it&#x27;s like nail polish, and will leave a very...&amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; surface on the nails. As a guy, it didn&#x27;t really sit well with my friends who were laughing hysterically. But it&#x27;s ok, still 5/5, because I was only looking for the effectiveness, and boy did it work well.</li>
            <li> This product worked great!! Both of my kids stopped with the first application.</li>
            <li> We tried everything to get my child to stop sucking his thumb.  Finally at five years old and only one application he is no longer a thumb sucker!</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter for 30 years. Things were so bad that i no longer had nails in my hands, just bloody nailbeds. I used mavala stop just once, and that was enough for me to break the habit- every time i tried to bite my nails this nasty taste would envelop my mouth and stop me.</li>
            <li> Completely cured my 6 year old&#x27;s thumb sucking within one week.  He immediately stopped putting his thumbs in his mouth.  We applied it to his nails after dinner every other night and then reduced the frequency of application to about once a week.  He was upset the first night or two (of course), but he adjusted and is doing great.  Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t try to stop a child from sucking their thumb but his thumb sucking was causing significant speech and dental problems.  His speech therapist AND dentist are thrilled.  This product is a miracle!!!</li>
            <li> It works.  I wish I had tried it sooner.  No negative effects. Fingernails on 7-year old child are starting to grow within a week.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old has bitten his nails for years.  He has not bitten his nails since using it, and we just clipped his nails for the first time since he was a little baby.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I finally decided I wanted to stop having bitten-down nails all the time. I had tried a similar product as a kid (thanks for trying, mom!) but it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to survive my vigorous hand scrubbing in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is stronger. And it lingers. And it doesn&#x27;t taste good. Two weeks of use every few days and I had nails to clip for the first time in a long time. And I stopped licking the BBQ sauce off my fingers because it no longer tasted good. And you stop washing your face in the shower. But at least you have finger nails again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s been over two months and we&#x27;re still on track. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> This worked at first but now my son seems to have gotten used to the taste and still bites his nails even after we recently applied it.  I worry about him ingesting the chemicals.  It did work for my husband.</li>
            <li> this really really works i put this on my nails and hate my self if i get my mouth close to them some times i forget and lick my fingers if im eating messy food but thats the price you pay. after applying for a month i no longer need it. leaves nails a little shiny but not too bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff is disguising for sure.  But it works.  It&#x27;ll stick to your fingernails all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be cautious about preparing food with it on or eating finger food like chips.</li>
    </ol>
