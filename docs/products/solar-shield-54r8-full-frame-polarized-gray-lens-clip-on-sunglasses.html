            <li>I Love them.  </li>
            <li>I liked that you can choose size and shape to fit.</li>

            <li>made well - easy to use - works well to shade the sun</li>
            <li>These are lightweight and easily storable when not in use.</li>
            <li>These fit true to the measurements!</li>

            <li>Cheaply made</li>

            <li>I originally bought these at Walmart a few years ago, but when I needed more they were no longer there.</li>
            <li>Removing is done by fussily pulling the hooks away while pushing down on the glasses (my own) frame.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is because the lens filters out certain wavelength.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These clip overs are simple, cheap, and work.</li>
            <li>I paid $10.99 which is much cheaper than having to buy prescription sunglasses.</li>

            <li>These clip ons are well made, go on easily, provide plenty of sun protection without looking like there&#x27;s a backhoe on your nose like some other types.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble taking them on or off.  </li>
            <li>Spring is not as strong as previous pair but firm enough to not rattle and hold onto glasses securely.  </li>
            <li>Dark enough, although my light sensitive eyes still squint.  </li>
            <li>it actually makes it harder to view certain shades/glasses (i.e., iphone, pda, computer, etc.)  </li>
            <li>Gently stretch the middle spring until other side hooks catch.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are fairly good quality clip-on for the price, if they fit. Didn&#x27;t work for me. If you order, try them on immediately.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Dark enough, although my light sensitive eyes still squint.  Lot less than without this.  Very good alternative to full price, prescription sunglasses.  It is fragile and is fussy removing.  Install is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;If anybody needs the how-to:  hook one side at an angle.  One hook at a time.  Gently stretch the middle spring until other side hooks catch.  Adjust.  Removing is done by fussily pulling the hooks away while pushing down on the glasses (my own) frame.  Then swing the clip on at a angle to remove.</li>
            <li> I ordered these clip on sunglasses and they are great. They are for the smaller glasses. They go on nice and stay on. I have always wanted a pair but didn&#x27;t know where to look. So I found them here on Amazon. Great buy. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> needed  to adjust fit to go over lens with pliers</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanx</li>
            <li> If you pick the correct size these work out great. You need to go to there website and print out their size sheets( which is why I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars) in order to find the correct size.</li>
            <li> These clip overs are simple, cheap, and work. Unlike another fancier clip over I tried.</li>
            <li> The sunglasses look good, and provide the protection I want.  My only complaint is that the hooks that hold the sunglasses onto the eyeglass frame aren&#x27;t very deep.  So the sunglasses clip on securely, but occasionally are a little difficult to get off.  The sunglasses might not fit at all on thick plastic frames and on metal frames with thick lenses.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Cheaply made</li>
            <li> Decent quality.  Good sun protection.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. Fit well on my frames.</li>
            <li> The packaging says polarized, but I did take notice of the reviewer who asserted these were not polarized. So I tested them by looking at an LCD computer screen through these clip-ons and rotating the clip-on. Horizontal I could read the screen perfectly. Vertical the screen was black. This was not true for another pair of sunglasses that is not polarized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I conclude these ARE polarized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also fit my 53mm glasses and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clip-ons are essentially impossible to find in stores. This is a good solution.</li>
            <li> These fit his classes perfectly. The polarized lens make driving on the bright sunny days in the South so much easier.</li>
            <li> Simple and they work well.</li>
            <li> These fit true to the measurements! Also the silver trim around the lenses look nice too.&lt;br /&gt;ONE MONTH LATER: Still grabbing good. I tend to put them in and out of my shirt pocket ALOT and they haven&#x27;t broken or gotten scratched doing this. The spring still has a good pull even after using them daily. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Pro: Fits like a glove on my prescription glasses.  Like the &#x27;semi&#x27; mirror look and the spring adjusting capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Not as scratch resistance as advertised - got a few scratch just by cleaning the lens.  Although it looks like it polarized, it not.  If you wear this you need to be warned:  it actually makes it harder to view certain shades/glasses (i.e., iphone, pda, computer, etc.)  You will also see noticeable artifacts on auto glass.  I believe this is because the lens filters out certain wavelength.  I find myself pull the shade off when I look at iphone / tablet.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these at Walmart a few years ago, but when I needed more they were no longer there. I was so bummed until I thought to look on Amazon. Saved!!!! These clip ons are well made, go on easily, provide plenty of sun protection without looking like there&#x27;s a backhoe on your nose like some other types. I paid $10.99 which is much cheaper than having to buy prescription sunglasses. They have never broken on me since I tend to lose them first! Will be buying more. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price.  Will buy again when I lose this pair.....always happens.</li>
            <li> Function : seems to work well but not yet tested in bright sunshine. Appearance : attractive.  Spring is not as strong as previous pair but firm enough to not rattle and hold onto glasses securely.  Case is included which protects while in the car&#x27;s glove compartment.</li>
            <li> made well - easy to use - works well to shade the sun</li>
            <li> I Love them.  I have no trouble taking them on or off.  After a while you can do it one handed while driving.</li>
            <li> Work and fit very well.</li>
            <li> These frames would not clamp onto the frames of my glasses. They did not stretch nicely. I wanted to get a refund but after the shipping and 15% restocking fee it was just cheaper for me to toss them in the trash which is exactly where they can be found..in the local landfill.</li>
            <li> Excellent, good price and the right size this product fits perfectly, the shade is good and not to dark, do not hesitate to buy it, full reccomended!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good for the price and appear to be of good quality. I liked that you can choose size and shape to fit. These are very close to my glasses fit and at a fraction of the cost compared to ordering with glasses.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my glasses.  These are lightweight and easily storable when not in use.</li>
