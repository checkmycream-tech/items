            <li>Anyway, this is really a marvelous winter fragrance.</li>
            <li>Excellent leather scent fragrance; great value.</li>
            <li>Great product and great shipping from customer.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great vendor.</li>
            <li>it would make a great showing.  </li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE AND PACKAGING.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved this scent.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how good this is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built with good, old-fashioned longevity.  </li>
            <li>I still liked the scent, I debated wearing it for a bit</li>
            <li>love the sent and so do my family.</li>
            <li>And get many compliments.  </li>
            <li>This 1776 has been around for many decades, but I never tire of the smell.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>it goes on better that way.  </li>
            <li>The more I use it, the happier I am with it.</li>
            <li>Finally, I also have what I consider to be the best leather scent of all:</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s strongly scented.</li>
            <li>My husband had this cologne when we first started dating, so glad I found it again</li>
            <li>AND I AM EXCITED TO GIVE IT FOR CHRISTMAS.  </li>
            <li>Smells very old fashioned like my grandpa&#x27;s kind of thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s something of a favorite among a certain class of men in Utah...  </li>
            <li>Smells quite good, but it&#x27;s a bit different from what I remember growing up with</li>
            <li>Longevity is old school great, and in cold weather it smells just delightful.  </li>
            <li>this is rare for me.</li>
            <li>Who says the Russians can&#x27;t do something right?  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware it was still being made, but you can&#x27;t underestimate Amazon.</li>
            <li>Elsha is a rich man&#x27;s English Leather but refined and full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has barely any scent and the bottle looks cheap.</li>
            <li>My high school and college cologne  Brings back many memories</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, creamy leather scent - same as it always was, apparently.</li>
            <li>She has since purchased Elsha and wears it much of the time.  </li>
            <li>Lo and behold she got a small bottle from her perfume tray and let me smell it (properly of course; avoided the alcohol smack) and I had to agree with her that it smelled like it except the Elsha was much more potent.</li>
            <li>(I suspect that many people who like one will appreciate the other.)</li>
            <li>I used Elsha through high school and college, it was sold in very high end men&#x27;s stores in Utah, a couple were Clarks and Hoover&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and the other said it was different but very appealing to her for herself.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for the nostalgic.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (I normally don&#x27;t wear cologne or scents at all.)  </li>
            <li>Rich buttery leather, smooth texture, smells expensive as high end brands.</li>
            <li>sampled the two scents and decided that the tones of Elsha are subtly different from Chanel but not by much.</li>
            <li>I touched a finger on the damp (not wet) lip of the bottle and touched both lapels.</li>

            <li> According to her, although it has a stronger initial scent, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Elsha is very deep and  long lasting.  </li>
            <li> A few of the reviewers have likened this cologne to the old Russian Leather,it is not even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it wears MUCH better when it&#x27;s cold.  </li>
            <li> This was back when very heavy cotton oxford Gant shirts, Polo, and custom made suits were sold only in traditional men&#x27;s stores.</li>
            <li> (Not very much!)  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been with them but a few minutes when one of them turned to me and exclaimed, \\&quot;What french</li>
            <li> It is absolutely not one of those reformulated into nothingness scents.</li>
            <li> The only con: It gets unbearably soapy after a few hours in summer heat.</li>
            <li> When I lived in Colorado, I ran into guys who would take a taxi during a Salt Lake City layover to pick up a few bottles, it was like Coor&#x27;s Beer in reverse (when it was only sold in a few states and you could buy cases at the DEN airport to take home) and friends would ask buddies headed to Park City to pick up some Elsha for them whenever a ski trip was on the schedule.</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a steal, as they say, the makers waste money on the product rather than the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> So, do not waste your money,even if you are&lt;br /&gt;feeling nostalgic.</li>
            <li> While Elsha doesn&#x27;t smell like it, it has its place on the shelf with it at less than a tenth of the cost!</li>
            <li> Small bottles, over priced.</li>
            <li> So this is definitely not a warm weather scent.</li>
            <li> Cold weather only - fall and winter.</li>
            <li> the sealed Elsha boxes did say cologne, however the wrong product had been packed inside the box.</li>
            <li> If Elsha 1776 was decanted into an expensive bottle with fancier labeling, etc.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s been an unusually cold winter.)</li>

            <li> Great product and great shipping from customer.</li>
            <li> Who says the Russians can&#x27;t do something right?  Great stuff for the nostalgic.  A perfume guys can wear.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find Elsha on Amazon. My high school and college cologne  Brings back many memories</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  love the sent and so do my family.</li>
            <li> AAA++++. seller Thank you</li>
            <li> Smells quite good, but it&#x27;s a bit different from what I remember growing up with and it&#x27;s strongly scented. I touched a finger on the damp (not wet) lip of the bottle and touched both lapels. (Not very much!)  My maternal parent smelled it and thought that she recognized it.  Lo and behold she got a small bottle from her perfume tray and let me smell it (properly of course; avoided the alcohol smack) and I had to agree with her that it smelled like it except the Elsha was much more potent. The bottle said Chanel #5...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was heading out to meet female friends at the theater. I hadn&#x27;t been with them but a few minutes when one of them turned to me and exclaimed, \\&quot;What french wh*re have you been sleeping with!?\\&quot; (I normally don&#x27;t wear cologne or scents at all.)  After explaining to them what I had done, one thought it was Chanel and the other said it was different but very appealing to her for herself.  She has since purchased Elsha and wears it much of the time.  According to her, although it has a stronger initial scent, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sampled the two scents and decided that the tones of Elsha are subtly different from Chanel but not by much. (I suspect that many people who like one will appreciate the other.) I still liked the scent, I debated wearing it for a bit and now I wear it when I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li> Twice I ordered and paid for Elsha cologne,  and both times we received aftershave instead. This was not the sellers fault~ the sealed Elsha boxes did say cologne, however the wrong product had been packed inside the box.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent.  Though Iam a women I wear it with ease.  And get many compliments.  This 1776 has been around for many decades, but I never tire of the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great vendor.</li>
            <li> Elsha is very deep and  long lasting.  Rich buttery leather, smooth texture, smells expensive as high end brands. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I found this one in the men&#x27;s store in my university&#x27;s bookstore; it&#x27;s the only fragrance they sell! $20 a bottle! My friend&#x27;s grandfather wore this so I bought him a bottle. I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s something of a favorite among a certain class of men in Utah...  It&#x27;s a nice, creamy leather scent - same as it always was, apparently. It compares favorably, I think, with Chanel&#x27;s Cuir de Russie (which I find too floral) and Hermes&#x27; Bel Ami - that&#x27;s how good this is. What&#x27;s more, it lasts a lot longer. It is absolutely not one of those reformulated into nothingness scents. On my wrist I can spray it and seven hours later it&#x27;s still there - this is rare for me. It&#x27;s built with good, old-fashioned longevity.  If Elsha 1776 was decanted into an expensive bottle with fancier labeling, etc. it would make a great showing.  I have decanted some from the splash bottle into an atomizer - it goes on better that way.  The only con: It gets unbearably soapy after a few hours in summer heat. So this is definitely not a warm weather scent. Cold weather only - fall and winter. Maybe sweat spoils it? I don&#x27;t know. But it wears MUCH better when it&#x27;s cold.  Anyway, this is really a marvelous winter fragrance. (It&#x27;s been an unusually cold winter.) The more I use it, the happier I am with it. Longevity is old school great, and in cold weather it smells just delightful.  Finally, I also have what I consider to be the best leather scent of all: Tom Ford Tuscan Leather. While Elsha doesn&#x27;t smell like it, it has its place on the shelf with it at less than a tenth of the cost!</li>
            <li> My husband had this cologne when we first started dating, so glad I found it again</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE AND PACKAGING.  ITEM WAS AS DESCRIBED AND I AM EXCITED TO GIVE IT FOR CHRISTMAS.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Close to the skin sillage and short duration of 2-3 hours. Smells very old fashioned like my grandpa&#x27;s kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Excellent leather scent fragrance; great value.</li>
            <li> An oldie but goody!  have been using it for 60 years.</li>
            <li> Item met lifetime standard.</li>
            <li> I used Elsha through high school and college, it was sold in very high end men&#x27;s stores in Utah, a couple were Clarks and Hoover&#x27;s. This was back when very heavy cotton oxford Gant shirts, Polo, and custom made suits were sold only in traditional men&#x27;s stores. Now you get no service nor quality tailoring in a bustling three-story mall department store, in place of the personalized men&#x27;s shops. When I lived in Colorado, I ran into guys who would take a taxi during a Salt Lake City layover to pick up a few bottles, it was like Coor&#x27;s Beer in reverse (when it was only sold in a few states and you could buy cases at the DEN airport to take home) and friends would ask buddies headed to Park City to pick up some Elsha for them whenever a ski trip was on the schedule. I wasn&#x27;t aware it was still being made, but you can&#x27;t underestimate Amazon. Elsha is a rich man&#x27;s English Leather but refined and full. For the money, it&#x27;s a steal, as they say, the makers waste money on the product rather than the glass bottle.</li>
