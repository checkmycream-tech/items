            <li>Best hair tonic.</li>
            <li>It came on time shipped perfectly, however, the fragrance was overpowering!</li>
            <li>Awesome scent that does fade (which I prefer since I&#x27;m not in an assassin duo from a</li>
            <li>Great Item!</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Just like the barbershop... doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and smells great!</li>
            <li>Very good for intended use.</li>
            <li>The smell is great too, just like I got out of the barber shop.</li>
            <li>It is a great scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for me.</li>
            <li>So I bought some to find out, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great scent</li>
            <li>It goes great with the aftershave and talc powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>And it smells great, as they all do (though the Quinine took getting used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great hair tonic, but I over paid for it.</li>
            <li>People tell me how good I smell when I use it.</li>
            <li>Um... well, this stuff smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells really good, keeps scalp and hair moisturized without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not as good as Clubman Pinaud Eau de Quinine Compound Hair Tonic.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, not oil based but with a light and fragrant scent.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t even know what hair tonic is</li>
            <li>It compliments the aftershave perfectly and absolutely works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Kind of like putting aftershave on your head.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all for hair control but smells nice.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure that alcohol is good for your hair.</li>
            <li>Better than Lucky Tiger, but not as good as Pinaud&#x27;s own Portugal hair tonic.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I prefer Pinaud&#x27;s Eau de Quinine, but very much enjoy having both products in my grooming arsenal!</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s what your looking for then ok, but it took me off guard.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but gives me a stuffy nose.</li>
            <li>Must be aleric to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the fragrance of the aftershave and hair tonic.  </li>
            <li>I went online and discovered the manufacturer had discontinued manufacturing the scent of hair tonic I enjoyed.</li>
            <li>put it in a spray bottle from MUJI, and that seems to be much more</li>
            <li>I love the Clubman smell</li>
            <li>It held my hair in place, but had a more oily look.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but this is not a &amp;#34;stand-alone&amp;#34; hair tonic for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the Clubmen products, so I will keep experimenting with them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more akin to putting rubbing alcohol on your hair.</li>
            <li>love to put on after I wash hair (with punish shampoo) but will not aid in styling in anyway.</li>
            <li>Love it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>It should make it more cooperative in styling it the way you want.  </li>
            <li>Has that great classic smell.</li>
            <li>Feels cool when it&#x27;s applied combs out nice, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>This product is great and will remind you of when going to an old fashion Barber!  </li>
            <li>As far as making me smell good, this stuff is awesome, but as a product to make my hair look better, it didn&#x27;t do a single thing that I&#x27;ve read a hair tonic should do.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a refreshing, clean smell</li>
            <li>Brings me back to barbershop memories and smells and does a great job of greases sly holding hair in place.</li>
            <li>Not greasey, Light control</li>
            <li>I was concerned the fragrances would conflict, but it turns out they are very complimentary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t a compliment.</li>
            <li>This provides nice hold and and a light old time barbershop scent</li>
            <li>, I love the whole line of Clubman Pinaud products.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s greaseless not bad</li>
            <li>this one is classic, but i like more variety.</li>
            <li>I take really good care of my hair but the problem is this tonic is mostly alcohol (I think - at least it has a strong alcohol smell).</li>
            <li>I really wish I got the same great results that everyone else gets from it</li>
            <li>hair tonic is supposed to keep your hair shiny, silky, soft, and healthy...</li>
            <li>It has that classic scent, but like all of the Pinaud products is filled with old time ingredients that are allergens to many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my second favorite hair tonic, right after Lucky Tiger.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve used the aftershave forever, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the hair tonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it is back on the market.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love the Clubman Pinaud aftershave as something to splash on after a shower, but I can&#x27;t say the same for my scalp and this product.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed is alcohol...</li>
            <li>(I do love and use the aftershave in this same scent), but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like</li>
            <li>Leaves hair refreshed, clean smelling, natural looking and all with zero grease.</li>
            <li>Mild hold, but very natural look to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I will be the first to say that I like the Pinaud Clubman product line - but the hair tonic - eh, not so much.</li>
            <li>tonic - I can&#x27;t judge really well because this is the first hair tonic I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Especially in this dry winter air it provides some conditioning to my hair and the fragrance is pleasant and manly.</li>
            <li>That keeps my hair in place, but almost too much.</li>
            <li>but I know alcohol is very &amp;#34;drying.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t have any holding power with my finger length haircut.</li>
            <li>Really is non-greasy and holds your hair in place.</li>
            <li>The seller (Goodman&#x27;s) very considerately refunded my payment (and shipping).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much, except make your hair fell silkier.  </li>
            <li>I really just like the smell.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a lot to control hair, but it seems to do more than the other tonics in the line (Eau de Portugal and Eau de Quinine).</li>
            <li>However, Pinaud Clubman is a classic man&#x27;s aftershave that is still unmatched.</li>
            <li>OK, not really, but I do like the old time barber shop products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better and stayed in place w/o being stiff or greasy</li>
            <li>After shaves come and go and some Hollywood celebrity is always putting their name on some new formula.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a decent job of keeping your hair manageable but the fragrance really lasts,</li>
            <li>I usually use Vitalis and haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately, thought, well this size is large, I&#x27;ll use clubman, whew, really strong,</li>
            <li>Only wish it had a little more hold to it like</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t alter your hair&#x27;s sheen and is natural looking.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell like a barber shop and feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>For that &amp;#34;I just left the barbershop&amp;#34; smell and the fact that it really works should rate it 6 stars.  </li>
            <li>hair tonic that would control my hair without an oily look and provide the old barbershop smell.</li>
            <li>As far as how well it does as a hair</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I started using Clubman&#x27;s Pinaud Hair Tonic in the early 1960s and have never stop.</li>
            <li>My wife does say it makes me smell like an old man.</li>
            <li>Old man smell or not, I like it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s old fashioned</li>
            <li>but when I just want a quick fix to tame my hair it does the trick.</li>
            <li>do in general like the tonic -</li>
            <li>what of a dry look, but more stiff than I prefer, and certainly no old barbershop smell.  </li>

            <li> I started using Clubman&#x27;s Pinaud Hair Tonic in the early 1960s and have never stop.</li>
            <li> My wife does say it makes me smell like an old man.</li>
            <li> Old man smell or not, I like it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s old fashioned</li>

            <li> what of a dry look, but more stiff than I prefer, and certainly no old barbershop smell.  </li>
            <li> The only other experiment I can try is to apply this tonic to wet hair, right out of the shower, then let it air dry and comb, to see how it holds.  </li>
            <li> Although the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long, the hair stays manageable.</li>
            <li> When I applied my regular gel/mousse, hair dry, then apply this Clubman 276700 Pinaud Hair Tonic, it gave me the look and smell I wanted, but I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;stand alone&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have long hair and also use the Clubman gel.</li>
            <li> I get  more compliments when I wear Pinaud than that of expensive department store brands!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t slept in a week and they&#x27;re still coming, breaking down my door with no regard for my current physical or mental state.</li>
            <li> If you put it on while your hair is DRY, however, you get that 70&#x27;s slicked-down, \\&quot;Hi</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Brings me back to barbershop memories and smells and does a great job of greases sly holding hair in place.</li>
            <li> i prefer the quinine hair tonic. this one is classic, but i like more variety.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Very little hold but when I just want a quick fix to tame my hair it does the trick. The smell is great too, just like I got out of the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair refreshed, clean smelling, natural looking and all with zero grease. I prefer Pinaud&#x27;s Eau de Quinine, but very much enjoy having both products in my grooming arsenal!</li>
            <li> A minimalist approach to managing flyaway hair.  It doesn&#x27;t alter your hair&#x27;s sheen and is natural looking.</li>
            <li> Best hair tonic. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wash and wear guy. In the winter I have slightly itchy scalp, work it into your hair scalp area. I haven&#x27;t itched since I started using it. I use it with Clubman Aftershave Pinaud...  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve used the aftershave forever, this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the hair tonic. To be honest, I don&#x27;t even know what hair tonic is but I love this stuff. It compliments the aftershave perfectly and absolutely works as advertised. I&#x27;ll be a lifelong customer from now on.</li>
            <li> Very good for intended use. No oil.</li>
            <li> The seller was fantastic,&lt;br /&gt; It came on time shipped perfectly, however, the fragrance was overpowering! I usually use Vitalis and haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately, thought, well this size is large, I&#x27;ll use clubman, whew, really strong, if that&#x27;s what your looking for then ok, but it took me off guard.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not oil based but with a light and fragrant scent.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a lot bigger</li>
            <li> This coupled with clubman aftershave and my wife goes bonkers. It is a great scent. However, like the quinine if you want a daylong hold, you probably going to need hairspray</li>
            <li> This is a great product for me. Especially in this dry winter air it provides some conditioning to my hair and the fragrance is pleasant and manly. I have long hair and also use the Clubman gel. I was concerned the fragrances would conflict, but it turns out they are very complimentary. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Has that great classic smell. Only wish it had a little more hold to it like that it&#x27;s greaseless not bad</li>
            <li> Kind of like putting aftershave on your head.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all for hair control but smells nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair tonic out of curiosity. I had no idea what hair tonic was, or what it was used for. So I bought some to find out, and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It makes my hair smell like a barber shop and feel incredibly soft. I am a big fan.</li>
            <li> This product is great and will remind you of when going to an old fashion Barber!  Great scent, I love the whole line of Clubman Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> After shaves come and go and some Hollywood celebrity is always putting their name on some new formula. However, Pinaud Clubman is a classic man&#x27;s aftershave that is still unmatched. I get  more compliments when I wear Pinaud than that of expensive department store brands!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. People tell me how good I smell when I use it. It goes great with the aftershave and talc powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but gives me a stuffy nose. Must be aleric to one or more of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better and stayed in place w/o being stiff or greasy</li>
            <li> For that &amp;#34;I just left the barbershop&amp;#34; smell and the fact that it really works should rate it 6 stars.  This is my favorite.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My health club displayed this product for members to use.  I enjoyed the fragrance of the aftershave and hair tonic.  However, after a short time, the club discontinued using the product because of availability from their distributor.  I went online and discovered the manufacturer had discontinued manufacturing the scent of hair tonic I enjoyed. I&#x27;m glad to see it is back on the market.</li>
            <li> Mild hold, but very natural look to the hair.  Awesome scent that does fade (which I prefer since I&#x27;m not in an assassin duo from a James Bond film).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in a spray bottle from MUJI, and that seems to be much more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I combine this with a &#x27;half&#x27; dab of Brylcreem.  That keeps my hair in place, but almost too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been approximately 8 months since I made the horrible decision to purchase this product. I&#x27;m hot, sweaty, and very exhausted. I haven&#x27;t slept in a week and they&#x27;re still coming, breaking down my door with no regard for my current physical or mental state. Every night is a battle for my life, and my days are no different. I have scratch marks covering 90% of my back, and I can&#x27;t feel my leg or stomach muscles. I am very tired, I don&#x27;t know how long I can do this. If you&#x27;re reading this, please send help. These girls are going to be the death of me.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> I will be the first to say that I like the Pinaud Clubman product line - but the hair tonic - eh, not so much. I take really good care of my hair but the problem is this tonic is mostly alcohol (I think - at least it has a strong alcohol smell). I love the Clubman smell but I&#x27;m not so sure that alcohol is good for your hair. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects but I know alcohol is very &amp;#34;drying.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t have any holding power with my finger length haircut. I only use it for the Clubman smell.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;stand-alone&amp;#34; hair tonic that would control my hair without an oily look and provide the old barbershop smell. I currently use a lite gel or mousse, hair dryer, then hair spray to control my hair throughout the day.  Some what of a dry look, but more stiff than I prefer, and certainly no old barbershop smell.  Unfortunately, this particular Clubman product does not deliver . . . by itself.  When I applied it to dry hair, it requires two or three generous palm fulls of product to keep my hair in place, but it gives my hair a thin oily look, not for what I was looking.  When I applied my regular gel/mousse, hair dry, then apply this Clubman 276700 Pinaud Hair Tonic, it gave me the look and smell I wanted, but I&#x27;m looking for a &amp;#34;stand alone&amp;#34; product.  I&#x27;m now 62, but when I was  youngster growing up in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s I used Vitalis with V7.  It held my hair in place, but had a more oily look.  The Beatles were invading the U.S. and I wanted the &amp;#34;dry look.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t mind a little shine, but this product does not hold my hair in place and allows my bangs to fall down (I comb my hair back.)  The only other experiment I can try is to apply this tonic to wet hair, right out of the shower, then let it air dry and comb, to see how it holds.  I love the smell, but this is not a &amp;#34;stand-alone&amp;#34; hair tonic for me.  I love the Clubmen products, so I will keep experimenting with them.</li>
            <li> Um... well, this stuff smells good. As far as how well it does as a hair tonic - I can&#x27;t judge really well because this is the first hair tonic I&#x27;ve ever used. If you put it on while your hair is wet, as it dries it sorta kinda holds your hair in place. If you put it on while your hair is DRY, however, you get that 70&#x27;s slicked-down, \\&quot;Hi, what&#x27;s your sign, baby?\\&quot; look. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If hair tonic is supposed to keep your hair shiny, silky, soft, and healthy... this doesn&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s more akin to putting rubbing alcohol on your hair. I even had a barber tell me my hair was EXTREMELY dry and \\&quot;thirsty\\&quot; while I had this stuff on. I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t a compliment.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a lot to control hair, but it seems to do more than the other tonics in the line (Eau de Portugal and Eau de Quinine). And it smells great, as they all do (though the Quinine took getting used to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my second favorite hair tonic, right after Lucky Tiger. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has that classic scent, but like all of the Pinaud products is filled with old time ingredients that are allergens to many. Better than Lucky Tiger, but not as good as Pinaud&#x27;s own Portugal hair tonic.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, keeps scalp and hair moisturized without being greasy.</li>
            <li> love to put on after I wash hair (with punish shampoo) but will not aid in styling in anyway. Rather is another form of conditioner of sorts. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or sticky. Feels cool when it&#x27;s applied combs out nice, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Not greasey, Light control</li>
            <li> Great hair tonic, but I over paid for it.</li>
            <li> Old habits die hard. I started using Clubman&#x27;s Pinaud Hair Tonic in the early 1960s and have never stop. Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> Really is non-greasy and holds your hair in place. Best I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> This stuff is good.  But it&#x27;s not as good as Clubman Pinaud Eau de Quinine Compound Hair Tonic.  I&#x27;ll buy this again only if I can&#x27;t get Eau de Quinine.</li>
            <li> The bottle was damaged in transit and leaking when it arrived. The seller (Goodman&#x27;s) very considerately refunded my payment (and shipping).&lt;br /&gt;I do in general like the tonic - I discovered it while attending a function at the Union League Club in Chicago, where it seems to be in all of the mens&#x27; rooms. I think it has a refreshing, clean smell &amp; it definitely is not greasy or oily. My wife does say it makes me smell like an old man. Old man smell or not, I like it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using the Pinaud Aftershave this is definitely the hair tonic to go along with it.  Not only does it do a decent job of keeping your hair manageable but the fragrance really lasts, while not being overpowering as I feel some of the other Clubman are (Eau de Quinine comes to mind).  I&#x27;d shy away from using this if you&#x27;re wearing a different aftershave since they could conflict.  Get this stuff with the Pinaud aftershave and smell like you just walked out of a 1950&#x27;s barber shop!  Now, who wouldn&#x27;t want to do that?</li>
            <li> OK, not really, but I do like the old time barber shop products.  This fits the bill.  Doesn&#x27;t really do much, except make your hair fell silkier.  I really just like the smell.  I use it along with something else with stronger hold.</li>
            <li> I love the Clubman Pinaud aftershave as something to splash on after a shower, but I can&#x27;t say the same for my scalp and this product. Yes, it&#x27;s old fashioned but it dries your scalp and the hold is poor compared to other gels. If you want the Clubman Pinaud scent in a hair product I suggest buying their gel.</li>
            <li> Just like the barbershop... doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and smells great! Although the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long, the hair stays manageable. I also pair this with the aftershave.</li>
            <li> As far as making me smell good, this stuff is awesome, but as a product to make my hair look better, it didn&#x27;t do a single thing that I&#x27;ve read a hair tonic should do.  A hair tonic should make your hair shiny.  This didn&#x27;t do that.  It should make it more cooperative in styling it the way you want.  If anything, this made it more difficult to work with.  It should help moisturize your hair and scalp.  The first ingredient listed is alcohol... so no, it didn&#x27;t help with that, either.  I really wish I got the same great results that everyone else gets from it (I do love and use the aftershave in this same scent), but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like this is the hair tonic for me.</li>
            <li> This provides nice hold and and a light old time barbershop scent</li>
