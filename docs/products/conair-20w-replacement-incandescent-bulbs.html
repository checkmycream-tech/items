            <li>Glad to see this is offered through Amazon.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to find replacement bulbs</li>
            <li>but I just make sure not to leave on in case of overheating and fire.</li>
            <li>I can see again and just love my Conair mirror.</li>
            <li>I CAN NOW APPLY MY MAKE UP BETTER.</li>
            <li>What could be better than renewing your mirror by &amp;#34;pushing a button&amp;#34; on Amazon.com and getting them delivered to your door?  </li>
            <li>(magic?</li>
            <li>They are way too bright and get very hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Bulbs were a perfect match and easy to replace one we got the dang mirror open!  </li>
            <li>You need to two colors to be able to adjust the light settings, which I never do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching now for a reasonably priced lighted makeup mirror and a good supply of replacement bulbs.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfectly easy to install</li>
            <li>Easy to replace bulbs for my Conair makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>These blew very quickly.</li>
            <li>These bulbs are easy to install and because they&#x27;re what the manufacturer recommends.  </li>
            <li>It came as described, and worked fine.</li>
            <li>If they charged $2.00 they would be making a huge profit.</li>
            <li>I purchased a 25 watt candelabra light bulb for my Conair Oval Double-Sided Lighted Mirror - Oiled-Bronze Finish.  </li>
            <li>This is the light bulb that I needed for replacement in my lighted mirror.  </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery included BOTH light bulbs which you may not know that you need when ordering.</li>
            <li>The bulbs that came with the mirror are no longer available and these bulbs are the recommeded substitute.  </li>
            <li>My Conair make-up light is still working</li>
            <li>Genuine com air product</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy just a light bulb set for a mirror.  </li>
            <li>They fit and they work.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Good quality and fits my old conair lighted make-up mirror.</li>
            <li>So glad I could find the right bulb for my mirror,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t light up bright enough.</li>
            <li>Amazon is certainly the most convenient way to go to get replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because they are listed as replacements for the Conair makeup mirror model I have, but the white bulbs are so super bright compared to what originally was in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>These are great because the blue one is white/neutral light and the clear is the warmer light so depending on which you put in the dimming side of the mirror you can have either type of light.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, arrived in great shape.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly came in one piece work well.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and worked</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>Shopping quick.  </li>
            <li>Conair makes a nice mirror, and the lighting is good, but the replacement bulb price is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I glad I found these when I was shopping for a new mirror.</li>
            <li>When you pay a lot for a mirror you want to be able to get new bulbs when they burn out.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Arrived in few days and works great</li>
            <li>The clear bulb works best, hopefully I can find a package that just sells the clear bulbs for future purchases.  </li>
            <li>The price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I will only get the clear as it does work great.</li>
            <li>I decided to use 2 clear bulbs for better lighting.</li>
            <li>Arrived completely shattered, I love the bulbs</li>
            <li>These lights were the original replacements and the mirror has been working exactly like when it was first purchases.</li>
            <li>They work exactly like the originals at a far more economical price.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>These bulbs did the trick and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It needed new light bulbs and these worked prefect.</li>
            <li>Products is as advertised  and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>The clear bulb doesn&#x27;t seen nearly as bright as the initial bulb that came in my mirror????</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need to repair my make-up mirror.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I needed for my Conair makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This two bulb are the exact replacement lights from my wife&#x27;s Conair markup mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Yea, they were exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I purchased in person and they last forever :)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly</li>
            <li>These were and exact match.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; my mirror.</li>
            <li>I only needed the clear bulb from this set but liked that they came together</li>
            <li>They work exactly the same as the original part that came with the mirror and were super easy to replace - just took two tiny screws out of the mirror, popped in the bulbs and &amp;#34;reassembled&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Next time, I might try to locate two white bulbs, as I only care about bright light when messing with my face.</li>
            <li>My mirror is working like new!!</li>
            <li>To be able to replace the burnt out bulb saved an enormous amount of money versus having to buy a new mirror.</li>
            <li>mirror has 4 different light settings each with a different intensity of light, and the bulbs do exactly what they&#x27;re designed to do which is to provide the different intensity of light based on the mirror setting.  </li>
            <li>What really can you say about these?</li>
            <li>Item as described, the only thing I would suggest is that maybe they should provide instructions on which color light goes on which side...  </li>
            <li>In fact, I had to get these bulbs when I accidentally left my mirror light on all day.</li>
            <li>Fast service, just what I wanted</li>
            <li>All other settings have the bright lights on (with or without the additional blue lights), and I&#x27;m blinded.  </li>
            <li>There is a blue one and a clear one which is exactly what was originally in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>but I find that the blue tinted bulbs tend to burn out much quicker than the clear ones resulting in more clear spares.</li>
            <li>Just like new!</li>
            <li>They saved me from having to buy a whole new mirror.</li>
            <li>You could probably buy a clear night light bulb of the same wattage and get by, but I just bought the two new bulbs instead.</li>
            <li>Since they were made by the mirror&#x27;s manufacturer, I expected them to work fine</li>
            <li>I have to hold my hand over the light to partially block it</li>
            <li>It would be nice if these were sold in double packs of the blue bulbs only.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to order and replace and my wife&#x27;s mirror is back in business, It ain&#x27;t rocket science.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new mirror.</li>
            <li>After pricing a NEW Conair makeup mirror, I realized it would be a lot cheaper to just replace the burned out bulb.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be brighter, Lighting seemed to be very dim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same bulb that my Conair dual mirror takes.</li>
            <li>The lamp was not left on continuely for the first bulb.</li>
            <li>the old bulbs were 10w the new ones are 20w and run hotter.</li>
            <li>I went to the hardware store and got ones that fit, but basically exploded after less than a week.</li>
            <li>I thought a little pricey but had to order these online to get my makeup mirror to work again.&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs were just fine.</li>
            <li>The second bulb I left it on thinking the turning it on and off so much contributed to the first bulb blowing, which has been my experience with salt lamps.</li>
            <li>Hope they last as long as the original ones.</li>
            <li>With replacement bulbs (even direct from Conair) it no longer operates that way.</li>
            <li>Mine has lasted so far, albeit with the routine of plugging in and unplugging.</li>
            <li>I thought the bulb would brighten and dim.</li>
            <li>and since I could not find them near me</li>
            <li>Needed a replacement for my 10 year old make up mirror.  </li>
            <li>this was not a problem with the bulbs, was that the opening the mirror housing to replace these was a major pain.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had to replace the blue bulb twice while the clear bulb continues to work.  </li>
            <li>The last batch I bought the clear lasted about four seconds then quite, there goes five bucks.</li>
            <li>Wish you could purchase just the clear one as that is the only one I use.</li>
            <li>This was the only bulb I could find that fit my mirror, so the blue bulb is wasted.  </li>
            <li>I really could not locate one locally where I live &amp; found it in less than 2 minutes on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought two sets so that I could replace the clear bulb and still have an extra one along with the blue replacements.  </li>
            <li>When a lower setting is on, only the blue comes on, and I can barely see myself</li>

            <li> When you pay a lot for a mirror you want to be able to get new bulbs when they burn out.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Arrived in few days and works great</li>
            <li> The clear bulb works best, hopefully I can find a package that just sells the clear bulbs for future purchases.  </li>
            <li> The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I will only get the clear as it does work great.</li>
            <li> I decided to use 2 clear bulbs for better lighting.</li>
            <li> Arrived completely shattered, I love the bulbs</li>
            <li> These lights were the original replacements and the mirror has been working exactly like when it was first purchases.</li>
            <li> They work exactly like the originals at a far more economical price.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> These bulbs did the trick and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It needed new light bulbs and these worked prefect.</li>
            <li> Products is as advertised  and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The clear bulb doesn&#x27;t seen nearly as bright as the initial bulb that came in my mirror????</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to repair my make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I needed for my Conair makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This two bulb are the exact replacement lights from my wife&#x27;s Conair markup mirrors.  </li>
            <li> Yea, they were exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I purchased in person and they last forever :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly</li>
            <li> These were and exact match.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; my mirror.</li>
            <li> I only needed the clear bulb from this set but liked that they came together</li>
            <li> They work exactly the same as the original part that came with the mirror and were super easy to replace - just took two tiny screws out of the mirror, popped in the bulbs and &amp;#34;reassembled&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Next time, I might try to locate two white bulbs, as I only care about bright light when messing with my face.</li>
            <li> My mirror is working like new!!</li>
            <li> To be able to replace the burnt out bulb saved an enormous amount of money versus having to buy a new mirror.</li>
            <li> mirror has 4 different light settings each with a different intensity of light, and the bulbs do exactly what they&#x27;re designed to do which is to provide the different intensity of light based on the mirror setting.  </li>
            <li> What really can you say about these?</li>
            <li> Item as described, the only thing I would suggest is that maybe they should provide instructions on which color light goes on which side...  </li>
            <li> In fact, I had to get these bulbs when I accidentally left my mirror light on all day.</li>
            <li> Fast service, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> All other settings have the bright lights on (with or without the additional blue lights), and I&#x27;m blinded.  </li>
            <li> There is a blue one and a clear one which is exactly what was originally in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> but I find that the blue tinted bulbs tend to burn out much quicker than the clear ones resulting in more clear spares.</li>
            <li> Just like new!</li>
            <li> They saved me from having to buy a whole new mirror.</li>
            <li> You could probably buy a clear night light bulb of the same wattage and get by, but I just bought the two new bulbs instead.</li>
            <li> Since they were made by the mirror&#x27;s manufacturer, I expected them to work fine</li>
            <li> I have to hold my hand over the light to partially block it</li>
            <li> It would be nice if these were sold in double packs of the blue bulbs only.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to order and replace and my wife&#x27;s mirror is back in business, It ain&#x27;t rocket science.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new mirror.</li>
            <li> After pricing a NEW Conair makeup mirror, I realized it would be a lot cheaper to just replace the burned out bulb.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be brighter, Lighting seemed to be very dim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same bulb that my Conair dual mirror takes.</li>
            <li> The lamp was not left on continuely for the first bulb.</li>
            <li> the old bulbs were 10w the new ones are 20w and run hotter.</li>
            <li> I went to the hardware store and got ones that fit, but basically exploded after less than a week.</li>
            <li> I thought a little pricey but had to order these online to get my makeup mirror to work again.&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs were just fine.</li>
            <li> The second bulb I left it on thinking the turning it on and off so much contributed to the first bulb blowing, which has been my experience with salt lamps.</li>
            <li> Hope they last as long as the original ones.</li>
            <li> With replacement bulbs (even direct from Conair) it no longer operates that way.</li>
            <li> Mine has lasted so far, albeit with the routine of plugging in and unplugging.</li>
            <li> I thought the bulb would brighten and dim.</li>
            <li> and since I could not find them near me</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my 10 year old make up mirror.  </li>
            <li> this was not a problem with the bulbs, was that the opening the mirror housing to replace these was a major pain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to replace the blue bulb twice while the clear bulb continues to work.  </li>
            <li> The last batch I bought the clear lasted about four seconds then quite, there goes five bucks.</li>
            <li> Wish you could purchase just the clear one as that is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> This was the only bulb I could find that fit my mirror, so the blue bulb is wasted.  </li>
            <li> I really could not locate one locally where I live &amp; found it in less than 2 minutes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets so that I could replace the clear bulb and still have an extra one along with the blue replacements.  </li>
            <li> When a lower setting is on, only the blue comes on, and I can barely see myself</li>
            <li> Is it possible to buy single blue bulbs?</li>
            <li> My mirror is like new again with little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE TYPES FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> Works well enough - not sure why there is a blue bulb in there, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> They burn out so quickly and are so expensive</li>
            <li> I just hope it doesn&#x27;t burn out quickly because they are expensive to keep having to replace.</li>
            <li> (my mirror did not originally come with blue lights).  </li>
            <li> Usually one goes first and the other might last longer or be not far behind.</li>
            <li> The wife needed these for her makeup mirror and the only complaint I have is that I didn&#x27;t need the blue bulb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last as I just put them in, but if I have any problems I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Everything was as I expected for the purchase</li>
            <li> Fits, works as expected andd saves time running to the store.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding the blue tint bulb?</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Simple as screwing in a new bulb and much less expensive than replacing the mirror.</li>
            <li> These bulbs are the exact replacement for my mirror and were less expensive than what Conair was selling them for.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Too dark or blinded are basically the two settings I get.  </li>
            <li> These bulbs are too expensive and are not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in Conair and will most likely go with another brand.</li>
            <li> Never had any trouble with the bulbs or delivery.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that these bulbs are too expensive with shipping costs added in.  </li>
            <li> Was not able to find them any place else.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should get the mirror that goes with these bulbs instead since the one i have is so hard to find replacements for.</li>
            <li> rejuvinated my very expensive mirror at a low cost.</li>
            <li> I had no idea these bulbs were so hard to find in a store!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the blue bulb.</li>
            <li> So annoyed.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what they are...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to use my mirror.  </li>
            <li> delivered as advertised, expensive!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked perfectly easy to install</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my cosmetic mirror and they do the job. You need to two colors to be able to adjust the light settings, which I never do. Next time, I might try to locate two white bulbs, as I only care about bright light when messing with my face.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  I purchased a 25 watt candelabra light bulb for my Conair Oval Double-Sided Lighted Mirror - Oiled-Bronze Finish.  It works perfect and I got 2 bulbs for a dollar at a local store.  Save your money because you won&#x27;t need the blue one anyway for this model.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipment of quality product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need to repair my make-up mirror. Simple as screwing in a new bulb and much less expensive than replacing the mirror.</li>
            <li> So glad I could find the right bulb for my mirror, tried everywhere local to find it.  Arrived in few days and works great</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these so I bought two this time. They arrive perfectly packaged as shown!</li>
            <li> Perfectly replaced decades-old bulbs that finally burned out.</li>
            <li> What really can you say about these? They fit my Conair BE6FV lamp perfectly. I believe you can also find these at Bed Bath and Beyond. I would price compare them.</li>
            <li> Great price for the bulbs to replace my conair mirror.</li>
            <li> Bulbs returned my wife&#x27;s mirror to its proper brightness and function.</li>
            <li> Order received ahead of promised schedule. Product exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Worked great in my mirror.  No problems</li>
            <li> Easy to replace bulbs for my Conair makeup mirror. Just like new!</li>
            <li> Perfect for makeup mirror...  bought a second set for future use.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never find replacement bulbs for my favorite makeup mirror - these were perfect!  Only problem I had, and this was not a problem with the bulbs, was that the opening the mirror housing to replace these was a major pain.</li>
            <li> Replaced burned out bulbs.</li>
            <li> I glad I found these when I was shopping for a new mirror. I save $50.</li>
            <li> This is the light bulb that I needed for replacement in my lighted mirror.  Met my needs perfectly.  The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> These bulbs are the exact replacement for my mirror and were less expensive than what Conair was selling them for.</li>
            <li> Correct lightbulbs for con air mirror.  Shipped quickly came in one piece work well.  Everything was as I expected for the purchase</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and worked</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t write a review for something I&#x27;ve not yet used.  Bought for replacement purposed</li>
            <li> They burn out so quickly and are so expensive</li>
            <li> Good replacement. Work well</li>
            <li> The bulb blew within a week!!</li>
            <li> Makeup mirror is back in business!</li>
            <li> Picked this mirror up in a thrift store. It needed new light bulbs and these worked prefect.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the blue bulb. It doesn&#x27;t light up bright enough. Will not buy the pkg deal again. I will only get the clear as it does work great.</li>
            <li> The Conair website says i can use these bulbs for my BE51TX but they&#x27;re too big. So annoyed. The bulbs blew out on my mirror months ago. I went to the hardware store and got ones that fit, but basically exploded after less than a week. I finally go online and get the details and order these and now they&#x27;re just sitting on my night stand. Don&#x27;t know what to do with them. Maybe I should get the mirror that goes with these bulbs instead since the one i have is so hard to find replacements for.</li>
            <li> When the light bulb burned out in my makeup mirror, I thought I&#x27;d have to give notice where I work that I wouldn&#x27;t be in until I found a replacement bulb ... kidding! I really could not locate one locally where I live &amp; found it in less than 2 minutes on Amazon. It&#x27;s the exact same bulb that my Conair dual mirror takes. I ordered an extra package, just in case.</li>
            <li> I remember my mom having the lighted make up mirror in the 80&#x27;s.  I would put the settings on &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; and wonder what I had to look forward to in life.</li>
            <li> Item as described, the only thing I would suggest is that maybe they should provide instructions on which color light goes on which side...  I did find out by another consumer though.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery included BOTH light bulbs which you may not know that you need when ordering.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s mirror need a replacement bulb set so this worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I needed  for my Conair make-up mirror, however I did not put the blue bulb in. I decided to use 2 clear bulbs for better lighting. I think the blue bulb is used to get different lighting hues from different situations (office, daylight).</li>
            <li> exact replacement..works great</li>
            <li> The bulbs that came with the mirror are no longer available and these bulbs are the recommeded substitute.  They are way too bright and get very hot very quickly.  I&#x27;m almost afraid to use my mirror.  I&#x27;m searching now for a reasonably priced lighted makeup mirror and a good supply of replacement bulbs.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in Conair and will most likely go with another brand.</li>
            <li> My Conair make-up light is still working and I always go on Amazon to order the bulbs when they go up.  There is a blue one and a clear one which is exactly what was originally in the mirror.  Never had any trouble with the bulbs or delivery.</li>
            <li> I needed replacements bulbs for a makeup mirror and was happy to find the exact ones.</li>
            <li> delivered as advertised, expensive!</li>
            <li> Would have been happier if bulbs has lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lamps to replace burned out lamps in my bathroom mirror lamp.  the bulbs worked great in restoring the use.</li>
            <li> Used these are replacement bulbs for my make-up mirror.  Installed easily, work great.</li>
            <li> Fits, works as expected andd saves time running to the store. Gave only replaced 2 x in 6 years. Genuine com air product</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product, immediately installed it in my wifes mirror. I thought it would be brighter, Lighting seemed to be very dim.</li>
            <li> The product serves the purpose but I find that the blue tinted bulbs tend to burn out much quicker than the clear ones resulting in more clear spares. Is it possible to buy single blue bulbs?</li>
            <li> I had the Conair mirror that was &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; on/off. With replacement bulbs (even direct from Conair) it no longer operates that way. I now have to plug/unplug the mirror to turn it off and on. I think I will be getting a switch for the mirror (like one of those dimmer switches) so that I don&#x27;t have to keep reaching for the outlet. I saw reviewers that said their bulbs didn&#x27;t last. Mine has lasted so far, albeit with the routine of plugging in and unplugging. And it has always generated a lot of heat. In fact, I had to get these bulbs when I accidentally left my mirror light on all day.</li>
            <li> I thought the bulb would brighten and dim.</li>
            <li> worked perfectly in my mirror purchased from Sharper Image many years ago.  I was very pleased to find a replacement bulb.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Conair make-up mirror model BE47BR. The clear bulb works best, hopefully I can find a package that just sells the clear bulbs for future purchases.  I visited several hardware stores and could only find 15 Watts. Glad to see this is offered through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried to go to the Batteries + Bulbs store and they didn&#x27;t have anything comparable. These are great because the blue one is white/neutral light and the clear is the warmer light so depending on which you put in the dimming side of the mirror you can have either type of light. They work great and seem as bright or brighter than the originals</li>
            <li> order two packages and only received one.</li>
            <li> Work perfectly in the mirror I have</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to find replacement bulbs so I didn&#x27;t have to buy a new mirror.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition and on time. They were exactly what I needed for my Conair makeup mirror. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These fit my mirror perfect but I wish they were brighter.</li>
            <li> Came at speed time and worked great</li>
            <li> They work exactly like the originals at a far more economical price.&lt;br /&gt;Have rejuvinated my very expensive mirror at a low cost.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This two bulb are the exact replacement lights from my wife&#x27;s Conair markup mirrors.  When moms happy everyone is happy!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Products is as advertised  and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> works great but is higher wattage than my mirror.  Not all Conair mirrors use the same watt bulbs.  I am using but I just make sure not to leave on in case of overheating and fire.</li>
            <li> These blew very quickly. I purchased these to use in a aromatherapy salt lamp because the only 20 watt bulbs in this size I could find. They both blew within a month of use. The lamp was not left on continuely for the first bulb. The second bulb I left it on thinking the turning it on and off so much contributed to the first bulb blowing, which has been my experience with salt lamps. But could not tell that made a difference with the second bulb.</li>
            <li> I have a makeup mirror that I purchased over a year ago and the lights went out on it.  I looked everywhere locally and decided to look on Amazon.  Yea, they were exactly what I was looking for and since I could not find them near me I just ordered from Amazon.  They were even cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Just what you would expect.  Nothing fancy just a light bulb set for a mirror.  Works as expected, arrived in great shape.</li>
            <li> These worked great.  They came on time. They work great just as they said that they would.  Nice and bright a lot better than the ones that were burned out. lol</li>
            <li> The wife needed these for her makeup mirror and the only complaint I have is that I didn&#x27;t need the blue bulb but they force you to purchase the pair. FTR/ the old bulbs were 10w the new ones are 20w and run hotter.</li>
            <li> Thank you for putting this item on Amazon I could have called the manufacturer but I did not have to pay for shipping through Amazon. I can see again and just love my Conair mirror.</li>
            <li> THESE BULBS WORKED WONDERFULLY ON MY CONAIR MIRROR. HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE TYPES FOR A LONG TIME. I CAN NOW APPLY MY MAKE UP BETTER.</li>
            <li> I only needed the clear bulb from this set but liked that they came together so I would have an extra bulb when I needed it.  I bought two sets so that I could replace the clear bulb and still have an extra one along with the blue replacements.  They install great and work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Works well enough - not sure why there is a blue bulb in there, but it does the job.  I just hope it doesn&#x27;t burn out quickly because they are expensive to keep having to replace.</li>
            <li> These bulbs are too expensive and are not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Arrived completely shattered, I love the bulbs/mirror I have so I couldn&#x27;t give 1 star as the issue isn&#x27;t with Conair or the bulbs. I purchased in person and they last forever :)</li>
            <li> Yay I can see in my mirror again! If your light is not as bright as it used to be, check the bulbs. Usually one goes first and the other might last longer or be not far behind. But don&#x27;t wait till both go. Have this on hand so you won&#x27;t have to see properly as put your makeup on.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as described and before the promised delivery date.  My only gripe is that these bulbs are too expensive with shipping costs added in.  I cannot find the blue bulbs in the local stores and I&#x27;ve had to replace the blue bulb twice while the clear bulb continues to work.  It would be nice if these were sold in double packs of the blue bulbs only.</li>
            <li> They fit and they work.  When you pay a lot for a mirror you want to be able to get new bulbs when they burn out.  And you don&#x27;t find bulbs like this on the shelf next to your makeup mirror.  Amazon is certainly the most convenient way to go to get replacement bulbs.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, a fair price, and working like they should.  It has only been a couple of months, so I cannot comment on bulb life.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The light bulbs fit perfectly into my husband&#x27;s lighted mirror.  They worked well. I bought an extra set to keep on hand.  I am happy.</li>
            <li> These bulbs are easy to install and because they&#x27;re what the manufacturer recommends.  What could be better than renewing your mirror by &amp;#34;pushing a button&amp;#34; on Amazon.com and getting them delivered to your door?  My mirror is like new again with little effort on my part.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Very good buy, they were idental to the replaced bulbs, works well.</li>
            <li> Lasted about 2 days in a lamp.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my mirror.</li>
            <li> This was the only bulb I could find that fit my mirror, so the blue bulb is wasted.  The clear bulb doesn&#x27;t seen nearly as bright as the initial bulb that came in my mirror????</li>
            <li> Very happy with the service and the product!</li>
            <li> If you have a conair mirror these are the bulbs you need. I almost missed that one of them is supposed to be blue.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed for my older make up mirror.  Was not able to find them any place else.</li>
            <li> My wife was going to replace our vanity mirror when I discovered that I could replace the bulbs.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed! My mirror is working like new!!</li>
            <li> fits my dual side conair mirror and very bright</li>
            <li> If you order from Conair, S&amp;H is included in the $9.99 price.</li>
            <li> After pricing a NEW Conair makeup mirror, I realized it would be a lot cheaper to just replace the burned out bulb.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Fast service, just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Correct replacement bulbs...happy to find them!</li>
            <li> Only regret is that they only last about a year</li>
            <li> The bulbs arrived on time and in perfect condition.  They were easy to install and work great.  I am so happy to have my lighted mirror again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I thought a little pricey but had to order these online to get my makeup mirror to work again.&lt;br /&gt;Bulbs were just fine.</li>
            <li> Work great, and unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> works perfectly with my mirror</li>
            <li> they work and do the job.</li>
            <li> Ten bucks for two bulbs? I purchase these every so often for my wife&#x27;s makeup mirror. The last batch I bought the clear lasted about four seconds then quite, there goes five bucks. You could probably buy a clear night light bulb of the same wattage and get by, but I just bought the two new bulbs instead. Conair makes a nice mirror, and the lighting is good, but the replacement bulb price is ridiculous. If they charged $2.00 they would be making a huge profit.</li>
            <li> Bulbs were a perfect match and easy to replace one we got the dang mirror open!  Shopping quick.  Hope they last as long as the original ones.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here. these were the correct replacement part needed for my Conair double-sided mirror. Since they were made by the mirror&#x27;s manufacturer, I expected them to work fine and they do, so no problems there. They work exactly the same as the original part that came with the mirror and were super easy to replace - just took two tiny screws out of the mirror, popped in the bulbs and &amp;#34;reassembled&amp;#34;. done. easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has 4 different light settings each with a different intensity of light, and the bulbs do exactly what they&#x27;re designed to do which is to provide the different intensity of light based on the mirror setting.  I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly (magic? wizardry? who knows) but it does. I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last as I just put them in, but if I have any problems I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place could find the correct replacement bulbs for m Conair mirror.  These were and exact match.  I probably should have bought an extra set.  They saved me from having to buy a whole new mirror.</li>
            <li> Set is what is needed to replace burned out bulbs</li>
            <li> Perfect, as promised.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> Needed a replacement for my 10 year old make up mirror.  These bulbs did the trick and the price was right.</li>
            <li> They work great, just as the originals!</li>
            <li> Expensive for what they are... I don&#x27;t know what to do with the blue one. But they did reach me in a timely manner and they are what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Wish you could purchase just the clear one as that is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fits my old conair lighted make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding the blue tint bulb? Here it is.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my make-up mirror.  I had no idea these bulbs were so hard to find in a store!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in my make up mirror that is so old.</li>
            <li> I really only needed one of the two bulbs but at the price it made sense to buy it this way. Easy enough to order and replace and my wife&#x27;s mirror is back in business, It ain&#x27;t rocket science.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Delivery timeframe was met.</li>
            <li> These lights were the original replacements and the mirror has been working exactly like when it was first purchases.</li>
            <li> It came as described, and worked fine. No problems.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they are listed as replacements for the Conair makeup mirror model I have, but the white bulbs are so super bright compared to what originally was in the mirror.  They are literally blinding.  When a lower setting is on, only the blue comes on, and I can barely see myself (my mirror did not originally come with blue lights).  All other settings have the bright lights on (with or without the additional blue lights), and I&#x27;m blinded.  Too dark or blinded are basically the two settings I get.  I have to hold my hand over the light to partially block it so I can see what I&#x27;m doing, which defeats the purpose.  Don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; my mirror. To be able to replace the burnt out bulb saved an enormous amount of money versus having to buy a new mirror.</li>
