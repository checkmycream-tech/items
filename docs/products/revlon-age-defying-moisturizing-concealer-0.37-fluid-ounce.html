            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect here, but certainly this is the easiest concealer to use out there</li>
            <li>and you must set it with some kind of powder or</li>
            <li>It does not crease very matte perfect coverage blendable also can be use for highlights when contouring face.</li>
            <li>If you do your own make up take</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very light color.  </li>

            <li>my undereye area looks even better with just the colorstay liquid foundation.</li>

            <li>I love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I have used many cocealers but none have worked so well.</li>
            <li>This product is the best out there for a reasonable price and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Works fine under makeup or alone.  </li>
            <li>it did nothing but accentuate the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Works good, cakea a little more than my MAC but much more affordable!  </li>
            <li>It feels light but still does its job.</li>
            <li>prefer the maybelline fit me concealer.</li>
            <li>I was very upset when they discontinued it in the stores and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to pick the color that is right for your skin.</li>
            <li>It will not crease, it is super easy to apply &amp; blend.</li>
            <li>I have not tried concealer for more than $40 yet, and don&#x27;t exactly plan to, unless they give me a sample</li>
            <li>a great anti aging concealer doesn&#x27;t dry up, moisturizing</li>
            <li>I have very very fair skin and very very dark under eye circles, almost like I have been hit on both eyes.</li>
            <li>This one covers under eye circles to a 90% degree, and believe me this is the best one can get with serious under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Over 40, settles in fine lines making them more apparent.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping this would avoid the problem of settling into smile lines.</li>
            <li>it slides right</li>
            <li>It stays on for a good 8 hours, might need a little retouch at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Nothing looks more natural while also providing complete coverage when I have those zit days..</li>
            <li>Nice concealer for covering dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>You might need retouch after 8 hours, but if applied well, it looks super natural.</li>
            <li>Also, the NYX concealers are nice but have less coverage.</li>
            <li>The color selection is very limited and very light.</li>
            <li>Also, because of the creamy consistency of the concealer you can&#x27;t really use it anywhere else if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>i guess this will work for people who don&#x27;t have much to cover.</li>
            <li>Its a well made product, I really tip my hat to whoever create it.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast too .</li>
            <li>Apply a normal layer of primer to the whole under age area that you will cover.</li>
            <li>THIS product is so much better and for lots less.</li>
            <li>Forget it that darker shades for your skin tone will have better coverage, they will look odd.</li>
            <li>If it does collect on your fine lines, then a few minutes after it has dried, carefully with the flat side of the concealer brush, softly spread the excess out of the fine lines only, and in the same direction of the fine line, and voila, perfect coverage of those raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>In fact, just purchased and returned the highly touted Hourglass concealer.  </li>
            <li>In general you won&#x27;t need the loose powder, but it might give you more coverage time.</li>
            <li>It does, but only if you use it very, very sparingly, in which case you don&#x27;t get quite as much coverage.</li>
            <li>Did not care for this very much because it has a thick consistency; I prefer to use more liquid concealers for my under eye</li>
            <li>It sets on the delicate under eye skin amazingly well.</li>
            <li>So disappointed they discontinued this product, but so happy I can find it here!  </li>
            <li>:The texture is nice and creamy and doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines too badly, and I can see that it brightens the eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Soft strokes</li>
            <li>and then pat it gently where necessary to make it all even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old</li>
            <li>Long lasting foundations such as Revlon Colorstay cover pretty well my under eye circles, but they will crease and dry and produce fine lines that I don&#x27;t have, overall giving a none desired effect.</li>
            <li>I have managed to get an even better coverage by using primer (Physicians Formula), then a thin layer of ALMAY SMART SHADE ANTI AGING, and last REVLON AGE DEFYING.</li>
            <li>Forget about getting the look of magazine models that have absolutely no discoloration under their eyes, that&#x27;s a photoshop effect or very pro make up applied by a pro.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> When I apply this to under my eyes it doesn&#x27;t cake into the lines. I also have some hyperpigmentation that I apply it to and it seems to cover it well. It feels light but still does its job. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Nice concealer for covering dark circles under the eyes.  Works fine under makeup or alone.  Just be sure to pick the color that is right for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have the dark circle trifecta of allergies, heredity, and lack of sleep and am always looking for a miracle product to fix them. This wasn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:The texture is nice and creamy and doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines too badly, and I can see that it brightens the eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It causes non-waterproof eyeliner and mascara to bleed a little. The color selection is very limited and very light. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a medium coverage concealer and that&#x27;s only with layering and you must set it with some kind of powder or it slides right off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it just because I have nothing else at the moment, but I&#x27;m mixing it with my foundation to get it a little darker. Also, because of the creamy consistency of the concealer you can&#x27;t really use it anywhere else if you&#x27;re prone to breakouts. I had a little extra on my concealer brush one day and dabbed it on my chin. The next morning I had broken out in the exact spot where I put the concealer.</li>
            <li> It does not crease very matte perfect coverage blendable also can be use for highlights when contouring face. Theystop selling it at my drugstore was so depress about It decided to look here and Bingo! Found it  couldnt be happier oh by the way if you do photo shoots TRUST WHEN I SAY TAKE THIS WITH YOU,!  If you do your own make up take if not still bring it with you and tell them to apply no question ask just apply dammit! Divaa style!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this concealer did not work for me. So many people love it but so many people hate it too. If you are going to google some reviews online (makeupalley and youtube), you&#x27;ll see how people have a love and hate relationship with this concealer. some say it&#x27;s their HG concealer. well, I absolutely hate this concealer. it&#x27;s the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used under my eyes. it did nothing but accentuate the fine lines. didn&#x27;t cover at all. my undereye area looks even better with just the colorstay liquid foundation. i guess this will work for people who don&#x27;t have much to cover. I totally wasted my money on this one.</li>
            <li> This is on one of the best concealers I&#x27;ve ever used.  In fact, just purchased and returned the highly touted Hourglass concealer.  THIS product is so much better and for lots less.</li>
            <li> love this product.  I use it as a base for eyemakeup.  so disappointed its discontinued.  have not found another product like it.</li>
            <li> I have very very fair skin and very very dark under eye circles, almost like I have been hit on both eyes. Gray purplish color on the entire under eye area. I am 30, and before any foundation with staying power will do. Not anymore. Long lasting foundations such as Revlon Colorstay cover pretty well my under eye circles, but they will crease and dry and produce fine lines that I don&#x27;t have, overall giving a none desired effect. This product is the best out there for a reasonable price and looks very natural. I have not tried concealer for more than $40 yet, and don&#x27;t exactly plan to, unless they give me a sample and it covers to a 100% total perfection. This one covers under eye circles to a 90% degree, and believe me this is the best one can get with serious under eye circles. Forget about getting the look of magazine models that have absolutely no discoloration under their eyes, that&#x27;s a photoshop effect or very pro make up applied by a pro. This product has the best coverage for a DIY. I will try it with primer to see if I can get a 95% coverage. It will not crease, it is super easy to apply &amp; blend. It sets on the delicate under eye skin amazingly well. Its a well made product, I really tip my hat to whoever create it. A tiny tiny speck will do. I recommend to apply with a concealer brush (ecotools are great). Still, skillful application is the key, as is with any other make up. Soft strokes and then pat it gently where necessary to make it all even. Practice makes perfect here, but certainly this is the easiest concealer to use out there and you will get the hang of it soon. Get the color that best matches your skin tone. Forget it that darker shades for your skin tone will have better coverage, they will look odd. It stays on for a good 8 hours, might need a little retouch at the end of the day. I have tried countless other drugstore brands with terrible results, they wont cover well, they dry, they cake, they crease, extremely difficult to apply, won&#x27;t stay on, etc, even if you use all techniques possible for application, total waste of money. If you have under eye circles you know this drill already. If it does collect on your fine lines, then a few minutes after it has dried, carefully with the flat side of the concealer brush, softly spread the excess out of the fine lines only, and in the same direction of the fine line, and voila, perfect coverage of those raccoon eyes. If you must apply loose powder to set it if you have very very oily skin, do it lightly and softly and a little will do, and use a brush for LOOSE mineral powder, if you use too much it will dry and look bad. In general you won&#x27;t need the loose powder, but it might give you more coverage time. Experiment on what works better for your skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT UPDATE:For even better coverage get a primer. You won´t regret it. Apply primer 1st. I have managed to get an even better coverage by using primer (Physicians Formula), then a thin layer of ALMAY SMART SHADE ANTI AGING, and last REVLON AGE DEFYING. Apply a normal layer of primer to the whole under age area that you will cover. ALMAY &amp; REVLON use thin layers &amp; use a flat round tip brush to apply &amp; a little tiny bit of Mineral Loose Powder to set (apply with mineral brush, tap excess &amp; apply very softly, otherwise it will produce wrinkles). For me its the best coverage I have gotten. You might need retouch after 8 hours, but if applied well, it looks super natural. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Did not care for this very much because it has a thick consistency; I prefer to use more liquid concealers for my under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the maybelline fit me concealer. It has a beautiful liquid consistency with a decent amount of coverage and did not accentuate my under eyes lines/texture. Also, the NYX concealers are nice but have less coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. It&#x27;s not to heavy and it wears well through the day. I use it as my foundation. I was very upset when they discontinued it in the stores and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome concealer, super creamy and pigmented!!! I wish I could use it as a foundation it covers so well and does not cake. It makes me want to try the accompanying foundation because the concealer worked so well. A little goes a long way and I think this will last me along time.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Definitely would recommend this product to others. Arrived fast too . And is a great anti aging concealer doesn&#x27;t dry up, moisturizing</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would avoid the problem of settling into smile lines. It does, but only if you use it very, very sparingly, in which case you don&#x27;t get quite as much coverage. It&#x27;s also a very light color.  I ended up needing to blend it with a slightly darker color, and I&#x27;m rather pale.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer. I&#x27;m in my 40s and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> So disappointed they discontinued this product, but so happy I can find it here!  Nothing looks more natural while also providing complete coverage when I have those zit days..yuck! ;)</li>
            <li> Works good, cakea a little more than my MAC but much more affordable!  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used many cocealers but none have worked so well. It is moisturizing and it goes on smoothly. I&#x27;m 65 years old and when I used it to conceal mostly under my eyes it looks great. I have been told by my Doctor that he couldn&#x27;t believe I was 65. Oh, I have never ever had surgery. I&#x27;m not against either. Do try it.</li>
            <li> Over 40, settles in fine lines making them more apparent.  Still looking for the perfect concealer.</li>
