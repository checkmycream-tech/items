            <li>perfect and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>i have used PTR Camu Camu Serum for about 5 years and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good. :)</li>
            <li>I use the PTR Camu camu serum, sleeping mask and CC Cream and am loving all of them.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t notice a difference and when you spend that kind of money on a product you want to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin, it instantly brightens your skin and it feels like a healthy drink for your face!!</li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>As for fine lines and wrinkles, at my age they are still fairly unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Very light on you skin.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be a very good product</li>
            <li>Love Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li>Love serums.</li>
            <li>I do not feel this is the authentic product.</li>
            <li>This serum is okay.  </li>
            <li>I think there are better vitamin C serums out there for the money.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and the way it feel as it goes on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Works even better with Dermalight Spa Sonic</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, looks healthier, and I can&#x27;t find most of those fine lines.</li>
            <li>The product was very good but be warned the amount you are paying all those dollars for is not as listed on the jar, 50 ml...,you are only getting 30 ml.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs easily into the skin as well.</li>
            <li>It does help fine lines.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s great for the face and no breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>I know I will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>For not being a medical grade product, I am having great results.</li>
            <li>The overall look of my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have tried other high end brands but PRR is proven with best results.</li>
            <li>If miracles are what you want, than stick to medical grade skin peels and good ol&#x27; botox.</li>
            <li>I do not know how much longer I will be able to afford them</li>
            <li>It also smells very strongly of alcohol rather than the usual pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>The product is sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I have never been more satisfied with a facial moisturizer in my life</li>
            <li>If this was cheaper I might continue it because I do like how it feels on my skin, but I&#x27;m just not convinced it is worth it for the benefits I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>

            <li>but this product offers more.</li>
            <li>My old bottle had a nice orange scent the new bottle stunk like chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is designed when pushed, it delivers the right amount and fingers only touches the closed system top!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use sunscreen when you go outside after putting on this product.</li>
            <li>Because of all of these issues I&#x27;m pretty picky about the products I use and expect a lot from my skin care.  </li>
            <li>I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
            <li>I think pretty realistic expectations going in).  </li>
            <li>I think pretty realistic expectations going in).  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement by way of eliminating fine lines, but it definitely brightens my complexion and smooths my skin.</li>
            <li>It should be very watery, darker yellow with a light smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Camu Camu product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants smoother skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed much in the brightening department.  </li>
            <li>This product is not meant to erase wrinkles, as much as it is meant to brighten and tone the skin.</li>
            <li>I have VERY problematic skin.</li>
            <li>I wonder if this is the real stuff or not.  </li>
            <li>it has a different smell and makeup than the original.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this with the camu camu moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was very curious about its claims to brighten and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve used it consistently 2x a day for about a month and a half, I&#x27;m torn about whether or not I like this enough to find it worth the high price tag.  </li>
            <li>this product has clearly been altered.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t it will look clear and watery.</li>
            <li>To lend context, I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li>As far as the brightening goes, those results seem inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very please.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 35 year old guy and was given this by my girlfriend&#x27;s mother who thought it made her skin too oily.</li>
            <li>PTR also offers a PM Retinol serum I use at night.</li>
            <li>My old formula did not.</li>
            <li>I had the old bottle that I just used up and compared the smell .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results wise, the biggest thing I have been noticed is that my skin does seem to be noticeably less dry and irritated as compared to previous winters.  </li>
            <li>I expected a little more from this product.</li>
            <li>Here are some major differences:&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>This certainly wasn&#x27;t a benefit I expected to receive from this serum, but I will take it.  </li>
            <li>However, this product is doing a fantastic job of evening out my skin tone and brightening my dull completion.</li>
            <li>it has made itchy dry winter skin less of an issue, but I don&#x27;t feel like I consistently got the benefits of brightening</li>
            <li>This is a different consistency, different color, different (very intense and toxic) smell than what I usually get from Ulta.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a little over 2 months and have been pleasantly surprised at how well my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product--it has a little bit of a vitamin smell going on--but for only a few seconds</li>
            <li> It smells of alcohol and is clear (not light orange and fruity like it</li>
            <li> Previously, I had used various vitamin C products,but always found them too drying.  </li>
            <li> I thought it took longer than expected and not quite the results.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, in my opinion, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used almost everything on the market (very expensive products), to try to get my skin to look healthy and tight.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfield with it.  </li>
            <li> dark spots from my acne, dry skin and red spots - not a good look.</li>
            <li> Events out skin tone and lightens dark spots.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;be taken down..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive, dry and acne prone which can be a frustrating combination and in the winter time when the air is at its driest, it has a tendency to look dull even with a humidifier.</li>
            <li> I am usually very impatient when it comes to seeing results from products, and I notice a difference every single morning when i wake up.</li>
            <li> requested and received a full refund for this bad product.</li>
            <li> I suspect it was less expensive because it was extremely old.</li>
            <li> I wish I could remember who the seller was because this stuff was either really old or something was wrong.</li>
            <li> Color pale, smell alcohol, glu texture</li>
            <li> It stinks like chemicals and is much thicker than the stuff I usually get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase once my bottle is through.  </li>
            <li> usually is)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some days I swear my skin looks healthier and brighter, otherwise it looks just as dull as ever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced any skin care or beauty product lives up to that description, at least not for my skin issues.  </li>
            <li> It had a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed for the first time with anything I have ordered from Amazon in the past.</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad to know there are people out there selling false contents.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the bottle I got.</li>
            <li> This item was FAKE!  </li>
            <li> This one was thick like a gel and had a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> and I have terribly problematic skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It took about a week to see the results. Events out skin tone and lightens dark spots. The product is sticky and absorbs quickly. It also smells great like I want to eat the fruit. Overall, it&#x27;s great for the face and no breakouts at all. Just make sure you use sunscreen when you go outside after putting on this product.</li>
            <li> Very light on you skin. Great price!</li>
            <li> Try this perfect serum and within weeks you can see amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford the cream too you can use both as therapy during the winter time.</li>
            <li> Smooth application. I noticed smoothing of my skin after about 2 weeks. Nothing dramatic, but I did notice one day my skin looked smoother and move even.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It leaves your skin feeling great and is not oily at all.  I apply it every morning before my make up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this with the camu camu moisturizer. I use these 2 products every night and it has made a difference in my skin. My skins softer and my pores smaller.</li>
            <li> This was well sealed and looked like it would be good. It smelled like shellac.&lt;br /&gt;I checked with the Sephora staff, and they said if it smelled like that it was spoiled.&lt;br /&gt;When I checked with the Peter Thomas Roth website, it said any of their products on Amazon are counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;I requested and received a full refund for this bad product.</li>
            <li> I was persuaded to purchase this after a makeup artist used it to prep my skin before applying makeup.  To lend context, I&#x27;m 30 years old and I have terribly problematic skin. It&#x27;s sensitive, dry and acne prone which can be a frustrating combination and in the winter time when the air is at its driest, it has a tendency to look dull even with a humidifier. Because of all of these issues I&#x27;m pretty picky about the products I use and expect a lot from my skin care.  I was very curious about its claims to brighten and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve used it consistently 2x a day for about a month and a half, I&#x27;m torn about whether or not I like this enough to find it worth the high price tag.  I will say going in I didn&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle product.  I&#x27;m not convinced any skin care or beauty product lives up to that description, at least not for my skin issues.  The only things in my case that have made a substantial difference are prescription pills and creams for acne and facial peels at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and even those have only worked on breakouts, not the dullness I get in winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results wise, the biggest thing I have been noticed is that my skin does seem to be noticeably less dry and irritated as compared to previous winters.  (And this even as we are in the midst of one of the driest winters I can remember).  This certainly wasn&#x27;t a benefit I expected to receive from this serum, but I will take it.  As far as the brightening goes, those results seem inconsistent.  Some days I swear my skin looks healthier and brighter, otherwise it looks just as dull as ever.  As for fine lines and wrinkles, at my age they are still fairly unnoticeable.  Perhaps there was something subtle, but I haven&#x27;t really noticed major improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase once my bottle is through.  I do like that it has made itchy dry winter skin less of an issue, but I don&#x27;t feel like I consistently got the benefits of brightening I was hoping for (even with I think pretty realistic expectations going in).  If this was cheaper I might continue it because I do like how it feels on my skin, but I&#x27;m just not convinced it is worth it for the benefits I&#x27;ve seen.  I don&#x27;t regret my purchase, but I&#x27;m also not blown away either.brightening I was hoping for (even with I think pretty realistic expectations going in).

            <li> Love Vitamin C products. Heard a lot about Camu Camu. Only have had 2 days. Love serums. I know I will enjoy this product. As for Brightening. Can&#x27;;t tell yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this Camu Camu product.  Previously, I had used various vitamin C products,but always found them too drying.  This product does not dry-out my skin, and smells wonderful.  I think it&#x27;s a good value, as the amount of product is generous.</li>
            <li> This item was FAKE!  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Would not use anything else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a lower price. This product did not meet my expectations. It should have been a liquid and smell like oranges. This one was thick like a gel and had a terrible smell. I suspect it was less expensive because it was extremely old. Very disappointed for the first time with anything I have ordered from Amazon in the past.</li>
            <li> I do not feel this is the authentic product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever put on my skin, it instantly brightens your skin and it feels like a healthy drink for your face!! Love love love!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product--it has a little bit of a vitamin smell going on--but for only a few seconds and then it goes away--once on it fades into your skin and leaves a silky--not oily--feeling.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I expected a little more from this product. It does help fine lines. I thought it took longer than expected and not quite the results.  It does help</li>
            <li> i have used PTR Camu Camu Serum for about 5 years and LOVE it!  However the serum inside this last bottle i purchased from Larkin thru Amazon is NOT the same serum.  It smells of alcohol and is clear (not light orange and fruity like it usually is)&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this item and reporting to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The Peter Thomas Roth products are GREAT.  It&#x27;s sad to know there are people out there selling false contents.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. For the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it, it&#x27;s brightened, tightened, and smoothed my skin. Lines have almost disappeared. The smell is kinda funky, but it could smell like a foot and I&#x27;d still use it. It&#x27;s that good. :)</li>
            <li> This serum is okay.  I think there are better vitamin C serums out there for the money.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed much in the brightening department.  I won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> this product has clearly been altered. it has a different smell and makeup than the original.</li>
            <li> For not being a medical grade product, I am having great results. I have been using this product for a little over 2 months and have been pleasantly surprised at how well my skin looks. I use the PTR Camu camu serum, sleeping mask and CC Cream and am loving all of them. Again, I repeat, this is not a medical grade product so you can not expect miracles. If miracles are what you want, than stick to medical grade skin peels and good ol&#x27; botox. This product is not meant to erase wrinkles, as much as it is meant to brighten and tone the skin. And it does a great job of that.  I have VERY problematic skin. Acne, lots of hyper-pigmentation/dark spots from my acne, dry skin and red spots - not a good look. However, this product is doing a fantastic job of evening out my skin tone and brightening my dull completion. I am usually very impatient when it comes to seeing results from products, and I notice a difference every single morning when i wake up. My skin is bright, moisturized and toned. The overall look of my skin has greatly improved. I love the way it smells and the way it feel as it goes on. Absorbs easily into the skin as well. Overall, very please.</li>
            <li> I love it, this is the second purchased.</li>
            <li> The content of this product is entirely different from the same product I bought in store. Here are some major differences:&lt;br /&gt;  Online Product: Color pale, smell alcohol, glu texture&lt;br /&gt;  In-Store product: color orange (the same color as the bottle), smell fruity, watery texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have returned my purchase and reported the issue to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check your purchase and if in doubt, go to any physical stores who sell PTR Camu Camu to compare.</li>
            <li> This is a different consistency, different color, different (very intense and toxic) smell than what I usually get from Ulta. It should be very watery, darker yellow with a light smell. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
            <li> The product was very good but be warned the amount you are paying all those dollars for is not as listed on the jar, 50 ml...,you are only getting 30 ml.  This is fraudulent .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel,like  I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old guy and was given this by my girlfriend&#x27;s mother who thought it made her skin too oily. However, I have never been more satisfied with a facial moisturizer in my life and I have oily skin to begin with. Before this I bought whatever was at Target, but now I only buy this line.I use the Camu Camu moisturizer and this serum daily and my face is brighter and tighter. I grew up at the beach and surfed for years so I&#x27;ve got sun damage but after a month of using this much of that improved; sun spots, uneven tone, ect.. It is expensive, in my opinion, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff reminds me of Ole Henriksen Truth Serum. It&#x27;s a citrus-scented serum enriched with vitamin C. I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement by way of eliminating fine lines, but it definitely brightens my complexion and smooths my skin. It&#x27;s way overpriced, though, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have tried other high end brands but PRR is proven with best results. I always use vitamin C but this product offers more. I am out in the sun every day because of this product I have no sun damage, spots or wrinkles. I also use the moisturizer that goes with it. PTR also offers a PM Retinol serum I use at night. These are the only products I use and need. I am 51 and owe great skin to these products.</li>
            <li> perfect and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth!  Love the fact that it is designed when pushed, it delivers the right amount and fingers only touches the closed system top!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be a very good product and I will recommend it, the only thing Peter Thomas Roth products are very&lt;br /&gt;expensive  I do not know how much longer I will be able to afford them but they are very good products the prices needs to&lt;br /&gt;be taken down.. That would be great thank you</li>
            <li> Love this!! To the customer who said it is watery. You have to shake it before use. If you don&#x27;t it will look clear and watery. If you do, it will be thicker and orange in appearance. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I just didn&#x27;t notice a difference and when you spend that kind of money on a product you want to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Works even better with Dermalight Spa Sonic</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  This is my second bottle I purchased.  I am extremely satisfield with it.  I seems to take the redness off my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the bottle I got. It stinks like chemicals and is much thicker than the stuff I usually get. I wish I could remember who the seller was because this stuff was either really old or something was wrong. It had a thick consistency. My old formula did not. I had the old bottle that I just used up and compared the smell . My old bottle had a nice orange scent the new bottle stunk like chemicals. I definitely got ripped off on this purchase. I will not buy this online again.</li>
            <li> Not at all. It was different in texture, a sticky rather than fluid liquid. It also smells very strongly of alcohol rather than the usual pleasant fragrance. I wonder if this is the real stuff or not.  Very disappointed n puzzled. Why?</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used almost everything on the market (very expensive products), to try to get my skin to look healthy and tight. After only a day or two, I know this is the product for me. My skin is smoother, looks healthier, and I can&#x27;t find most of those fine lines.</li>
