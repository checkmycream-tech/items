    <ol>
            <li>Great eyelash extension glue.</li>
            <li>I, and my clients, have experienced with eyelash extensions.  </li>
            <li>Lots of money for not so good product.</li>
            <li>I love this glue and so does my clients!</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>But not bad for $20 good glue ...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh out of the factory semi-permanent eyelash extensions glue!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to do it yourself with way better results.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 days most lashes have came off(getting out of shower and lightly daubbing eyes/</li>
            <li>the fumes is SUPER strong!</li>
            <li>When removal is needed it is also easy to remove</li>
            <li>The bonding time is quick and the hold is okay.</li>
            <li>I also use conditioner on my lashes to keep them semi soft, just some good ole vaseline will work.  </li>
            <li>I was surprise on how quick delivery was.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was quick drying time</li>
            <li>Fantastic glue that dries very fast.....</li>
            <li>Honestly, I am hesitant to put anything that may burn a client if it touches the skin, simply because these are suppose to go on eyelashes.</li>
            <li>so you have to be pretty quick</li>
            <li>when they say, you have to balance out if you think the pain you endure is worth beautiful, long lasting lashes!</li>
            <li>and then the glue turned into watery mess I can&#x27;t even use still in search of a good glue</li>
            <li>The only thing is, good glue is ESSENTIAL!  </li>
            <li>I generally like blink products but this Advanced Tech Ultra</li>
            <li>Very well but shelf life is bout 4 mo.</li>
            <li>How much is glue remover?</li>
            <li>The drying time is so fast...</li>
            <li>Glue bonds very well</li>
            <li>This glue is amazing and usually lasts me 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>High fumes &amp; irritation.</li>
            <li>dries quick and holds for a long time.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, long lasting you can even swim and jacuzzi!</li>
            <li>Always try to use items that are sensitive.</li>
            <li>This glue is not for those who have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>i am a licensed professional</li>
            <li>This product is unusable do not waste your money</li>
            <li>They are the worst when you first open the bottle and use it the first couple times when its most potent.  </li>
            <li>I know this breaks down the glue but hard eyelashes kind of hurt.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but the fumes can still cause extreme irritation after they open them.</li>

            <li> Blink products have been great for me, this product was the worst I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This was the most painful experience</li>

            <li> Her eyes were closed.</li>
            <li> And the glue doesn&#x27;t stick, very loose.</li>
            <li> DOES BURN FOR A FEW SECONDS FOLLOWING APPLICATIONS.</li>
            <li> like this glue but not good on people who has sensitive</li>
            <li> My client preferred the other glue as well, because she could smell it too.</li>
            <li> So, the first time I used it, I had burning and painful eyes for an entire day.  </li>
            <li> Drying time is not quick at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using fake eyelashes for a long time and I used different type of glues in the past.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS BLACK EYELASH GLUE FOR OVER A YEAR!  </li>
            <li> Not a strong glue.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to use this product because it burned my eye just putting couple eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the the fumes are crazy.  </li>
            <li> NO THANKS!!!!!</li>
            <li> but it stays on for like a month, seriously.  </li>
            <li> but I have never been so unhappy about a single product.  </li>
            <li> it gave me the worst case of allergies and did not last very long.</li>

            <li> This product is terrible!</li>

            <li> Great eyelash extension glue. dries quick and holds for a long time.</li>
            <li> High fumes &amp; irritation. Clients must keep eyes closed at all times but the fumes can still cause extreme irritation after they open them. Honestly, I am hesitant to put anything that may burn a client if it touches the skin, simply because these are suppose to go on eyelashes. Regardless of how much of an expert you are, there will be small moments were you may accidentally get a tiny bit on your client. Always try to use items that are sensitive. This glue is not for those who have sensitive eyes. The bonding time is quick and the hold is okay.</li>
            <li> Fantastic glue that dries very fast.....</li>
            <li> This not only burned my eyes it gave me the worst case of allergies and did not last very long. All my lashes fell off in a week</li>
            <li> This product gave two people allergic reactions and they lashes didn&#x27;t last longer than 3 days. Blink products have been great for me, this product was the worst I have ever had. Will not purchase it ever again.</li>
            <li> Very well but shelf life is bout 4 mo. But not bad for $20 good glue ... How much is glue remover?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  The drying time is so fast...so you have to be pretty quick but it stays on for like a month, seriously.  The only down side is that the the fumes are crazy.  They are the worst when you first open the bottle and use it the first couple times when its most potent.  After a few uses, it is not as bad, but literally after the first time, my eyes sting for a good few hours.</li>
            <li> I generally like blink products but this Advanced Tech Ultra Plus one smells terrible. I like the regular version glue with less fumes. I ordered this to save glue drying time; this is supposed to dry faster than then regular version. My client preferred the other glue as well, because she could smell it too.</li>
            <li> Fumes made my eyes water for an hour! I used it in a well ventilated room with a fan going and my eyes watered for a  hour because the fumes burned so bad!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible! It STINGS badly and the fumes is SUPER strong! My client couldn&#x27;t stop tearing up and the stinging took 1 hour to go away.  Her eyes were closed. And the glue doesn&#x27;t stick, very loose. 1-2 sec dry time&#x3D;LIE!&lt;br /&gt;I am a salon owner. I do lashes for Ethnic customers daily.</li>
            <li> Not a strong glue.  Drying time is not quick at all.</li>
            <li> I was surprise on how quick delivery was.&lt;br /&gt;I like this glue but not good on people who has sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It was quick drying time</li>
            <li> Very fresh out of the factory semi-permanent eyelash extensions glue! I love this glue and so does my clients! Easy to apply, long lasting you can even swim and jacuzzi! When removal is needed it is also easy to remove I recommend using the cream form of removal as it does not burn or irritate the client.</li>
            <li> I have been using fake eyelashes for a long time and I used different type of glues in the past. I was not able to use this product because it burned my eye just putting couple eyelashes. That was my experience with the product I will not use it again.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS BLACK EYELASH GLUE FOR OVER A YEAR!  MY LASHES STAY ON 6-8 WEEKS!  AMAZING PRODUCT.  DOES BURN FOR A FEW SECONDS FOLLOWING APPLICATIONS.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recomment using this in yourself. Has a very strong odor. It made my nose and eyes run and also gave me a headache. Glue bonds very well, I just have to find a method that works so I can use this on myself when I apply my mink lashes.</li>
            <li> This glue kept my lashes in for 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I starting out in the eyelash business i am a licensed professional this glue seemed to burny clients eyes and then the glue turned into watery mess I can&#x27;t even use still in search of a good glue this is not it !!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I have never been so unhappy about a single product.  This was the most painful experience I, and my clients, have experienced with eyelash extensions.  This product is unusable do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Doesnt hold lashes at all. Within 2 days most lashes have came off(getting out of shower and lightly daubbing eyes/lashes NO WIPING and they still come off)  Lots of money for not so good product.</li>
            <li> This product smells like super-glue and burns like crazy. I couldn&#x27;t even get the lash on, it was burning too bad. NO THANKS!!!!!</li>
            <li> This burn my eyes like crazy. I have to return this.</li>
            <li> I almost returned this glue...but I gave it a second chance.  I wear extensions and it&#x27;s so easy to do it yourself with way better results.  The only thing is, good glue is ESSENTIAL!  So, the first time I used it, I had burning and painful eyes for an entire day.  So painful.  The next time I used it, I used a blow dryer to get the fumes away from my eyes and that is definitely the trick!  This glue is amazing and usually lasts me 4 weeks.  I also use conditioner on my lashes to keep them semi soft, just some good ole vaseline will work.  I know this breaks down the glue but hard eyelashes kind of hurt.  I have to exchange one evil for another.  I agree with the others on their review when they say, you have to balance out if you think the pain you endure is worth beautiful, long lasting lashes!</li>
