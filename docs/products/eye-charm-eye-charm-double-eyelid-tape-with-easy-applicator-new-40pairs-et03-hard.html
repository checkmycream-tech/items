            <li> double, I wanted to make the single match my double, and it&#x27;s already almost there!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that when you put the tape on, it doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> but they made the shape of her eyes look very strange.</li>
            <li> I have one single eyelid and one</li>
            <li> Not double-sided, so it was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Watch what you order and read everything carefully.</li>
            <li> Of course it must be applied carefully and removed just as carefully.</li>
            <li> The thin ones don&#x27;t help because my eyelids are too heavy and go right over them.  </li>
            <li> For me is not very work，I &#x27;m hidden eyelids .but</li>
            <li> The hard strips hold my eyelids in place and last a lot longer.    </li>
            <li> Took me about a half hour to do both eyes</li>
            <li> What a waste of money; virtually no instructions and the tapes are SO flimsy that they break apart no matter</li>
            <li> I am a white girl and thought maybe i&#x27;d find some anciet korean secret here...</li>
            <li> This was also a waste of money for me too.</li>
            <li> This tape didn&#x27;t work for me because the height and width were both way too small for my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and they are verrryyyy hard to put on.</li>
            <li> But she didn&#x27;t like the way they looked and how hard they are to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally regret it, shipping costs a lot, and very late delivery</li>
            <li> I recommend these over the thin ones.  </li>
            <li> Although I continue to recommend these strips because they do work, the price listed here is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but without having hooded eyes, they basically made me look creepy.</li>

            <li> It works really good for me.  I have been trying a lot of products, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> This is very goood item but my eyelid got burn and cut.  I think this item is good for young age to fix eyes.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money; virtually no instructions and the tapes are SO flimsy that they break apart no matter how gently you attempt to handle them.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> These hard strips work pretty good.  The thin ones don&#x27;t help because my eyelids are too heavy and go right over them.  The hard strips hold my eyelids in place and last a lot longer.    I recommend these over the thin ones.  Update -  Although I continue to recommend these strips because they do work, the price listed here is way too expensive.  I found the same product with cheaper prices on ebay.</li>
            <li> the product was delivered on time.  The tapes fit perfectly on the creases of my eyes to create bigger eye effect</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I have a double lid and a triple lid.  I bought this product in anticipation that I would be able to blend my triple lid into a double.  This tape didn&#x27;t work for me because the height and width were both way too small for my eyes.  The tape barely covered 25% of my triple lid and the excess skin just folded right over it without any difficulties.  If you have any suggestions for a product that would work for larger eyes, let me know!</li>
            <li> I am a white girl and thought maybe i&#x27;d find some anciet korean secret here... but without having hooded eyes, they basically made me look creepy. So for anyone just looking to be experimental... don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product very much, but the price just DOUBLED, so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Pros - cheap, and works as described.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - very visible, would be better if more transparent.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This tape is only sticky on one side!!!! How is it supposed to stick two sides of the eyelid to create a double?!?!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 pieces of this! And now what am i supposed to do with them?!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally regret it, shipping costs a lot, and very late delivery</li>
            <li> Having not a lot of experience with an ytype of double eye makers, this was my first. The tape arrived before expected and it was in great shape. It&#x27;s just that when you put the tape on, it doesn&#x27;t stay on long and it&#x27;s really noticable.</li>
            <li> makes your eyes beautiful and it&#x27;s long-standing, can wear over night for sure. I don&#x27;t know if it really is, but it does not get loose after I sweated.</li>
            <li> good～ For me is not very work，I &#x27;m hidden eyelids .but it&#x27;s ok～maybe regular is better～～～～My item is marked as delivered but is not in my mail.I think it lost ,bt next day usps send it to me</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom to help open her eyes back up and they are verrryyyy hard to put on. Took me about a half hour to do both eyes but they made the shape of her eyes look very strange. However they did open her eyes up. But she didn&#x27;t like the way they looked and how hard they are to apply.</li>
            <li> Does not work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to put on and hard to see. You end up scrunch it trying to put it on</li>
            <li> Not double-sided, so it was a complete waste of money! Did absolutely nothing for me. No instructions for application included with the item. I should have read the reviews!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend since she wanted to try it, and she LOVES it. Excellent product! Even tho she didn&#x27;t need to wear this stuff Lol.</li>
            <li> If you read the description, which I obviously didn&#x27;t do carefully enough... this is NOT double-sided eyelid tape... which is the only type that works. This product&#x27;s description simply reads: Double Eyelid tape. Watch what you order and read everything carefully. This was also a waste of money for me too.</li>
            <li> Great product! Can already see my eyelid shaping up for the better and don&#x27;t even need to have the tape on every day. I have one single eyelid and one double, I wanted to make the single match my double, and it&#x27;s already almost there! Of course it must be applied carefully and removed just as carefully. I saw a lot of improvement in myself, very simple item, and very cheap. Very happy with this!</li>
            <li> they very visible.. not a fan!</li>
