            <li>, awesome stuff.  </li>
            <li>hours+ is a wonderful addition to the cologne collection, gentlemen.</li>
            <li>Awesome cologne, good dam stuff for the price...</li>
            <li>Great price, and a great seller.</li>
            <li>They also feature a matching body wash that smells great in the shower but</li>
            <li>He loves the Cologne and I find it very nice as well.  </li>
            <li>great price smell good</li>
            <li>Heck, it&#x27;s just good stuff period, regardless of the price.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the size.. very nice scent.. smells something like Escada Sentiment for Men if you&#x27;re familiar with that cologne</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s put it this way, if this stuff was in a bottle labled &amp;#34;lacoste&amp;#34; you&#x27;d gladly pay $90 or so for it, honestly it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular in colognes, but this smells great.</li>
            <li>Large quantity for a great price.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this for me for Christmas, and after wearing it for a week, I bought more in bulk in case it ever get&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful scent that evaporates far too quickly after application.  </li>
            <li>Better price than Bath &amp; Body Works, and it has a great masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Great lingering soft manly wodsy cologne</li>
            <li>Got to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>A clean and refreshing scent to stay on where sprayed for 12</li>
            <li>Scent is a bit strong...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as Escada (which is good).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something light and sporty though, this is not the scent you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li>Good value buying it from Amazon instead of directly from B&amp;BW</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good buy, especially here.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick, and it&#x27;s quite a bit cheaper than at the store.</li>
            <li>Dark Amber wears well on both men and women - yet it is &amp;#34;PH-balanced for men (just kidding).&amp;#34; It smells great on me</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ll say about it is that it is a dense rich sweet scent (to me</li>
            <li>Nice smelling cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I found that I enjoyed Dark Amber quite a bit.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Very masculine.</li>
            <li>Almost like a sweet molasses or something, subtle, very masculine, clean, &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li>You really have to spray it on to have any lasting effects.</li>
            <li>I went to Bath and Body Works to sample their colognes, in search of an inexpensive cologne that smelled good enough for my casual days.</li>

            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I get compliments when I wear it but be advised that the scent only lasts, at least on me, about 3-4 hours before it needs to be refreshed</li>
            <li> I wanted to get it on sale in the store for black friday, but it didnt go on sale!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to using it as a bathroom air freshener, sadly.</li>

            <li> Smells amazing. Large quantity for a great price.</li>
            <li> A friend of my son recommended this product, therefore at my son&#x27;s request I purchased it for him.  He loves the Cologne and I find it very nice as well.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>

            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend this year and he loves it ! I wanted to get it on sale in the store for black friday, but it didnt go on sale! Great price, and a great seller. Got to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne, good dam stuff for the price... Heck, it&#x27;s just good stuff period, regardless of the price.

If you&#x27;re looking for something light and sporty though, this is not the scent you&#x27;re looking for.  This is the one you put on before a date.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cologne for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very masculine. been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent that evaporates far too quickly after application.  I&#x27;ve taken to using it as a bathroom air freshener, sadly.</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>

I&#x27;m very particular in colognes, but this smells great. Almost like a sweet molasses or something, subtle, very masculine, clean, &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li> PROMPT DELIVERY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Good value for the size.. very nice scent.. smells something like Escada Sentiment for Men if you&#x27;re familiar with that cologne but it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong as Escada (which is good). I get compliments when I wear it but be advised that the scent only lasts, at least on me, about 3-4 hours before it needs to be refreshed, I guess that&#x27;s why they sell it in such a big bottle! Get one for office and one for home and you should be covered. They also feature a matching body wash that smells great in the shower but again doesn&#x27;t really last that long (the scent that is). Good value buying it from Amazon instead of directly from B&amp;BW (although mine shipped in a B&amp;BW box). Try the matching body spray too.</li>
            <li> Great lingering soft manly wodsy cologne</li>
            <li> Better price than Bath &amp; Body Works, and it has a great masculine scent. My husband gets lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, unfortunately it disappears after an hour or two. You really have to spray it on to have any lasting effects.</li>
            <li> Dark Amber wears well on both men and women - yet it is &amp;#34;PH-balanced for men (just kidding).&amp;#34; It smells great on me and I am a manly-man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it reminds me of amber, which is what I sought after. A clean and refreshing scent to stay on where sprayed for 12 hours+ is a wonderful addition to the cologne collection, gentlemen. It turns heads and causes inquiries regarding brand name.</li>
            <li> My huband go this as a gift from bath and body works.. Loves it.. Cant find it in the stores anymore.. So ordered it here!!</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit strong...a little goes a long way.</li>
