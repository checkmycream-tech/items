            <li>Love this bronzer.</li>

            <li>Good product and fast delivery ty</li>
            <li>This bronzer was shipped and delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This color is perfect and the depth is really easy to dial up or dial down by layering it.    </li>
            <li>It gives a light tan look with no sweat steaks.</li>
            <li>I realize alot of people want to avoid the reddish undertone but this is a healthy glowing color that really makes it look believable...     </li>
            <li>I mix it with my moisturizer and it goes on flawlessly and gives me a soft, golden glow reminiscent of a day at the beach.  </li>
            <li>Does not give much of a tan, more like sunburn look</li>
            <li>I find it VERY easy to apply and it leaves a very natural tan - not orange at all.  </li>
            <li>Especially on an older woman&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Jb</li>
            <li>Start by applying sparingly and blend quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice color- 2 pack of dark bronze is a better value</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, with a natural looking result -  Better than most other such bronzers,  after much searching was Delighted to&lt;br /&gt;find</li>
            <li>so I need to make sure it looks natural.    </li>
            <li>I use it every days and it completely evens skin tone with a healthy reddish tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sheer, light, and gives a healthy glow and definition to cheeks.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this, but the color really didn&#x27;t even show up?...</li>
            <li>Looks natural on and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll def wash it off at the end of the day, but it&#x27;s a natural non-orange-y light brown</li>
            <li>Comfortable - not heavy</li>
            <li>only makeup i use now love it</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly, has a rich and deep golden tan, is non greasy, and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>you can certainly wear it solo, but if you wanted to do bronzer, then foundation</li>
            <li>- really wish they carried it.</li>
            <li>Really like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>so this takes a couple of minutes to really &#x27;soak in&#x27;</li>
            <li>So light and sheer.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other bronzer. :)</li>
            <li>When I was way younger, I used to use Bonne Bell products as they were available nearly everywhere, not so anymore.  </li>
            <li>I love Bonne Bell Bronze gel, but it is becoming difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally recommend a Bonne Bell product, but I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 15 years and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair and don&#x27;t need or like a lot of makeup -- have been using this product for at least 20 years daily.</li>
            <li>I also believe this is the exact same product as Clarins Mens bronzers at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t cake, it just adds that sunkissed glow and looks so natural!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tons of different bronzers over the years - Nars, Bobbi Brown, Clinique - pricey expensive bronzers and in my opinion none of them are as beautiful or natural looking as Bonne Bell.  </li>
            <li>I am finding hard to find as a lot of stores do not carry any more, so</li>
            <li>yet I cant find it in any of the stores near me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a natural sun look.</li>
            <li>Nothing compares for a natural looking sun kissed complexion.</li>
            <li>It is as good as the expensive department store bronzers.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong its a nice like temporary &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; for your cheeks</li>

            <li> Nice color- 2 pack of dark bronze is a better value</li>
            <li> I am a guy who uses this so I need to make sure it looks natural.    This is a gift from the bronzing gods. I use it every days and it completely evens skin tone with a healthy reddish tan.

I also believe this is the exact same product as Clarins Mens bronzers at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer.  It doesn&#x27;t come off on clothing so I use it even in winter for a nice healthy look.</li>

            <li> Love this. I&#x27;m looking fir the dark blend one.</li>
            <li> This is my standby for spring &amp; summer foundation. I LOVE it!!! It gives a light tan look with no sweat steaks. Also, i have a pink undertone &amp; it&#x27;s hard to find the right foundation. Thinking about using it all year round.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product at all, would send back but threw away packaging!</li>
            <li> really was terrible, colored my skin red, no matter how many layers it said to put on, really don&#x27;t recommend it. Jergens or even a tarte body bronze lotion thing would be much better and more effective. Don&#x27;t get me wrong its a nice like temporary &amp;#34;blush&amp;#34; for your cheeks but if u are looking for the olivey skin that i was going for - definitely not for you.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite bronzer for years. It goes on quickly, has a rich and deep golden tan, is non greasy, and looks completely natural. When I use this my friends tell me I have a gorgeous glow! I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other bronzer. :)</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying two.  Ver expensive site.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this drugstore bronzer forever.  I mix it with my moisturizer and it goes on flawlessly and gives me a soft, golden glow reminiscent of a day at the beach.  It doesn&#x27;t cake, flake, or clog your pores.  It is as good as the expensive department store bronzers.  Five stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, with a natural looking result -  Better than most other such bronzers,  after much searching was Delighted to&lt;br /&gt;find it here on Amazon. com !</li>
            <li> so this takes a couple of minutes to really &#x27;soak in&#x27; I found... you can certainly wear it solo, but if you wanted to do bronzer, then foundation you&#x27;ll want to give it a sec... otherwise I really liked it.... it&#x27;s not &#x27;build-able&#x27; as in... you&#x27;ll def wash it off at the end of the day, but it&#x27;s a natural non-orange-y light brown</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this, but the color really didn&#x27;t even show up?...</li>
            <li> Love it...have been using it for many years. Can&#x27;t go wrong getting it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! This is one of those MUST have items yet I cant find it in any of the stores near me. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive products when this beats all others!!! It&#x27;s been a staple item in my makeup bag for years!!</li>
            <li> It stains your fingers red, not very impressed with it.  Does not give much of a tan, more like sunburn look</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t received it yet, but have used it forever, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a natural sun look. Especially on an older woman&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Jb</li>
            <li> When I was way younger, I used to use Bonne Bell products as they were available nearly everywhere, not so anymore.  I particularly love this bronzer because it&#x27;s a gel, it doesn&#x27;t cake, it just adds that sunkissed glow and looks so natural!  I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this bronzer as a blush in winter and all over bronzer in summer for over 30 years.  Works with just moisturizer or over foundation as well. Start by applying sparingly and blend quickly. Can be layered for more color or depth. Nothing compares for a natural looking sun kissed complexion.</li>
            <li> This bronzer was shipped and delivered very quickly.  I find it VERY easy to apply and it leaves a very natural tan - not orange at all.  I have not had any problems with streaking or spotting as I do with a body bronzer that I use.  Also, you can keep applying the product for a deeper tan, with great results.  I do want to mention that this is NOT water proof, so if you eyes happen to be tearing up from allergies, skip the bronzer or you&#x27;ll wind up with streaks.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 25 years, and can not find in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;just a dab will do ya&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Comfortable - not heavy</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer. So light and sheer.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery ty</li>
            <li> only makeup i use now love it</li>
            <li> this is my favorite colour gel, I put on a moisturizer and then pat on this and it makes me look like I have a tanned face. The gel just sinks in and you do not feel it on you skin, I have used this for years as I don&#x27;t like the feel of foundation and now have my sisters and a co worker using too. I am finding hard to find as a lot of stores do not carry any more, so thank goodness for Amazon, I seem to find things on here that I can&#x27;t find any where else.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected!</li>
