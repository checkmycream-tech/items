            <li>The application of the polishes were wonderful as you can expect with OPI polishes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s not a girly girl, so these colors are perfect for her.</li>
            <li>Great OPI mini deal!</li>
            <li>I heard the best things of Opi nail polish, that is also what they used on me in a nail bar</li>
            <li>that applied a thousand times better!!!!</li>
            <li>Great gift!  </li>
            <li>I have used all four of the colors in this set and they are great!</li>
            <li>The kid really loved it and the colors are awesome.  </li>
            <li>She was happy with the gift</li>
            <li>I could see it being an excellent fall/winter color for sure.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Spotted the Lizard\\&quot; because I loved the duochomatic effect of the green-yellow and \\&quot;Into</li>
            <li>I went to and loved it.</li>
            <li>but I actually loved all of the colors.</li>
            <li>liked the pink-coral one, very nice tone, but also</li>
            <li>Great item for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a product of an even better quality with OPI, so I was not too happy about this polish set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cute.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I opted for the mini bottles as the colors didn&#x27;t look as good on my nails as I thought they would.  </li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for a friend and she liked it.</li>
            <li>Colors seem very pretty, and the box itself is very nicely done for Spiderman fans.  </li>
            <li>Item came so quickly!!</li>
            <li>customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I recently gifted this to my sister-in-law, mostly as a joke because my brother LOVES Spiderman.  </li>
            <li>Maybe he&#x27;ll get HIS nails done!  :-)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister who loves spiderman and the colors are so cute</li>
            <li>This will be a favorite for sure</li>
            <li>I recommend 2 or more coats to get the most out of the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY unique.  </li>
            <li>We especially love how they&lt;br /&gt;appear to change colors in different light.</li>
            <li>They go in very well and have a good pigmintation.</li>
            <li>The quality of the polish is as one would expect from an OPI product -- longlasting, easy appication...</li>
            <li>so I had to put more coats than normal but the colors were really nice.</li>
            <li>Loved the mini bottles because I dont go through a whole bottle, and I got to try 4 colors for about the price of 1 full size bottle</li>
            <li>her it gave her super powers :)&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a great way to see if you want the larger bottles.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li>These colors are so pretty and interesting.</li>
            <li>What a fun collection!</li>
            <li>son.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it, the colors are unique and sparkly and something outside of the norm for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It changes from a green to gold tint depending on the light and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the colors on my nails as much as I did in the bottle.</li>
            <li>As a big fan of Spiderman as well, I loved that OPI was involved in creating a set of colors for the newest film.</li>
            <li>I never use up a full sized nail polish bottle</li>
            <li>I never go through nail polish quickly, so when I discovered the option of OPI minis</li>
            <li>/&gt;Was not expensive but would not re-order!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun set.  </li>
            <li>enough in each bottle for 1 nice coat, maybe 2 depending.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I had originally brought this set because there were two colors that I really wanted but couldn&#x27;t talk myself into spending ~20 for two bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li>so I always start chipping within a few days, but these colors do look beautiful and rich while they last.</li>
            <li>This particular set has really nice colors, especially this shimmery green/black/gold color.  </li>
            <li>Everything was a 2 coater except for Into the Night which took 3 (it was more sheer than the others).  </li>
            <li>So I settled for the smaller set with more colors, because I was a big fan of variety in colors rather than more of one color.</li>
            <li>be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>packaged, exactly as described by seller</li>
            <li>The green is GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>Especially the goldish green one... very unique! :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s attracted to multiple shades in the collection and don&#x27;t want to spend tons of money buying them separately :)</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s just too generic of a bright, summer pink.</li>
            <li>I was really attracted to \\&quot;Just</li>
            <li>I thought as I thought and very metallic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really bought this set for</li>
            <li>; color, it is my absolute FAVE</li>
            <li>OPI is a good brand and this set offers enough variety to where you can try out different colors but still get quality.</li>
            <li>The pink is just a very pretty shade, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw the OPI Spiderman collection at my local Ulta.  </li>
            <li>But I eventually fell in love with the other two colors in the packet as well.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;number one nemesis\\&quot; is a really cool silver color and the web reviews definitely don&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li>I kinda wish everything was a mini since I have so many full sized polishes that are cool, but I&#x27;m bored with them.  </li>
            <li>However, I was surprised at how well Just Spotted the Lizard!</li>
            <li>But seeing as I have about a million other bottles to use up, I couldn&#x27;t justify buying the full size.</li>
            <li>product and service was very good - hard to see just how small each bottle is though if you don&#x27;t know what an 1/8 fl oz is ahead of time!</li>
            <li>The polish seemed to be kind of thin</li>
            <li>the Night\\&quot; because I had been looking for a pretty navy color for a very long time.</li>
            <li>You can easily get 10 manicures out of this, if not more.  </li>
            <li>This products glides on smoothly as OPI products usually do.</li>
            <li>Your Web or Mine is a really pretty pink that shines similarly to \\&quot;just spotted the lizard\\&quot; and</li>
            <li>Long lasting and vibrant.</li>

            <li> Yes, the bottles are small but unless you wear the same color all the time they should last you a while.</li>
            <li> The last color I wanted to try was the dark green crackle</li>
            <li> The black has a rockstar look and is glittery.</li>
            <li> The bottles are quite small, but they are the minis, so it&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> green is mora a gold, very thick polish, too thick in my opinion, like the nail polish I&#x27;ve opened last year...</li>
            <li> a bit think and hard to apply for that reason.</li>
            <li> They are very small and I feel expired because the polish was thick and bubbled up because the air cannot escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was excited when I saw the OPI Spiderman collection at my local Ulta.  However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the colors on my nails as much as I did in the bottle. Instead of paying $8.50 for a regular sized bottle, I decided to buy this mini pack.  This mini pack has 3 out of the 4 colors I wanted to try (Into The Night, Number One Nemesis, and Just Spotted the Lizard!). The last color I wanted to try was the dark green crackle but I&#x27;ve never seen OPI put a crackle in a mini collection.  I&#x27;m glad I opted for the mini bottles as the colors didn&#x27;t look as good on my nails as I thought they would.  However, I was surprised at how well Just Spotted the Lizard! looked.  The application of the polishes were wonderful as you can expect with OPI polishes.  Everything was a 2 coater except for Into the Night which took 3 (it was more sheer than the others).  Great item for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li> The quality of the polish is as one would expect from an OPI product -- longlasting, easy appication... etc. I had originally brought this set because there were two colors that I really wanted but couldn&#x27;t talk myself into spending ~20 for two bottles of nail polish. So I settled for the smaller set with more colors, because I was a big fan of variety in colors rather than more of one color. I was really attracted to \\&quot;Just Spotted the Lizard\\&quot; because I loved the duochomatic effect of the green-yellow and \\&quot;Into the Night\\&quot; because I had been looking for a pretty navy color for a very long time. But I eventually fell in love with the other two colors in the packet as well. Your Web or Mine is a really pretty pink that shines similarly to \\&quot;just spotted the lizard\\&quot; and \\&quot;number one nemesis\\&quot; is a really cool silver color and the web reviews definitely don&#x27;t do it justice. I would highly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s attracted to multiple shades in the collection and don&#x27;t want to spend tons of money buying them separately :)</li>
            <li> Sent these to my niece who was struggling to go to school after a family tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;Told her it gave her super powers :)&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s not a girly girl, so these colors are perfect for her. We especially love how they&lt;br /&gt;appear to change colors in different light.</li>
            <li> I bought this mini set for my daughter who uses only OPI Nail products.  It was an extra Christmas gift and one I figured she could try out the colors before buying the regular sized bottle.  She was happy with the gift and I made out on the deal because one of the mini&#x27;s in this set she had already purchased in the regular size so she gave the mini to me.  Great OPI mini deal!</li>
            <li> ...&lt;br /&gt;I know this opi say mini buy no way is not mini is really TINY&lt;br /&gt;s*** this is over priced</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great either.  The polish seemed to be kind of thin so I had to put more coats than normal but the colors were really nice.</li>
            <li> I heard the best things of Opi nail polish, that is also what they used on me in a nail bar I went to and loved it. However, I was quite disapointed by that order... Not the standards I was expecting at all for that brand. Now is it the seller&#x27;s fault or the manufacturer? I let you judge:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green is mora a gold, very thick polish, too thick in my opinion, like the nail polish I&#x27;ve opened last year...&lt;br /&gt;The blue, much lighter than midnight blue, was suspiciously thin. Need 2-3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;The gray is not I thought as I thought and very metallic.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the pink-coral one, very nice tone, but also a bit think and hard to apply for that reason. I bought some polish thinner just for that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The China glaze polish I had bought just a bit before that applied a thousand times better!!!! I was expecting a product of an even better quality with OPI, so I was not too happy about this polish set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not expensive but would not re-order!</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
            <li> I love these.  I kinda wish everything was a mini since I have so many full sized polishes that are cool, but I&#x27;m bored with them.  You can easily get 10 manicures out of this, if not more.  (I&#x27;ve yet to run out, so it&#x27;s a guess!)  This particular set has really nice colors, especially this shimmery green/black/gold color.  It&#x27;s VERY unique.  I could see it being an excellent fall/winter color for sure.  It&#x27;s a fun set.  I recently gifted this to my sister-in-law, mostly as a joke because my brother LOVES Spiderman.  Maybe he&#x27;ll get HIS nails done!  :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who loves spiderman and the colors are so cute I just may get myself some! PLUS it arrived earlier than it was supposed to!(:</li>
            <li> Had to get set for the lizard polish but I actually loved all of the colors. This will be a favorite for sure</li>
            <li> These colors are so pretty and interesting. They go in very well and have a good pigmintation. Loved the mini bottles because I dont go through a whole bottle, and I got to try 4 colors for about the price of 1 full size bottle</li>
            <li> They are very small and I feel expired because the polish was thick and bubbled up because the air cannot escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it local</li>
            <li> What a fun collection! I like the names and all the colors except \\&quot;Your Web or Mine?\\&quot; It&#x27;s just too generic of a bright, summer pink. This is a great way to see if you want the larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Great gift!  The kid really loved it and the colors are awesome.  Especially the goldish green one... very unique! :)</li>
            <li> Mini&#x27;s are my weakness. I really bought this set for the &amp;#34;Just Spotted The Lizard&amp;#34; color, it is my absolute FAVE when I let my nails grow out. But seeing as I have about a million other bottles to use up, I couldn&#x27;t justify buying the full size. I love it!</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY!!! AAAAAAA+++++++++</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as a Valentine&#x27;s Day present from our son.&lt;br /&gt;She loved it, the colors are unique and sparkly and something outside of the norm for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just enough in each bottle for 1 nice coat, maybe 2 depending.&lt;br /&gt;Good sample pack to try for the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged, exactly as described by seller</li>
            <li> I never go through nail polish quickly, so when I discovered the option of OPI minis I was thrilled! As a big fan of Spiderman as well, I loved that OPI was involved in creating a set of colors for the newest film. I have used all four of the colors in this set and they are great! Long lasting and vibrant. Just wish they made multiple sets with the other colors as well!</li>
            <li> Item came so quickly!! The bottles are quite small, but they are the minis, so it&#x27;s to be expected.  Colors seem very pretty, and the box itself is very nicely done for Spiderman fans.  Very cute.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend and she liked it. OPI is a good brand and this set offers enough variety to where you can try out different colors but still get quality. Yes, the bottles are small but unless you wear the same color all the time they should last you a while.</li>
            <li> product and service was very good - hard to see just how small each bottle is though if you don&#x27;t know what an 1/8 fl oz is ahead of time!</li>
            <li> I never use up a full sized nail polish bottle so I decided I would just get these trial sizes so I could play around with the different colors. The green is GORGEOUS. It changes from a green to gold tint depending on the light and looks beautiful. The black has a rockstar look and is glittery. The blue is a deep shiny blue, not really my taste. The pink is just a very pretty shade, nothing special. This products glides on smoothly as OPI products usually do. I recommend 2 or more coats to get the most out of the color. I use my hands a lot so I always start chipping within a few days, but these colors do look beautiful and rich while they last.</li>
