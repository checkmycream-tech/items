            <li>:) satisfied</li>
            <li>Great rpcie for such a quality product,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a wonderful texture, a small amount goes along way</li>
            <li>It smells like cocoa butter and is a nice product, but didn&#x27;t wow me at all.</li>
            <li>you want to be &amp;#34;at the ready&amp;#34; for Spring and Summer and combat current weather you would be wise to give it a whirl!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my hands super soft without a greasy after feeling.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with O*SHI GLOWS Body Butter.</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry skin during dry winger days in cali.</li>
            <li>This body butter is rich in nutrients to combat current weather conditions and is getting me ready for Spring and Summer!  </li>
            <li>For how much they charge otherwise- forget it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have to layer another moisturizer over this to really feel any level of moisturization, which begs the question of why I would use this at all.</li>
            <li>but it was very off-putting to me.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something wonderful, but I find this to be only mediocre.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It is all organic, containing a multitude of fine oils and other plant-based products.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time outdoors but don&#x27;t like to wear gloves, and was happy to discover that this body butter gives remarkable, long lasting protection against cold, dry air - and without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Not to much of a smell but made my scaly gator legs look soft and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to how lotions, etc feel</li>
            <li>After trying the facial line of Oshi Glows - Clay mask and serums - which I love - I had to try the body butter for full body especially after this unbelievable winter we have had.  </li>
            <li>So soft, all previous reviews are accurate and I agree with all of them.</li>
            <li>My skin is also so sensitive</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft..</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews before ordering this as it was more expensive than I would normally pay for lotion.  </li>
            <li>This cream works wonders, so much so that my husband who works outside and has extremely dry cracked hands has started using it as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick and creamy, yet it absorbs into the skin so quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super luscious and thick.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish there was a bigger size because I go through it so quickly.</li>

            <li> This is one of THE BEST body butters I&#x27;ve ever used! I wish I had a gallon jar! It&#x27;s so thick and creamy, yet it absorbs into the skin so quickly. It is all organic, containing a multitude of fine oils and other plant-based products. It really helps my dry hands and cuticles. The only drawback is that it is a bit pricey. However, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this for $5 add on. For $5 this product is good. For how much they charge otherwise- forget it. I noticed no difference with my stretch marks or elasticity. It smells like cocoa butter and is a nice product, but didn&#x27;t wow me at all. If you can get it for $5- go for it, but anything more than that and I think you might not be happy.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this body butter. I am very sensitive to how lotions, etc feel and I love this one. My skin is also so sensitive and I usually get super red once anything foreign hits my skin (even water) but not this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Oshi Glows products! This stuff is amazing! I love how it leaves my hands super soft without a greasy after feeling. This cream works wonders, so much so that my husband who works outside and has extremely dry cracked hands has started using it as well. His hands used to get so dry they would crack and bleed. Now he doesn&#x27;t complain about his dry hands anymore! Love, Love, Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this body butter. It&#x27;s super luscious and thick. My only complaint is that I wish there was a bigger size because I go through it so quickly. I even use it on my toddler son because his skin is just like mine and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this stuff did nothing for my mine.  It felt like wax going on and didn&#x27;t moisturize like I had hoped.  I will not be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> After trying the facial line of Oshi Glows - Clay mask and serums - which I love - I had to try the body butter for full body especially after this unbelievable winter we have had.  I love it! This body butter is rich in nutrients to combat current weather conditions and is getting me ready for Spring and Summer!  Cannot beat the price point and moreso the consistency of this product has integrity.  It has a wonderful texture, a small amount goes along way and it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to be &amp;#34;at the ready&amp;#34; for Spring and Summer and combat current weather you would be wise to give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Oshi Glows for yet another line extension that I Love!</li>
            <li> Bought this on Amazon when it was 5 dollars!  Should have stacked up on this, my wife says (and I have noticed) this is the only cream that ridded or vanished her stretch marks.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> So soft, all previous reviews are accurate and I agree with all of them. I had to order more before the price goes up. Hahah</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin moisturized the entire day. Great product!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Not to much of a smell but made my scaly gator legs look soft and feel soft.  I use this on my elbows as well and my husband complemented on them yesterday.  Great rpcie for such a quality product,</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before ordering this as it was more expensive than I would normally pay for lotion.  I was expecting something wonderful, but I find this to be only mediocre.  Not very moisturizing at all...I have to layer another moisturizer over this to really feel any level of moisturization, which begs the question of why I would use this at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my winter-dried hands. I spend a lot of time outdoors but don&#x27;t like to wear gloves, and was happy to discover that this body butter gives remarkable, long lasting protection against cold, dry air - and without all the chemicals. No more chapped skin. No oily feeling. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth! I love using it on my hands and feet</li>
            <li> So this lotion is definitely moisturizing but is smells gross. It reminded me of Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s smell so if you are ok with stuff like that then it might not bother you but it was very off-putting to me.</li>
            <li> This body butter is nice.  Cooling to your skin as you apply it.  Has a nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with O*SHI GLOWS Body Butter. It&#x27;s silky smooth and my skin drinks it up. No greasy feeling. I use it on my entire body. Love!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft.. no residue feel. :) satisfied</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry skin during dry winger days in cali. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff.  It&#x27;s made such a difference in my skin.  Not greasy.  Absorbs completely.  Doesn&#x27;t just sit in the surface.  I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
