            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the moisturizing top coat but had I, I am sure it would have been more smooth throughout the day.</li>

            <li>PROBABLY THE PRODUCT IS OLD.</li>
            <li>I think you need to be a professional makeup artist to apply this (and I am not).  </li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the particular color I received.</li>
            <li>The more you try to correct it, the worse it gets.  </li>
            <li>I do like how thick and smooth the lipstick is.</li>

            <li> I Love this lipcolor, it does last all day, in fact it is still there the next morning. Covergirl has good products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only lipstick I use.....</li>
            <li> Was the wrong color and once in awhile might have to apply a second time later inthe day, but for the most part I can eat 3 meals and still people ask me how can I stil have lipstick on. I love this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but I like the price!</li>
            <li> I usually get the wrong color even when buying it in a store where I can see the product up close.  I really lucked out with this one.  Color is just what I wanted.  This keeps color on my lips and not on straws, drinking glasses, etc.  Amazing. Even when the top coat of shine wears off, my lips still have a beautiful color.  Will definitely be buying more and may experiment with a few other colors.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE! DON&amp;#34;T WASTE YOUR YOUR MONEY.  IT FALLS APART. IT CRUMBLES ON YOUR LIPS. PROBABLY THE PRODUCT IS OLD.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift! Looks Great</li>
            <li> Product does what it said it would do. Strongly recommend this to you and everyone! It&#x27;s worth every penny. Comes in different shades; I know lol I bought several of them</li>
            <li> I love the all day coverage, even after eating, and the price is right! I never wear regular lipstick now.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This lip color is awesome, thank you!</li>
            <li> great color lasts all day</li>
            <li> love and the price was right too.  katherine</li>

            <li> I hardly ever wear lip color...now I love the fact that I can wear it and it stays on for most of the day.  I will definitely be making this a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I think you need to be a professional makeup artist to apply this (and I am not).  If you mess up putting the color on, good luck.  The more you try to correct it, the worse it gets.  I tried to get it to the edge of my lips and it got below my lip and I had a mess.  Even with my $2.00 coupon, I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> have used the for years  LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Kinda OK, nothing great</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stay place long-lasting color</li>
            <li> I am not normally a lipstick fan but I was able to test a free sample through and Influenster VoxBox. I do like how thick and smooth the lipstick is. Goes on easily and it definitely lasted all day. I didn&#x27;t receive the moisturizing top coat but had I, I am sure it would have been more smooth throughout the day. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the particular color I received. It is a nice color, but a bit too bold for me! Otherwise everything was great!</li>
            <li> Have been using this lipstick for about 5 years now. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great way to a tried and true product.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Outlast 2-Step Lipcolor is THE best product available. (I&#x27;ve tried several.)  The on-line price is often less than 1/2 the store price.....</li>
