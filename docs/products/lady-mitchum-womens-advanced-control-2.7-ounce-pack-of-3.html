            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love Lady Mitchum!</li>
            <li>I think this product might be effective as an antiperspirant but it gave me an underarm rash.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comes quick and is great.</li>
            <li>I bought two orders of this, i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of mitchum deoderant and have bought the gel kind for years.  </li>
            <li>was so glad I found this item on line.  </li>
            <li>This is powerful stuff, I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it, always good to have plentiful lying around too.</li>
            <li>Best Deoderant I have used - hands down ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective, and this brand remains pretty much the highest dosage of &amp;#34;anti-perspirant&amp;#34; ingredient you can find in the store.  </li>
            <li>I opted for the solid stick when I saw it was a great price.  </li>
            <li>It is such a good product.</li>
            <li>My husband took one of the 3 and he wants more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many prescription products that haven&#x27;t helped much...</li>
            <li>Packaged very well might O add :)</li>
            <li>KEEPS ME FRESH AND CLEAN WITHOUT A LOT OF RESIDUE.</li>
            <li>Buying a 3 pack is so worth the price; I saved almost the full price of 1 from the store.</li>
            <li>but I still smell this Fresh Powder Sense coming from me.</li>
            <li>So far so good , you defiantly get protection as far as the smell.</li>
            <li>women&#x27;s  advance control  Powder Fresh not sold or found in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I was frantic when I could not find Powder Fresh in retail stores</li>
            <li>I have tried ERYTHING and This one by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Other products may work just as good</li>
            <li>This one works amazing because I can go up to 2 days without reapplying and it still keeps me dry and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry when I work out, smells nice and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I also like the solid better than the gels and Lady Michum</li>
            <li>I will Read the Add Better Nest Time as I Have Used Mitchumfor Yers,This being the Dry RollOn</li>
            <li>I use the \\&quot;pure fresh\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the availability.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it - no one wants to admit they need a stronger deodorant, but. . .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that it does not cause staining or build up on clothing like many other brands.</li>
            <li>So if you have odor problems I suggest you don&#x27;t use this, go for a men&#x27;s deodorant like pure sport by Old Spice or</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the only anti-perspirant I use.  </li>
            <li>The other scents work fine.  </li>
            <li>right now I&#x27;m using my boyfriend&#x27;s Dove solid deodorant which seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Lady Mitchum Women&#x27;s Advanced Control Anti-perspirant and Deodorant contains 20 percent aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly as its active ingredient, which is the strongest concentration you can get without a prescription.</li>
            <li>I thought i was getting my usual, the Mitchum gel for women, that i&#x27;ve used for a long time with good results.</li>
            <li>I thought this might work but only in a Fall and Winter months when I&#x27;m not sweating as much.</li>
            <li>I can only use this product as others give me rash and it was priced reasonable for the pack of 3</li>
            <li>I needed something stronger with a soft smell.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing worse than realizing you do not smell like a rose at the end of the work day.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I really wish Mitchum would bring this formula/scent back because I fear the day when there&#x27;s no more available online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give the product that, but overall, I have to find a new deodorant.</li>
            <li>It works even in the heat of summer in southern USA and that is the ultimate test of an anti-perspirant and deodorant&#x27;s real strength.</li>
            <li>I usually do the gel only but decided to get this as it was a special price</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m still not completely dry but can just be my body</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m still not completely dry but can just be my body</li>
            <li> The big deal for me is the soft powder scent that doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances OR remind me of its scent</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; scent is becoming difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this item for 5 years and will continue to use as long as I could purchase on line.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes or leave white marks like some other deodorant does.</li>
            <li> This scent remains on all day and I stay really dry.</li>
            <li> They come three in a package so I now have one barely used and two unused items and will try to return or will have to discard...a waste.</li>
            <li> Except for Secret deodorant (which I prefer over this brand), Lady Mitchum Women&#x27;s Advanced Control deodorant works as well if not better than other deodorant brands.</li>
            <li> The Gel Mitchum for women goes on wet</li>
            <li> Works well for our, hot, muggy Southern days!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in a three pack and will be giving away the other two.</li>
            <li> The other scent they offer seems too overpowering with other perfumes and things.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for years, but solid is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear the regular scented brand, but it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> solid is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> a day\\&quot; if you sweat a lot like me, but its definitely lasted me 24 hours at least.</li>
            <li> I hope they are not going to discontinue the powder scent, but at least I have this pack of 3 to last me awhile.  </li>
            <li> but I hate most of the fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other solids (secret,  degree) .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Have used different deodorants (Secret, Degree)</li>
            <li> Even Secret worked better. :-(</li>
            <li> Not sure that you can \\&quot;skip</li>
            <li> My Sister also tried the same products and said it failed her.</li>
            <li> The price is not great here on Amazon, but if you can&#x27;t find it locally, then at least you can find it online!</li>
            <li> this is not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> The deodorant is very hard to find in store</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with sweating profusely this deodorant is for you!!!</li>
            <li> I have severe issues with underarm wetness and unfortunately, stink.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product for reliable protection.</li>
            <li> I could sweat so bad to the point that I am soaked</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mitchum for years and lately the Powder Fresh scent seems to fall short.  The other scents work fine.  I will be revising my order for the next auto-shipment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant.  It works.</li>
            <li> Best Deoderant I have used - hands down ... I hope hope hope they don&#x27;t change the formula this time! (although I got mine at WalMart for $2.97 ...)</li>
            <li> It lasts for about 6 hours for me. It smells good- I&#x27;ll give the product that, but overall, I have to find a new deodorant. Even Secret worked better. :-(</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, but solid is hard to find in stores.  Gel always breaks.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but female deodorant just does NOT work with me. I thought this might work but only in a Fall and Winter months when I&#x27;m not sweating as much. I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, I&#x27;ve just been having odor problems recently (hormones must be changing). So if you have odor problems I suggest you don&#x27;t use this, go for a men&#x27;s deodorant like pure sport by Old Spice or right now I&#x27;m using my boyfriend&#x27;s Dove solid deodorant which seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I bought two orders of this, i love it. It is such a good product. I had no problems with it and it came on time!</li>
            <li> These are the best ever!</li>
            <li> I thought it was the gel, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this type! I will Read the Add Better Nest Time as I Have Used Mitchumfor Yers,This being the Dry RollOn will leave &amp;#34;White All over Everything!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I&#x27;ve been getting it from Amazon for about a year now...it&#x27;s comes quick and is great.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever!!!  I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years and even got my boyfriend to change to it. Would recommend to anyone and everyone. I usually do the gel only but decided to get this as it was a special price and it is great. Doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes or leave white marks like some other deodorant does.</li>
            <li> I can only use this product as others give me rash and it was priced reasonable for the pack of 3</li>
            <li> I could sweat so bad to the point that I am soaked but I still smell this Fresh Powder Sense coming from me. I do not ever have to worry again with Lady Mitchum, Truly a God sent for women or men that need extra control for deodorant. My husband took one of the 3 and he wants more.</li>
            <li> I have uses this product for years, it&#x27;s amazing! Buying a 3 pack is so worth the price; I saved almost the full price of 1 from the store.</li>
            <li> Except for Secret deodorant (which I prefer over this brand), Lady Mitchum Women&#x27;s Advanced Control deodorant works as well if not better than other deodorant brands. Keeps me dry when I work out, smells nice and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Lady Mitchum Women&#x27;s Advanced Control Anti-perspirant and Deodorant contains 20 percent aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly as its active ingredient, which is the strongest concentration you can get without a prescription. I have been using it now for over 2 years and it is THE BEST anti-perspirant and deodorant I have ever tried. It works even in the heat of summer in southern USA and that is the ultimate test of an anti-perspirant and deodorant&#x27;s real strength. An added bonus is that it does not cause staining or build up on clothing like many other brands. It is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item for me!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I used to wear the regular scented brand, but it&#x27;s so hard to find. This scent remains on all day and I stay really dry. I buy it in bundles. I will buy it again. It&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> So far so good , you defiantly get protection as far as the smell. Keeps me dryer then any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. Sometimes I&#x27;m still not completely dry but can just be my body</li>
            <li> Works well for our, hot, muggy Southern days!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of mitchum deoderant and have bought the gel kind for years.  I opted for the solid stick when I saw it was a great price.  I bought this in a three pack and will be giving away the other two.</li>
            <li> KEEPS ME FRESH AND CLEAN WITHOUT A LOT OF RESIDUE. i ALWAYS USE THIS PRODUCT. IT WORKS FOR ME ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> I have severe issues with underarm wetness and unfortunately, stink. I&#x27;ve tried many prescription products that haven&#x27;t helped much... then someone told me to try this. LOVE IT! I use the \\&quot;pure fresh\\&quot; scent. Not sure that you can \\&quot;skip a day\\&quot; if you sweat a lot like me, but its definitely lasted me 24 hours at least.</li>
            <li> The Gel Mitchum for women goes on wet this is not a good feeling. My Sister also tried the same products and said it failed her. The lady Mitchum  women&#x27;s  advance control  Powder Fresh not sold or found in stores anymore. I was frantic when I could not find Powder Fresh in retail stores&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad I found this item on line.  I have been using this item for 5 years and will continue to use as long as I could purchase on line.  Thank you so much for the availability.</li>
            <li> This is labeled as a pack of 3.  However I only received 2.  The product is excellent and I am very happy with the 2 I received.  I only wish they would believe I only got 2.  Obviously, this is not about the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is powerful stuff, I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it, always good to have plentiful lying around too.</li>
            <li> Love Lady Mitchum! It is the only brand I have used in over a year and I won&#x27;t ever change!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product for reliable protection.</li>
            <li> Decided to order this for my daughter in law &amp; she loves it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product by accident, not paying close enough attention to the details. I thought i was getting my usual, the Mitchum gel for women, that i&#x27;ve used for a long time with good results. I think this product might be effective as an antiperspirant but it gave me an underarm rash. They come three in a package so I now have one barely used and two unused items and will try to return or will have to discard...a waste.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - no one wants to admit they need a stronger deodorant, but. . . there&#x27;s nothing worse than realizing you do not smell like a rose at the end of the work day.  So, I did some research and read the reviews for Lady Mitchum. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now.  This stuff lasts all day at work and is still working like a dream after I return home from the gym.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works for me best. I&#x27;ve tried several other solids (secret,  degree) . I also like the solid better than the gels and Lady Michum solid is hard to find in stores. So I decided to order online. Great price too.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the only anti-perspirant I use.  It&#x27;s very effective, and this brand remains pretty much the highest dosage of &amp;#34;anti-perspirant&amp;#34; ingredient you can find in the store.  I ordered this online because the &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; scent is becoming difficult to find in stores.  The other scent they offer seems too overpowering with other perfumes and things.  The powder scent is lighter and does not overpower your perfume.  I hope they are not going to discontinue the powder scent, but at least I have this pack of 3 to last me awhile.  The price is not great here on Amazon, but if you can&#x27;t find it locally, then at least you can find it online!</li>
            <li> Have used different deodorants (Secret, Degree) but they no longer work. I needed something stronger with a soft smell.  Other products may work just as good but I hate most of the fragrances.  This one works amazing because I can go up to 2 days without reapplying and it still keeps me dry and fresh.  The big deal for me is the soft powder scent that doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances OR remind me of its scent everytime I move around.  Lastly, I really wish Mitchum would bring this formula/scent back because I fear the day when there&#x27;s no more available online.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
