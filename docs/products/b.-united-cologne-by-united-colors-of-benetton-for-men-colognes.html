            <li> A good fragrance from Benetton. They are known for it&#x27;s fresh and clean scents. This is no different. With the exception of some floral notes in it, it can be a signature scent for some.&lt;br /&gt;This can be blind bought and the buyer wouldn&#x27;t regret it. For $15, what more can a buyer ask?&lt;br /&gt;It can be worn in the summer and is definitely considered a sporty scent. Definitely for teens and young adults to enjoy</li>
