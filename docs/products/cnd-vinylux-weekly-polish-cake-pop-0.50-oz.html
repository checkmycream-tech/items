            <li>This brand is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This product is great and lasted for 7 days as promised with the Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>Love the color and how the polish stays on for over a wk, I don&#x27;t wear gloves, and I do my own cooking and cleaning!</li>
            <li>I love it on my fingernails and my toes!  </li>
            <li>I have used it when I did my nails myself, but I have also used my own topcoat (Seche Vite).  </li>
            <li>A friend gave me a set of polish and top coat</li>
            <li>and I am hooked!  :)</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>love the color and the quality.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more</li>
            <li>I love vinylux, this is not one of their better colors.  </li>
            <li>I bought another color, and love it.</li>
            <li>Again love the brand.</li>
            <li>(I used the top coat).</li>
            <li>I love Vinylux and this color</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Use with vinylux top coat.</li>
            <li>She is on day 9 with the polish and top coat . . .</li>
            <li>So it seems that the better the nails, the better the product will work.</li>
            <li>Gel polish seemed like the perfect solution for me but after 6 months of nearly constant gel manis, my nails were wrecked.</li>
            <li>Love this color - an opaque strawberry milk shade.</li>
            <li>Rich nail lacquer!</li>
            <li>my mother has always had strong nails.</li>
            <li>The color was too light and did not look as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I purchased the shade #135 Cake Pop, which is an opaque light pink/lavender.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, lasts long time.</li>
            <li>When I brought my own bottle, I didn&#x27;t have to pay extra, so this purchase more than paid for itself.  </li>
            <li>If you like a full coverage than this might work for you.</li>
            <li>Stays very well as advertised (you must cover it with their top coat, though).</li>
            <li>It covers very well, but it is an opaque, white-based shade, so you do need 2-3 coats as with most polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>needs 2 coats for full coverage.</li>
            <li>Sweet Sweet</li>
            <li>Great quality - it really does last a week (if not longer).  </li>
            <li>Quickly.</li>
            <li>Lovely and stays much better than regular polish.</li>
            <li>I love it, stay more than a week, which regular nail polish will stay on my nail 3 days and start chipped  off.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>This was very a very positive thing for me though</li>
            <li>Very good quality and pretty long lasting!</li>
            <li>Really pretty color.  </li>
            <li>I applied an extra layer of top coat on day 3 which helps.</li>
            <li>3 days before first chip</li>
            <li>Good color and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very light pink.  </li>
            <li>, you must try it if you want a solid not to bright pink color.</li>
            <li>My daughter said this chipped fast on her</li>
            <li>The color is very chalky though.</li>
            <li>It is very opaque and really pops on tan skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like vinylux nail polish.</li>
            <li>have tried various ways of applying this, but thin coats of color (2-3) with 2 coats of the Vinylux topcoat seems to work the best for me.  </li>
            <li>nice, long lasting, pretty neutral color</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because it only lasted about 4 nights</li>
            <li>Long lasting and my favorite color</li>
            <li>Waste of $7.00 but the color was cute.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>It does last better than regular polishes, especially when the nail salon applies it.  </li>
            <li>The first place my nails start to chip is where my nails bend in doing daily tasks.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly the same on your nails as it does in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Dries much faster than traditional nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I was rather hesitant to try the CND Vinylux system as I had noticed mixed reviews, but I needed an alternative to Shellac as it was very drying and damaging to my nails.  </li>
            <li>so I would advise against using them, as this must bond directly to the nail for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this polish lasts much longer than regular polish, and it dries in 8 minutes!  </li>
            <li>really does last 7 days</li>
            <li>Finally a nail polish that lasts more than one day AND doesn&#x27;t destroy my nails!</li>
            <li>Pretty Pink.</li>
            <li>Did not last much longer than regular polish</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to make it work, but I have grown to love Vinylux.  </li>
            <li>It is such a pretty pink.  </li>
            <li>I only needed two coats and it went on evenly and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>My nail salon charges twice as much for this polish as opposed to their regular polishes because it is supposed to last twice as long.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last much longer than other polishes though.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last much longer than other polishes though.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer than regular nail polish but not as long as the two weeks as they say.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the topcoat makes the difference in how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This polish also lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> and it took a long time to dry and didnt have the &#x27;gel&#x27; apperance.  </li>
            <li> only one small barely noticeable chip.</li>
            <li> just know that the color is extremely flat and does not look like a typical nail polish because it is so matte and opaque.</li>
            <li> I did like the colors, just not what I expected in the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opaque (there is absolutely no sparkles like in their other pink colors).</li>
            <li> And worst part for me, and I realize everyone&#x27;s nails are different, when I took it off with just regular remover, no scraping or anything, my nails were flaky and broke very easily for weeks.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any streaks or any other problems applying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will purchase other colors!</li>
            <li> You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I do get an occasional chip, but that could be because of my nails being weak.  </li>
            <li> This polish has been the answer - lasts almost a week with NO chips, then starts to wear at the tips and chip a little.</li>
            <li> I always bring this with me to the nail salon and have them do it since I am terrible at painting my own nails.</li>
            <li> I think it also dried out my nails.</li>
            <li> i was getting tired of shellac manicures because after a while they make your nails soft and weak.</li>
            <li> It did survive 3 beach days and nights with excessive sand and partying, so I feel it served</li>
            <li> A lot of streaks, need at least 3 coats to cover.</li>
            <li> No more smudged manicure!  </li>
            <li> Also, I have weak and \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li> I am terrible about chipping my manicure within the first 24 hours</li>
            <li> too thin, dries like paint.  </li>
            <li> Also chipped very easily, not happy with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was sad when it peeled off after 2 days....</li>
            <li> horrible color , pale and not define</li>
            <li> seriously???!!!</li>
            <li> In my experience, base coats cause this to chip prematurely</li>
            <li> Will try again but maybe with a base coat.</li>
            <li> I also hated the soaking process to remove the gel.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long lasting and my favorite color</li>
            <li> Really pretty color.  Doesn&#x27;t last much longer than other polishes though.  And worst part for me, and I realize everyone&#x27;s nails are different, when I took it off with just regular remover, no scraping or anything, my nails were flaky and broke very easily for weeks.</li>
            <li> I love these products. You polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door!&lt;br /&gt;This color Cake Pop is one of the perfect mates to the Cream Puff or Cityscape color.</li>
            <li> Chipped within hours!! Streaked with application...several coats required to cover well. I did like the colors, just not what I expected in the product.</li>
            <li> My daughter said this chipped fast on her but I always put 2 topcoats on.</li>
            <li> beautiful color! just know that the color is extremely flat and does not look like a typical nail polish because it is so matte and opaque. This was very a very positive thing for me though</li>
            <li> The color is a very solid light pink with a thick texture.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color and the quality. Will purchase more</li>
            <li> Peeled. Not a fan of it!</li>
            <li> color is streaky no matter how you put it on. this one went in garbage</li>
            <li> I love vinylux, this is not one of their better colors.  A lot of streaks, need at least 3 coats to cover.</li>
            <li> too thin, dries like paint.  Is not shiny at all. Would not buy again.  I bought another color, and love it.</li>
            <li> Good color and long lasting. I like it!</li>
            <li> Great quality - it really does last a week (if not longer).  Perfect color for summer!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish around</li>
            <li> This brand is AMAZING! The color is very chalky though. If you like a full coverage than this might work for you. Again love the brand.</li>
            <li> best polish I have ever used. Lasts for 2 weeks - unless you use your nails as tools.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Stays on forever.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It is very opaque and really pops on tan skin.  I only needed two coats and it went on evenly and dried quickly.  I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because it only lasted about 4 nights (I used the top coat). It did survive 3 beach days and nights with excessive sand and partying, so I feel it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Love the color and how the polish stays on for over a wk, I don&#x27;t wear gloves, and I do my own cooking and cleaning!</li>
            <li> I love Vinylux and this color is just awesome. It&#x27;s opaque (there is absolutely no sparkles like in their other pink colors). Stays very well as advertised (you must cover it with their top coat, though). I did not experience any streaks or any other problems applying it.&lt;br /&gt;So, you must try it if you want a solid not to bright pink color.</li>
            <li> The color was too light and did not look as I wanted. Also chipped very easily, not happy with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> My nail salon charges twice as much for this polish as opposed to their regular polishes because it is supposed to last twice as long.  When I brought my own bottle, I didn&#x27;t have to pay extra, so this purchase more than paid for itself.  It does last better than regular polishes, especially when the nail salon applies it.  I do get an occasional chip, but that could be because of my nails being weak.  Since I have the polish, I can touch it up myself.  I love this color.  It is such a pretty pink.  There is a topcoat that goes with it that the nail salon uses.  I have used it when I did my nails myself, but I have also used my own topcoat (Seche Vite).  I don&#x27;t think the topcoat makes the difference in how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> After getting a manicure I accidentally dropped the bottle and polish splattered everywhere. I have dropped OPI bottles several times and have not bursted one yet. Waste of $7.00 but the color was cute.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. . . . pink/purple. Dries much faster than traditional nail polish.  I agree with the majority that it doesn&#x27;t quite make it a week, but it does last longer than traditional nail polish. Use with vinylux top coat. I applied an extra layer of top coat on day 3 which helps. Also, I have weak and \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; nails. The first place my nails start to chip is where my nails bend in doing daily tasks. If you have stronger nails, this might actually make it to a week for you. UPDATE: my mother has always had strong nails. She is on day 9 with the polish and top coat . . . her nails look great! only one small barely noticeable chip. I&#x27;m impressed! So it seems that the better the nails, the better the product will work.</li>
            <li> I was rather hesitant to try the CND Vinylux system as I had noticed mixed reviews, but I needed an alternative to Shellac as it was very drying and damaging to my nails.  It took a few tries to make it work, but I have grown to love Vinylux.  I purchased the shade #135 Cake Pop, which is an opaque light pink/lavender.  It looks exactly the same on your nails as it does in the bottle.  It covers very well, but it is an opaque, white-based shade, so you do need 2-3 coats as with most polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various ways of applying this, but thin coats of color (2-3) with 2 coats of the Vinylux topcoat seems to work the best for me.  In my experience, base coats cause this to chip prematurely so I would advise against using them, as this must bond directly to the nail for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be removed with regular acetone/polish remover, which is another big advantage over Shellac.  I would advise this to anyone looking for a longer lasting polish without the damaging effects of Shellac.</li>
            <li> Great neutral summer color! I love it on my fingernails and my toes!  This polish also lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> nice, long lasting, pretty neutral color</li>
            <li> worked great, lasted 8 days without chipping.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, lasts long time. I also purchased stickers and they look great on this background.</li>
            <li> Yessssss! Finally a nail polish that lasts more than one day AND doesn&#x27;t destroy my nails! I am terrible about chipping my manicure within the first 24 hours and I can&#x27;t stand looking at chipped polish so I end up removing all of it the day after it was put on. Gel polish seemed like the perfect solution for me but after 6 months of nearly constant gel manis, my nails were wrecked. I also hated the soaking process to remove the gel.  This polish has been the answer - lasts almost a week with NO chips, then starts to wear at the tips and chip a little. I always bring this with me to the nail salon and have them do it since I am terrible at painting my own nails. Love this color - an opaque strawberry milk shade.</li>
            <li> Great color.  Very light pink.  The brush is different and takes a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and it took a long time to dry and didnt have the &#x27;gel&#x27; apperance.  I think it also dried out my nails. Will try again but maybe with a base coat.</li>
            <li> Polish chipped after 3 days.</li>
            <li> i was getting tired of shellac manicures because after a while they make your nails soft and weak. this was the perfect solution!  this polish lasts much longer than regular polish, and it dries in 8 minutes!  No more smudged manicure!  great color.  needs 2 coats for full coverage.</li>
            <li> Pretty Pink. Sweet Sweet color.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered Quickly.</li>
            <li> Solid color with no glitter or shimmer.  Lovely and stays much better than regular polish.</li>
            <li> I love it, stay more than a week, which regular nail polish will stay on my nail 3 days and start chipped  off.</li>
            <li> the nail polish is so grainy that Ihad to toss it</li>
            <li> 3 days before first chip</li>
            <li> great nail polish! really does last 7 days, mine has lasted for 2 weeks in-between manicures.</li>
            <li> This looks like gel polish.</li>
            <li> This product is great and lasted for 7 days as promised with the Vinylux Top Coat. I will purchase other colors!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Did not last much longer than regular polish</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Rich nail lacquer! The brand itself is great. Very good quality and pretty long lasting!</li>
            <li> horrible color , pale and not define</li>
            <li> I really like vinylux nail polish. It lasts longer than regular nail polish but not as long as the two weeks as they say.</li>
            <li> I was sad when it peeled off after 2 days.... seriously???!!!</li>
