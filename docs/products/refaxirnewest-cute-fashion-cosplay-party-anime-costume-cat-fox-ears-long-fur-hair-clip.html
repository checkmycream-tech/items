            <li>theyre clip on and theyre cute but idk</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>Perfect ears would be 5 stars but seeing as the shipping was so long...</li>
            <li>and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Stay on great compared to some other ears I&#x27;ve gotten, and so cute with the bells!</li>
            <li>but they are so cute and worth the wait &amp; money.</li>
            <li>but are not annoying at all and the clips are sturdy.</li>
            <li>Good quality the bells are loud</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality fur price super cute soft love</li>
            <li>I love these ears so much!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>The clips make them easy to adjust, depending on my mood and the little bells sound adorable!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay though because they&#x27;re easy to sew back together.</li>
            <li>They seemed big enough for me, and very cute and worth their price! :3</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>Love them completely.</li>
            <li>Wow these clips are a lot of cute for your buck.</li>
            <li>so these arrived pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>One of them is shaped better then the other, but they are so very darling!!!</li>
            <li>and they were exposed to be here in the first week of March)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>Theyre exactly how you imagine them to be tbh.</li>
            <li>The hair clips used to keep in the kitty ears were not enough for me; mostly because I have very straight and flat hair that can not keep most hair accessories in, in the first place.</li>
            <li>I guess at least one looks good</li>
            <li>They are cute, soft, and smaller than what the picture shows them to be, but I do not mind.</li>
            <li>and then they weren&#x27;t as big as the ones pictured but they are very cute and well made so the size isn&#x27;t a big issue unless you want them for an adult.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and fun to wear, they also came in two-three weeks early!</li>
            <li>Really cute and good clips kinda small though I call them my kitten ears cause there smaller than my other ones ahahah</li>
            <li>Other than that, its soft and cute.</li>
            <li>I wear them often and love the little bells.</li>
            <li>These are cute little cat ears with a metal hair clip fastener, they look just like the picture.</li>
            <li>The ears are absolutely adorable and they came in the mail earlier then expected, one thing is one of the bells was unglued but easily fixed with a hot glue gun.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves her new cat clip ears</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I expected, but theyre still super adorable and my family loves &#x27;em!</li>
            <li>These arrived today and I was surprised because I wasn&#x27;t expecting them until September!</li>
            <li>They are ok but they are hard to even out</li>
            <li>Got them early, not to early but early.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that noticeable and it can probably be fixed.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, they look exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I just ironed them back to normal.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the ribbon was pretty bent but other than that these are really adorable and the bells make lots of noise while walking.</li>
            <li>The stitching on the pink part wasn&#x27;t sewn very well.</li>
            <li>The ears are big, and the fur is sooo soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little too round but a simple stitch at the top can fix that issue.</li>
            <li>Actually when I first used it, it had a torn and black fur are falling off from the tore...</li>

            <li> loved them they r so adorable, its perfect for my neko look in cosplaying. the ribbon &amp; bells r just so cute.</li>
            <li> They are cute and well crafted great for cosplay</li>
            <li> I love these ears, if you cover your ears with your hair you look just like a neko ^.^ I wear them often and love the little bells. This arrived about 2 weeks ahead of time so a big thank you to the seller &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Amazing and adorable! A little smaller than I expected, but theyre still super adorable and my family loves &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> These are cute little cat ears with a metal hair clip fastener, they look just like the picture. I was able to attach them to my hair with no problem, and they looked just like the photo. My cat is also fascinated with them because the bells make a lot of noises and he thinks they are a toy. They did take a bit of time to arrive as they came from China so please leave enough time for shipping.</li>
            <li> Cute, but very cheap.</li>
            <li> The ears come in earlier than it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;they are a little smaller than I thought they would be but they are so cute and worth the wait &amp; money.</li>
            <li> They are ok but they are hard to even out</li>
            <li> So cute!!!!! I love these ! I was hesitant to buy them because of the reviews but I am glad I did get them! They&#x27;re so soft and fun to wear, they also came in two-three weeks early! (I got them today 2/10/15 and they were exposed to be here in the first week of March)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little too round but a simple stitch at the top can fix that issue. The bell isn&#x27;t too loud or annoying. I love these &#x3D;^~^&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Got them early, not to early but early. I ordere them June 5th they were suppose to come July 29th - August 4th but they came yesterday and I was so excited! Good quality the bells are loud the fabric and fur is durable. Perfect ears would be 5 stars but seeing as the shipping was so long...all in all fantastic ears!!!</li>
            <li> SO CUTE!!! One of them is shaped better then the other, but they are so very darling!!!</li>
            <li> Really cute and good clips kinda small though I call them my kitten ears cause there smaller than my other ones ahahah</li>
            <li> These are so cute and look amazing! The problem is that it came sort of ripped. The stitching on the pink part wasn&#x27;t sewn very well. I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is. It isn&#x27;t that noticeable and it can probably be fixed. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> The ears are absolutely adorable and they came in the mail earlier then expected, one thing is one of the bells was unglued but easily fixed with a hot glue gun.</li>
            <li> I love these ears so much! The clips make them easy to adjust, depending on my mood and the little bells sound adorable!</li>
            <li> My baby doll looks so sexy in them. Great for the price :)</li>
            <li> The ears arrived neither early or late, but actually on time. The hair clips used to keep in the kitty ears were not enough for me; mostly because I have very straight and flat hair that can not keep most hair accessories in, in the first place. I use some extra bobby pins to keep the ears in my hair. Do not wear these out in the rain because I wore these out to a couple football games too and that makes the glue loosen. That&#x27;s okay though because they&#x27;re easy to sew back together.</li>
            <li> So cute I love them. I got them for my daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Actually when I first used it, it had a torn and black fur are falling off from the tore... Other than that, its soft and cute.</li>
            <li> It seems like both of the ears are meant for the left side of my head. I had to try and shape it to look good but it didn&#x27;t work 😐 I guess at least one looks good</li>
            <li> They were a bit flimsy, for the price though you can&#x27;t beat it.  Very cute :)</li>
            <li> These arrived today and I was surprised because I wasn&#x27;t expecting them until September! I ordered them on August 10th so these arrived pretty quickly. The ears are big, and the fur is sooo soft. My only complaint is that the ribbon was pretty bent but other than that these are really adorable and the bells make lots of noise while walking. I&#x27;m happy I purchased these! 💕</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality fur price super cute soft love the bells  came sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Really cute and cheap! Perfect size... They got here in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new cat clip ears She is very very satisfied.</li>
            <li> They are cute, soft, and smaller than what the picture shows them to be, but I do not mind. They did come a little squished. The clips fell off  so I had to glue them back on. It took about 5 weeks to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> The clips clamp nicely, the ears are perky and cute.  Not much to say, they look exactly as pictured.  Definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Great for Cosplaying! if you know what I mean</li>
            <li> One of the bells fell off as soon as I opened them. But there still awesome! I love them!:)</li>
            <li> Fash shipping for something coming from china. Love them completely. They&#x27;re so cute.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured but came kimda squished and folded weird. I just ironed them back to normal. Super cute!</li>
            <li> The ears took over a month to come in the mail and then they weren&#x27;t as big as the ones pictured but they are very cute and well made so the size isn&#x27;t a big issue unless you want them for an adult. I would recommend them for younger girls.</li>
            <li> Wow these clips are a lot of cute for your buck. They arrived in only 2wks while it was estimated at almost a month- shipping from Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;The bells jingle but are not annoying at all and the clips are sturdy. They sit perfect on either side. I&#x27;m going to order the white ones now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone looking for a cuteness boost!</li>
            <li> They seemed big enough for me, and very cute and worth their price! :3</li>
            <li> Stay on great compared to some other ears I&#x27;ve gotten, and so cute with the bells!</li>
            <li> Theyre exactly how you imagine them to be tbh. theyre clip on and theyre cute but idk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought little kitty ear clips on Amazon before, but these ones are just curved. I like mine to have somewhat of a point. I&#x27;d suggest getting them somewhere else.</li>
