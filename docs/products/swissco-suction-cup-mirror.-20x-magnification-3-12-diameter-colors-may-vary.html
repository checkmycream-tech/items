            <li>I love this mirror!</li>

            <li>I was offered this product at a discounted rate/free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It is nice just alittle on the blurry side.</li>
            <li>You can attach it where you want with effective attached suction cups.</li>
            <li>you have to get very close and the perfect angle to try to get a focused spot.</li>
            <li>I think the cleaning lady liked it because they couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>There are some amazing things going on right on our own faces, lol.</li>
            <li>I do have pretty good vision, but anyone using glasses which corrects his/her vision should not have any problem seeing every detail on his/her face!  </li>
            <li>love the mounting versatility.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found a stronger mirror than a 15x.  </li>
            <li>The mirror has fallen off many times.</li>
            <li>more magnifying than the Tweezerman was</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic magnifying mirror!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like 15 x.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>this &#x27;20x&#x27; doesn&#x27;t magnify any more than</li>
            <li>I am able to see every flaw on my face that needs to be addressed.</li>
            <li>get yours you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>i already had a 10X, &amp; it magnifies better than this one..</li>
            <li>I have a 10x and it is much better than this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more, one to keep in my purse and one to give away.</li>
            <li>Mirror is okay</li>
            <li>I feel so much better knowing my eyebrows are neatly groomed.</li>
            <li>I have a 15X magnification mirrow that is more magnification than this 20X.</li>
            <li>, I put it in my vanity mirror to get a better look on details.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>mothers love these mirrors.</li>
            <li>Magnification is probably more than what I need.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t even remember what degree to which that magnified, but this is even more, and I had thought that one was pretty good.)  </li>
            <li>Easy for travel and very light weight.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent zoom (20x), though I expected more from a 20x.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Spend about $5 bucks more and get the Zadro mirror which really is 20x mag., although that brand isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the clarity of reflection is best at its center.  </li>
            <li>I have to turn and close one eye to look to the side of the brow, good for straight ahead view.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is an awesome must have for women that need a bit of assistance with vision.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror for my wife so she can clean her face better.  </li>
            <li>so easy to use</li>
            <li>Recommend that if you keep this in your&lt;br /&gt;purse, that you keep it away from the sun&#x27;s rays or you can easily start a fire, as I almost did.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold in my hand.</li>
            <li>The mirror is easy to use and see with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stay attached to the mirror and comes off easy when I take it on trips with me.  </li>
            <li>Suction cups are strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a strong suction cup and is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to move around to find the sweet spot to be able to focus.</li>
            <li>I periodically have extremely fine lower eyelid hairs which grow upward, inward toward my eye &amp; cause maddening irritation.</li>
            <li>This little mirror is awesome!</li>
            <li>This would be a great product if the viewing area were larger.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel also, I like to suction it onto my regular mirror, that way I can lean in to check the area I need to tend to.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not retarded</li>
            <li>but they want with led light ;-(</li>
            <li>The whole thing is very clear and great magnification.</li>
            <li>i originally bought one at Ross for 10$ that was twice this size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is as magnified as it gets, and so far, I am ok with that. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70&#x27; wear glasses, yet want to keep my eyebrows looking neat and clean.</li>
            <li>Who knew, right?!</li>
            <li>I have a hard time with my eyebrows, so this mirror works just great!  </li>
            <li>i saw the size in the description, but you don&#x27;t get use of the full 3.5 inches.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>works great and attached to any other mirror - hotel or relatives.</li>
            <li>I have no way to verify the magnification, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted (for those times when I get something in my eye) and the clarity is fine.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, well packed.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mirror but will have to search for another product with better grip of the suction cups.  </li>
            <li>They are really handy, so I purchased extra to give to friends.</li>
            <li>I own a 15x mirror of the same type and</li>
            <li>I can finally arch my own eyebrows again.  </li>
            <li>It has a clear image and magnifies much more than the 15x mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m useful a Lots I was planning order for my sisters &amp; friend</li>
            <li>Just the right step up I needed in magnification.</li>
            <li>You have to hold it just right to use it.</li>
            <li>My face had appeared smooth and clear, but the true contents of my pores were revealed, and I picked to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mag is too much but great for seeing those wild tiny eyelashes that grow into my eyeball.</li>
            <li>great mirror for those of us not able to see those stray brows.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>When you really want to see your face...there is no substitute!</li>
            <li>I forgot how much I paid, was thinking for 5.00, it wasn&#x27;t worth returning..</li>
            <li>if you have reasonable vision,  this is not the case!  </li>
            <li>Much caution should be taken when doing this operation &amp; this is just the mirror for it.!</li>
            <li>One major flaw is that it does not have a smooth reflective surface.</li>
            <li>Now I can see my eyebrows to pluck them, Great mirror, some people have complained about the clarity, you must get close enough to it to get into clear focus, I can see my pores better than I want to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you want a tiny mirror w suction cups that won&#x27;t break easy, this it.</li>
            <li>Edit: 5 months later and still works fine, but</li>
            <li>too much</li>
            <li>I really like the magnification on this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Have to lean in too close across sink to actually be of real value.  </li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>Plenty clear and powerful.</li>
            <li>Suction cups don&#x27;t hold onto the mirror very well.</li>
            <li>Also, unless you are an inch away from the mirror, you can&#x27;t legibly see anything.</li>
            <li>That said, your in for a shock when you see yourself magnified this much...</li>
            <li>Magnification is great for those of us with poor eyesight.  </li>
            <li>It makes tweeting so much easier.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I have zero idea why a reviewer stated that this mirror gives you only a tiny spot where you might be able to see your face clearly...</li>
            <li>Pretty cool little mirror with 20 times magnification.</li>
            <li>Gives a very clear image.</li>
            <li>This is my second one and wish it were just a bit higher in quality.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Perhaps the magnification is a little too strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest skipping this, and buy a mirror with less magnification that you can see better and further away with.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was fine, until I bought this one and could see everything I was missing.</li>
            <li>This is certainly ample enough, unless of course you are dating a hawk...or an eagle...</li>
            <li>I can also see my entire face by just holding it away from my face a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars, but the mirror could be a bit bigger to see the whole eyebrow.</li>
            <li>it help me to see the most tiny pieces of my hair that normally i cant see from the ordinary mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost scary how good you can see yourself.  </li>
            <li>I am getting older and my eyesight is not as I had when I was younger.</li>
            <li>to high of price an it the same as 10 x</li>
            <li>small but mighty.  </li>
            <li>have to get real close to use the magnification that only a tiny portion of what I&#x27;m looking at is visible.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
            <li>The very rare spot where I did get a clear reflection was very, very small</li>
            <li>This mirror allows me to do the very delicate work of being able to see them to pluck them out.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any vision in the middle of my right eye due to a hole in the retina.  </li>
            <li>Not a good feature, maybe one giant suction cup would have worked better.</li>
            <li>The glass is clear enough but the magnification isn&#x27;t what it says.</li>

            <li> This little mirror is awesome!</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if the viewing area were larger.  </li>
            <li> Great for travel also, I like to suction it onto my regular mirror, that way I can lean in to check the area I need to tend to.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not retarded</li>
            <li> but they want with led light ;-(</li>
            <li> The whole thing is very clear and great magnification.</li>
            <li> i originally bought one at Ross for 10$ that was twice this size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is as magnified as it gets, and so far, I am ok with that. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70&#x27; wear glasses, yet want to keep my eyebrows looking neat and clean.</li>
            <li> Who knew, right?!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with my eyebrows, so this mirror works just great!  </li>
            <li> i saw the size in the description, but you don&#x27;t get use of the full 3.5 inches.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> works great and attached to any other mirror - hotel or relatives.</li>
            <li> I have no way to verify the magnification, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted (for those times when I get something in my eye) and the clarity is fine.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, well packed.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mirror but will have to search for another product with better grip of the suction cups.  </li>
            <li> They are really handy, so I purchased extra to give to friends.</li>
            <li> I own a 15x mirror of the same type and</li>
            <li> I can finally arch my own eyebrows again.  </li>
            <li> It has a clear image and magnifies much more than the 15x mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m useful a Lots I was planning order for my sisters &amp; friend</li>
            <li> Just the right step up I needed in magnification.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it just right to use it.</li>
            <li> My face had appeared smooth and clear, but the true contents of my pores were revealed, and I picked to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mag is too much but great for seeing those wild tiny eyelashes that grow into my eyeball.</li>
            <li> great mirror for those of us not able to see those stray brows.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> When you really want to see your face...there is no substitute!</li>
            <li> I forgot how much I paid, was thinking for 5.00, it wasn&#x27;t worth returning..</li>
            <li> if you have reasonable vision,  this is not the case!  </li>
            <li> Much caution should be taken when doing this operation &amp; this is just the mirror for it.!</li>
            <li> One major flaw is that it does not have a smooth reflective surface.</li>
            <li> Now I can see my eyebrows to pluck them, Great mirror, some people have complained about the clarity, you must get close enough to it to get into clear focus, I can see my pores better than I want to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want a tiny mirror w suction cups that won&#x27;t break easy, this it.</li>
            <li> Edit: 5 months later and still works fine, but</li>
            <li> too much</li>
            <li> I really like the magnification on this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Have to lean in too close across sink to actually be of real value.  </li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> Plenty clear and powerful.</li>
            <li> Suction cups don&#x27;t hold onto the mirror very well.</li>
            <li> Also, unless you are an inch away from the mirror, you can&#x27;t legibly see anything.</li>
            <li> That said, your in for a shock when you see yourself magnified this much...</li>
            <li> Magnification is great for those of us with poor eyesight.  </li>
            <li> It makes tweeting so much easier.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I have zero idea why a reviewer stated that this mirror gives you only a tiny spot where you might be able to see your face clearly...</li>
            <li> Pretty cool little mirror with 20 times magnification.</li>
            <li> Gives a very clear image.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and wish it were just a bit higher in quality.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Perhaps the magnification is a little too strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest skipping this, and buy a mirror with less magnification that you can see better and further away with.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was fine, until I bought this one and could see everything I was missing.</li>
            <li> This is certainly ample enough, unless of course you are dating a hawk...or an eagle...</li>
            <li> I can also see my entire face by just holding it away from my face a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars, but the mirror could be a bit bigger to see the whole eyebrow.</li>
            <li> it help me to see the most tiny pieces of my hair that normally i cant see from the ordinary mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost scary how good you can see yourself.  </li>
            <li> I am getting older and my eyesight is not as I had when I was younger.</li>
            <li> to high of price an it the same as 10 x</li>
            <li> small but mighty.  </li>
            <li> have to get real close to use the magnification that only a tiny portion of what I&#x27;m looking at is visible.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The very rare spot where I did get a clear reflection was very, very small</li>
            <li> This mirror allows me to do the very delicate work of being able to see them to pluck them out.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any vision in the middle of my right eye due to a hole in the retina.  </li>
            <li> Not a good feature, maybe one giant suction cup would have worked better.</li>
            <li> The glass is clear enough but the magnification isn&#x27;t what it says.</li>
            <li> Love this and it aides me daily, but the suction cups were very thin and pulled apart now making its use not so helpful.</li>
            <li> close and EVERY portion of this mirror clearly shows the area I am looking at with absolutely NO distortion whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> Works really well for seeing all those funky little hairs I can feel but not see!  </li>
            <li> That being said it is good for the hard to see strays but not really good for applying make up because the clear area is too small.  </li>
            <li> had previously been using the Tweezerman mirror which I&#x27;d accidentally broken, and I hoped that I&#x27;d be able to resist any picking by not having a magnifying mirror, but, weak-willed</li>
            <li> This mirror is so small I can&#x27;t see much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not a mirror for seeing anything on your face unless you are facing forward and holding the mirror directly infront of you, an inch or less away.</li>
            <li> The silver mirror backing is not smoothly concave, meaning that you can&#x27;t get a clear magnified reflection.  </li>
            <li> this mirror is a lot smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> It is not the same quality of the Zadro 20X EXtreme which I also bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 10X Magnification for quite awhile now, but it has been getting harder and harder to keep my eyebrow  neat as I can&#x27;t wear my glasses and take care of eyebrows at same time - until I found the 20X Magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> too small and too high for such a small mirror....</li>
            <li> Not really 20 X Magnification......</li>
            <li> works for the center of ur face but not really for the sides.</li>
            <li> and I had trouble keeping that tiny spot in focus .  </li>
            <li> I am visually impaired and now I can see just where to pluck a hair from my eyebrows or find something I am unable to normally see.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again knowing how small the actual viewing area is for use.</li>
            <li> I use it to locate any stray lash or other particles in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve purchased the same brand of small magnification mirror I lost.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this mirror due its size and quality.</li>
            <li> , it was probably about 15x as the other reviewer stated.  </li>
            <li> Also the magnification power was much less than other 20x mag.</li>
            <li> just what I needed for those hard to reach facial hairs.</li>
            <li> The down side it</li>
            <li> The suction caps didn&#x27;t stick well to the surface and kept falling down.</li>
            <li> Suction cups are small and poorly placed (and there are only two, so it wobbles and occasionally falls down).</li>
            <li> It is small, which I expected, and a bit blurry.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little stronger, I had one that was 25x</li>
            <li> Well it magnifies every little blemish on her face.  </li>
            <li> I can see all of those little eyebrow hairs, and tweeze them out with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down on this!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see much in it waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> and I see it used everyday.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money it is so distorted it is useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wasted you money, mine ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I can see so much that it&#x27;s almost scary!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained about the magnification or the clarity.</li>
            <li> Small distortions in the mirror tends to be wavey in a few places on the mirror.</li>
            <li> Not worth it and way too small and clumsy.</li>
            <li> it was really really small</li>
            <li> Not sure how I lived without this magnification level before.</li>
            <li> Now I can see what I have been missing!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money on this one!</li>
            <li> I needed a magnifier for applying make up and tweezing eyebrows, close up work that my eyes have been failing at lately.</li>
            <li> Left unattended, can start a scary blaze!</li>
            <li> Sucks!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find  one in a 20x.</li>
            <li> I can see every gory detail.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she has bad eyesite and with this mirror she can see what she is doing when groming here face.</li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> This one is garbage. :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the quality of this mirror.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very disappointed with the quality of this mirror. The suction cups &amp;#34;gave up&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t hold. I had high hopes for this mirror but will have to search for another product with better grip of the suction cups.  I was offered this product at a discounted rate/free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my wife. She wanted one 30X, BUT WE COULD NOT FIND ONE ANYWHERE(30X MAGNIFICATION. So I bought her one that was 20X MAGNIFICATION. That is the breaks I guess. I was going to surprize her for our anniversary, no this is not all that I am getting her. But I di wish I could have got her what She Wanted. Jim in Ohio</li>
            <li> I can see so much that it&#x27;s almost scary! Lol</li>
            <li> It is nice just alittle on the blurry side. It will take time to get use to it. ;)</li>
            <li> Great mirror for home and travel.</li>
            <li> Sucks! One of the suction cups on the back broke off.</li>
            <li> Suction cups do not stay attached, have to hold it!</li>
            <li> good quality, thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent mirror. Exactly as described. Other reviewers have complained about the magnification or the clarity. I have no way to verify the magnification, but it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted (for those times when I get something in my eye) and the clarity is fine.</li>
            <li> When you really want to see your face...there is no substitute!</li>
            <li> Wish I could find one of these in a larger size.  Good for plucking eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are poorly designed, and DO NOT stick to any smooth surface e.g. glass, mirror, ceramic. This make the product impractical to use, as you end using up one hand to hold up the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely not recommend this product, until the quality of the suction cups is improved.</li>
            <li> This little mirror is awesome! Without it I would not be able to pluck my eyebrows! I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> Am replacing my 15X mirror n it&#x27;s great......love the mounting versatility.</li>
            <li> I can see again!!exact product, good price</li>
            <li> small but mighty.  Like the mirror a lot.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found a stronger mirror than a 15x.  This mirror is perfect for my needs to tweeze the brows !</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, but a helpful tool for failing eyesight. Suction cups can be a fiddle.</li>
            <li> Wow!! I am so impressed with this magnification -- and without my prescribed glasses.  I simply push the suction cups onto a portable makeup mirror that has a stand.  I can see everything and recommend this mirror for those who need close-up tweezing, make-up applications, etc.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little stronger, I had one that was 25x and I broke it, but this one works good.</li>
            <li> The mirror magnification is excellent. It is difficult to find  one in a 20x. The down side it that the suction cups slip out of their holes in the back. The mirror has fallen off many times. One day it&#x27;s going to crack or break.</li>
            <li> Let me make a shameful confession: I am a picker.  When stressed, or needing to do basically anything I don&#x27;t want to do, I pick instead.&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using the Tweezerman mirror which I&#x27;d accidentally broken, and I hoped that I&#x27;d be able to resist any picking by not having a magnifying mirror, but, weak-willed, I ordered this one with one day delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It. Is. Glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAY more magnifying than the Tweezerman was (I don&#x27;t even remember what degree to which that magnified, but this is even more, and I had thought that one was pretty good.)  I can see every gory detail.  My face had appeared smooth and clear, but the true contents of my pores were revealed, and I picked to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gross?  Yes.  But we know I&#x27;m not the only picker looking at this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI there were no wavy lines or blurry spots.  The whole thing is very clear and great magnification.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the clarity of reflection is best at its center.  That being said it is good for the hard to see strays but not really good for applying make up because the clear area is too small.  Should be larger to be practical.</li>
            <li> works great and attached to any other mirror - hotel or relatives.</li>
            <li> Eyesight not as good as it used to be, this is perfect for plucking eyebrows - can see the smallest hairs</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. I forgot how much I paid, was thinking for 5.00, it wasn&#x27;t worth returning..but for 15.00, I guess I should have. The mirror is actually plastic - y, and about a finger width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want a tiny mirror w suction cups that won&#x27;t break easy, this it.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and wish it were just a bit higher in quality.</li>
            <li> i for some reason thought it was going to be much bigger it was really really small</li>
            <li> Very good for shaping eyebrows and can be held comfortably in my hand. can be used for finding splinters too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see well up close so I need a mag mirror to put on eyeliner. 20x mag is too much but great for seeing those wild tiny eyelashes that grow into my eyeball.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my wife so she can clean her face better.  Well it magnifies every little blemish on her face.  She said &amp;#34;Wow too much information&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror does a great job.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get this in a bigger version.  I can see the smallest of mistakes in my face make-up and a tiny fiber of the cotton ball in my eye.</li>
            <li> Really GREAT mirror! I have zero idea why a reviewer stated that this mirror gives you only a tiny spot where you might be able to see your face clearly...if you have reasonable vision,  this is not the case!  I can hold this mirror close and EVERY portion of this mirror clearly shows the area I am looking at with absolutely NO distortion whatsoever!  I can also see my entire face by just holding it away from my face a little bit more. I do have pretty good vision, but anyone using glasses which corrects his/her vision should not have any problem seeing every detail on his/her face!  I LOVE this mirror! I did buy a 15x magnification, too, way before my recent purchase of this mirror AND, if a 30x comes out I will buy this, too! I can&#x27;t stand not seeing every detail...  This is certainly ample enough, unless of course you are dating a hawk...or an eagle... Elle</li>
            <li> The suction caps didn&#x27;t stick well to the surface and kept falling down. Unimpressive for a so-called suction cap mirror.</li>
            <li> Suction cups are small and poorly placed (and there are only two, so it wobbles and occasionally falls down). Magnification is great, though.</li>
            <li> I really like the magnification on this mirror.  I wish it were bigger, but it gets the job done.  I&#x27;m not a fan of suction cups--they never hold--so I don&#x27;t use it in that way and so no risk of breaking it.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> great price for this item/so easy to use</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if the viewing area were larger.  Have to lean in too close across sink to actually be of real value.  Would not purchase again knowing how small the actual viewing area is for use.</li>
            <li> to high of price an it the same as 10 x but bluryer the 10x cost 2.00 dollars</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the mirror.  Perhaps the magnification is a little too strong.  It takes a while for me to focus in order to see.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic magnifying mirror!  I can see all of those little eyebrow hairs, and tweeze them out with no problem.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this mirror.</li>
            <li> I needed a magnifier for applying make up and tweezing eyebrows, close up work that my eyes have been failing at lately. I tried a 5x magnifier and I thought it was fine, until I bought this one and could see everything I was missing. There are some amazing things going on right on our own faces, lol. I would give 5 stars, but the mirror could be a bit bigger to see the whole eyebrow. I have to turn and close one eye to look to the side of the brow, good for straight ahead view. Other than that, this is an awesome must have for women that need a bit of assistance with vision. Edit: 5 months later and still works fine, but both suction cups have come off and so using masking tape to attach to larger bathroom mirror. Not a good feature, maybe one giant suction cup would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I am getting older and my eyesight is not as I had when I was younger. With this mirror, I can see&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTHING on my face. Wow! Who knew, right?! Anyways, it&#x27;s great for plucking unwanted hair,&lt;br /&gt;checking out pores, what&#x27;s gotten in your eye, etc. I have the  5x, 10x, 15x, and now the 20x. I think&lt;br /&gt;this is as magnified as it gets, and so far, I am ok with that. :-) Recommend that if you keep this in your&lt;br /&gt;purse, that you keep it away from the sun&#x27;s rays or you can easily start a fire, as I almost did. It only takes a&lt;br /&gt;few seconds to start a smoke. Left unattended, can start a scary blaze! I&#x27;m just sayin...be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this seller and this mirror! I have 2 backups!</li>
            <li> Just the right step up I needed in magnification. Easy to hold in my hand.</li>
            <li> You can attach it where you want with effective attached suction cups. I use it to locate any stray lash or other particles in my eyes. It really helps. Plenty clear and powerful. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see much in it waste of money.  Wish I would&#x27;ve purchased the same brand of small magnification mirror I lost. This one is garbage. :(</li>
            <li> Small distortions in the mirror tends to be wavey in a few places on the mirror. It is not the same quality of the Zadro 20X EXtreme which I also bought. I will not buy this maker&#x27;s mirror again.</li>
            <li> Gives a very clear image. The magnification is solid. Easy for travel and very light weight. Suction cups are strong.</li>
            <li> It should get no star. It&#x27;s not 20x as I compared with my 20x mirror. I think it&#x27;s 12x or 15x.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I lived without this magnification level before. Great for plucking eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Great value, good quality and fantastic magnification!</li>
            <li> perfect for my eyebrows, love it</li>
            <li> It fell apart from suction cups repeatedly until it finally broke. Not worth it and way too small and clumsy.</li>
            <li> They are really handy, so I purchased extra to give to friends.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, suction cups stick to almost any serface. Great for traveling!</li>
            <li> it help me to see the most tiny pieces of my hair that normally i cant see from the ordinary mirror. i love it.</li>
            <li> Now I can see my eyebrows to pluck them, Great mirror, some people have complained about the clarity, you must get close enough to it to get into clear focus, I can see my pores better than I want to. Great for travel also, I like to suction it onto my regular mirror, that way I can lean in to check the area I need to tend to.</li>
            <li> Not really 20 X Magnification......it&#x27;s more like 15 x.  It&#x27;s okay, but I thought I was going to get the 20 x.  I bought the Zadro 20 X instead, which is truly 20 X.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool little mirror with 20 times magnification. One major flaw is that it does not have a smooth reflective surface. You need to move around to find the sweet spot to be able to focus.</li>
            <li> Mama says it makes the chin hairs big enough to see.  When she likes it that&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Works really well for seeing all those funky little hairs I can feel but not see!  Quick delivery, well packed.</li>
            <li> I own a 15x mirror of the same type and this &#x27;20x&#x27; doesn&#x27;t magnify any more than the 15x does.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she has bad eyesite and with this mirror she can see what she is doing when groming here face.</li>
            <li> perfect for tweezing, and teeth and skin care as it maginifes</li>
            <li> this mirror is a lot smaller than i expected. i originally bought one at Ross for 10$ that was twice this size. it&#x27;s like the size of your palm. which isn&#x27;t so bad. i&#x27;m not retarded i saw the size in the description, but you don&#x27;t get use of the full 3.5 inches. you have to get very close and the perfect angle to try to get a focused spot. works for the center of ur face but not really for the sides. so it&#x27;s alright</li>
            <li> Suction cups don&#x27;t hold onto the mirror very well. Also, unless you are an inch away from the mirror, you can&#x27;t legibly see anything. This is not a mirror for seeing anything on your face unless you are facing forward and holding the mirror directly infront of you, an inch or less away. I&#x27;d suggest skipping this, and buy a mirror with less magnification that you can see better and further away with. Thumbs down on this!</li>
            <li> You can see things that you had no clue were there! I am visually impaired and now I can see just where to pluck a hair from my eyebrows or find something I am unable to normally see.</li>
            <li> I periodically have extremely fine lower eyelid hairs which grow upward, inward toward my eye &amp; cause maddening irritation. This mirror allows me to do the very delicate work of being able to see them to pluck them out.  Much caution should be taken when doing this operation &amp; this is just the mirror for it.!</li>
            <li> I am able to see every flaw on my face that needs to be addressed.</li>
            <li> great mirror for those of us not able to see those stray brows. get yours you&#x27;ll love it. buy happy.</li>
            <li> yes i can now see those microscopic blackheads i want to KILL</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Magnification works well. Used a a hand held product. Would recommend this mirror due its size and quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any vision in the middle of my right eye due to a hole in the retina.  Despite two surgeries, it never closd.  I have a hard time with my eyebrows, so this mirror works just great!  I always travel with one.</li>
            <li> Works great and with my aging eyes I can&#x27;t pluck without it.  That said, your in for a shock when you see yourself magnified this much...</li>
            <li> Like the mirror, but the suction cups continue to come off the back. I have now lost one of them.</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep at work.  It is small, which I expected, and a bit blurry.  You have to hold it just right to use it.</li>
            <li> too small and too high for such a small mirror....i already had a 10X, &amp; it magnifies better than this one..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is NOT 20x.  Maybe 2x.  I have a 10x and it is much better than this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift  and I see it used everyday.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT AND I CAN SEE WITH MY EYES. I CARRY IT WITH ME ALL THE TIMES. JEAN</li>
            <li> This mirror is so small I can&#x27;t see much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;I have to get real close to use the magnification that only a tiny portion of what I&#x27;m looking at is visible.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> GREAT MIRROR!!!  I can finally arch my own eyebrows again.  It&#x27;s almost scary how good you can see yourself.  I love this mirror!</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this mirror.  It has a clear image and magnifies much more than the 15x mirror I already had.  I hand hold it and use it to pluck my eyebrows without needing to wear my eyeglasses.  I love it so much I ordered 2 more, one to keep in my purse and one to give away.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror.  Plan to take it with me on trips for those hotels and establishments that don&#x27;t have magnifying mirrors in the bathroom.  I am so glad I ran across this Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Mirror is okay but the suction grips just won&#x27;t keep the mirror up, so it&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70&#x27; wear glasses, yet want to keep my eyebrows looking neat and clean. I&#x27;ve been using 10X Magnification for quite awhile now, but it has been getting harder and harder to keep my eyebrow  neat as I can&#x27;t wear my glasses and take care of eyebrows at same time - until I found the 20X Magnification mirror. Now I can see what I have been missing! I feel so much better knowing my eyebrows are neatly groomed.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money it is so distorted it is useless. Buy a 5 or ten times. This went into the trash.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have this a week and it fell off my mirror and broke all over the place. It also is so magnified, you can see a darn thing. Don&#x27;t waste you money on this one!</li>
            <li> What a rip. I have a 15X magnification mirrow that is more magnification than this 20X. Totally dissapointed. The glass is clear enough but the magnification isn&#x27;t what it says.</li>
            <li> Magnification is great for those of us with poor eyesight.  Works great for tweezing brows too.  Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent zoom (20x), though I expected more from a 20x.&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- You have to move the mirror to a specific angle to zoom and focus on the object you are seeing.</li>
            <li> GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper &amp; trustworthy-that’sImportant</li>
            <li> Works great putting on makeup!!</li>
            <li> I love it!! I can see all my &amp;#34;mystakes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can place the mirror where I need it with the suction cups. No distortion  on the mirror even with the 20X magnification.</li>
            <li> just what I needed for those hard to reach facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Love this and it aides me daily, but the suction cups were very thin and pulled apart now making its use not so helpful.</li>
            <li> The silver mirror backing is not smoothly concave, meaning that you can&#x27;t get a clear magnified reflection.  The image is distorted and wavey.  The very rare spot where I did get a clear reflection was very, very small and I had trouble keeping that tiny spot in focus .  Also the magnification power was much less than other 20x mag. mirrors I&#x27;ve owned, it was probably about 15x as the other reviewer stated.  Don&#x27;t wasted you money, mine ended up in the trash.  Spend about $5 bucks more and get the Zadro mirror which really is 20x mag., although that brand isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Great size and great magnification, I put it in my vanity mirror to get a better look on details.</li>
            <li> This mirror has ruined my life. I could spend an hour a day finding imperfections on my face. It makes tweeting so much easier. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy this mirror! Pair it up with one of those pore cleaning tools and you will find yourself in my position, which is standing in front of the mirror for an hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong suction cup and is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to focus properly, otherwise it is all blurry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not what I thought. Not fault of seller. It arrived well and as promised.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift. mothers love these mirrors. I recommend if you are looking for a gift. there are also pocket sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m useful a Lots I was planning order for my sisters &amp; friend but they want with led light ;-(</li>
            <li> The mirror is easy to use and see with. Magnification is probably more than what I need. It only took a week to get here. Great value!</li>
            <li> I have looked all over for this mirror.  And amazon had it.  I use it for everything. Plucking my eye brows, putting in my contacts, putting on my makeup and keeping a close eye on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stay attached to the mirror and comes off easy when I take it on trips with me.  Yes it goes where I go.  I did leave one in a hotel and had to order another one.  I think the cleaning lady liked it because they couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
