            <li>The good part is that this facial cleaner does work, it spins the attachments instead vibrating them.</li>

            <li>Your face feels clean and soft.</li>

            <li> Completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The pore vacuum is not a miracle tool</li>
            <li> and this pore vacuum would not extract that brownish clog.  </li>
            <li> OTOH, I have identified a single clogged pore and focused on that one pore for several minutes</li>
            <li> not very powerful or effective, sounds odd, weird clicking noise.  </li>
            <li> I love how it removes the white wormy looking bacteria from my nose, which cause bad breath.</li>
            <li> This product is not very well made at all.</li>
            <li> But the suction is not strong enough to remove blackheads...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried the other parts of it and will consider returning it.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting it not to from other reviews I read</li>
            <li> I have not tried the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> Just enough to lift the skin a little, but no strong suction is created.</li>
            <li> There is no suction and doesn&#x27;t remove the black heads.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use the brush on the main unit, I was unable to keep the attachment and the brush together in order to use it!</li>
            <li> Garbage, all it does is rotate around, make noise, and has very little suction.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for as this item is much less expensive then other like items.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think about wasting your hard earned cash on this paperweight.</li>
            <li> They must have gone out of favor because they are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> The one I received was broken.</li>
            <li> The attachment pieces are poor quality and it took awhile to get to me.</li>
            <li> Now for the bad, it is quite noisy and it bogs down if pressure is applied when using the brush, sponge and massage attachments.</li>
            <li> Total crap!</li>
            <li> Completely useless</li>
            <li> Didnt even work, literally i couldnt even get the thing to turn on, i was so annoyed!</li>
            <li> , they either got a bad item, had bad batteries or just didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience, will not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> The WORST product...</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t do as well as i hoped.  the vacuum is very light</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wast ur money!!!</li>
            <li> Did basically nothing for my skin. Didn&#x27;t clean my pores. Didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy spend a few more dollars and get a good one !!! You get what you pay for that is very true hear! !!!</li>

            <li> The product is okay. I like to use the brush the most. There is no suction and doesn&#x27;t remove the black heads.</li>

            <li> I only wanted a blackhead remover for one blackhead. It left a hickey! I haven&#x27;t even tried the other parts of it and will consider returning it.</li>
            <li> OK  This is just another Piece of China junk.  Don&#x27;t but one.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience, will not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Works exceptionally well for the price!  WOW! and didn&#x27;t go over budget. Blackheads be gone!</li>
            <li> Didnt even work, literally i couldnt even get the thing to turn on, i was so annoyed!</li>
            <li> Attachments work and stay on. But the suction is not strong enough to remove blackheads...</li>
            <li> The good part is that this facial cleaner does work, it spins the attachments instead vibrating them. Your face feels clean and soft. The suction attachment works very well and I was expecting it not to from other reviews I read, they either got a bad item, had bad batteries or just didn&#x27;t know how to use it. I made sure my face was wet and a bit soapy turned on the suction, touched it to my face and let the suction build up the I moved it along where I wanted to use it all the while keeping it in contact with my skin. It has such good suction that it is almost painful, lol and don&#x27;t leave it in one spot too long. Now for the bad, it is quite noisy and it bogs down if pressure is applied when using the brush, sponge and massage attachments. It does not bog down when using the suction attachment :-)</li>
            <li> Cheap junk that doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The WORST product...the attachments wouldn&#x27;t stay on, and the blackhead remover did not remove anything. Not enough suction power to extract anything...TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> cheap plastic doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> This machine removes the bacteria from your face. I love how it removes the white wormy looking bacteria from my nose, which cause bad breath.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  When I received it in the mail the inner box was crumpled and smelled of mildew.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Got this product for the &amp;#34;suction&amp;#34; piece. Ya right. Doesn&#x27;t do anything. As in no suction whatsoever. Decided to keep and try to exfoliating brush. It was nice but the piece doesn&#x27;t even stay on.</li>
            <li> not very powerful or effective, sounds odd, weird clicking noise.  I guess you get what you pay for as this item is much less expensive then other like items.  The suction does work, but I don&#x27;t the feeling well enough to serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think about wasting your hard earned cash on this paperweight. Completely ineffective. Avoid like Ebola.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it does.  Works well.</li>
            <li> It does not make the suction with power. So it does not absorb anything. For the rest of fictions it work good!</li>
            <li> I miss the days when they sold these at Dollar Tree.  They must have gone out of favor because they are hard to find.  The pore vacuum is not a miracle tool but I just like the idea of it; I like seeing that it pulls strongly enough to pull my skin out from my face.  OTOH, I have identified a single clogged pore and focused on that one pore for several minutes and this pore vacuum would not extract that brownish clog.  I have not tried the other attachments.  The spray mist is a nice idea but it is more of a steady dribble.  OTOH, it&#x27;s enough liquid that I can use the tool in front of the TV instead of in the bathroom without needing to specifically moisten my face to keep the suction going strong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
