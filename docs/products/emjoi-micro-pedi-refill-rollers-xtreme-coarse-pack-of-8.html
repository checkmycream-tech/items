            <li>I found out my husband was using my Emjoi, and having this reasonably priced option is good because we can keep our rollers separate</li>
            <li>Best rollers for extreme callouses.</li>
            <li>Better than the original roller that came with my emoji.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s just not as easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it really comes in handy during sandal season</li>
            <li>Wish they lasted longer but good in general</li>
            <li>These rollers are much better than the less-course (blue) kind.</li>
            <li>Just what I was hoping for, great on my dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li>XTREME  IS AS COARSE AS THEY MAKE OR SELL, AND IS GOOD  </li>
            <li>When he finally tried it he loved it just like I do.</li>
            <li>works great with the other rollers</li>
            <li>them uber quick...</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY!!</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>My feet are rough and callused; I think more than most people.</li>
            <li>As far as I can find these rollers are the top of the line...</li>
            <li>These along with new batteries go a long way to making soft, awesome heels!</li>
            <li>These do a much better job than the original blue pad that comes with the machine.  </li>
            <li>The extra coarse works great.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the blue ones that come with the device!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better then the regular ones.</li>
            <li>work better that standard cutters.</li>
            <li>I love the bottom of my feet when I use Xtreme Coarse Rollers.  </li>
            <li>These work a lot better than the blue ones it comes with.</li>
            <li>love the extra coarseness.</li>
            <li>A Godsend!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It really works and reduced my weekly trips to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>These work really well for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well --- would buy these again</li>
            <li>He thought the same and was happy I got the extra coarse ones.</li>
            <li>They worked really well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They are working out very well.</li>
            <li>They are much stronger than the blue original ones that come with the roller.  </li>
            <li>and he had to be careful not to shave of to much at once with them because they are strong.</li>
            <li>The only refills to get no matter what shape your feet are in for baby soft smooth feet.</li>
            <li>thought these did a much bette job than what comes with the tool - fresh batteries also go a long way.</li>
            <li>Love these heavy duty refills.  </li>
            <li>They removed several years worth of foot &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I expected more - they do say Xtreme Coarse.</li>
            <li>These are pretty coarse.</li>
            <li>This product produces smooth heels in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>These seem to get dull very quickly and don&#x27;t help as much as I thought they should.</li>
            <li>These work well, but I am not sure that they are that much courser than the original that came with the Micro Pedi.</li>
            <li>I hope the makers of this roller will consider making/offering an even more Extra Extreme Ultimate Roller that would be even coarser</li>
            <li>The coarse ones did a decent job.</li>
            <li>I get several  usages out of 1 roller before I have to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li>Better for tough callouses than the standard in the Micro Pedi kit.</li>
            <li>This brand is much  less expensive than the Emjoi, so in my book it is a good purchase.</li>

            <li> The grit doesn&#x27;t last as long on these.  </li>
            <li> It takes down the rough spots much easier in less time</li>
            <li> Works well to rid your feet from dry winter callous.</li>
            <li> Use the green before the blue.</li>
            <li> The item is as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely make the job a few minutes shorter.</li>
            <li> Would I recommend these rollers to other users?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EXPENSIVE FOR IT NOT LASTING A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly, no need to buy the expensive refills.</li>
            <li> I needed the heavy duty ones.</li>
            <li> A few passes and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> It took him very little time to do his feet using this grade.</li>
            <li> this was not effective in removing my callous and was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I use at least once a week.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the Emjoi brand rollers, but they work just as well and they are MUCH less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The other rollers are worthless that came in the starter set.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try the grey because I have horrifying heels.</li>
            <li> I will never pay the absurd name brand price again.</li>

            <li> Great! Better than the original roller that came with my emoji.</li>
            <li> As promised. Gives me a couple of extra weeks between pedis. Well worth it.</li>

            <li> Great price for the product will do the work and save mone, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Comparing these rollers side by side with the name brand ones you would never ever know the difference. I will never pay the absurd name brand price again.</li>
            <li> These worked wonderfully and my feet are forever grateful for them.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a bit courser then what they were.</li>
            <li> It did what it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for rough calloused feet.</li>
            <li> I expected more - they do say Xtreme Coarse. I have others that work as well that don&#x27;t claim to be &amp;#34;Xtreme&amp;#34; I do like the Emjoi and it really comes in handy during sandal season</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a five star rating instead of six. My feet are rough and callused; I think more than most people. These rollers are much better than the less-course (blue) kind. They are quite good for rollers in and of themselves; however, the Ped Egg Foot File works much better for me. Itâ€™s just not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love how well this system works.  Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Works great, showed up quickly.  My friend loved it so much she ordered the Emjoi for herself</li>

            <li> Just the best- particularly with the coarser refills. Going to buy as presents next Xmas!</li>
            <li> Way better than the blue ones that come with the device!  These along with new batteries go a long way to making soft, awesome heels!</li>
            <li> I love my Pedi callus remover and I change my rollers often!  These are the only ones I buy!  The Xtreme Coarse refill rollers!</li>
            <li> These seem to get dull very quickly and don&#x27;t help as much as I thought they should.</li>
            <li> These work almost as good as the name brand. The grit doesn&#x27;t last as long on these.  I did try washing them after use and it does seem to restore the gritty surface. I will purchase again</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better then the regular ones.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; roller last for only ONE session.  It&#x27;s EXPENSIVE FOR IT NOT LASTING A LONG TIME. However, it does the job.  The other rollers are worthless that came in the starter set.  The &amp;#34;coarse or extreme&amp;#34; are the ONLY ones that do the job.</li>
            <li> Wish they lasted longer but good in general</li>
            <li> Works great with the Emjoi!</li>
            <li> The item is as expected.</li>
            <li> These are just what i wanted. not to rough for me and perfect for my hubby. separate rollers of coarse....lol</li>
            <li> These do a much better job than the original blue pad that comes with the machine.  Lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> The only refills to get no matter what shape your feet are in for baby soft smooth feet.</li>
            <li> work better that standard cutters.</li>
            <li> These work really well for me. They removed several years worth of foot &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34;. These work better for me than the one the emjoi comes with.</li>
            <li> These work well, but I am not sure that they are that much courser than the original that came with the Micro Pedi. This brand is much  less expensive than the Emjoi, so in my book it is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the Emjoi Xtreme Coarse Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers to go with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover. The ones that come with it were hardly effective. The coarse ones did a decent job.</li>
            <li> Love my Rollers. As far as I can find these rollers are the top of the line...I love the bottom of my feet when I use Xtreme Coarse Rollers.  I hope the makers of this roller will consider making/offering an even more Extra Extreme Ultimate Roller that would be even coarser then this one...I say BRING IT ON!!!</li>
            <li> XTREME  IS AS COARSE AS THEY MAKE OR SELL, AND IS GOOD  ...... I WOULD LIKE COARSER BUT THATS ME</li>
            <li> Works very well --- would buy these again</li>
            <li> Perfect for my horrid feet.</li>
            <li> this was not effective in removing my callous and was a waste of money</li>
            <li> These do work better/faster than the blue rollers, but not as coarse as I thought they&#x27;d be.  Definitely make the job a few minutes shorter.</li>
            <li> Just what I was hoping for, great on my dry cracked heels. Better price than at the beauty supply house. I will order again.</li>
            <li> These are pretty coarse. I bought them for my husband to use because I figured he would need the coarsest ones. He thought the same and was happy I got the extra coarse ones. They worked really well and he had to be careful not to shave of to much at once with them because they are strong. It took him very little time to do his feet using this grade.</li>
            <li> Perfect refill rollers for my need.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with them.  My fault I thought they would be more abusive.</li>
            <li> My wife was very pleased with these refill rollers and the amount of abrasiveness was just right.  I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves them.  They work well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. These work a lot better than the blue ones it comes with. It takes down the rough spots much easier in less time so I will be ordering these again when I run out. Thanks</li>
            <li> Got for me and one for son, who is on his feet all day. When he finally tried it he loved it just like I do. Better for tough callouses than the standard in the Micro Pedi kit.</li>
            <li> They are working out very well.</li>
            <li> they work great....love the extra coarseness.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the Emjoi brand rollers, but they work just as well and they are MUCH less expensive.  I found out my husband was using my Emjoi, and having this reasonably priced option is good because we can keep our rollers separate (I mark mine with an X in permanent marker) and replace worn-out rollers very cheaply and as often as we would like.</li>
            <li> Emjoi Micro Pedi was the best gift ever given to me. I don&#x27;t see the need to ever get a pedicure again.</li>
