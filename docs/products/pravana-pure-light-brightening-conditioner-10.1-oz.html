            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>A wonderful companion to the shampoo, but also, because it is slippery and detangling, a great conditioner.</li>

            <li>Just as great as its shampoo counterpart.</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>on it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>and I really liked the shampoo and conditioner for those reasons.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner for white/silver/gray hair.</li>
            <li>- I am a brunette w/blonde highlights and its nice</li>
            <li>great for ash blonde/silver blondes with cool skin undertones.</li>
            <li>But I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This conditioner is perfect when used with the pravana pure light shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect follow up to the Pravana Pure Light shampoo...with almost-white hair and a keratin treatment on my *</li>
            <li>My coworkers and friends have all commented on how pretty my hair is looking, great for my ego that needed a boost after deciding to embrace my gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One use of Pravana shampoo and conditioner returned my hair to an even, lovely silver-white.</li>
            <li>Shampooing again got rid of MOST of this conditioner</li>
            <li>use Klorane Shampoo - love it - but wished there was a conditioner to use with it.  </li>
            <li>So glad my friend recommended this brand.</li>
            <li>This product definitely does what it promises - my highlights still look great after four weeks!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>A really potent lavender shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The problem I had is that after my 4th use, my hair turned a lovely shade of violet...</li>
            <li>The brassiness is gone - it is now more silver/platinum.</li>
            <li>You also do not need to let it sit for more than 3 minuets.</li>
            <li>, I love it but got a much better deal on amazon.</li>
            <li>Works ok  </li>
            <li>Really keeps my salt and pepper hair looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair since i&#x27;ve started using this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great compliment to the Pravana Pure Light Brightening Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Pravana Pure Light Brightening Conditioner reverses this discoloration and makes my hair bright and sparkly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better brands and this just isn&#x27;t worth the money!</li>
            <li>I use it once a week to keep my white nice and bright.  </li>
            <li>Once or twice a week keeps my grays bright and lively.</li>
            <li>i like that it is sulfate free</li>
            <li>it has a wonderful smell, sweet like grape candy and has the most color concentration of all the purple conditioners i have tried (and i have tried a few!)</li>
            <li>PLUS, it is sulfate free so its not damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li>Great to brighten up white hair.</li>
            <li>The biggest factor for me is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to notice a nice improvement because of the high price tag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase at all.</li>
            <li>the smell is nothing special to get me hooked.</li>
            <li>The product itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is that one bottle of this should equal 2-3 yes of toner product for me, which makes it a good buy.</li>
            <li>I mix this Pravana purple conditioner with a deep conditioner and my hair is good to go.</li>
            <li>Works well no bad smell.</li>
            <li>I am under 50 and have strong hands, but I&#x27;m going to have to transfer it to a different bottle just so I can squeeze it more easily.</li>
            <li>Other shampoos and conditioners strip the keratin off and shorten the great effects.  </li>
            <li>Amazing transformation, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I use it about three times a week and love the results and have recommended it to many of my blonde friends!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>Okay it&#x27;s definitely a good conditioner for blonde hair, it keeps it soft and all, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it would turn my hair PURPLE after every use.</li>
            <li>so I only use it once a week, just on the ends, it feels great, my hair just goes flat if I condition more than that.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use with the Pravana Pure Light shampoo.</li>
            <li>Sulfate free, gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>Because it is so effective in helping keep the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of your hair and keeping your hair lightened; you only need to use it once a week.</li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelming and has an old lady perfume smell.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of grey and it gets brassy very easily.  </li>
            <li>really want to be able to use this shampoo and conditioner as it left my hair feeling and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li>great product, takes the yellow out of white hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day (once or twice a week), but it certainly does the trick to keep my highlites looking fresh as the day I came home from the salon.</li>
            <li>Tones hair very well and the conditioner leaves it very soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It only happened on the lightest of my highlights, so most likely the most damaged and porous strands of hair.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>While it makes my hair super super soft, this conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much in regards to removing brassiness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pravana Pure Light Brightening shampoo + conditioner are a winning pair, hands down.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after seeing good reviews but it did very little in toning the hair and the consistency of the product is watery feeling and</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t leave it in too long</li>
            <li>One thing it does really well is dye your hands &amp; nails purple.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Its purpose was to get the brassiness out of my hair, which really didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It also made my once soft hair to the point my hair is ruined!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave it weighted down or oily looking.  </li>
            <li>I have tried ALL the decent color-deposit brands out there:</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but lately it kept turning really brassy soon after a visit at the salon &amp; shimmer lights just wasn&#x27;t helping, with this product after one use turned my blond to bright blonde,</li>
            <li>but for now, it sits on the back shelf unused as I&#x27;m not crazy about my hair being purple.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde and it lightens my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>However, the stuff is strong, and so I split 1/2 regular shampoo w/ Pravana shampoo, then 1/2 regular conditioner w/ Pravana conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that work much better.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the scent, which is kinda fruity and very sweet-smelling.  </li>
            <li>my last dye appointment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this stuff and will never return to the other products out there!</li>
            <li>I like the sulfate-free aspect, plus it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>so you do end up with old lady &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I NEVER expected that out of a shampoo or a conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>I have been struggling to find a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; conditioner that actually does as promised -- tone down brassiness as well leave hair soft and manageable, easy to style.</li>
            <li>I say USE BOTH, as I have tried going cheap and just using one or the other, and the results were not the same.</li>
            <li>Left my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>this is a little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>my color-deposit shampoos and conditioners only go so far.</li>
            <li>Completely drys my hair out while depositing steal blue color.</li>
            <li>the orangy tones dissapear with the shampoo and conditioner, the hair looks a little bit healthier, but dont use it more than 2 times a week, because i think dries a little bit the hair...</li>
            <li>Purple tinted, easy to tell from the other items when I travel, too, without labels on my little bottles that are approved to go through TSA screening.</li>
            <li>Since this is a product for people with grey hair, likely to be older and with less grip strength, this seems like a particularly uninformed mistake on the part of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very purple and the conditioner, while a little less so, is very purple also.  </li>
            <li>My hair had some brassy tones which I disliked and this shampoo and conditioner certainly corrected that.</li>
            <li>I would just like to warn all of you platinum blondes out there, like me, whose hair has a tendency to get a little dry, to dilute this extremely dark purple toner product before applying and not leave it in your hair for more than 3 minutes, or your hair will grab the blue/purple color and, if it&#x27;s really dry, even break off the hairs an inch away from the scalp.</li>
            <li>If you were to use it in large amounts, everyday it would turn your hair purple, but only temporarily!</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but lately it kept turning really brassy soon after a visit at the salon &amp; shimmer lights just wasn&#x27;t helping, with this product after one use turned my blond to bright blonde,</li>
            <li> but for now, it sits on the back shelf unused as I&#x27;m not crazy about my hair being purple.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde and it lightens my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> However, the stuff is strong, and so I split 1/2 regular shampoo w/ Pravana shampoo, then 1/2 regular conditioner w/ Pravana conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that work much better.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the scent, which is kinda fruity and very sweet-smelling.  </li>
            <li> my last dye appointment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this stuff and will never return to the other products out there!</li>
            <li> I like the sulfate-free aspect, plus it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> so you do end up with old lady &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I NEVER expected that out of a shampoo or a conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to find a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; conditioner that actually does as promised -- tone down brassiness as well leave hair soft and manageable, easy to style.</li>
            <li> I say USE BOTH, as I have tried going cheap and just using one or the other, and the results were not the same.</li>
            <li> Left my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> this is a little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> my color-deposit shampoos and conditioners only go so far.</li>
            <li> Completely drys my hair out while depositing steal blue color.</li>
            <li> the orangy tones dissapear with the shampoo and conditioner, the hair looks a little bit healthier, but dont use it more than 2 times a week, because i think dries a little bit the hair...</li>
            <li> Purple tinted, easy to tell from the other items when I travel, too, without labels on my little bottles that are approved to go through TSA screening.</li>
            <li> Since this is a product for people with grey hair, likely to be older and with less grip strength, this seems like a particularly uninformed mistake on the part of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very purple and the conditioner, while a little less so, is very purple also.  </li>
            <li> My hair had some brassy tones which I disliked and this shampoo and conditioner certainly corrected that.</li>
            <li> I would just like to warn all of you platinum blondes out there, like me, whose hair has a tendency to get a little dry, to dilute this extremely dark purple toner product before applying and not leave it in your hair for more than 3 minutes, or your hair will grab the blue/purple color and, if it&#x27;s really dry, even break off the hairs an inch away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> If you were to use it in large amounts, everyday it would turn your hair purple, but only temporarily!</li>
            <li> I have very fine dirty blonde hair, for reference.</li>
            <li> , I never left this on for long because I was scared it would stain my hair...and it has!</li>
            <li> I have even applied it to dry hair and left it in for several hours with no results other than smoother and softer hair.</li>
            <li> I am a hard to maintain ash blonde (natural undertones and enhanced highlights).</li>
            <li> This was my first time using it and it left me with 1 inch long violet/blue hairs all along my part, in front of my ears (sideburns area), and nape of neck, which is frustrating when I put my hair up into a clip or ponytail because you see these damaged little hairs sticking up all over</li>
            <li> Im hoping that the new products Im purchasing can at least save my hair.</li>
            <li> platinum highlights without dry frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I had accidentally dyed my blonde hair a little too brassy.</li>
            <li> Honestly I am really not a fan, I&#x27;m reading all the comments and don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s the craze over this product.</li>
            <li> I would be careful using this until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use other pravana products but this one turned my hair purple.</li>
            <li> I purchased this believing other reviews that I had read.  </li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to enhance the silver/white in my hair along with the highlights to remove the yellow left behind from years of coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> but it does leave my hair a greyish dull tint and takes a lot of washes with regular shampoo to get that out.</li>
            <li> and it takes hair oil and hairspray to attempt to lay them down.</li>
            <li> i will never switch to any other!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these hair products and to my horror the shampoo and conditioner turned my once pretty blonde hair a dull ugly gray!</li>
            <li> i have used other purple shampoos in the past and had never had that issue.</li>
            <li> I have curly, silver hair and HATE that most conditioners discolor it, and I end up with dull, yellowish hair instead.  </li>
            <li> but I wasted $22 since I will not use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use it again for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wonderful product, received it a few days after ordering, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I also am not a huge fan of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I don&#x27;t usually fall for the &amp;#34;must use in conjunction malarkey&amp;#34; but the difference when using the brightening shampoo + conditioner is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> , I get a LOT of mileage out of my keratin ivestment by using the Pravana shampoo and conditioner which are formulated for both taking the brassiness out of the white and leaving the keratin on the hair shaft to do its expensive but worth-it work of keeping my hair frizz-free for months.  </li>
            <li> The product turned my hair a darker, dull look.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it would be patching, I mean at least make it an even purple</li>
            <li> I mean VERY hard to maintain - usually after 4 weeks from hair dye, my hair has gone brassy and have to get it re-highlighted sooner than desired as</li>
            <li> Get both the shampoo and conditioner, a little goes a long way - and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this conditioner is so thick, that it is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Keep each product in my hair for at least 5 minutes in shower, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe the results!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product to use with the Pravana Pure Light shampoo. I had accidentally dyed my blonde hair a little too brassy. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair color even though I was using the product as instructed. I was hoping to notice a nice improvement because of the high price tag. One thing it does really well is dye your hands &amp; nails purple.</li>
            <li> I have naturally white hair that had become damaged by sun and chlorine. One use of Pravana shampoo and conditioner returned my hair to an even, lovely silver-white.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these hair products and to my horror the shampoo and conditioner turned my once pretty blonde hair a dull ugly gray! It also made my once soft hair to the point my hair is ruined!!! Im hoping that the new products Im purchasing can at least save my hair. My advice to anyone who is thinking of buying this product is BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> It works on toning but isn&#x27;t the greatest conditioner.</li>
            <li> i like that it is sulfate free and it smells nice and leaves my hair soft. but it does leave my hair a greyish dull tint and takes a lot of washes with regular shampoo to get that out. i have used other purple shampoos in the past and had never had that issue. a really great line but i stopped using this purple shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just as great as its shampoo counterpart. Left my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> The product turned my hair a darker, dull look.  I had to immediately wash it again to try and get the conditioner out.  Shampooing again got rid of MOST of this conditioner but I wasted $22 since I will not use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Klorane Shampoo - love it - but wished there was a conditioner to use with it.  That is why I thought I&#x27;d try Pravan conditioner but one use will be the last time I use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> i reviewed the matching Shampoo and have not used this yet on it&#x27;s own but i do plan to. it has a wonderful smell, sweet like grape candy and has the most color concentration of all the purple conditioners i have tried (and i have tried a few!) PLUS, it is sulfate free so its not damaging to the hair. A wonderful companion to the shampoo, but also, because it is slippery and detangling, a great conditioner. So glad my friend recommended this brand. i will never switch to any other!</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting cool-tone highlights that I wanted to prevent from darkening or going brassy. This product definitely does what it promises - my highlights still look great after four weeks! I only deducted one star because it&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as I&#x27;d prefer. If they could improve that aspect then I would give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: don&#x27;t use this every time you shampoo or the product will eventually tint your hair. If you wash every day then use this 1 to 2 times per week. If you only wash your hair every couple days or so then alternate this with your regular color-safe shampoo and conditioner. Also, don&#x27;t leave it on longer than two minutes. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> IT TURNED MY HAIR PURPLE!!!!! I will not use this product again. I use other pravana products but this one turned my hair purple. I NEVER expected that out of a shampoo or a conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> great for ash blonde/silver blondes with cool skin undertones.</li>
            <li> This is the one. Works well no bad smell. A little goes a long way. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great product! Tones hair very well and the conditioner leaves it very soft and easy to manage. Will buy again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> One use and my gray hair is fried .  BAD product</li>
            <li> A really potent lavender shampoo.  I use this once a week to keep the brassiness out of my hair.  I have to use it sparingly though or my hair ends up a lavender gray.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling to find a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; conditioner that actually does as promised -- tone down brassiness as well leave hair soft and manageable, easy to style. This one actually does all that and I really liked the shampoo and conditioner for those reasons. The problem I had is that after my 4th use, my hair turned a lovely shade of violet...just like the shampoo/conditioner. It only happened on the lightest of my highlights, so most likely the most damaged and porous strands of hair. It took about a week to get the purple tint out of my hair and I didn&#x27;t use it again for a few weeks. On my next try...same thing happened. Purple hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to be able to use this shampoo and conditioner as it left my hair feeling and smelling fantastic. Knowing me, I&#x27;ll probably give it another try at some point but for now, it sits on the back shelf unused as I&#x27;m not crazy about my hair being purple.</li>
            <li> Great to brighten up white hair.</li>
            <li> I am a hard to maintain ash blonde (natural undertones and enhanced highlights). I mean VERY hard to maintain - usually after 4 weeks from hair dye, my hair has gone brassy and have to get it re-highlighted sooner than desired as my color-deposit shampoos and conditioners only go so far. I have tried ALL the decent color-deposit brands out there: L&#x27;oreal Artec Colorist Collection, Aveda Blue Malva, Joico Color Endure.......... they all can&#x27;t hold a candle to the Pravana duo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pravana Pure Light Brightening shampoo + conditioner are a winning pair, hands down. I say USE BOTH, as I have tried going cheap and just using one or the other, and the results were not the same. Trust me, I don&#x27;t usually fall for the &amp;#34;must use in conjunction malarkey&amp;#34; but the difference when using the brightening shampoo + conditioner is night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people recommend using these products every 2nd or 3rd time you wash your hair - but as I said, for an ash blonde that is tought to maintain, I have to use it everytime I wash (which is every 3 days anyway). However, the stuff is strong, and so I split 1/2 regular shampoo w/ Pravana shampoo, then 1/2 regular conditioner w/ Pravana conditioner. Keep each product in my hair for at least 5 minutes in shower, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe the results!! My hair smells good and is still ASH after 1.5 months since my last dye appointment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this stuff and will never return to the other products out there! Get both the shampoo and conditioner, a little goes a long way - and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would just like to warn all of you platinum blondes out there, like me, whose hair has a tendency to get a little dry, to dilute this extremely dark purple toner product before applying and not leave it in your hair for more than 3 minutes, or your hair will grab the blue/purple color and, if it&#x27;s really dry, even break off the hairs an inch away from the scalp. This was my first time using it and it left me with 1 inch long violet/blue hairs all along my part, in front of my ears (sideburns area), and nape of neck, which is frustrating when I put my hair up into a clip or ponytail because you see these damaged little hairs sticking up all over and it takes hair oil and hairspray to attempt to lay them down. Only good thing is that one bottle of this should equal 2-3 yes of toner product for me, which makes it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner along with the shampoo for brightening silver/platinum blonde hair. My hair had some brassy tones which I disliked and this shampoo and conditioner certainly corrected that. The brassiness is gone - it is now more silver/platinum.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner.  My hair is very fine and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave it weighted down or oily looking.  It&#x27;s a great compliment to the Pravana Pure Light Brightening Conditioner.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Makes you hair blonde again taking out all that unwanted orangey look!  would recommend in a heart beat :) You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Turned my hair purple</li>
            <li> It is exactly as I thought it would be. I&#x27;m not disappointed with my purchase at all.</li>
            <li> great product, takes the yellow out of white hair.  Products arrived timely - a day ahead.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this believing other reviews that I had read.  Big Mistake!  The Shampoo/Conditioner turned all my platinum blonde highlights violet in color, yes, I now have purple hair because of this product.  I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the posts I read raving about Pravana were in fact from the company and not actual users!!  I spend a lot of money on my hair and I am beyond disappointed--do not buy unless you want purple hair!!</li>
            <li> Amazing transformation, better than I expected. My hair dresser recommended this product to enhance the silver/white in my hair along with the highlights to remove the yellow left behind from years of coloring my hair. My coworkers and friends have all commented on how pretty my hair is looking, great for my ego that needed a boost after deciding to embrace my gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product, received it a few days after ordering, couldn&#x27;t be happier. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I am a natural blonde and it lightens my hair tremendously. I have had several people ask me who highlighted my hair! I suggest only using it two times a week!</li>
            <li> Worked as described!!...platinum highlights without dry frizzy hair! This is a great product to shampoo sand condition your hair with</li>
            <li> Its purpose was to get the brassiness out of my hair, which really didn&#x27;t work. I am a brunette with blonde highlights. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that work much better.</li>
            <li> Honestly I am really not a fan, I&#x27;m reading all the comments and don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s the craze over this product. Okay it&#x27;s definitely a good conditioner for blonde hair, it keeps it soft and all, but I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that it would turn my hair PURPLE after every use. Not to mention it would be patching, I mean at least make it an even purple, I never left this on for long because I was scared it would stain my hair...and it has! Paul Mitchell is no.1 for purple washed, RUSK has a great one as well.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT JUST USE PROPERLY!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product for people with highlights or platinum hair! Because it is so effective in helping keep the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; out of your hair and keeping your hair lightened; you only need to use it once a week. You also do not need to let it sit for more than 3 minuets. If you were to use it in large amounts, everyday it would turn your hair purple, but only temporarily! So you get more for your buck and brighten hair! Just use once a week.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me about this brand and I bought it at the salon, I love it but got a much better deal on amazon. I only use it about once a week and I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing good reviews but it did very little in toning the hair and the consistency of the product is watery feeling and the smell is nothing special to get me hooked. I&#x27;ve used better brands and this just isn&#x27;t worth the money!</li>
            <li> I like the sulfate-free aspect, plus it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I love this! the orangy tones dissapear with the shampoo and conditioner, the hair looks a little bit healthier, but dont use it more than 2 times a week, because i think dries a little bit the hair...</li>
            <li> The consistency of this conditioner is so thick, that it is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle. I am under 50 and have strong hands, but I&#x27;m going to have to transfer it to a different bottle just so I can squeeze it more easily. Since this is a product for people with grey hair, likely to be older and with less grip strength, this seems like a particularly uninformed mistake on the part of the manufacturer. The product itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li> Works ok  Don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have been getting my hair highlighted for years but lately it kept turning really brassy soon after a visit at the salon &amp; shimmer lights just wasn&#x27;t helping, with this product after one use turned my blond to bright blonde, no brassy tones at all!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Completely drys my hair out while depositing steal blue color. Would not purchase again. The smell is overwhelming and has an old lady perfume smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner removes yellow from white hair, especially paired with the Pravana shampoo.  I use it once a week to keep my white nice and bright.  My hair is soft and manageable and easy to style.  I would be careful using this until you get used to it.  The shampoo is very purple and the conditioner, while a little less so, is very purple also.  Use sparingly until you see how your hair reacts so you do end up with old lady &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free, gentle on hair. Really keeps my salt and pepper hair looking and feeling great. I get so many compliments on my hair since i&#x27;ve started using this shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use every day, though, because the violet pigments work so well that after 3 consecutive days I definitely had a purple tinged aura. Once or twice a week keeps my grays bright and lively.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner with benefits.  It makes the highlights just sparkle with the added benefit of softness.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is a little pricey but worth it.  I have a full head of grey and it gets brassy very easily.  I use it two to three times a week and that&#x27;s enough to keep all the brassiness out of my hair.  People comment on it all the time on how good it looks.  I&#x27;ve tried all the name brands but this product outdoes them all.  The biggest factor for me is that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner for white/silver/gray hair. But I have very fine hair so I only use it once a week, just on the ends, it feels great, my hair just goes flat if I condition more than that.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner - I am a brunette w/blonde highlights and its nice</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! After one use my brassiness from coloring was gone, and I looked like I had just gotten my hair done! I used this with the matching shampoo...absolutely the best brightening product ever!</li>
            <li> This is the best toning shampoo and conditioner on the market. Truly. It smells great and it helps my hair feel healthier sooner. Just make sure you don&#x27;t leave it in too long otherwise you might end up with lavender colored hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is perfect when used with the pravana pure light shampoo. I use it about three times a week and love the results and have recommended it to many of my blonde friends!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect follow up to the Pravana Pure Light shampoo...with almost-white hair and a keratin treatment on my *ahem* vintage hair, I get a LOT of mileage out of my keratin ivestment by using the Pravana shampoo and conditioner which are formulated for both taking the brassiness out of the white and leaving the keratin on the hair shaft to do its expensive but worth-it work of keeping my hair frizz-free for months.  Other shampoos and conditioners strip the keratin off and shorten the great effects.  This stuff is GOOD.  Purple tinted, easy to tell from the other items when I travel, too, without labels on my little bottles that are approved to go through TSA screening.</li>
            <li> I have curly, silver hair and HATE that most conditioners discolor it, and I end up with dull, yellowish hair instead.  Pravana Pure Light Brightening Conditioner reverses this discoloration and makes my hair bright and sparkly.  And, an added bonus, it is sulphate-free! The only thing I don&#x27;t particularly care for is the scent, which is kinda fruity and very sweet-smelling.  But for the results (strangers stopping me to tell me how beautiful my hair is!) I&#x27;ll put up with the scent. ;)</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for silver gray hair. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> While it makes my hair super super soft, this conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much in regards to removing brassiness. I have even applied it to dry hair and left it in for several hours with no results other than smoother and softer hair. Great, yes, but I needed this for my brassy hair. I also am not a huge fan of the fragrance.  I have very fine dirty blonde hair, for reference.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t use it every day (once or twice a week), but it certainly does the trick to keep my highlites looking fresh as the day I came home from the salon. Great product.</li>
            <li> I mix this Pravana purple conditioner with a deep conditioner and my hair is good to go. after shampooing with the Pravana purple toner shampoo which drys out my hair a bit. Using both Pravana shampoo and conditioner keeps my white hair WHITE without turning my hair amethyst color.  If you have white hair like mine, you want to stay away from all the oils (Morrocan, olive, etc) as the white hair picks up the color of the oil.</li>
