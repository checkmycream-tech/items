            <li>Smells very fresh, and lasts me about 6 hours.  </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it, I kept smelling my clothing/checking myself to make sure I didn&#x27;t forget to put on deodorant, or get something on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Dove Men + Care 1/4 Moisturizer Deodorant, Clean Comfort, 3 Ounce (</li>
            <li>I have used the Dove Men+Care Deodorant stick in Extra Fresh twice now, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>but I thing the Dove as a clean, mild smell that as one review suggest smell like soap but if that is the case I prefer a clean smell over a cheap cologne</li>
            <li>Overall the smell is pleasant and not over powering even when just put on.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Cool Silver instead</li>
            <li>Cool Silver Deodorant,3.0 oz]]</li>
            <li>I dont like to use antiperspirant due to the fact that they are not that great for you.</li>

            <li>Really mild fragrance, and</li>
            <li>And the Extra Fresh scent is really nice without being too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>Relatively cheap deodorant that smells nice and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>They have a clean smell, a light fragrance, and never overwhelm you (or anyone standing nearby such as your wife or momentary love</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, it goes on smooth with no irritation at all!</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I also think Dove got it right in terms of the cap design.</li>
            <li>soon as you remove the cap, you notice the much stronger scent than Clean Comfort.</li>
            <li>The best, not a strong scent(perfect for work) but protect like no other.</li>
            <li>Keeps me nice and dry.</li>
            <li>Smells good, it is clear blue and it works</li>
            <li>After 40 years of having a deodorant irritate my skin after a few weeks of use I have finally found this Dove product that works PERFECT!  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, good product, buy it you will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna lie, when Dove first launched this product line, I rolled my eyes at the name - &amp;#34;Men+Care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Dove is the only brand I trust on my body, besides Irish Springs to keep me smelling good and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>You will still need to purchase some more at a later date.</li>
            <li>I am gobsmacked by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I always enjoy gel deodorants more than the white sticks because it goes on easier and doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks.</li>
            <li>used to switch up deodorants pretty much after every tube was finished.</li>
            <li>Smells good and last a long time</li>
            <li>Nice fresh sent and long lasting,</li>
            <li>IT KEEPS YOU DRY ALL DAY,AND KEEP YOU SMELLING FRESH AND CLEAN</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s all you can really ask for.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a non-antiperspirant this works very well.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be gentle and help him heal.</li>
            <li>Item as Advertised and Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li>However, this is the first one where I think the scent is too strong and not very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>smell most other mens deodorant smells like.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t talk about it to other people because I get compliments of &amp;#34;smelling nice&amp;#34; at work with this one the most of any deodorant I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells exactly like the EXTRA FRESH Dove bar soap and like the liquid soap.</li>
            <li>I went to another store and got the regular Clean Comfort Stuff.</li>
            <li>I like this line of deodorant, just not a huge fan of this scent--it smells a bit like laundry detergent and is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find a deodorant not &amp;#34;anti-perspirant&amp;#34; with cancerous aluminum these days that also smells nice.</li>
            <li>The scent is EXTRA FRESH</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s what the &#x27;extra&#x27; fresh means</li>
            <li>In this Dove Men line I have tried both this Extra Fresh scent and their [[ASIN:B004DH1AXM</li>
            <li>The fresh line of Dove mens care products has a cedarwood scent to it and initially reminded me of having a hamster as a kid and opening the cedar shavings for the cage..</li>
            <li>I find I get the same life out of a stick as most other brands with all day protection and my arm pits simply feel clean</li>
            <li>I use other deodorants and anti perspiration and they work fine.</li>
            <li>It works just nice to have things delivered makes trips to stores smaller and less to lug in.</li>
            <li>Those range from musky to clean scents and it&#x27;s tough sometimes to find deodorant that still holds strong without clashing or fading.</li>
            <li>I switched to Aluminum Free deodorant shortly after college as I noticed that all my dress shirts were getting yellow stains at the pits.  </li>
            <li>but it turned out to be a clear gel.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well--so far no complaints (from anyone).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go out and buy some anti-perspirant or old spice.</li>
            <li>But just enough to where you can relax when you get a whiff of that extra fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I think it smells more like soap and less like a cologne, but I pick up this Extra Fresh version when my local drug store is out of the other.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll usually give myself a light spray of cologne before leaving home but this thing is like 2 direct shots into each armpit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product and is the ONLY deodorant I will now use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never encountered any itching, burning or redness as a few reviewers have reported and I&#x27;ve never gotten through the work day to find this deodorant has become less effective.</li>
            <li>At the gym I use a spray antiperspirant but find that for normal daily activities a deodorant is sufficient.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve stuck with the same deodorant brand for such a long period of time since using Mennen Speed Stick all through high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, it&#x27;s just not pleasant either.</li>
            <li>The smell seemed to linger around me, even when I was not actively sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t necessarily because they weren&#x27;t working for me, but more often than not because I just got tired of the scent and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it does NOT contain alcohol, so I do not get a red rash as with the deodorant from Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 starts because it does NOT last anywhere near 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, subtle.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up as good as the other stuff.  </li>

            <li> The fresh line of Dove mens care products has a cedarwood scent to it and initially reminded me of having a hamster as a kid and opening the cedar shavings for the cage..</li>
            <li> I find I get the same life out of a stick as most other brands with all day protection and my arm pits simply feel clean</li>
            <li> I use other deodorants and anti perspiration and they work fine.</li>
            <li> It works just nice to have things delivered makes trips to stores smaller and less to lug in.</li>
            <li> Those range from musky to clean scents and it&#x27;s tough sometimes to find deodorant that still holds strong without clashing or fading.</li>
            <li> I switched to Aluminum Free deodorant shortly after college as I noticed that all my dress shirts were getting yellow stains at the pits.  </li>
            <li> but it turned out to be a clear gel.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well--so far no complaints (from anyone).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go out and buy some anti-perspirant or old spice.</li>
            <li> But just enough to where you can relax when you get a whiff of that extra fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I think it smells more like soap and less like a cologne, but I pick up this Extra Fresh version when my local drug store is out of the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually give myself a light spray of cologne before leaving home but this thing is like 2 direct shots into each armpit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product and is the ONLY deodorant I will now use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never encountered any itching, burning or redness as a few reviewers have reported and I&#x27;ve never gotten through the work day to find this deodorant has become less effective.</li>
            <li> At the gym I use a spray antiperspirant but find that for normal daily activities a deodorant is sufficient.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve stuck with the same deodorant brand for such a long period of time since using Mennen Speed Stick all through high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, it&#x27;s just not pleasant either.</li>
            <li> The smell seemed to linger around me, even when I was not actively sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t necessarily because they weren&#x27;t working for me, but more often than not because I just got tired of the scent and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it does NOT contain alcohol, so I do not get a red rash as with the deodorant from Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 starts because it does NOT last anywhere near 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong, subtle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up as good as the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> I like how it does not irritate me in any way and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I finally have a deodorant that does not irritate or leave a big mess.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it does seem to last longer than some other options.</li>
            <li> In putting this cap on it slides down until it meets a detent position where you can actually feel and hear a bit of a click to let you know</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasing to some and not to others same as any other deodorant, as such you should probably swing by a store and do a few sniff tests before making a purchase online.</li>
            <li> Keeping the pits dry and smell-free!</li>
            <li> ALL other brands I have ever used let me know</li>
            <li> I would try a different deodorant if I did heavy manual labor (this deodorant is not recommended for heavy manual labor).  </li>
            <li> I found this lasts on average about 8 - 10 hours.  </li>
            <li> (note, I would consider his job to include an average amount of manual labor)</li>
            <li> , did you rub your body down with deodorant or something&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few other ones (</li>
            <li> are half a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that I sweat considerably less when wearing a deodorant vs. an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Oddly that is now stuck in my head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active</li>
            <li> Actually makes you stink worse after it wears off.</li>
            <li> but I got tired of all the staining left behind on my white undershirts.</li>
            <li> I have also never liked deoderant because I sweat</li>
            <li> Also, even if the scientific community is not in agreement, concerns about how aluminum may negatively react with the body are also part of my thought process when it comes to selecting a deodorant product over an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> Even in the cold of winter I have never encountered any discomfort or found my underarms to be overly dry while using this product.</li>
            <li> Awful smell and only lasts a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Weird, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird combination of musty/stale/soapy/foresty smelling (And no it&#x27;s not just me).</li>
            <li> The smell rubs me the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Sadly however, brick and mortar stores also do not carry the 39&amp;#34; tall containers shown in the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty sticky feel from other gel ones this one is legit.</li>
            <li> although I don&#x27;t ordinarily have any reactions to scented products, I got a terrible headache from this stuff.</li>
            <li> This formula does not control my husband&#x27;s odor and causes bad irritation too</li>
            <li> no matter what I do, I still don&#x27;t smell bad at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t smell bad..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m heavily disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> It is a horrific alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described. Packaged well.  It works just nice to have things delivered makes trips to stores smaller and less to lug in.</li>
            <li> My son had an allergic reaction to this stuff</li>
            <li> great deodorant. effective.</li>
            <li> Relatively cheap deodorant that smells nice and lasts a long time. I will probably by again, possibly a different sent. I like how it does not irritate me in any way and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I dont like to use antiperspirant due to the fact that they are not that great for you. I have also never liked deoderant because I sweat and then they wear off and I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exception to the rule. I have been using dove for men products since they started. I am a huge fan and they all seem good. I decided to give this one a try. I think it has a pleasant scent (wife likes so I like it) and it seems to last. I dont have the problem of smelly pits are half a day. Happy with the purchase and it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly, smells great</li>
            <li> Awful smell and only lasts a few hours.  Worst I have ever had.  Actually makes you stink worse after it wears off.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from being one of those smelly co-workers all day and that&#x27;s all you can really ask for. I always enjoy gel deodorants more than the white sticks because it goes on easier and doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks.</li>
            <li> I finally have a deodorant that does not irritate or leave a big mess.  If you are looking for a non-antiperspirant this works very well.  Not overly scented but you can definitely tell it does the job.</li>
            <li> Smells good and last a long time</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I switched to Aluminum Free deodorant shortly after college as I noticed that all my dress shirts were getting yellow stains at the pits.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I sweat considerably less when wearing a deodorant vs. an antiperspirant.  Weird, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is great.  Not too pungent to where people are like, &amp;#34;Damn dude, did you rub your body down with deodorant or something&amp;#34;.  But just enough to where you can relax when you get a whiff of that extra fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I found that this stuff lasts about an 8 hour workday plus a 1 hour bike ride. Can&#x27;t say that the scent is my favorite. It&#x27;s a weird combination of musty/stale/soapy/foresty smelling (And no it&#x27;s not just me). The first time I wore it, I kept smelling my clothing/checking myself to make sure I didn&#x27;t forget to put on deodorant, or get something on my clothes. You won&#x27;t smell like BO, but you won&#x27;t smell wonderful either.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells exactly like the EXTRA FRESH Dove bar soap and like the liquid soap. I like the fact that it does NOT contain alcohol, so I do not get a red rash as with the deodorant from Old Spice.  I give it 4 starts because it does NOT last anywhere near 48 hours.  I would state that it honestly lasts 5-8 hours.  I sit and type all day.  I would try a different deodorant if I did heavy manual labor (this deodorant is not recommended for heavy manual labor).  The scent is EXTRA FRESH and it&#x27;s great.  I deducted one star because it does NOT last 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done i like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant for those with sensitive skin.  Does not cause any underarm discoloration or irritation.  Will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good but it&#x27;s so strong! I&#x27;ll usually give myself a light spray of cologne before leaving home but this thing is like 2 direct shots into each armpit. Guess that&#x27;s what the &#x27;extra&#x27; fresh means</li>
            <li> Seems to work well--so far no complaints (from anyone).  I like the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, good product, buy it you will not be sorry.  It is deodorant and we all need it just buy it already</li>
            <li> Great scent and odor help</li>
            <li> This formula does not control my husband&#x27;s odor and causes bad irritation too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant, and it does it&#x27;s job well.  Good scent.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while.  I tried the anti perspirant from the same brand but don&#x27;t like the fact that I end up with white residue on all my clothe.  The 48 hour tag line is just that, a tag line.  I found this lasts on average about 8 - 10 hours.  Overall the smell is pleasant and not over powering even when just put on.</li>
            <li> Really mild fragrance, and no matter what I do, I still don&#x27;t smell bad at the end of the day.  Win.  Tried a few other ones (the blue colored one smelled like baby powder?), and this was the least-frangranced of all of them.</li>
            <li> Very light smell and considering the fact I have sensitive skin, it goes on smooth with no irritation at all!</li>
            <li> The smell rubs me the wrong way. It&#x27;s not a terrible smell, it&#x27;s just not pleasant either. I&#x27;d recommend the &amp;#34;cool silver&amp;#34; over this.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> This was purchased in hopes to replace a more toxic deodorant that my husband uses.  Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up as good as the other stuff.  It did not last through my husband&#x27;s workday (note, I would consider his job to include an average amount of manual labor)</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh, and lasts me about 6 hours.  I&#x27;m very active so I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove Men&#x27;s deodorants before and have been happy with them so I decided to give it a try.  As someone who is prone to underarm irritation, I&#x27;ve found that the Dove Men +  Care line has been great.  However, this is the first one where I think the scent is too strong and not very pleasing.  May be a matter of personal preference though.  I would recommend the Cool Silver instead [[ASIN:B00AO379SO Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant,3.0 oz]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, when Dove first launched this product line, I rolled my eyes at the name - &amp;#34;Men+Care&amp;#34;. But I&#x27;m glad that I decided to overlook the name and try it anyway, because this is a great product and it exceeded my expectations. The stick rolls on very smoothly, almost like a gel. And the Extra Fresh scent is really nice without being too strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> I like this line of deodorant, just not a huge fan of this scent--it smells a bit like laundry detergent and is pretty strong. On the plus side, it does seem to last longer than some other options.</li>
            <li> I am gobsmacked by all the positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B004DH1AXM Dove Clean Care Deodorant]] for years, and have been very satisfied with it. But when my local Target was out, I bought this instead. It is a horrific alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you remove the cap, you notice the much stronger scent than Clean Comfort. But actually applying it on my armpits seems to awaken the beast -- a drop of sweat his this stuff, and it seems to make your underarms emanate Axe Bodyspray. The smell seemed to linger around me, even when I was not actively sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although I don&#x27;t ordinarily have any reactions to scented products, I got a terrible headache from this stuff. I went to another store and got the regular Clean Comfort Stuff. After two uses, the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; deodorant is now in my trash can -- as close as I ever want it to my body again.</li>
            <li> Deodorant.  Same as the store.  Don&#x27;t know about the 48-hour claim, but works for what I need.  Keeping the pits dry and smell-free!</li>
            <li> Now I smell great.  Co-workers appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t smell bad.. So that&#x27;s nice! 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again. Price was on point and I love Dove products. I do recommend this product to anyone who is debating.</li>
            <li> My son has a chafing issue and the doctor recommended this deodorant for him. It&#x27;s supposed to be gentle and help him heal. I hope so!</li>
            <li> Does great it is not 48 hr like they say but overall it&#x27;s great I use it twice a day</li>
            <li> Keeps odor away for 24 hours plus! awesome stuff. Doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty sticky feel from other gel ones this one is legit.</li>
            <li> Works Great for my husband&lt;br /&gt;he works out daily and has no odor&lt;br /&gt;and it leaves no white marks either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out several Men&#x27;s Dove products lately, such as shampoo, body wash, and deodorant.  They all feel as this one does.  They have a clean smell, a light fragrance, and never overwhelm you (or anyone standing nearby such as your wife or momentary love interest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect product for a low-profile guy who wants to be clean.  If you want musk and intensity, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance smell. Not too strong, subtle.</li>
            <li> I had been using various &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; deoderants in the hopes of finding something that did not irritate.  This finally was the product that worked.  Been using it for months now with no issues.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a deodorant not &amp;#34;anti-perspirant&amp;#34; with cancerous aluminum these days that also smells nice.</li>
            <li> I prefer a deodorant to an antiperspirant for daily use. At the gym I use a spray antiperspirant but find that for normal daily activities a deodorant is sufficient. I used to use an antiperspirant on a daily basis but I got tired of all the staining left behind on my white undershirts. This deodorant does not cause undershirt stains and that&#x27;s a big plus in my book. Also, even if the scientific community is not in agreement, concerns about how aluminum may negatively react with the body are also part of my thought process when it comes to selecting a deodorant product over an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to switch up deodorants pretty much after every tube was finished. That wasn&#x27;t necessarily because they weren&#x27;t working for me, but more often than not because I just got tired of the scent and wanted to try something new. In this Dove Men line I have tried both this Extra Fresh scent and their [[ASIN:B004DH1AXM Dove Men + Care 1/4 Moisturizer Deodorant, Clean Comfort, 3 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] scent. Both scents are nice and refreshing, but of the two I&#x27;ve tried I prefer the Clean Comfort version. I think it smells more like soap and less like a cologne, but I pick up this Extra Fresh version when my local drug store is out of the other. I&#x27;m sure all of the scents in the Dove Men+Care line work well and Dove is now the only deodorant I purchase/use.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve stuck with the same deodorant brand for such a long period of time since using Mennen Speed Stick all through high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never encountered any itching, burning or redness as a few reviewers have reported and I&#x27;ve never gotten through the work day to find this deodorant has become less effective. Even in the cold of winter I have never encountered any discomfort or found my underarms to be overly dry while using this product. I also think Dove got it right in terms of the cap design. In putting this cap on it slides down until it meets a detent position where you can actually feel and hear a bit of a click to let you know you got the cap on securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing about this product that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;m glad Dove has gotten into the male grooming product line with these good \\&quot;solid\\&quot; contenders. Good job Dove!r a bit of a click to let you know you got the cap on securely.    There&#x27;s nothing about this product that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;m glad Dove has gotten into the male grooming product line with these good \\&quot;solid\\&quot; contenders. Good job Dove!</li>
            <li> Caused me to be itchy after a week or so, may be the perfumes in the product</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> just buy deoderent in the store</li>
            <li> had an issue with rashes when i used another.  this one didn&#x27;t cause rashes and smells good too</li>
            <li> I have used the Dove Men+Care Deodorant stick in Extra Fresh twice now, and it&#x27;s great. The gel doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and I am always smelling good. Sure it doesn&#x27;t have antiperspirant but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Dove is the only brand I trust on my body, besides Irish Springs to keep me smelling good and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t suck. Keeps me nice and dry. Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The Hubster loves the smell of this. It lasts all day, unlike some others, and it helps with odor. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good, it is clear blue and it works</li>
            <li> After 40 years of having a deodorant irritate my skin after a few weeks of use I have finally found this Dove product that works PERFECT!  I find this stick has a non greasy feeling better than most, offers superior deodorant protection and is gentle on my skin. I like the smell. Some reviews say the smell is strong but not for me. I have used the AXE brand now thats some overpowering stuff but I thing the Dove as a clean, mild smell that as one review suggest smell like soap but if that is the case I prefer a clean smell over a cheap cologne smell most other mens deodorant smells like. I find I get the same life out of a stick as most other brands with all day protection and my arm pits simply feel clean and I cannot tell I am using deodorant. ALL other brands I have ever used let me know I have something on my skin but not this Dove,&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price / value as well. Highly recommended product and is the ONLY deodorant I will now use.</li>
            <li> Despite the 3rd picture, this is not a 39&amp;#34; tall container of deodorant. You will still need to purchase some more at a later date. The size of the package is just over 6&amp;#34; tall and contains 3 oz of deodorant. The smell is pleasing to some and not to others same as any other deodorant, as such you should probably swing by a store and do a few sniff tests before making a purchase online. Sadly however, brick and mortar stores also do not carry the 39&amp;#34; tall containers shown in the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1/4 moisturizer is very nice for sensitive skin and this is just deodorant not antiperspirant , so there are no aluminum-based compounds to worry about.</li>
            <li> The fresh line of Dove mens care products has a cedarwood scent to it and initially reminded me of having a hamster as a kid and opening the cedar shavings for the cage.. Oddly that is now stuck in my head but I just don&#x27;t talk about it to other people because I get compliments of &amp;#34;smelling nice&amp;#34; at work with this one the most of any deodorant I&#x27;ve worn. Nicest thing about this scent is that it compliments Tommy Bahama&#x27;s St. Barts, Nautica&#x27;s Discovery and the Bath and Body Works Midnight for Men. Those range from musky to clean scents and it&#x27;s tough sometimes to find deodorant that still holds strong without clashing or fading. Biggest bonus is the Dove for Men deodorants are all really great with my sensitive skin. Never had any hint of an issue with any of these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell, it smells soapy.</li>
            <li> Sucks. Doesn&#x27;t last at all and wears off after only a couple of hours without strenuous activity. I use other deodorants and anti perspiration and they work fine. And I thought this was the white powder stick deordorant but it turned out to be a clear gel. Wish i could return it but it isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;ll go out and buy some anti-perspirant or old spice. I&#x27;m heavily disappointed. It lasts for about 4-6 hours and then wears off. 48 hour lie.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh sent and long lasting,</li>
            <li> Great price with the subscription deal and 5 other items.</li>
            <li> Item as Advertised and Fast Shipping.  Thank you-</li>
            <li> The best, not a strong scent(perfect for work) but protect like no other. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> IT KEEPS YOU DRY ALL DAY,AND KEEP YOU SMELLING FRESH AND CLEAN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. What is there to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather go with the Silver version... This one has a bit of a detergent like smell. I also think that this product&#x27;s advertized protection is way shorter (again compared to the silver)</li>
            <li> the best men&#x27;s line out there.</li>
    </ol>
