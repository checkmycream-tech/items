            <li>In the summer, I use this and then sunscreen, and that would be perfect for my skin.  </li>

            <li>It has a constancy more like a serum, but it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Good experience tks seller</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good to remember that even holy grail products that work for 1000000 users may not work out for you.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>So happy that I have a huge bottle of it...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all even after reading all the reviews on putting it on lightly damp skin patting it in.....</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing as a toner, moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nice hydration.</li>
            <li>Wonderful to find hyaluronic acid at such great price.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and works well with making your own lotion masks.  </li>
            <li>This item is, as you probably know already if you are reading this review, extremely popular in Japan.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li>I used all kind of moisturizers, from inexpensive up to $400 a jar.</li>
            <li>Has a nice airy fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice moist barrier on my skin.</li>
            <li>This particular seller also has the best price.</li>
            <li>and I found an organic product I normally use for Aztec clay masks that was perfect for the lotion mask</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a bottle handy to pour the lotion into because the pouch is not resealable.  </li>
            <li>It feels exactly like what&#x27;s in the sheet masks, a glycerin based liquidy gel feeling substance, but I do not find it doing any kind of miracles to my skin or the effects that great.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>This lotion absolutely SOFTENS the skin beautifully making serum and makeup application 200 percent more effective.</li>
            <li>This lotion helped to more effectively moisturize my face without making it create more oil.</li>
            <li>but when I saw that it actually moisturizes NICELY, it was great!  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid is a great facial product, this one bottle lasts a good two months even when used generously morning and night, but this is not a moisturizer and does not stand on its own as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The product is more liquidly,and scentless.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is truly magic for your face.</li>
            <li>Amazing oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;ll try this again</li>
            <li>I am purchasing more.:)</li>
            <li>I now use a moisturizing cream with Matrixyl, and Argireline on top of this Rohto Hyaluronic Lotion.</li>
            <li>An okay moisturizing toner, but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Amazon has noticed the increase in orders :)</li>
            <li>Product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>but more like a toner/astringent.</li>
            <li>I love it, use it instead of toner.</li>
            <li>love love</li>
            <li>: I now use this before my acids and essences; it works well like this as I find the products I use after absorb so much better than by themselves.</li>
            <li>Lets whatever you put on top of it absorb so much better, no scent, no stickiness.</li>
            <li>and this is ok for me</li>
            <li>but I know I&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
            <li>I like this product, just don&#x27;t love it yet.</li>
            <li>I also love soaking cotton pads and making a mask out of this.</li>
            <li>I love this and will reorder.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I heard about this</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>No break out at all, In fact, my face are more plump and healthy now, thank to this cult product.</li>
            <li>NO idea why when so many raved about it.</li>
            <li>I love this for preparing my face before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has no mineral oil, parabens, or fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is more like a toner.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Before using this, my face looks sallow, now it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for  3-4 years now.</li>
            <li>I have friends who have asked me, what are you doing, you look so much more youthful?</li>
            <li>More of a serum than a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect thing to wear before moisturizer to give your face extra plump and moisture</li>
            <li>I would describe this more as a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; than lotion.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and with a combo of this lotion and exfoliating, most of my flaky skin is gone</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this and read the reviews.</li>
            <li>The first week of use was really good</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I realized that this moisturizer is most effective when you continuously rub the product into your skin in circular massaging motions until its sticky and absorbed.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and smooth, but make sure you get the milky lotion to go with it!</li>
            <li>Pretty satisfied with this one! :)</li>
            <li>The light version might have been more suited to my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin evened out nicely, and I rarely get a pimple now (knock on wood).</li>
            <li>in a warm and moist environment (usually right after a shower), patting until it&#x27;s all sunken</li>
            <li>When I need more moisture, i like to use a heavier night cream, But this stuff is great for daily use.</li>
            <li>Highly effective &#x27;first step&#x27; in skincare.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes super well!</li>
            <li>Ok first off I didn&#x27;t get the product I bought!</li>
            <li>At first I liked it and it felt like it got my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a huge bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li>In the winter, I mix this with 2 drops of Josie Marana Argan Oil Light, and that would provide sufficient moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Sound like an acid</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for not only your skin, but also your hair!  </li>
            <li>I use this every morning, and it feels so smooth putting it on.  </li>
            <li>always get compliments on how smooth and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Smooth skin after applying this.</li>
            <li>I use this on my neck and chest as well, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I can even put regular unscented baby lotion of my face in conjunction with this and still get great moisture.</li>
            <li>It works by attracting the available moisture in the air and &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; it into your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay and soothing and fun</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it alone, which is why I combine the Smooth Lotion with it.</li>
            <li>It plumps the skin and helps it to retain moisture beautifully all day or night long.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth and light.</li>
            <li>As usual wonderful lotion.</li>
            <li>I was able to see results from first time of use.</li>
            <li>I realized after massaging it into my skin (like I do after I use a face mask and the leftover liquid is on my face) until its gone or sticky, my skin feels smooth, cool, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>this is very moisturizing and good if you&#x27;re doing microneedling (sinks in really good then) or using retin A where your skin is flaking and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in texture, moisture, or clarity using this product or doing the lotion masks</li>
            <li>Also, I avoid the sun, I take long walks while enjoying the sunset, I listen to soft music while I walk, thinking kind thoughts, feeling good about myself and the world.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you&#x27;re not getting full use out of this wondrous liquid.    </li>
            <li>I did the mask in hopes that my face would cool off...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it really amps up any creams I use and makes them even more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>There is a lot here, so it will last for a good two to three months.</li>
            <li>I use this AND the Hadalabo milk, mostly because I accidentally bought the milky stuff when I intended to buy the lotion (the bottles look so much alike).</li>
            <li>The light weight lotion keeps my skin moist so that my moisturizer I put on after is absorbed well.</li>
            <li>Good for summer only.</li>
            <li>But people who are used to a more simple skincare routine, I feel like it would do more for them.</li>
            <li>Will most likely repurchase unless I find something better.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly without greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Is not enough for most skintypes, you will need another mosturizer (this is more like a booster)</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my fine lines and large pores disappear after using this.</li>
            <li>The stickiness isn&#x27;t unwelcoming and its brief, you just have to give it a moment and also stop touching!</li>
            <li>I will purchase the other kind some suplier!</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel (rose), sprayed on face until wet&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: Ole Henricksen Sheer Transformation, massaged into face in combination with toner</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clear, healthy, and supple.</li>
            <li>Honestly from all the positive reviews, I was fully expecting a better than average result.</li>
            <li>right after I wash my face morning and night under my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>bought this on it&#x27;s own at first (not enough).  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My method is usually patting my lotions into my skin which have been a great fool proof way for me but</li>
            <li>, it feels pampering, but I&#x27;m not sure the great reviews are so warranted.</li>
            <li>I use this almost everyday and afterwards my face feels angelic, how could there be such a wonderful product in this world.</li>
            <li>Locking in the water nicely on my face and neck after only about one minute of gently padding.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for people living in north east coast area where the weather is extremely dry in the winter and this item is good at helping moisturing</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and then put another moisturizer on top of it (I live in a very dry area, if it was more humid I might not need both).</li>
            <li>If you are doing a multiple step skincare this will be your first step, unless you are using a very light essence (like SK-II) or a pH dependent product (like a glycolic acid serum or a retinoid); those will be first.</li>
            <li>It should be noted though, that this is labeled as a Japanese lotion--which means for most westerners, it&#x27;s what we would consider a hydrating toner.</li>
            <li>But for winter this in combination with a lotion is more than enough.</li>
            <li>Merchandise looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I was aware of this when I bought it, but just saying in case others need clarification on it.  </li>
            <li>I had read about this on a review of 50 best beauty products, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember where.  </li>
            <li>Very like it !</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>usually seal it in with a good oily moisturizer before I go to bed (and right after I take off the mask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a clear liquid that is absorbed quickly into the face.</li>
            <li>After washing my face and patting it dry I would pour a about a dime size (any more than this amount will take you awhile to get all of it absorbed) of the liquid and pat onto my face until I feel the stickiness.</li>
            <li>I am beginning to see an improvement in the texture and tone of my skin, which is fair, freckled, normally dry and usually sensitive.</li>
            <li>The baby is very like a knife face slippery, very comfortable, and later bought two bottles</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs through pretty fast, though.</li>
            <li>I have used a wrinkle repair cream for a long time mostly for the Hyaluronic acid in it.</li>
            <li>At first it seems very liquidy</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it doesnt really have that sticky feeling i used to have when I first used it.</li>
            <li>You do have to apply it a certain way by rubbing it into your hands then patting it onto your face until it feels very sticky and tacky.</li>
            <li>i have super acne prone/dry skin, and this product was wonderful to put on before my moisturizer while keeping my skin clear because of the non irritating simple ingredients :) and shipping came way before i expected!</li>
            <li>After it sinks it my skin still feels a bit sticky, but I add another moisturizer on top so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>Much like another reviewer I agree that you need to follow the cotton pad method of applying to your face.  </li>
            <li>They really do work in tandem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gentle for my skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out and ships fast.</li>
            <li>Now, if you put a wet sponge onto a paper towel, the towel gets more saturated and fully soaked with moisture.</li>
            <li>: This product is available in POUCH REFILL form (!), saving you valuable dollars off the price while being eco-friendly as well.    </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very supple and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps re-moisturize after cleansing.</li>
            <li>This liquid really gives my skin a plumping boost without causing breakouts.  </li>
            <li>my face loves this so much idk</li>
            <li>That what makes your skin looks fresh and young.</li>
            <li>also couple it with a light 50 SPF sunscreen in the summer for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>to the hyaluronic acid, the ingredient derives the moisture from the skin, so using a very moisturizing product afterwards is recommended, and works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**February</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use much each time.</li>
            <li>Tested it out on my skin but really haven&#x27;t tried it fully yet on my skin</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It has never broken out my skin either.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>A bit slippery-feeling, but that doesn&#x27;t happen as much if you use it in a steamy bathroom.</li>
            <li>As a face mask, it works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>my skin feel really supple and its affordable for the price, I will definitly repurchase.</li>
            <li>really seem to help that much.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle product that works.</li>
            <li>1, its straight up liquid, not a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like some people were describing it.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of tries to figure out an appropriate way to use it because I&#x27;m not used to this type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I started using this this twice a day and while the consistency is watery, it is very moisturizing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really seems to make a difference in how the follow moisturizer works.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture in from around it, it doesn&#x27;t provide much by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like water, but I really do feel my skin is softer when I use this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the smooth lotion from the same line, and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>It hydrates with a light fluid in a way that creams do not.</li>
            <li>and I find this very soothing and keeps me hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li>fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>but I ended up really liking it.  </li>
            <li>I also use a regular moisturizer, but this might be enough on it&#x27;s own for some people.</li>
            <li>It seems to be totally free of color and fragrance which is a major plus for my sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will still work for other people</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a rich face lotion this definitely isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>As a hydrating toner, it does well with helping my other skincare products absorb more easily, as well as moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
            <li>You will notice that your skin immediately feels more plump and slightly firmer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see the difference with the moisture in my skin, but i can say that it does make my face look more plump after a few uses.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toner, and you really only need 3 drops of this stuff for your entire face!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t remember if any particular products were recommended by the author.)  </li>
            <li>Usually I break out, or have a burn that lasts for days when I try new products, but this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this after my friend highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly suspicious about the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase and use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is meant to be used as a kind of lotion prior to putting other creams and serums on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually making a huge effect on my dry skin, but it feels good when I put it on</li>
            <li>I may be aging, but I am going down kicking and screaming all the way!  :-)</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel soft and plumped up.</li>
            <li>It may feel a bit sticky, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes your skin will have absorbed the loition and feel soft, smooth and plumped up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it well over a dozen times: under my Rodin oil at night, under my day time moisture cream and so on and it actually made me more dry...</li>
            <li>I could not easily discern that my skin was more hydrated.</li>
            <li>This one has a very smooth texture that is just slightly thicker than water, and one drop is enough for my whole face, and another two for my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>Its a new take on a face moisturizer in that it is a gel not a creme.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t mind the extra step because I enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li>then I apply my double c vitamin serum from Puritain&#x27;s Pride and let it dry, makes my 61 year old combination skin so smooth women stop me on the street and ask me what I use!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t super moisturizing if you have dry skin tho</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not sure why it is a holy grail of so many.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to this much hyaluronic acid in a product.</li>
            <li>Living in Singapore means I&#x27;m exposed to a hot and humid environment almost constantly, but this doesn&#x27;t wreak havoc on my oil control at all.</li>
            <li>My skin became 20years old!  </li>
            <li>If you use it on dry skin, all water is available is in deep tissue.</li>
            <li>Asian &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; are not what we think of as lotions/moisturizers: they&#x27;re not creams, but more like hydrating toners with a typically watery consistency.</li>
            <li>It really helps with other products absorbing, as well!</li>
            <li>I routinely follow-up with a moisturizer mixed with pure hylauronic acid.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin a little bit sticky, but not plump, about smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and as liquid as water so not a lotion like we in America are used to.</li>
            <li>lotion is a clear, viscous liquid.</li>
            <li>I feel like its because I already had an extensive skincare routine that adding a toner would do much for me.</li>
            <li>I might repurchase because it does make your face feel soft like mochi.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin so soft and bouncy, which is something I have never felt before.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 4,5 days and have no break-outs so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin, and I am always flaking from gycolic and salicylic peels.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and moisturized after using this.</li>
            <li>so who knows what my sensitive skin will look like tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Yes, yes, yes I&#x27;m into natural things</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my skin was just really soft to begin with, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Also, despite the instructions, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to follow this up with moisturiser and can go straight to sunblock without clogging my pores or breaking out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>My face stays moisturized far longer then if i use moisturizer alone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Weekly: Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
            <li>My face feels baby soft after.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in how moisturized my skin is when I use this, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My face is soft and silky now.</li>
            <li>Does take a while to absorb but it leaves the skin feeling soft, supple, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Does leave my skin soft AFTER the stickiness goes away.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing beneficial to my skin and left it feeling like there was a film on my face.  </li>
            <li>Lotion masks are thin cotton pads that you saturate with the Hada Labo and leave on your face for 3-5 minutes ( same thing as those pre-moistened Sheet Masks but more economical).</li>
            <li>few drops are more than enough.</li>
            <li>but it is actually more of a clear thick liquid.</li>
            <li>I introduced this to a good friend and now she is obsessed with it too</li>
            <li>Seriously, you won&#x27;t need more than five drops for your face.</li>
            <li>This is what japanese calls a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but by american standards this has the consistency of a toner and just like a toner is the first step after cleansing and helps to prepare the skin for the rest of your products.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;d say my face has been LESS oily than when I first started using this, no mean feat I can assure you.</li>
            <li>When I did that as well as rubbing only in the beginning, it made my skin dry (but most likely because the half the product stayed on the surface on my skin instead of absorbing.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t forget to wet your face first.</li>
            <li>However, please note that one has to pat the product down into your face until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Make sure your face is a little wet before applying so it absorbs easier.</li>
            <li>Very helpful in dry winter and rooms with heat.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This product is absolute must have for dry aging skin.</li>
            <li>Just adding this had really improved my dry skin.</li>
            <li>really takes care of dry scaling skin</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also keenly aware that America has some of the worst chemical guidelines for bodycare and cosmetics of most countries and thought Japan would be more rigid on these rules.</li>
            <li>, wait for my skin to clear and then start it back in to see.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so simple, make my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft in the morning after following this regime the night before!</li>
            <li>so I barely have to pat it in.</li>
            <li>Then gently pat your face, nose, eyes (being careful not to get any in them), neck and decoulette&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combo Asian</li>
            <li>This is purely Hyaluronic Acid; you have to use moisturizers with other wrinkle-fighting ingredients.</li>
            <li>After using this directly on the pads as suggested by Chizu Saeki (buy that book now), I went through a whole bottle in less than a month.  </li>
            <li>, then wet the pads with a Nalgene medical was bottle and put a silicone face mask over the whole shebang.  </li>
            <li>Started using it only a few days ago, but so far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky when it first goes on, give it a few minutes to soak in and you wont even notice that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li>Only a few drops go a long way and it&#x27;s easy to just pat on your skin and let it dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I find if I feel like a need a little more moisture that day I prefer to apply it on dry skin, and if I need less, on damp just after cleansing.</li>
            <li>(my skin is dry and sensitive) but not with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it has completely hydrated my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days, the dry patches completely cleared up</li>
            <li>, it only becomes sticky when its nearly dried on your face which isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>gentle patting is key) on damp skin, which also may cut down on the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Ulta sells this exact same item, but it&#x27;s more expensive for less product!</li>
            <li>Must just be me and my 54 year old very, very dry skin.</li>

            <li> In the summer, I use this and then sunscreen, and that would be perfect for my skin.  </li>

            <li> But it&#x27;s good to remember that even holy grail products that work for 1000000 users may not work out for you.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> So happy that I have a huge bottle of it...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all even after reading all the reviews on putting it on lightly damp skin patting it in.....</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing as a toner, moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice hydration.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to find hyaluronic acid at such great price.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and works well with making your own lotion masks.  </li>
            <li> This item is, as you probably know already if you are reading this review, extremely popular in Japan.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> I used all kind of moisturizers, from inexpensive up to $400 a jar.</li>
            <li> Has a nice airy fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice moist barrier on my skin.</li>
            <li> This particular seller also has the best price.</li>
            <li> and I found an organic product I normally use for Aztec clay masks that was perfect for the lotion mask</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a bottle handy to pour the lotion into because the pouch is not resealable.  </li>
            <li> It feels exactly like what&#x27;s in the sheet masks, a glycerin based liquidy gel feeling substance, but I do not find it doing any kind of miracles to my skin or the effects that great.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> This lotion absolutely SOFTENS the skin beautifully making serum and makeup application 200 percent more effective.</li>
            <li> This lotion helped to more effectively moisturize my face without making it create more oil.</li>
            <li> but when I saw that it actually moisturizes NICELY, it was great!  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is a great facial product, this one bottle lasts a good two months even when used generously morning and night, but this is not a moisturizer and does not stand on its own as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The product is more liquidly,and scentless.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is truly magic for your face.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> sure I&#x27;ll try this again</li>
            <li> I am purchasing more.:)</li>
            <li> I now use a moisturizing cream with Matrixyl, and Argireline on top of this Rohto Hyaluronic Lotion.</li>
            <li> An okay moisturizing toner, but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Amazon has noticed the increase in orders :)</li>
            <li> Product itself is ok.</li>
            <li> but more like a toner/astringent.</li>
            <li> I love it, use it instead of toner.</li>
            <li> love love</li>
            <li> : I now use this before my acids and essences; it works well like this as I find the products I use after absorb so much better than by themselves.</li>
            <li> Lets whatever you put on top of it absorb so much better, no scent, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> and this is ok for me</li>
            <li> but I know I&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, just don&#x27;t love it yet.</li>
            <li> I also love soaking cotton pads and making a mask out of this.</li>
            <li> I love this and will reorder.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I heard about this</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> No break out at all, In fact, my face are more plump and healthy now, thank to this cult product.</li>
            <li> NO idea why when so many raved about it.</li>
            <li> I love this for preparing my face before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I love how it has no mineral oil, parabens, or fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is more like a toner.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Before using this, my face looks sallow, now it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for  3-4 years now.</li>
            <li> I have friends who have asked me, what are you doing, you look so much more youthful?</li>
            <li> More of a serum than a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect thing to wear before moisturizer to give your face extra plump and moisture</li>
            <li> I would describe this more as a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; than lotion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and with a combo of this lotion and exfoliating, most of my flaky skin is gone</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this and read the reviews.</li>
            <li> The first week of use was really good</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I realized that this moisturizer is most effective when you continuously rub the product into your skin in circular massaging motions until its sticky and absorbed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and smooth, but make sure you get the milky lotion to go with it!</li>
            <li> Pretty satisfied with this one! :)</li>
            <li> The light version might have been more suited to my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin evened out nicely, and I rarely get a pimple now (knock on wood).</li>
            <li> in a warm and moist environment (usually right after a shower), patting until it&#x27;s all sunken</li>
            <li> When I need more moisture, i like to use a heavier night cream, But this stuff is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Highly effective &#x27;first step&#x27; in skincare.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly, and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes super well!</li>
            <li> Ok first off I didn&#x27;t get the product I bought!</li>
            <li> At first I liked it and it felt like it got my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a huge bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li> In the winter, I mix this with 2 drops of Josie Marana Argan Oil Light, and that would provide sufficient moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Sound like an acid</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for not only your skin, but also your hair!  </li>
            <li> I use this every morning, and it feels so smooth putting it on.  </li>
            <li> always get compliments on how smooth and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smooth skin after applying this.</li>
            <li> I use this on my neck and chest as well, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I can even put regular unscented baby lotion of my face in conjunction with this and still get great moisture.</li>
            <li> It works by attracting the available moisture in the air and &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; it into your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay and soothing and fun</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it alone, which is why I combine the Smooth Lotion with it.</li>
            <li> It plumps the skin and helps it to retain moisture beautifully all day or night long.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Goes on super smooth and light.</li>
            <li> As usual wonderful lotion.</li>
            <li> I was able to see results from first time of use.</li>
            <li> I realized after massaging it into my skin (like I do after I use a face mask and the leftover liquid is on my face) until its gone or sticky, my skin feels smooth, cool, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> this is very moisturizing and good if you&#x27;re doing microneedling (sinks in really good then) or using retin A where your skin is flaking and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in texture, moisture, or clarity using this product or doing the lotion masks</li>
            <li> Also, I avoid the sun, I take long walks while enjoying the sunset, I listen to soft music while I walk, thinking kind thoughts, feeling good about myself and the world.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;re not getting full use out of this wondrous liquid.    </li>
            <li> I did the mask in hopes that my face would cool off...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it really amps up any creams I use and makes them even more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> There is a lot here, so it will last for a good two to three months.</li>
            <li> I use this AND the Hadalabo milk, mostly because I accidentally bought the milky stuff when I intended to buy the lotion (the bottles look so much alike).</li>
            <li> The light weight lotion keeps my skin moist so that my moisturizer I put on after is absorbed well.</li>
            <li> Good for summer only.</li>
            <li> But people who are used to a more simple skincare routine, I feel like it would do more for them.</li>
            <li> Will most likely repurchase unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly without greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Is not enough for most skintypes, you will need another mosturizer (this is more like a booster)</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my fine lines and large pores disappear after using this.</li>
            <li> The stickiness isn&#x27;t unwelcoming and its brief, you just have to give it a moment and also stop touching!</li>
            <li> I will purchase the other kind some suplier!</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel (rose), sprayed on face until wet&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: Ole Henricksen Sheer Transformation, massaged into face in combination with toner</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clear, healthy, and supple.</li>
            <li> Honestly from all the positive reviews, I was fully expecting a better than average result.</li>
            <li> right after I wash my face morning and night under my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> bought this on it&#x27;s own at first (not enough).  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My method is usually patting my lotions into my skin which have been a great fool proof way for me but</li>
            <li> , it feels pampering, but I&#x27;m not sure the great reviews are so warranted.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday and afterwards my face feels angelic, how could there be such a wonderful product in this world.</li>
            <li> Locking in the water nicely on my face and neck after only about one minute of gently padding.</li>
            <li> highly recommended for people living in north east coast area where the weather is extremely dry in the winter and this item is good at helping moisturing</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and then put another moisturizer on top of it (I live in a very dry area, if it was more humid I might not need both).</li>
            <li> If you are doing a multiple step skincare this will be your first step, unless you are using a very light essence (like SK-II) or a pH dependent product (like a glycolic acid serum or a retinoid); those will be first.</li>
            <li> It should be noted though, that this is labeled as a Japanese lotion--which means for most westerners, it&#x27;s what we would consider a hydrating toner.</li>
            <li> But for winter this in combination with a lotion is more than enough.</li>
            <li> Merchandise looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I was aware of this when I bought it, but just saying in case others need clarification on it.  </li>
            <li> I had read about this on a review of 50 best beauty products, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember where.  </li>
            <li> Very like it !</li>
            <li> Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> usually seal it in with a good oily moisturizer before I go to bed (and right after I take off the mask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a clear liquid that is absorbed quickly into the face.</li>
            <li> After washing my face and patting it dry I would pour a about a dime size (any more than this amount will take you awhile to get all of it absorbed) of the liquid and pat onto my face until I feel the stickiness.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to see an improvement in the texture and tone of my skin, which is fair, freckled, normally dry and usually sensitive.</li>
            <li> The baby is very like a knife face slippery, very comfortable, and later bought two bottles</li>
            <li> /&gt;It runs through pretty fast, though.</li>
            <li> I have used a wrinkle repair cream for a long time mostly for the Hyaluronic acid in it.</li>
            <li> At first it seems very liquidy</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it doesnt really have that sticky feeling i used to have when I first used it.</li>
            <li> You do have to apply it a certain way by rubbing it into your hands then patting it onto your face until it feels very sticky and tacky.</li>
            <li> i have super acne prone/dry skin, and this product was wonderful to put on before my moisturizer while keeping my skin clear because of the non irritating simple ingredients :) and shipping came way before i expected!</li>
            <li> After it sinks it my skin still feels a bit sticky, but I add another moisturizer on top so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Much like another reviewer I agree that you need to follow the cotton pad method of applying to your face.  </li>
            <li> They really do work in tandem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gentle for my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out and ships fast.</li>
            <li> Now, if you put a wet sponge onto a paper towel, the towel gets more saturated and fully soaked with moisture.</li>
            <li> : This product is available in POUCH REFILL form (!), saving you valuable dollars off the price while being eco-friendly as well.    </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very supple and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps re-moisturize after cleansing.</li>
            <li> This liquid really gives my skin a plumping boost without causing breakouts.  </li>
            <li> my face loves this so much idk</li>
            <li> That what makes your skin looks fresh and young.</li>
            <li> also couple it with a light 50 SPF sunscreen in the summer for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> to the hyaluronic acid, the ingredient derives the moisture from the skin, so using a very moisturizing product afterwards is recommended, and works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**February</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use much each time.</li>
            <li> Tested it out on my skin but really haven&#x27;t tried it fully yet on my skin</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It has never broken out my skin either.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> A bit slippery-feeling, but that doesn&#x27;t happen as much if you use it in a steamy bathroom.</li>
            <li> As a face mask, it works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> my skin feel really supple and its affordable for the price, I will definitly repurchase.</li>
            <li> really seem to help that much.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle product that works.</li>
            <li> 1, its straight up liquid, not a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like some people were describing it.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to figure out an appropriate way to use it because I&#x27;m not used to this type of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I started using this this twice a day and while the consistency is watery, it is very moisturizing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really seems to make a difference in how the follow moisturizer works.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture in from around it, it doesn&#x27;t provide much by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like water, but I really do feel my skin is softer when I use this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the smooth lotion from the same line, and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> It hydrates with a light fluid in a way that creams do not.</li>
            <li> and I find this very soothing and keeps me hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> but I ended up really liking it.  </li>
            <li> I also use a regular moisturizer, but this might be enough on it&#x27;s own for some people.</li>
            <li> It seems to be totally free of color and fragrance which is a major plus for my sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will still work for other people</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a rich face lotion this definitely isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> As a hydrating toner, it does well with helping my other skincare products absorb more easily, as well as moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> You will notice that your skin immediately feels more plump and slightly firmer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see the difference with the moisture in my skin, but i can say that it does make my face look more plump after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner, and you really only need 3 drops of this stuff for your entire face!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t remember if any particular products were recommended by the author.)  </li>
            <li> Usually I break out, or have a burn that lasts for days when I try new products, but this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my friend highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly suspicious about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase and use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is meant to be used as a kind of lotion prior to putting other creams and serums on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually making a huge effect on my dry skin, but it feels good when I put it on</li>
            <li> I may be aging, but I am going down kicking and screaming all the way!  :-)</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel soft and plumped up.</li>
            <li> It may feel a bit sticky, but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes your skin will have absorbed the loition and feel soft, smooth and plumped up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it well over a dozen times: under my Rodin oil at night, under my day time moisture cream and so on and it actually made me more dry...</li>
            <li> I could not easily discern that my skin was more hydrated.</li>
            <li> This one has a very smooth texture that is just slightly thicker than water, and one drop is enough for my whole face, and another two for my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> Its a new take on a face moisturizer in that it is a gel not a creme.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t mind the extra step because I enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> then I apply my double c vitamin serum from Puritain&#x27;s Pride and let it dry, makes my 61 year old combination skin so smooth women stop me on the street and ask me what I use!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t super moisturizing if you have dry skin tho</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is a holy grail of so many.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to this much hyaluronic acid in a product.</li>
            <li> Living in Singapore means I&#x27;m exposed to a hot and humid environment almost constantly, but this doesn&#x27;t wreak havoc on my oil control at all.</li>
            <li> My skin became 20years old!  </li>
            <li> If you use it on dry skin, all water is available is in deep tissue.</li>
            <li> Asian &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; are not what we think of as lotions/moisturizers: they&#x27;re not creams, but more like hydrating toners with a typically watery consistency.</li>
            <li> It really helps with other products absorbing, as well!</li>
            <li> I routinely follow-up with a moisturizer mixed with pure hylauronic acid.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin a little bit sticky, but not plump, about smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and as liquid as water so not a lotion like we in America are used to.</li>
            <li> lotion is a clear, viscous liquid.</li>
            <li> I feel like its because I already had an extensive skincare routine that adding a toner would do much for me.</li>
            <li> I might repurchase because it does make your face feel soft like mochi.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin so soft and bouncy, which is something I have never felt before.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 4,5 days and have no break-outs so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin, and I am always flaking from gycolic and salicylic peels.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and moisturized after using this.</li>
            <li> so who knows what my sensitive skin will look like tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, yes I&#x27;m into natural things</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin was just really soft to begin with, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Also, despite the instructions, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to follow this up with moisturiser and can go straight to sunblock without clogging my pores or breaking out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My face stays moisturized far longer then if i use moisturizer alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Weekly: Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
            <li> My face feels baby soft after.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in how moisturized my skin is when I use this, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My face is soft and silky now.</li>
            <li> Does take a while to absorb but it leaves the skin feeling soft, supple, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Does leave my skin soft AFTER the stickiness goes away.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing beneficial to my skin and left it feeling like there was a film on my face.  </li>
            <li> Lotion masks are thin cotton pads that you saturate with the Hada Labo and leave on your face for 3-5 minutes ( same thing as those pre-moistened Sheet Masks but more economical).</li>
            <li> few drops are more than enough.</li>
            <li> but it is actually more of a clear thick liquid.</li>
            <li> I introduced this to a good friend and now she is obsessed with it too</li>
            <li> Seriously, you won&#x27;t need more than five drops for your face.</li>
            <li> This is what japanese calls a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but by american standards this has the consistency of a toner and just like a toner is the first step after cleansing and helps to prepare the skin for the rest of your products.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say my face has been LESS oily than when I first started using this, no mean feat I can assure you.</li>
            <li> When I did that as well as rubbing only in the beginning, it made my skin dry (but most likely because the half the product stayed on the surface on my skin instead of absorbing.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t forget to wet your face first.</li>
            <li> However, please note that one has to pat the product down into your face until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Make sure your face is a little wet before applying so it absorbs easier.</li>
            <li> Very helpful in dry winter and rooms with heat.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> This product is absolute must have for dry aging skin.</li>
            <li> Just adding this had really improved my dry skin.</li>
            <li> really takes care of dry scaling skin</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also keenly aware that America has some of the worst chemical guidelines for bodycare and cosmetics of most countries and thought Japan would be more rigid on these rules.</li>
            <li> , wait for my skin to clear and then start it back in to see.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so simple, make my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft in the morning after following this regime the night before!</li>
            <li> so I barely have to pat it in.</li>
            <li> Then gently pat your face, nose, eyes (being careful not to get any in them), neck and decoulette&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combo Asian</li>
            <li> This is purely Hyaluronic Acid; you have to use moisturizers with other wrinkle-fighting ingredients.</li>
            <li> After using this directly on the pads as suggested by Chizu Saeki (buy that book now), I went through a whole bottle in less than a month.  </li>
            <li> , then wet the pads with a Nalgene medical was bottle and put a silicone face mask over the whole shebang.  </li>
            <li> Started using it only a few days ago, but so far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky when it first goes on, give it a few minutes to soak in and you wont even notice that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops go a long way and it&#x27;s easy to just pat on your skin and let it dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I find if I feel like a need a little more moisture that day I prefer to apply it on dry skin, and if I need less, on damp just after cleansing.</li>
            <li> (my skin is dry and sensitive) but not with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it has completely hydrated my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days, the dry patches completely cleared up</li>
            <li> , it only becomes sticky when its nearly dried on your face which isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> gentle patting is key) on damp skin, which also may cut down on the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ulta sells this exact same item, but it&#x27;s more expensive for less product!</li>
            <li> Must just be me and my 54 year old very, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day after I wash my face; you only need a couple of drops as a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, at 28 my skin has not looked this clear or been this soft since I was a small child.</li>
            <li> I had a hysterectomy two years ago when I was 35, and in the past year (thanks to surgical menopause)</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> These did not remove the few lines on my face, but I have not gotten  new ones, either, so I consider this maintenance.</li>
            <li> See, if your skin is dry, simply applying the lotion doesn&#x27;t allow it to fully penetrate.</li>
            <li> I tried it multiple times before my moisturizing step and each time ended up with dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long, long way!  </li>
            <li> Especially,  when the weather is cold n dry, my face needs more moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was causing small, itchy white and clear bumps to pop up all over my face.</li>
            <li> It came from Japan, but it didn&#x27;t take long time and no damage.  </li>
            <li> this product convinced me to check out other japanese skincare product</li>
            <li> Other sellers are selling tiny bottles of this (30 ml) for almost $20!</li>
            <li> I adore the facial mask mentioned by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> By the law of osmosis, the moist hyaluronic acid soaks into the dry skin when it has a chance to be wetter, longer, in contact with the dermis.    </li>
            <li> my hair has become dry, curly, and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, dehydration and acne</li>
            <li> My cheeks are still a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Do not apply it to dry skin.</li>
            <li> After some time of using it on dry skin it will make your face looking even dryer.</li>
            <li> It immediately rescues my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, aging skin, and no moisturizers or anything</li>
            <li> I still end up with dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin and thought, &amp;</li>
            <li> Combats my dry wonter skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I was waking up to dry patches on my face (which I never had before)</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even wear foundation because of the dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any dry patches for 5 months already.</li>
            <li> With this product, once I pat it dry, I then apply a night cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the bottle will last you a loooot.</li>
            <li> Even works on my KP arms and my partner&#x27;s dry elbows (he ordered some immediately!).</li>
            <li> It had dramatically helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this before it is a lot thinner than a typical Western lotion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any product that could produce such results in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this daily during my facial cleansing routine by applying a small amount with my fingers and massaging it in and twice a week with a paper mask for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually apply my sunscreen after this and before anything else (unless is a physical sunscreen those are always last step before makeup)</li>
            <li> But it is not rich enough for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Now I wet my face with water then put the lotion all over my face</li>
            <li> To properly use this lotion, do what thousands of Japanese and Asian women do with this product: peel cotton pads into thin layers, saturate, then let sit on skin for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not really a fault of the product</li>
            <li> I am using this not only everyday, but I use the one with retinol at night and also 2x a month when a use my dermaroller.  </li>
            <li> Did not really do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face moisturized especially in the harsh winter and using retin-a.  </li>
            <li> The texture is not really something you&#x27;d expect (it feels almost like water)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always noticed that whenever I use this product, my skin is far less oily than it usually is.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> 1 bottle/ month if using it as toner twice a day and mask every other day.</li>
            <li> I usually have to apply face lotion constantly throughout the day</li>
            <li> I put this on my face before lotion and other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; s also extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist and doesn&#x27;t react with any of my other skincare.</li>
            <li> This can be used on other areas than just the face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problem with stickiness that other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few ways and well, just even more dry :(</li>
            <li> I just place a few drop into my hands (a little goes a long way) and pat it onto my face after I wash it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of bang for your buck and goes to show you don&#x27;t have to pay an insane amount for a good beauty product.</li>
            <li> You may notice the package label changed slightly.</li>
            <li> This applies like a serum, so it&#x27;s slightly sticky until it dries.</li>
            <li> have oily/combination skin, but contrary to what others have remarked it takes less than a minute for my skin to suck up all of this watery goodness,</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even hit half the bottle yet.  </li>
            <li> the moist version might be giving me a small amount of closed comedones, though.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you risk it dtawing moisture from your skin, and leaving you tight and/or</li>
            <li> and it is way less messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stop for a little bit</li>
            <li> You need to buy the little paper pill masks and soak them in this stuff...then put on your face and sit there for a while.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if other sellers would send it in a bottle and not the pouch.</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s the Japanese secret to using it?</li>
            <li> Now that I am using this, I will stop purchasing Benefit Porefessional which did help shrink my pores but is too heavy on my pocket.</li>
            <li> All I can say is buy it and use it everyday-</li>
            <li> This was just a few minutes ago</li>
            <li> I like that it is not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> needs to be dried up.</li>
            <li> but it ended it up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just use a few drops of this and spread it on.</li>
            <li> However, for it to work you have to remember a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair when I get out of the shower, and it helps tame the frizz and define the curls without leaving my hair oily looking.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product, I purchased a face cream with hyaluronic acid and it barely lasted two weeks and was twice as expensive and didn&#x27;t even work as well.  </li>
            <li> this will be my secret little ingredient for a LONG time!!!</li>
            <li> I was unable to read instructions since there is no English.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product and am not SURE yet</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount to my skin and patted it on until it became tacky.</li>
            <li> I did not love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s weird to think that oily skin needs moisture too because we are taught that dry skin needs moisture and oily skin</li>
            <li> I found the flow out of the bottle hard to control.  </li>
            <li> But its not amazing or anything.</li>
            <li> Thick toner, as it always is.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Chemicals on your skin can make you just as sick systemically as ingesting them although it effects you differently!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; is a liquid/toner consistency and boosts moisture retention without irritating my reactive, clog-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the Daison cotton pulled into thin layers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic change in my skin, but it does not cause any allergy or problems either.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it as a base layer for your other skin care products.</li>
            <li> and it was fairly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider myself highly skeptical when it comes to skincare; you could go on and on about the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of this ingredient over that, or</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not that expensive in comparison.  </li>
            <li> awful never buy this stuff waste of money!</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, my face and eyes swelled up so badly that I had to get a steroid prescription.</li>
            <li> Tip: the cotton pads to use with this technique are: [[ASIN:B00260T94K Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs - 80 sheets]]    </li>
            <li> Worthless in every way.</li>
            <li> After I use this product I don&#x27;t need to buy expensive department cosmetics!!!!</li>
            <li> I have the worst oily, dehydrated skin ever.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it. But its not amazing or anything. I feel like its because I already had an extensive skincare routine that adding a toner would do much for me. But people who are used to a more simple skincare routine, I feel like it would do more for them.</li>
            <li> Thick toner, as it always is. Very helpful in dry winter and rooms with heat.&lt;br /&gt;Just learned to use it with 5-layer cotton puffs when reading reviews, and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;It runs through pretty fast, though. 1 bottle/ month if using it as toner twice a day and mask every other day.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy way to add more moisture to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great</li>
            <li> Is this one of those products that removes melanin?</li>
            <li> Much like another reviewer I agree that you need to follow the cotton pad method of applying to your face.  Hints:  After using this directly on the pads as suggested by Chizu Saeki (buy that book now), I went through a whole bottle in less than a month.  I found the flow out of the bottle hard to control.  Now I wet my face with water then put the lotion all over my face, then wet the pads with a Nalgene medical was bottle and put a silicone face mask over the whole shebang.  I get really great results and it is way less messy.  I also have used one bottle in five months as opposed to one month.  This lotion absolutely SOFTENS the skin beautifully making serum and makeup application 200 percent more effective.</li>
            <li> what everyone else said.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my friend highly recommended it.  It&#x27;s a lot of bang for your buck and goes to show you don&#x27;t have to pay an insane amount for a good beauty product.</li>
            <li> Needs some instructions!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My skin feels clean and smooth, but make sure you get the milky lotion to go with it! They really do work in tandem.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on as soon as I get out of the shower and then apply the milky lotion...I usually have to apply face lotion constantly throughout the day (my skin is dry and sensitive) but not with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on it&#x27;s own at first (not enough).  I love 2 day shipping!</li>
            <li> Gentle for my skin. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the second bottle of this now.  I have combination to oily skin.  In the summer, I use this and then sunscreen, and that would be perfect for my skin.  In the winter, I mix this with 2 drops of Josie Marana Argan Oil Light, and that would provide sufficient moisture to my skin.  I&#x27;ve just ordered Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Milky Lotion and will see if I can use it alone for my winter skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this 2 months ago, compared to the shiseido face lotion, this one absorbs quicker in the skin which i like. The product is more liquidly,and scentless. I might repurchase because it does make your face feel soft like mochi. Pretty satisfied with this one! :)</li>
            <li> amazing!! i have super acne prone/dry skin, and this product was wonderful to put on before my moisturizer while keeping my skin clear because of the non irritating simple ingredients :) and shipping came way before i expected!</li>
            <li> Love it for toner purpose! When I want to use a light and hydrating toner this is the one I reach for!! Everyone need some of that hydrologic acid!! Sound like an acid but it is not!!!</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday and afterwards my face feels angelic, how could there be such a wonderful product in this world. I will buy this again and again. I do not know why this isn&#x27;t sold everywhere cuz it&#x27;s amazing. Doesn&#x27;t break me out and ships fast.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a must-have item. But what&#x27;s the Japanese secret to using it? LOTION MASKS. If you haven&#x27;t read Chizu Saeki&#x27;s book on Japanese anti-aging skincare techniques, get thee over to that Amazon page now and put it in your cart! Otherwise, you&#x27;re not getting full use out of this wondrous liquid.    Lotion masks are thin cotton pads that you saturate with the Hada Labo and leave on your face for 3-5 minutes ( same thing as those pre-moistened Sheet Masks but more economical). By the law of osmosis, the moist hyaluronic acid soaks into the dry skin when it has a chance to be wetter, longer, in contact with the dermis.    See, if your skin is dry, simply applying the lotion doesn&#x27;t allow it to fully penetrate. it&#x27;s like spraying a paper towel with water. What happens? it evaporates and gets even drier or crunchier. Now, if you put a wet sponge onto a paper towel, the towel gets more saturated and fully soaked with moisture. Same theory with the lotion masks.    To properly use this lotion, do what thousands of Japanese and Asian women do with this product: peel cotton pads into thin layers, saturate, then let sit on skin for 3-5 minutes. You will see a VAST difference in plumping + hydration with this synergistic technique vs. just applying the product on your face.    Tip: the cotton pads to use with this technique are: [[ASIN:B00260T94K Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs - 80 sheets]]    Money-Saving Tip: This product is available in POUCH REFILL form (!), saving you valuable dollars off the price while being eco-friendly as well.    You may notice the package label changed slightly. Hada Labo has changed the packaging graphics but the formula is still the same.</li>
            <li> Broke outy face. Stopped using it since then.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for not only your skin, but also your hair!  I had a hysterectomy two years ago when I was 35, and in the past year (thanks to surgical menopause) my hair has become dry, curly, and frizzy.  I use this on my hair when I get out of the shower, and it helps tame the frizz and define the curls without leaving my hair oily looking.</li>
            <li> coool, water or hydration for my face.. use it according to the Japanese Skincare Revolution book and your set.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning, and it feels so smooth putting it on.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic change in my skin, but it does not cause any allergy or problems either.</li>
            <li> I have dry, dehydration and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my Holy Grail (HG) skin hydrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so soft and bouncy, which is something I have never felt before.</li>
            <li> Nice hydration. Will most likely repurchase unless I find something better.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Started using it only a few days ago, but so far, I really like it.  Leaves your skin feeling very supple and hydrated.  I use it every night using the japanese lotion mask method (layering Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs - 80 sheets drenched in this lotion on your face and leaving it for 10 minutes).  It works wonders.  Remember to apply moisturizer after you remove the cotton sheets.  Love this!</li>
            <li> i use this twice daily however I can&#x27;t say  I see any difference.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It is a clear liquid that is absorbed quickly into the face. I have used it for about 4,5 days and have no break-outs so far.</li>
            <li> Good experience tks seller</li>
            <li> This is fantastic! I use it after my toner and it really helps re-moisturize after cleansing. After it sinks it my skin still feels a bit sticky, but I add another moisturizer on top so it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> As usual wonderful lotion.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing. But it is not rich enough for my combination skin. My cheeks are still a bit dry.</li>
            <li> Wow! Great product. Hyaluronic Acid gel to apply after your toner and moisturizer. I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin, and I am always flaking from gycolic and salicylic peels. I get sweat-related acne and 5-10 cystic bumps per month now that I am on a low-glycemic index diet to prevent blood sugar spikes which seemed to be making the cystic acne flare. I had to switch to an oil-free moisturizer during the day and my face felt parched by noon. This liquid really gives my skin a plumping boost without causing breakouts.  It&#x27;s also a huge bottle for the price.  It seems to be totally free of color and fragrance which is a major plus for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my regimen in order:&lt;br /&gt;Cleansers: PTR glycolic cleanser and or Vichy Normaderm .5% salicylic acid cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Toner: Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel (rose), sprayed on face until wet&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer: Ole Henricksen Sheer Transformation, massaged into face in combination with toner&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply this product to damp skin, let it sink in for 10 mins or so&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen: La Roche Posay SPF 30</li>
            <li> This is truly magic for your face. It should be noted though, that this is labeled as a Japanese lotion--which means for most westerners, it&#x27;s what we would consider a hydrating toner. So this would be applied after cleansing to help draw all sorts of delicious moisture to your face. It really helps with other products absorbing, as well! It is now a staple in my routine.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this before it is a lot thinner than a typical Western lotion. It has a constancy more like a serum, but it a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Highly effective &#x27;first step&#x27; in skincare.</li>
            <li> After I use this product I don&#x27;t need to buy expensive department cosmetics!!!! it&#x27;s so simple, make my skin soft and moist. Love it!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous. Hydrates. Moisturizes. Protects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil free moisturizer. It really makes my skin feel soft and plumped up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see the difference with the moisture in my skin, but i can say that it does make my face look more plump after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The first week of use was really good but I notice now that my skin is flaky in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I&#x27;ll try this again</li>
            <li> my face loves this so much idk why</li>
            <li> English translations, please.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful lotion. I used it just for two days and already I can see a difference in my skin. I am purchasing more.:)</li>
            <li> best lotion ever with very reasonable price! this product convinced me to check out other japanese skincare product</li>
            <li> I have used a wrinkle repair cream for a long time mostly for the Hyaluronic acid in it. Then they came up with all the fuss about this Rohto Hyaluronic Lotion, so I decided to try it. Hyaluronic Acid is a great facial product, this one bottle lasts a good two months even when used generously morning and night, but this is not a moisturizer and does not stand on its own as a moisturizer. This is purely Hyaluronic Acid; you have to use moisturizers with other wrinkle-fighting ingredients. I now use a moisturizing cream with Matrixyl, and Argireline on top of this Rohto Hyaluronic Lotion. These did not remove the few lines on my face, but I have not gotten  new ones, either, so I consider this maintenance. For my age I have very good complexion, and I intend to &amp;#34;plod on against the tide,&amp;#34; hence this morning-and-night ritual that I follow like a religion. Also, I avoid the sun, I take long walks while enjoying the sunset, I listen to soft music while I walk, thinking kind thoughts, feeling good about myself and the world. These work great against wrinkles as well!!</li>
            <li> Wow! This product is absolute must have for dry aging skin. Mine now looks 10 years younger. I was able to see results from first time of use. After few weeks I cant even believe my skin condition improved so much without any effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to warn users of this product who saying its sticky when they apply it. It means your skin is not hydrated enough. Do not apply it to dry skin. Use it after the shower or using a steamer. Hyaluronic acid &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; water and holds it. That what makes your skin looks fresh and young. If you use it on dry skin, all water is available is in deep tissue. After some time of using it on dry skin it will make your face looking even dryer. So don&#x27;t forget to wet your face first.</li>
            <li> goes on a like a toner. great moisturizer for someone like me with oily skin</li>
            <li> An okay moisturizing toner, but nothing to write home about. Not sure why it is a holy grail of so many.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I have very sensitive skin and have to be very careful what I use.  Only problem:  I was unable to read instructions since there is no English.  I simply read the questions and answers, and that helped me. The item arrived quickly, and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I just place a few drop into my hands (a little goes a long way) and pat it onto my face after I wash it. No need to use a cotton ball. It may feel a bit sticky, but that&#x27;s normal. You will notice that your skin immediately feels more plump and slightly firmer. I also noticed that my skin evened out nicely, and I rarely get a pimple now (knock on wood). This is definitely a go-to product and I recommend it as a base layer for your other skin care products.</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. It dries quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased almost all versions of this product and I&#x27;m never disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how smooth and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;I also couple it with a light 50 SPF sunscreen in the summer for extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even got my mom hooked! I&#x27;m sure Amazon has noticed the increase in orders :)</li>
            <li> Smooth skin after applying this. Amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Product itself is ok. I&#x27;ve used it before when I lived in Asia. However, I received it in a pouch refill form aka a plastic bag. I don&#x27;t have a bottle to pour this in! That&#x27;s not what it looks like in the picture! For this reason, 3 stars only.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it&#x27;s not lotion but more like a toner/astringent. I don&#x27;t think there is any alcohol in it. I put this on my face before lotion and other products. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable! I haven&#x27;t used any product that could produce such results in less than 3 minutes. My face feels so soft and moisturized after using this. However, please note that one has to pat the product down into your face until it is absorbed. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind the extra step because I enjoy the experience. I also noticed that my fine lines and large pores disappear after using this. I think it works to plump up the skin. Though the effect will be only temporary, it lasts me through the day. Now that I am using this, I will stop purchasing Benefit Porefessional which did help shrink my pores but is too heavy on my pocket.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re several questions about the texture of this product, so I&#x27;ve included a picture of the toner itself. The texture is watery, like Vitamin C serum. Amazing! Doesn&#x27;t overwhelm or breakout my oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always noticed that whenever I use this product, my skin is far less oily than it usually is. It&#x27; s also extremely moisturizing. I use this on my neck and chest as well, and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I use it twice a day after I wash my face; you only need a couple of drops as a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I love it, use it instead of toner. It keeps my skin moist and doesn&#x27;t react with any of my other skincare. I don&#x27;t battle acne, but it hydrates so well that i bet it would do wonders for it. love love and it will definitely be a staple</li>
            <li> All I can say is buy it and use it everyday- you will be amazed!!! Instant improvement!! I am switching to all Japanese products!!</li>
            <li> As a hydrating toner, it does well with helping my other skincare products absorb more easily, as well as moisturizing my dry skin. I immediately use this after [[ASIN:B0036MDUEM Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam - 160ml]] in a warm and moist environment (usually right after a shower), patting until it&#x27;s all sunken in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the hyaluronic acid, the ingredient derives the moisture from the skin, so using a very moisturizing product afterwards is recommended, and works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**February 2016: I now use this before my acids and essences; it works well like this as I find the products I use after absorb so much better than by themselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this twice and it lasts forevvvvvver. Lets whatever you put on top of it absorb so much better, no scent, no stickiness. Really amazing product!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; is a liquid/toner consistency and boosts moisture retention without irritating my reactive, clog-prone skin.  The bottle is huge.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Ok first off I didn&#x27;t get the product I bought! I ordered a toner like product to use for a lotion mask. What I got was the same brand but a tube of foaming cleanser. Which I tried and it made my face burn and turn red. This was just a few minutes ago so who knows what my sensitive skin will look like tomorrow. I thought since I had it I should try it. At first I liked it and it felt like it got my skin squeaky clean. Then I added moisturizer and started to turn in for the night. This was when I felt my skin heat up and it was fairly uncomfortable. It&#x27;s been about 15 minutes or so and I found an organic product I normally use for Aztec clay masks that was perfect for the lotion mask (Herirage Store Rosewater &amp;glycerine, if you must know). I did the mask in hopes that my face would cool off... Nope!!&lt;br /&gt;In inspecting this product line a bit closer I discovered that along with the benefits of hyluronic acid it&#x27;s got some not so good chemicals in it! Yes, yes, yes I&#x27;m into natural things but I&#x27;m also keenly aware that America has some of the worst chemical guidelines for bodycare and cosmetics of most countries and thought Japan would be more rigid on these rules. I should have done my homework before ordering these products! Chemicals on your skin can make you just as sick systemically as ingesting them although it effects you differently! Do some digging about methylparabens and you&#x27;ll see what I mean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not order this again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually making a huge effect on my dry skin, but it feels good when I put it on and I don&#x27;t need to use much each time. I&#x27;m thinking of buying the cotton pads and making it into a moisture mask but for now it&#x27;s summer and this is ok for me</li>
            <li> I like that it is not too heavy or greasy. Its a new take on a face moisturizer in that it is a gel not a creme. When I need more moisture, i like to use a heavier night cream, But this stuff is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Tested it out on my skin but really haven&#x27;t tried it fully yet on my skin but I know I&#x27;m going to love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, just don&#x27;t love it yet. You really don&#x27;t need a lot of it. But for winter this in combination with a lotion is more than enough. It has never broken out my skin either.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, my face and eyes swelled up so badly that I had to get a steroid prescription.</li>
            <li> This is meant to be used as a kind of lotion prior to putting other creams and serums on. I&#x27;ve noticed that it really amps up any creams I use and makes them even more moisturizing. I can even put regular unscented baby lotion of my face in conjunction with this and still get great moisture. I also love soaking cotton pads and making a mask out of this. It immediately rescues my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me--my skin might just not be compatible with hyaluronic acid. I tried it multiple times before my moisturizing step and each time ended up with dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Husband noticed a big difference in my skin. Leaves skin clear, healthy, and supple.</li>
            <li> I bought this in May and have been using it for a couple of months now. After washing my face and patting it dry I would pour a about a dime size (any more than this amount will take you awhile to get all of it absorbed) of the liquid and pat onto my face until I feel the stickiness. Then I would apply my daily moistures and treatments. It definitely helps lock in all the moisturizers. My face feels so soft in the morning after following this regime the night before! I&#x27;ve also used this before applying a face mask and had good results! This bottle will last me for maybe over a year.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Merchandise looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer for oily skin or dehydrated skin. I have combination skin, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my oilier areas feeling like a greaseball. Ulta sells this exact same item, but it&#x27;s more expensive for less product!</li>
            <li> Edited: I eventually had to stop using this product. It was causing small, itchy white and clear bumps to pop up all over my face. Once I stopped using it they went away. Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to this much hyaluronic acid in a product. I&#x27;m sure this will still work for other people it&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird to think that oily skin needs moisture too because we are taught that dry skin needs moisture and oily skin needs to be dried up. This lotion helped to more effectively moisturize my face without making it create more oil. I use this after my acid toners and before my serums/essences.</li>
            <li> Only just added this product to my skin care regimen recently but it has already become a Holy Grail Product. I just pat this on my face after washing and before moisturizing. Just adding this had really improved my dry skin. It works by attracting the available moisture in the air and &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; it into your skin. It is a bit sticky when it first goes on, give it a few minutes to soak in and you wont even notice that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> The baby is very like a knife face slippery, very comfortable, and later bought two bottles</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have the worst oily, dehydrated skin ever. This stuff helps me moisturizer my face, but does not make it greasy. There is a lot here, so it will last for a good two to three months. I love this and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes super well! A bit slippery-feeling, but that doesn&#x27;t happen as much if you use it in a steamy bathroom. Sometimes I soak up a cotton mask and leave it on for 15 min or so, and my skin is left suuuper supple. I have a feeling the moist version might be giving me a small amount of closed comedones, though. The light version might have been more suited to my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to find hyaluronic acid at such great price.</li>
            <li> 3 drops of this mixed with 3 drops of Timeless hyralunic acid spray my face then I apply my double c vitamin serum from Puritain&#x27;s Pride and let it dry, makes my 61 year old combination skin so smooth women stop me on the street and ask me what I use!</li>
            <li> As a face mask, it works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for aspirin face masks too.</li>
            <li> This applies like a serum, so it&#x27;s slightly sticky until it dries. But it&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing. Even works on my KP arms and my partner&#x27;s dry elbows (he ordered some immediately!). So happy that I have a huge bottle of it...I might use it everywhere, not just my face!</li>
            <li> really takes care of dry scaling skin</li>
            <li> This can be used on other areas than just the face. I use it on my arms and hands and it takes 10-15 years off them instantly.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try product and very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I really love this. Asian &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; are not what we think of as lotions/moisturizers: they&#x27;re not creams, but more like hydrating toners with a typically watery consistency. This one has a very smooth texture that is just slightly thicker than water, and one drop is enough for my whole face, and another two for my neck and chest. Since it is hyaluronic acid, it may work best for you to spread and then pat it in (not rub! gentle patting is key) on damp skin, which also may cut down on the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling if that bothers you, although it goes away after a minute or so either way. I find if I feel like a need a little more moisture that day I prefer to apply it on dry skin, and if I need less, on damp just after cleansing. Give it a minute or two to fully soak in then apply the moisturizer of your choice: I find I only need tiny dots of mine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, at 28 my skin has not looked this clear or been this soft since I was a small child.</li>
            <li> Provides great hydration for the skin.  Dries quickly without greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  I was looking for something that would moisturize without making my face break out and feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;This moist lotion is great.  It has a nice smell and works well with making your own lotion masks.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and am not SURE yet but it may be the culprit to some recent breakouts. I&#x27;m going to stop for a little bit, wait for my skin to clear and then start it back in to see.  Not really a fault of the product, I may be allergic to an ingredient in the formulation. But it&#x27;s good to remember that even holy grail products that work for 1000000 users may not work out for you. Always patch test!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner, and you really only need 3 drops of this stuff for your entire face! This isn&#x27;t super moisturizing if you have dry skin tho so i would advice using a serum or moisturizer after using this. my skin feel really supple and its affordable for the price, I will definitly repurchase.</li>
            <li> This item is, as you probably know already if you are reading this review, extremely popular in Japan. I have dry, aging skin, and no moisturizers or anything really seem to help that much. I still end up with dry patches on my face. Not anymore! The lotion really helps lock in moisture, and best of all, it feels great (not sticky or gooey). You do have to apply it a certain way by rubbing it into your hands then patting it onto your face until it feels very sticky and tacky. Don&#x27;t worry, though, as that sticky feeling dissipates. I use this AND the Hadalabo milk, mostly because I accidentally bought the milky stuff when I intended to buy the lotion (the bottles look so much alike).</li>
            <li> Worthless in every way. No plumping, moisturizing, just garbage. Leaves your skin a little bit sticky, but not plump, about smooth.  JUNK. When it dries, it looks like you forgot to wash the egg off your face. I&#x27;m highly suspicious about the ingredients. I doubt this actually is HLA. Throw away quality a scam. Burn your money instead. You could possibly exfoliate with the ashes. F-</li>
            <li> IT  WAS GOOOD!!~~ JUST AS DESCRIBED~</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin was just really soft to begin with, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Very good service &amp; products!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite improvement in my skin since using this. It is a gentle product that works. I have dry skin but it might be too sticky for people with oilier skin.</li>
            <li> This is great. I&#x27;m so glad I heard about this and Amazon sells it.  I use just a drop right after I wash my face morning and night under my moisturizer.  It gives you that extra moisture boost.  It&#x27;s clear and as liquid as water so not a lotion like we in America are used to. Once it dries it is not sticky so don&#x27;t let that worry you.  This bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Try this lotion. It will change your skin. I love it. Make sure your face is a little wet before applying so it absorbs easier.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a rich face lotion this definitely isn&#x27;t it. I indeed read the reviews on this lotion before purchasing it and all was well before I actually put the product on my face. 1, its straight up liquid, not a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like some people were describing it. 2, it only becomes sticky when its nearly dried on your face which isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing. I had higher hopes for this product but it ended it up being a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider myself highly skeptical when it comes to skincare; you could go on and on about the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of this ingredient over that, or how absolutely &#x27;essential&#x27; some product is to my (nonexistent) skin regimen till the cows come home, and I&#x27;d just go home and forget all about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried this, and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/combination skin, but contrary to what others have remarked it takes less than a minute for my skin to suck up all of this watery goodness, so much so I barely have to pat it in. Living in Singapore means I&#x27;m exposed to a hot and humid environment almost constantly, but this doesn&#x27;t wreak havoc on my oil control at all. In fact, I&#x27;d say my face has been LESS oily than when I first started using this, no mean feat I can assure you. Also, despite the instructions, I don&#x27;t find it necessary to follow this up with moisturiser and can go straight to sunblock without clogging my pores or breaking out. My skin has never looked and felt so good!</li>
            <li> The light weight lotion keeps my skin moist so that my moisturizer I put on after is absorbed well. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all. I have been using this product for 3 years and love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It plumps the skin and helps it to retain moisture beautifully all day or night long. I use it twice a day as second step in my regime. I only need 5 drops(about size of a dime) yes, trust me it will be plenty. Apply the drops to your palm and then rub your hands togethers to coat palms and fingers. Then gently pat your face, nose, eyes (being careful not to get any in them), neck and decoulette&#x27;. As the product begins to work it will become sticky but do not worry this is only temporary. Within a few minutes your skin will have absorbed the loition and feel soft, smooth and plumped up. I am beginning to see an improvement in the texture and tone of my skin, which is fair, freckled, normally dry and usually sensitive. It is called a lotion but it is actually more of a clear thick liquid. I will continue to purchase and use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of tries to figure out an appropriate way to use it because I&#x27;m not used to this type of moisturizer. My method is usually patting my lotions into my skin which have been a great fool proof way for me but for this one i realized that the patting motion is ineffective. When I did that as well as rubbing only in the beginning, it made my skin dry (but most likely because the half the product stayed on the surface on my skin instead of absorbing. I realized that this moisturizer is most effective when you continuously rub the product into your skin in circular massaging motions until its sticky and absorbed. The stickiness isn&#x27;t unwelcoming and its brief, you just have to give it a moment and also stop touching! I realized after massaging it into my skin (like I do after I use a face mask and the leftover liquid is on my face) until its gone or sticky, my skin feels smooth, cool, and moisturized. I really like it and I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple of weeks or months to see how my skin changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> awful never buy this stuff waste of money!</li>
            <li> I started using this this twice a day and while the consistency is watery, it is very moisturizing on my skin.  A little goes a long way.  I will defintely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  I absolutely love it!  At first it seems very liquidy (is that a word? lol) but when I saw that it actually moisturizes NICELY, it was great!  I am using this not only everyday, but I use the one with retinol at night and also 2x a month when a use my dermaroller.  I may be aging, but I am going down kicking and screaming all the way!  :-)</li>
            <li> I use this daily during my facial cleansing routine by applying a small amount with my fingers and massaging it in and twice a week with a paper mask for 15 minutes. It had dramatically helped my dry skin! I will be using this product for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. This is what japanese calls a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, but by american standards this has the consistency of a toner and just like a toner is the first step after cleansing and helps to prepare the skin for the rest of your products. Unlike and american toner this is a mosturizer not a cleansing product. Is not enough for most skintypes, you will need another mosturizer (this is more like a booster) If you are doing a multiple step skincare this will be your first step, unless you are using a very light essence (like SK-II) or a pH dependent product (like a glycolic acid serum or a retinoid); those will be first. I usually apply my sunscreen after this and before anything else (unless is a physical sunscreen those are always last step before makeup)</li>
            <li> this thing is like a glass of water for your skin</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> highly recommended for people living in north east coast area where the weather is extremely dry in the winter and this item is good at helping moisturing</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  My skin became 20years old!  I am 50th!  It came from Japan, but it didn&#x27;t take long time and no damage.  I will purchase the other kind some suplier!</li>
            <li> I like it !!!! Especially,  when the weather is cold n dry, my face needs more moisturizer. This is the best!!! 👍👍</li>
            <li> I use this with the Daison cotton pulled into thin layers. It feels exactly like what&#x27;s in the sheet masks, a glycerin based liquidy gel feeling substance, but I do not find it doing any kind of miracles to my skin or the effects that great. It&#x27;s okay and soothing and fun, it feels pampering, but I&#x27;m not sure the great reviews are so warranted. I will keep using and update my review.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. No break out at all, In fact, my face are more plump and healthy now, thank to this cult product.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing toner lives up to the hype! Been using for around a month. My skin loves all of the hyaluronic acid goodness.  It feels healthier and I&#x27;ve stopped having days in which my skin suddenly goes oily even though it&#x27;s summer. I smear on after my actives-- or time given with a diy sheet mask. Holy Grail product!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this and read the reviews. I have EXTREMELY dry skin and thought, &amp;#34;oh boy&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve used it well over a dozen times: under my Rodin oil at night, under my day time moisture cream and so on and it actually made me more dry... NO idea why when so many raved about it. Must just be me and my 54 year old very, very dry skin. I wasn&#x27;t happy with it at all even after reading all the reviews on putting it on lightly damp skin patting it in..... and so on. I tried it a few ways and well, just even more dry :(</li>
            <li> I love this for preparing my face before moisturizing. It really seems to make a difference in how the follow moisturizer works. My face stays moisturized far longer then if i use moisturizer alone. I just use a few drops of this and spread it on. While my face is still damp with this I spread on the moisturizer and let it sink in.&lt;br /&gt;My Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Step One: Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil&lt;br /&gt;Step Two: Trader Joes Nourish All In One Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step Three: Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion&lt;br /&gt;Step Four: Hyaluronic Acid Sleeping Gel Mask Moisturize Sleeping Pack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weekly: Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Combats my dry wonter skin like nothing else. However, for it to work you have to remember a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this is a hyaluronic acid toner (in Japan toners are known as lotions). Hyaluronic acid is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture in from around it, it doesn&#x27;t provide much by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is always best to apply this on damp skin and follow up with a moisturiser, so the lotion has external moisture to draw from. Otherwise, you risk it dtawing moisture from your skin, and leaving you tight and/or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is a clear, viscous liquid. Heavier than water, but lighter than a gel. Application may feel a bit sticky, but after you follow up with your moisturiser that will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops are more than enough. Seriously, you won&#x27;t need more than five drops for your face. A little goes a long way, and the bottle will last you a loooot.</li>
            <li> I was order this lotion and a mask.  But, I only got my mask not this lotion.  Bed seller..</li>
            <li> It feels like water, but I really do feel my skin is softer when I use this. I don&#x27;t have any problem with stickiness that other reviewers mentioned. I will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> This is a great product and zero smell!!!!  Love it &amp; use it every day.  A tiny bit goes a long, long way!  ***** 5 stars *****</li>
            <li> Honestly from all the positive reviews, I was fully expecting a better than average result. I applied a small amount to my skin and patted it on until it became tacky. I could not easily discern that my skin was more hydrated. I routinely follow-up with a moisturizer mixed with pure hylauronic acid. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product but will likely not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 6 months- it has completely hydrated my dry skin. I moved from Singapore back to the East Coast, USA in October 2013 and my skin immediately went berserk. I used all kind of moisturizers, from inexpensive up to $400 a jar. Absolutely nothing worked. I was waking up to dry patches on my face (which I never had before) and I couldn&#x27;t even wear foundation because of the dry skin. I decided to give this a go, and it was the best decision I ever made regarding my skin. Within 2 days, the dry patches completely cleared up and I haven&#x27;t had any dry patches for 5 months already. I use this with the Hada Labo moisturizer, which is also a life saver. I love how it has no mineral oil, parabens, or fragrance. Patting it into your face is the way to go. This particular seller also has the best price. Other sellers are selling tiny bottles of this (30 ml) for almost $20! I use this twice a day, morning and night. If I don&#x27;t use this, my skin just doesn&#x27;t feel hydrated enough. I introduced this to a good friend and now she is obsessed with it too and she has oily/combination skin. Anyone can and should use this product!</li>
            <li> This is more like a toner.  Not a lotion.  I was aware of this when I bought it, but just saying in case others need clarification on it.  I did not love it.  Did not really do much for my skin. I did need something hydrating now that it is winter.  With this product, once I pat it dry, I then apply a night cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that moisturizing. Good for summer only.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Locking in the water nicely on my face and neck after only about one minute of gently padding. I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the smooth lotion from the same line, and it has done wonders for my skin. Goes on super smooth and light. Has a nice airy fragrance to it. My face feels baby soft after. I would use this as sort of like a &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t use it alone, which is why I combine the Smooth Lotion with it.</li>
            <li> very good toner. Plumps my face immediately . Before using this, my face looks sallow, now it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use this twice a day after applying Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% BHA and before my serum. I also sometimes use it on my chest and hands. I really notice a difference in how moisturized my skin is when I use this, especially around my eyes. I also use a regular moisturizer, but this might be enough on it&#x27;s own for some people. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever put on my face! This toner boosts the hydrating properties of any essences or creams I put on after.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for  3-4 years now. In my opinion, it doesnt really have that sticky feeling i used to have when I first used it. But, thats probably after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Found it by a fluke on Amazon, and dont want to be without it now! It hydrates with a light fluid in a way that creams do not. My skin is ultra dry and I find this very soothing and keeps me hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> You need to buy the little paper pill masks and soak them in this stuff...then put on your face and sit there for a while. this is very moisturizing and good if you&#x27;re doing microneedling (sinks in really good then) or using retin A where your skin is flaking and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I usually seal it in with a good oily moisturizer before I go to bed (and right after I take off the mask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_http://www.amazon.com/Skin-Facial-Paper-Compress-Masque/dp/B008M74HZM/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1NG0MWY8SNFVGJG5PZ33</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Gave to my daughter for a present . She said she looks 30 again! She is 46😍</li>
            <li> I had read about this on a review of 50 best beauty products, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t remember where.  Love this! I have friends who have asked me, what are you doing, you look so much more youthful? I just say i drink water! LOL! this will be my secret little ingredient for a LONG time!!!</li>
            <li> This moist lotion is just what I needed. I used the Benton Aloe BHA lotion and I think I am allergic for some of the ingredients. This Hadalabo lotion is perfect for my skin! I apply oil and moisturizing cream to seal in the moisture of this lotion. It lasts all day! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great item here fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combo Asian skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product didn&#x27;t make my skin breakout so I&#x27;m happy about that.  I purchased it to use as a lotion mask as described in The Japanese Skincare Revolution book.  (I don&#x27;t remember if any particular products were recommended by the author.)  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant improvement in texture, moisture, or clarity using this product or doing the lotion masks so I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI that the product arrived in a pouch not a bottle.  (Think of a juice pack like Capri Sun.)  Make sure you have a bottle handy to pour the lotion into because the pouch is not resealable.  Once you open it you will need to dispense it into a container.  I purchased this from Value&#x27;s Japan so I&#x27;m not sure if other sellers would send it in a bottle and not the pouch.</li>
            <li> I pat this on after I use toner. You only need about three drips. Looks like water but feels slippery. It&#x27;s been about two months and I&#x27;m only a quarter of the way through the bottle. Creates a nice moist barrier on my skin.</li>
            <li> More of a serum than a moisturizer but this stuff is great. I use it twice a day and then put another moisturizer on top of it (I live in a very dry area, if it was more humid I might not need both). Item was shipped on time and the bottle lasts quite a while, it&#x27;s an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product each morning and night for one week. It is amazing as a toner, moisturizer. Usually I break out, or have a burn that lasts for days when I try new products, but this lotion is amazing. My face loves it. My son and husband noticed an improvement in my face after 24 hours of using this product. I adore the facial mask mentioned by other reviewers. This stuff has done wonders for me!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Ive went through bottles of it and it&#x27;s the perfect thing to wear before moisturizer to give your face extra plump and moisture</li>
            <li> Loooove it!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product. My face is soft and silky now.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Does take a while to absorb but it leaves the skin feeling soft, supple, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Works well with my skin type and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, non-sticky too.</li>
            <li> Does leave my skin soft AFTER the stickiness goes away. Don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very like it ! I will definetly buy again and again. Recommend it ! Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> Great lotion that works.  Moisturizes well and my skin feels firmer and healthier.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing beneficial to my skin and left it feeling like there was a film on my face.  I read that this product mimicked Shiseido&#x27;s product but it just isn&#x27;t so.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I use this every night as it does take a while to tap the product in.  It keeps my face moisturized especially in the harsh winter and using retin-a.  Would repurchase when I finish off the bottle.  It probably will last me a couple months as all you need is 2 drops.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> I would describe this more as a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; than lotion.  The texture is not really something you&#x27;d expect (it feels almost like water) but I ended up really liking it.  Only a few drops go a long way and it&#x27;s easy to just pat on your skin and let it dry in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been through tons of facial products and lotions, but this one is a keeper.  Plus, it&#x27;s not that expensive in comparison.  Before I purchased this product, I purchased a face cream with hyaluronic acid and it barely lasted two weeks and was twice as expensive and didn&#x27;t even work as well.  I purchased the hadolabo lotion maybe over a month ago and I haven&#x27;t even hit half the bottle yet.  It doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and with a combo of this lotion and exfoliating, most of my flaky skin is gone</li>
