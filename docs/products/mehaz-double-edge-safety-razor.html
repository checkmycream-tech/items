            <li>This is a fairly good razor for the price, it give a fairly good shave and is easy to use, it may be the blades I am using that is giving a lower quality shave.</li>

            <li>I changed my blade choice from Derby &amp;#34;I will never use Derby ever again&amp;#34; to Astra platinum I got an amazing shave.</li>

            <li>The razor has a nice heft to it.</li>
            <li>And again, the shave was nice and close</li>
            <li>#2 is Feather Popular.</li>
            <li>I just decided it would be nice to have a razor with a longer handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice razor.</li>
            <li>Mechanically it works well and provided a safe shave, making it a good choice as a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nicely manufactured, great design, this razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nicely made with a good finish and seems to seat the blade better than most.</li>
            <li>Sometimes new isn&#x27;t always the best!  </li>
            <li>Very nice razor and mild on the shave.</li>
            <li>Is does a very good job at giving me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Very well machined, fit, finish and blade alignment are awesome, and a very safe, comfortable shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great starter and first time safety razor.</li>
            <li>The Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor is a great buy for the first time</li>
            <li>The size and weight make it very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>it is VERY light weight.</li>
            <li>This razor is from Germany, it&#x27;s well made, of good quality materials, and easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Bought it, use it and Love it.  </li>
            <li>More cuts than the multi-blade models, but that&#x27;s what being a man is all about.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Better spend $10 more and get a Parker 99R or Parker 22R.</li>
            <li>I am sooooooooooo glad I listened to myself and bought this one.</li>
            <li>I had to check over and over again to make sure the blade was in correctly.</li>
            <li>This is a relatively inexpensive yet excellent safety razor.</li>
            <li>Short strokes work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Most safety razors are chrome plated brass.</li>
            <li>I will continue to experience more of this type of razors.</li>
            <li>Low cost - great results!</li>
            <li>SHAVES BETTER THAN</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nicely machined,  and handsome finish.</li>
            <li>(works well, but is mostly plastic) seem cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an okay razor.</li>
            <li>The finish is so much more appealing than the shiny chrome.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Got to love their craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>There was that magic butter again.</li>
            <li>After checking out numerous consumer reviews, I settled on the Mehaz along with a pack of Persona blades, both of which got excellent reviews for the most part.</li>
            <li>Upon searching, I notice one by    Edward London &amp; Co. that had no reviews, however, the photo and description seemed appealing</li>
            <li>I have used several safety razors but this razor is the best.</li>
            <li>Also the shaving experience is more akin to a feeling of scraping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I could go longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They claim it is made in Germany, but it came in a cheap paper box wrapped in rice paper!</li>
            <li>The razor does seem to shave better than the</li>
            <li>both were inexpensive and the Mehaz branded one is definitely better.</li>
            <li>But a friend told me I needed a better razor</li>
            <li>Take your time and you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I think that would work better for my purpose.</li>
            <li>but I prefer something a bit more aggressive.</li>
            <li>, I do like that one better.  </li>
            <li>It has more weight and a longer handle.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this butterfly razor.  </li>
            <li>best for the money no cuts at all the only razor I recommend for beginners you would not regret it.</li>
            <li>just right, good feel and heft.</li>
            <li>The weight is right on and has a good balance.</li>
            <li>Love the butterfly opening style of the razor, very easy to clean and change blades.  </li>
            <li>that angle is found it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I used a Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge blade to shave with and it was a perfect shave, nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I suspected the good initial result was because of the blade rather than the razor, which is why I have been alternating blades with good results with each.  </li>
            <li>The shave was so smooth I had to check about 5 times to make sure the blade was even touching my face.</li>
            <li>nice razor, works great, wish I would have gotten a longer handled one, but that is personal preference.  </li>
            <li>single double-edge razor blade is the best way to shave.</li>
            <li>and I got the closest smoothest most comfortable shave without nicks and razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap and some times it cost me more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I prefer the three piece design, as it provides a more secure lock on the blade</li>
            <li>Very maneuverable and the stippling cuts on the handle give a good grip (I shave in the shower.).</li>
            <li>Good quality and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>If you want a good, painless, fast, easy shave</li>
            <li>This results in a smooth, great shave, without the cuts, nicks, or razor burn, and I have fairly sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild and not aggressive at all.</li>
            <li>I started shaving with one of these type razors many years ago and didn&#x27;t really remember what kind of shave you can get with one.</li>
            <li>You can get a great shave and save some major money...</li>
            <li>The finish is satin rather than polished which is fine.  </li>
            <li>Mehaz razor looks great and is not very aggressive (although aggressiveness depends more on the blades, of course).</li>
            <li>easy to keep clean, unlike multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>Great shave, especially if you use oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You as a consumer have to remember that not everyone is the same, you cannot make everyone happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I feel this razor is worth way more than they are charging for</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li>has smooth open/close</li>
            <li>I must sound like I work forMehaz</li>
            <li>I once more look forward daily to a nice, refreshing shave.  </li>
            <li>my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and no irritation or bumps.</li>
            <li>The mechanism is smooth, and not glitchy.</li>
            <li>So save you money just buy this one and skip buying the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>It is immaculately machined, and the fit and finish, and the alignment of the blade to the head is spot on.</li>
            <li>Which makes for a close, and irritation free shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the closest first time pass shave, but, for first timers that&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s a good product for what it is, just don&#x27;t be surprised when you can&#x27;t get as close a shave with it.</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;Parker is a shade more aggressive if it is not handled right.</li>
            <li>I have a EJ DE89 that I use every day and this Actually shaves better!!</li>
            <li>The Mehaz on the other hand it incredibly engineered.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth and clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li>No cuts &amp; feels BBS clean burn free shave.</li>
            <li>Good materials and build, easy to open and replace the blade.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this  for a travel shaver</li>
            <li>In summary, they arrived sooner than the initial delivery estimate, following which I enjoyed the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li>My Scottish heritage has always made me cringe at having to pay fifteen bucks or so for five blades that never really gave me a good shave--no more.</li>
            <li>Although they certainly do well, when I finally use them up, I may switch from the Personas to Wilkinsons, the ones I liked best &#x27;way back when.</li>
            <li>Trying different blades to find the right feel, This razor is well made, great quality</li>
            <li>I keep my De89 for special occasions</li>
            <li>After today this might be my favorite razor and for anyone that has shaved with a Vintage Gillette to say that is really saying something.</li>
            <li>Maybe make an adjustable version, but really, I can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I should of believed the reviews when numerous people said buy a good razor.</li>
            <li>it really makes a difference and feels much better on the face as well.</li>
            <li>I have a Pearl travel razor, and it is the heaviest razor I have... even heavier than my full size razors, and as one reviewer said, once it is assembled, you cannot tell it is a travel</li>
            <li>The razor is not bad at all</li>
            <li>This is not bad quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great razor.</li>
            <li>In the harsh environment of the bathroom, stainless steel is best.</li>
            <li>Once you go double edge, you&#x27;ll never go back, and with this stylish razor and great shave, why wait?</li>
            <li>I like a quick easy shave that is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, my skin feels great and much, much less irritation than my Mach 3 disposable cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Seems very well made and cleans and operates easily.</li>
            <li>The butterfly design makes it easy and fast to change out the blade.  </li>
            <li>While the blade itself makes a big difference in your shaving experience, having a razor that holds the blade at exactly the angle and gap that works best for your face is essential.  </li>
            <li>When you are done, loosen the razor a bit by turning the handle, run it under the hot shower to clean it of debris, dip it (or spray it) with a bit of rubbing alcohol (to disperse rust causing water and to sanitize), and you are done.</li>
            <li>Very forgiving &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>These are made in Israel by the American Safety Razor Co. who make most blades available in the US.  </li>
            <li>Handle is a tad short, but still a nice razor.</li>
            <li>I am not a huge DE razor fanboy, but this one works great and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap razor in the blue case ($8 ) just to try out shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>But I also find myself reaching for it (or my Feather Popular) to touch up my problem areas that I have problems with, with a straight razor (under the neck, near the adams apple), if I want a truly BBS shave everywhere.</li>
            <li>a quick edit to cover a couple of things I missed the first time...</li>
            <li>it glides right over with no nicks&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my beard, which ranges from light (mid sideburns) to very heavy (neck and chin), this razor is the perfect razor.  </li>
            <li>However, it DOES provide a very safe, close shave, especially for the beginner, or for touch ups after a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>Since it is such a mild razor, I pair it with my most aggressive blades, like a Feather.</li>
            <li>Ok I have seen where people are saying this is really the Weishi cheap Chinese razor - and owning this one and the Weishi</li>
            <li>If you have a light beard or sensitive skin then this will be a great everyday razor.</li>
            <li>Including this one, I have 6 DE razors, 3 true straight razors, and 2 shavettes</li>
            <li>It is the lightest razor I own, with the possible exception of the partially plastic Feather Popular.</li>
            <li>I could learn to love using this razor with a little more practice.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve found that the blades sold at CVS seem to give a good shave, and last me about 4 to 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be true--it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t include anything, just comes in a box with the razor, but very fast</li>
            <li>A much better razor for beginners than some cheap other choices.</li>
            <li>I would at times get one or two with my first razor that came from the Shaving factory</li>
            <li>Sure enough it was</li>
            <li>This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but overall I love it.</li>
            <li>got the razor today, and have already had my first shave.</li>
            <li>It holds the blade in a reliable, exactly aligned position, so</li>
            <li>but it works VERY well!</li>
            <li>the same butter cutter I had before I knew what happened to that magic feeling.</li>
            <li>Also, I should not fail to mention the savings.</li>
            <li>The Germans are funny about things like that, so a lack of GERMANY on it and</li>
            <li>I will add one thing I recently started using shaving soap and a brush, now if you want to improve your shaving experience try one, it is so much better than the foam or gel creams and one thing</li>
            <li>I find that lighter razors like this one do better with lighter &amp;#34;gauge&amp;#34; blades such as the Feathers or Derbys that you can also buy on amazon.</li>
            <li>But, whereas they for some reason see that as a negative, I see it as a great thing.  </li>
            <li>It shaves almost like the Mehaz, but maybe a tiny bit more</li>
            <li>ordered the Mehaz along with the Utopia Care (a gold plated, good looking heavy razor).</li>
            <li>Not to heavy with a good balance point.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Mehaz razor to anyone who wants to try wet shaving using an old style double-edge safety razor (which is arguably the best way to shave).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other blades and believe the blades you use are far more critical to a good shave than the razor itself.  </li>
            <li>This shaves better, the blades are dirt cheap, and they can be used for a few days per blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;m going to be in love with that long handle on the Grande.</li>
            <li>I have read reviews after reviews on pretty much everything j buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first I flirted with the idea of a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I use persona blades nice and sharp and very inexpensive .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time user will find this double-edge razor to be very forgiving while he learns the technique of shaving with a double-edge.  </li>
            <li>but I question if it is really made in Germany since it looks exactly like a Weishi 9306 series razor.</li>
            <li>A long handle and a weighted head are most helpful when shaving with a DE blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m easily adopting to Mehaz double edge</li>
            <li>you these don&#x27;t shave as close or nearly as easy as a Schick or Gillette simple 3 blade .</li>
            <li>to conclude, I think the Mehaz is a fine razor if you like the satin finish, don&#x27;t have a coarse beard and prefer the butterfly design over a three piece.</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone who reviewed this razor.</li>
            <li>It seems that with the tempting inexpensive straight razors, you really get what you pay for; that was a non-starter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor</li>
            <li>For me, though, using this just confirmed that I prefer a traditional three piece shaver.</li>
            <li>much on aggressive razors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in solingen,Germany and it is very well made.</li>
            <li>I logged onto Amazon, much to my amazement</li>
            <li>but it gives a MUCH closer shave than any electric or disposable.</li>
            <li>but it is much easier for me to control.</li>
            <li>the cheap packaging leads me to believe it is masquerading as a German product (legally???).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very well made razor.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I use a three piece that cost twice as much when I&#x27;m home</li>
            <li>As you can see from the picture, the finish is not really chrome, but more of a satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen some people comment that this razor is so gentle</li>
            <li>, some reviewers have commented that it has a nice, heavy weight to it.</li>
            <li>This one is light, particularly in the head, and it is relatively short handled.  </li>
            <li>Since purchasing my Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor, I&#x27;ve learned that razors with four, five and even six edges don&#x27;t provide the satisfaction of a clean shave like an old-fashioned double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little light weight for my taste, and shaved a bit on the mild side.</li>
            <li>True German quality.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I came away from my first shave without a nick.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product that shaves very close with little irritation.  </li>
            <li>Lastly I would like to add that this razor has proven that it is possible to get a baby bottom smooth or bbs for short out of a very mild shaver.</li>
            <li>decent product, decent shave.</li>
            <li>My first safety razor, only nicked myself a couple of times in my first week with it.</li>
            <li>It actually turned out better than the Merkur I had earlier.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor for daily use as others have stated it has a mildly aggressive blade angle.</li>
            <li>saving lots of money in blades over the throw away razors, and gives a decent shave too</li>
            <li>But it is a decent razor for traveling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying this for a short time, I purchased a Merkur 33, which is a 3 three piece razor with a true chrome finish and a little more aggressive blade angle.  </li>
            <li>Still not a bad razor but a little to mild for my taste.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor for anyone.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer this one to a more expensive razor -- the Merkur Futur adjustable (which is, BTW, another great German product).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Slow and easy wins the race and gives me a very close shave (</li>
            <li>I love this little razor.</li>
            <li>Putting a top-quality blade in a poor quality razor isn&#x27;t any better than a lousy blade in the perfect razor.  </li>
            <li>but the cost savings makes the double edge razor worth it.</li>
            <li>Although it is in my rotation for normal shaving.</li>
            <li>This is the first Safety Razor I used after about a 40 year break, and the basic butterfly design hasn&#x27;t changed much.  </li>
            <li>They were good, but not great.</li>
            <li>That way new customers can relate a little more.</li>
            <li>It was OK I am new too safety razor shaving and kick my self everyday for not converting sooner.</li>
            <li>Not sure about going back to the good old double-edge?</li>
            <li>I got tempted to get more modern when I was young and foolish, but was never really satisfied with the shave I got from any of the cartridge systems, or my electric razor.</li>
            <li>but it shaves so well that it may turn in to my new every day shaver.</li>
            <li>and then it still won&#x27;t be up to par as the new 3 or 4 blades.</li>
            <li>It was hard to tell which blade was better since this razor is mild, even the feather produced similar results to the derby.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave four stars instead of five for this razor, is because for shaving my head a slightly longer handle might have been better for absolute control.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that nicks even with Gillette cartridges</li>
            <li>It is my first double edge razor and I bought it just to try it and to protect razor burns.</li>
            <li>Then I washed my face with pretty hot water &amp; Irish Spring leaving the Irish Spring on my face.</li>
            <li>Anyway I went back to no Irish Spring as a test, sure enough after&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, it&#x27;s the exact same razor as the Mehaz (how do they come up with these names?).</li>
            <li>I have a Weishi and this razor is exactly the same as that one.</li>
            <li>what is old is new again</li>
            <li>I did take my time and was amazed by the closeness of the shave from a single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try one, but go slow, use a good shaving cream or lotion and rinse the blade often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give something like the M&amp;uuml;hle Grande a chance when we get permanently moved into our new house but, even if I end up liking the Grande more, the Mehaz will make a terrific travel razor due to the short handle.</li>
            <li>This is a very &amp;#34;non-aggressive&amp;#34; razor, it needed several passes for my 3 day old beard.</li>
            <li>This is a clearly precision made device.</li>
            <li>several brands in a wide variety of prices turned out to be still available.</li>
            <li>The butterfly action has performed flawlessly so far.  </li>
            <li>I really like the satin brushed</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t cut my mole or any skin so far.</li>
            <li>To establish my perspective, I am 83 years old.</li>
            <li>The size is comparable to the old Gillette safety razors.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a close shave from a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>Wow, if I had known wet shaving was going to be so much fun, I would have done so 40 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But the double-edge blades are definitely cheaper, and I&#x27;ve been able to find them at a local Kroger that probably stocks them because a lot of foreign college students shop there.</li>
            <li>I now have nearly 200 blades I purchased for peanuts and won&#x27;t be needing more for a long, long, long time--</li>
            <li>Overall decent quality razor</li>
            <li>I was intimidated at first, but am glad I switched from the expensive disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>I think I want to try out a high end razor in the future just got to get over the cost.</li>
            <li>said if you are getting this expecting the same shave you can get as far as closeness as some of the new 3 and 4 blade plastic razors it won&#x27;t happen, maybe if your 16 and just started shaving.</li>
            <li>This was the first safety razor I bought when returning to the wet shaving scene.  </li>
            <li>those magic butter cutting shaves was washing my face with Irish Spring original bar soap.</li>
            <li>but I may go back to the plastic and use this as a back up or weekender when it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li>Back to my normal routine &amp; back to butter.</li>
            <li>The quality of the Mehaz seems to be a tad bit tighter, the finish on it is not cheap but is more or less a matte finish.</li>
            <li>you are a beginner to wet shaving, or have very sensitive skin, this is the razor for you!</li>
            <li>If you have never used this type of razor, be careful there is a learning curve, slow down enjoy a hot soapy shave, like your father, or grandfather did .  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants a less aggressive razor.</li>
            <li>paired the Mehaz with Personna blades and was a little nervous at first, flashing back to a teenage me with lots of t.p. on his face.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I have always preferred a butterfly opening razor and I particularly like the fact that with this one, once you tighten the blade down, it stays that way.  </li>

            <li> I am sooooooooooo glad I listened to myself and bought this one.</li>
            <li> I had to check over and over again to make sure the blade was in correctly.</li>

            <li> Short strokes work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Most safety razors are chrome plated brass.</li>
            <li> I will continue to experience more of this type of razors.</li>
            <li> Low cost - great results!</li>
            <li> SHAVES BETTER THAN</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nicely machined,  and handsome finish.</li>
            <li> (works well, but is mostly plastic) seem cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an okay razor.</li>
            <li> The finish is so much more appealing than the shiny chrome.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Got to love their craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> There was that magic butter again.</li>
            <li> After checking out numerous consumer reviews, I settled on the Mehaz along with a pack of Persona blades, both of which got excellent reviews for the most part.</li>
            <li> Upon searching, I notice one by    Edward London &amp; Co. that had no reviews, however, the photo and description seemed appealing</li>
            <li> I have used several safety razors but this razor is the best.</li>
            <li> Also the shaving experience is more akin to a feeling of scraping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I could go longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They claim it is made in Germany, but it came in a cheap paper box wrapped in rice paper!</li>
            <li> The razor does seem to shave better than the</li>
            <li> both were inexpensive and the Mehaz branded one is definitely better.</li>
            <li> But a friend told me I needed a better razor</li>
            <li> Take your time and you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think that would work better for my purpose.</li>
            <li> but I prefer something a bit more aggressive.</li>
            <li> , I do like that one better.  </li>
            <li> It has more weight and a longer handle.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this butterfly razor.  </li>
            <li> best for the money no cuts at all the only razor I recommend for beginners you would not regret it.</li>
            <li> just right, good feel and heft.</li>
            <li> The weight is right on and has a good balance.</li>
            <li> Love the butterfly opening style of the razor, very easy to clean and change blades.  </li>
            <li> that angle is found it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I used a Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge blade to shave with and it was a perfect shave, nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I suspected the good initial result was because of the blade rather than the razor, which is why I have been alternating blades with good results with each.  </li>
            <li> The shave was so smooth I had to check about 5 times to make sure the blade was even touching my face.</li>
            <li> nice razor, works great, wish I would have gotten a longer handled one, but that is personal preference.  </li>
            <li> single double-edge razor blade is the best way to shave.</li>
            <li> and I got the closest smoothest most comfortable shave without nicks and razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap and some times it cost me more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I prefer the three piece design, as it provides a more secure lock on the blade</li>
            <li> Very maneuverable and the stippling cuts on the handle give a good grip (I shave in the shower.).</li>
            <li> Good quality and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> If you want a good, painless, fast, easy shave</li>
            <li> This results in a smooth, great shave, without the cuts, nicks, or razor burn, and I have fairly sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild and not aggressive at all.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with one of these type razors many years ago and didn&#x27;t really remember what kind of shave you can get with one.</li>
            <li> You can get a great shave and save some major money...</li>
            <li> The finish is satin rather than polished which is fine.  </li>
            <li> Mehaz razor looks great and is not very aggressive (although aggressiveness depends more on the blades, of course).</li>
            <li> easy to keep clean, unlike multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Great shave, especially if you use oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You as a consumer have to remember that not everyone is the same, you cannot make everyone happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I feel this razor is worth way more than they are charging for</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this razor.</li>
            <li> has smooth open/close</li>
            <li> I must sound like I work forMehaz</li>
            <li> I once more look forward daily to a nice, refreshing shave.  </li>
            <li> my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and no irritation or bumps.</li>
            <li> The mechanism is smooth, and not glitchy.</li>
            <li> So save you money just buy this one and skip buying the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> It is immaculately machined, and the fit and finish, and the alignment of the blade to the head is spot on.</li>
            <li> Which makes for a close, and irritation free shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the closest first time pass shave, but, for first timers that&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
            <li> Still it&#x27;s a good product for what it is, just don&#x27;t be surprised when you can&#x27;t get as close a shave with it.</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;Parker is a shade more aggressive if it is not handled right.</li>
            <li> I have a EJ DE89 that I use every day and this Actually shaves better!!</li>
            <li> The Mehaz on the other hand it incredibly engineered.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth and clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li> No cuts &amp; feels BBS clean burn free shave.</li>
            <li> Good materials and build, easy to open and replace the blade.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this  for a travel shaver</li>
            <li> In summary, they arrived sooner than the initial delivery estimate, following which I enjoyed the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> My Scottish heritage has always made me cringe at having to pay fifteen bucks or so for five blades that never really gave me a good shave--no more.</li>
            <li> Although they certainly do well, when I finally use them up, I may switch from the Personas to Wilkinsons, the ones I liked best &#x27;way back when.</li>
            <li> Trying different blades to find the right feel, This razor is well made, great quality</li>
            <li> I keep my De89 for special occasions</li>
            <li> After today this might be my favorite razor and for anyone that has shaved with a Vintage Gillette to say that is really saying something.</li>
            <li> Maybe make an adjustable version, but really, I can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I should of believed the reviews when numerous people said buy a good razor.</li>
            <li> it really makes a difference and feels much better on the face as well.</li>
            <li> I have a Pearl travel razor, and it is the heaviest razor I have... even heavier than my full size razors, and as one reviewer said, once it is assembled, you cannot tell it is a travel</li>
            <li> The razor is not bad at all</li>
            <li> This is not bad quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, great razor.</li>
            <li> In the harsh environment of the bathroom, stainless steel is best.</li>
            <li> Once you go double edge, you&#x27;ll never go back, and with this stylish razor and great shave, why wait?</li>
            <li> I like a quick easy shave that is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, my skin feels great and much, much less irritation than my Mach 3 disposable cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Seems very well made and cleans and operates easily.</li>
            <li> The butterfly design makes it easy and fast to change out the blade.  </li>
            <li> While the blade itself makes a big difference in your shaving experience, having a razor that holds the blade at exactly the angle and gap that works best for your face is essential.  </li>
            <li> When you are done, loosen the razor a bit by turning the handle, run it under the hot shower to clean it of debris, dip it (or spray it) with a bit of rubbing alcohol (to disperse rust causing water and to sanitize), and you are done.</li>
            <li> Very forgiving &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are made in Israel by the American Safety Razor Co. who make most blades available in the US.  </li>
            <li> Handle is a tad short, but still a nice razor.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge DE razor fanboy, but this one works great and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap razor in the blue case ($8 ) just to try out shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> But I also find myself reaching for it (or my Feather Popular) to touch up my problem areas that I have problems with, with a straight razor (under the neck, near the adams apple), if I want a truly BBS shave everywhere.</li>
            <li> a quick edit to cover a couple of things I missed the first time...</li>
            <li> it glides right over with no nicks&lt;br</li>
            <li> For my beard, which ranges from light (mid sideburns) to very heavy (neck and chin), this razor is the perfect razor.  </li>
            <li> However, it DOES provide a very safe, close shave, especially for the beginner, or for touch ups after a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> Since it is such a mild razor, I pair it with my most aggressive blades, like a Feather.</li>
            <li> Ok I have seen where people are saying this is really the Weishi cheap Chinese razor - and owning this one and the Weishi</li>
            <li> If you have a light beard or sensitive skin then this will be a great everyday razor.</li>
            <li> Including this one, I have 6 DE razors, 3 true straight razors, and 2 shavettes</li>
            <li> It is the lightest razor I own, with the possible exception of the partially plastic Feather Popular.</li>
            <li> I could learn to love using this razor with a little more practice.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve found that the blades sold at CVS seem to give a good shave, and last me about 4 to 6 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be true--it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t include anything, just comes in a box with the razor, but very fast</li>
            <li> A much better razor for beginners than some cheap other choices.</li>
            <li> I would at times get one or two with my first razor that came from the Shaving factory</li>
            <li> Sure enough it was</li>
            <li> This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but overall I love it.</li>
            <li> got the razor today, and have already had my first shave.</li>
            <li> It holds the blade in a reliable, exactly aligned position, so</li>
            <li> but it works VERY well!</li>
            <li> the same butter cutter I had before I knew what happened to that magic feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, I should not fail to mention the savings.</li>
            <li> The Germans are funny about things like that, so a lack of GERMANY on it and</li>
            <li> I will add one thing I recently started using shaving soap and a brush, now if you want to improve your shaving experience try one, it is so much better than the foam or gel creams and one thing</li>
            <li> I find that lighter razors like this one do better with lighter &amp;#34;gauge&amp;#34; blades such as the Feathers or Derbys that you can also buy on amazon.</li>
            <li> But, whereas they for some reason see that as a negative, I see it as a great thing.  </li>
            <li> It shaves almost like the Mehaz, but maybe a tiny bit more</li>
            <li> ordered the Mehaz along with the Utopia Care (a gold plated, good looking heavy razor).</li>
            <li> Not to heavy with a good balance point.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Mehaz razor to anyone who wants to try wet shaving using an old style double-edge safety razor (which is arguably the best way to shave).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blades and believe the blades you use are far more critical to a good shave than the razor itself.  </li>
            <li> This shaves better, the blades are dirt cheap, and they can be used for a few days per blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;m going to be in love with that long handle on the Grande.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews after reviews on pretty much everything j buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first I flirted with the idea of a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I use persona blades nice and sharp and very inexpensive .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time user will find this double-edge razor to be very forgiving while he learns the technique of shaving with a double-edge.  </li>
            <li> but I question if it is really made in Germany since it looks exactly like a Weishi 9306 series razor.</li>
            <li> A long handle and a weighted head are most helpful when shaving with a DE blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m easily adopting to Mehaz double edge</li>
            <li> you these don&#x27;t shave as close or nearly as easy as a Schick or Gillette simple 3 blade .</li>
            <li> to conclude, I think the Mehaz is a fine razor if you like the satin finish, don&#x27;t have a coarse beard and prefer the butterfly design over a three piece.</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone who reviewed this razor.</li>
            <li> It seems that with the tempting inexpensive straight razors, you really get what you pay for; that was a non-starter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor</li>
            <li> For me, though, using this just confirmed that I prefer a traditional three piece shaver.</li>
            <li> much on aggressive razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in solingen,Germany and it is very well made.</li>
            <li> I logged onto Amazon, much to my amazement</li>
            <li> but it gives a MUCH closer shave than any electric or disposable.</li>
            <li> but it is much easier for me to control.</li>
            <li> the cheap packaging leads me to believe it is masquerading as a German product (legally???).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very well made razor.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I use a three piece that cost twice as much when I&#x27;m home</li>
            <li> As you can see from the picture, the finish is not really chrome, but more of a satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen some people comment that this razor is so gentle</li>
            <li> , some reviewers have commented that it has a nice, heavy weight to it.</li>
            <li> This one is light, particularly in the head, and it is relatively short handled.  </li>
            <li> Since purchasing my Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor, I&#x27;ve learned that razors with four, five and even six edges don&#x27;t provide the satisfaction of a clean shave like an old-fashioned double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little light weight for my taste, and shaved a bit on the mild side.</li>
            <li> True German quality.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I came away from my first shave without a nick.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product that shaves very close with little irritation.  </li>
            <li> Lastly I would like to add that this razor has proven that it is possible to get a baby bottom smooth or bbs for short out of a very mild shaver.</li>
            <li> decent product, decent shave.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor, only nicked myself a couple of times in my first week with it.</li>
            <li> It actually turned out better than the Merkur I had earlier.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for daily use as others have stated it has a mildly aggressive blade angle.</li>
            <li> saving lots of money in blades over the throw away razors, and gives a decent shave too</li>
            <li> But it is a decent razor for traveling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this for a short time, I purchased a Merkur 33, which is a 3 three piece razor with a true chrome finish and a little more aggressive blade angle.  </li>
            <li> Still not a bad razor but a little to mild for my taste.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor for anyone.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer this one to a more expensive razor -- the Merkur Futur adjustable (which is, BTW, another great German product).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Slow and easy wins the race and gives me a very close shave (</li>
            <li> I love this little razor.</li>
            <li> Putting a top-quality blade in a poor quality razor isn&#x27;t any better than a lousy blade in the perfect razor.  </li>
            <li> but the cost savings makes the double edge razor worth it.</li>
            <li> Although it is in my rotation for normal shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the first Safety Razor I used after about a 40 year break, and the basic butterfly design hasn&#x27;t changed much.  </li>
            <li> They were good, but not great.</li>
            <li> That way new customers can relate a little more.</li>
            <li> It was OK I am new too safety razor shaving and kick my self everyday for not converting sooner.</li>
            <li> Not sure about going back to the good old double-edge?</li>
            <li> I got tempted to get more modern when I was young and foolish, but was never really satisfied with the shave I got from any of the cartridge systems, or my electric razor.</li>
            <li> but it shaves so well that it may turn in to my new every day shaver.</li>
            <li> and then it still won&#x27;t be up to par as the new 3 or 4 blades.</li>
            <li> It was hard to tell which blade was better since this razor is mild, even the feather produced similar results to the derby.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave four stars instead of five for this razor, is because for shaving my head a slightly longer handle might have been better for absolute control.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that nicks even with Gillette cartridges</li>
            <li> It is my first double edge razor and I bought it just to try it and to protect razor burns.</li>
            <li> Then I washed my face with pretty hot water &amp; Irish Spring leaving the Irish Spring on my face.</li>
            <li> Anyway I went back to no Irish Spring as a test, sure enough after&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, it&#x27;s the exact same razor as the Mehaz (how do they come up with these names?).</li>
            <li> I have a Weishi and this razor is exactly the same as that one.</li>
            <li> what is old is new again</li>
            <li> I did take my time and was amazed by the closeness of the shave from a single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try one, but go slow, use a good shaving cream or lotion and rinse the blade often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give something like the M&amp;uuml;hle Grande a chance when we get permanently moved into our new house but, even if I end up liking the Grande more, the Mehaz will make a terrific travel razor due to the short handle.</li>
            <li> This is a very &amp;#34;non-aggressive&amp;#34; razor, it needed several passes for my 3 day old beard.</li>
            <li> This is a clearly precision made device.</li>
            <li> several brands in a wide variety of prices turned out to be still available.</li>
            <li> The butterfly action has performed flawlessly so far.  </li>
            <li> I really like the satin brushed</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t cut my mole or any skin so far.</li>
            <li> To establish my perspective, I am 83 years old.</li>
            <li> The size is comparable to the old Gillette safety razors.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a close shave from a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Wow, if I had known wet shaving was going to be so much fun, I would have done so 40 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the double-edge blades are definitely cheaper, and I&#x27;ve been able to find them at a local Kroger that probably stocks them because a lot of foreign college students shop there.</li>
            <li> I now have nearly 200 blades I purchased for peanuts and won&#x27;t be needing more for a long, long, long time--</li>
            <li> Overall decent quality razor</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first, but am glad I switched from the expensive disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> I think I want to try out a high end razor in the future just got to get over the cost.</li>
            <li> said if you are getting this expecting the same shave you can get as far as closeness as some of the new 3 and 4 blade plastic razors it won&#x27;t happen, maybe if your 16 and just started shaving.</li>
            <li> This was the first safety razor I bought when returning to the wet shaving scene.  </li>
            <li> those magic butter cutting shaves was washing my face with Irish Spring original bar soap.</li>
            <li> but I may go back to the plastic and use this as a back up or weekender when it doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li> Back to my normal routine &amp; back to butter.</li>
            <li> The quality of the Mehaz seems to be a tad bit tighter, the finish on it is not cheap but is more or less a matte finish.</li>
            <li> you are a beginner to wet shaving, or have very sensitive skin, this is the razor for you!</li>
            <li> If you have never used this type of razor, be careful there is a learning curve, slow down enjoy a hot soapy shave, like your father, or grandfather did .  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants a less aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> paired the Mehaz with Personna blades and was a little nervous at first, flashing back to a teenage me with lots of t.p. on his face.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I have always preferred a butterfly opening razor and I particularly like the fact that with this one, once you tighten the blade down, it stays that way.  </li>
            <li> I finally got tired of trying to clean the whiskers from between the dual blades and throwing away a hunk of plastic for the land fill.</li>
            <li> At first I was not impressed but after starting to get my technique down with a vintage Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li> see some that are very good and very few that are bad about this razor.</li>
            <li> LAST AS LONG AS</li>
            <li> Not long ago however, I saw an ad for one on one of those high-end cable channels and finally got curious.  </li>
            <li> but I am sad to say they are hard to get a good shave with</li>
            <li> But from my research I quickly discovered that it can be very expensive to get set up with a dependable straight razor that will keep an edge, and with a leather strop, etc..</li>
            <li> I did make the switch to Wilkinson and found they are no better than the Personnas--so far, about equal.</li>
            <li> But the Wilkinson nicked me not very close at all, so I figured I&#x27;d give another razor a try before I went back to spending money on disposable junk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on having this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t try my routine with this razor you will be searching for a long while for that elusive shave.</li>
            <li> They could have made the bolts that the blade sits on larger thus trivially easier to center.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick fast growing hair and shave every morning.  </li>
            <li> I mean safety razors as a whole.</li>
            <li> The only dislike I have with the razor is that the handle is a little short for my hands.</li>
            <li> you like using the extra sharp blades, like Shark or Feather, want to spend the time and effort to get as close as a shave as you can and don&#x27;t mind getting some cuts than maybe this isn&#x27;t the razor for you.  </li>
            <li> My husband decided that instead of buying the expensive cartridges with 4 or 5 blades in each one, he was going to &amp;#34;go old school&amp;#34; and try the type of razor that my Dad used his whole life.  </li>
            <li> Changes characteristic completly.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t abuse it it should last a long time, but this is not a razor you will hand down to your son.</li>
            <li> But this is such a minor matter, that I would like for you to consider my rating to be a four and a half.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean this razor in particular</li>
            <li> Old Gillette&#x27;s sell on auction sites for a small fortune.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it harder and harder to find disposable razors with fewer than four blades that are sharp enough to shave close.</li>
            <li> and I find it impossible to think it could be better</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor especially if your a first time user.</li>
            <li> I ran across the Mehaz razor and there were a lot of comments about this that were positive and few negative .</li>
            <li> The handle is a little short</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is because it has a little rattle in it.</li>
            <li> so i expected some type of nicks of scratches.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a thick beard</li>
            <li> I particularly liked the way you twist the base of the handle to install and remove the blade.</li>
            <li> Weishi I got is none other than the one advertised by Rick Harris of PawnStars...</li>
            <li> I am using a Shark blade in the razor, which is considered an extremely sharp blade, and I have not nicked myself once.  </li>
            <li> Other than that  </li>
            <li> After learning it&#x27;s possible to buy double-edge razors online, I decided on the Mehaz because other users talked about how hard it is to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> No worth it.</li>
            <li> You know as I write down my +s &amp;</li>
            <li> Let the weight of the razor do the work for you, don&#x27;t press down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get those little nicks I have with other razors.  </li>
            <li> Since I purchased this razor I&#x27;ve gone from shaving every other day to everyday.</li>
            <li> The blades are cheep and very sharp.</li>
            <li> so there is less of a chance to carve your face up.</li>
            <li> For my head there was a slight learning curve.</li>
            <li> is you can have a hot shave instead of putting on a cold foam or gel</li>
            <li> There is not much more I can say to convince anyone to buy this razor , the only thing I can say or do is to say it is your loss to not at least try it</li>
            <li> There is not much more I can say to convince anyone to buy this razor , the only thing I can say or do is to say it is your loss to not at least try it out?</li>
            <li> Now I must just learn to go a little slower when shaving, I have bumpy skin and tend to nick myself a little easier.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a great,great little shaver.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this little razor works.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve also found that it takes a little longer to get a close shave with the Mehaz than with, for example, a Bic Hybrid Advance 4 (four-blade semi-disposable razor).</li>
            <li> I just wish the handle was a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Mehaz for 1.5 months now, using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste another buck on some gimmicky cartridge.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a waste of money, besides being environmentally wasteful.</li>
            <li> but this is my everyday go-to razor.</li>
            <li> being said, don&#x27;t expect a heavy razor...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a small fortune, this razor just might be what you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li> It has a small gap between the two protective edges and the blade vs the Merkur</li>
            <li> Only thing that is difficult is making lines</li>
            <li> Im not sure why people changed to electric or disposable razors from these.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will be my #1 or a tied #1 yet.</li>
            <li> While the Utopia razor is hefty and gold plated, it is poorly engineered and takes skill and patience to center the blade in the razor.</li>
            <li> have a small mole on my cheek with this razor</li>
            <li> Sorry for hangging on to the supense way to long.</li>
            <li> Blades are $6 for 10, so you replace them when they get dull and not when you can afford to.</li>
            <li> you would be hard pressed to cut yourself with this razor.</li>
            <li> If you have a tough beard it will take a few passes with this to get close</li>
            <li> And the ones that were negative well they were or are new to DE safety razor shaving and did something wrong or used a bad blade or a terrible shave soap or they do not do it right or plan and simple</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my shave has not had that cut like butter lately.</li>
            <li> but I went back to what I was doing when I was getting those butter cutting Personnas.</li>
            <li> but they were very small ones.</li>
            <li> And the expense was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have grown a bead and the two to five blade razors are not good for trimming between nose and moustache.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had real high hopes for this razor - but was very disappointed with the nicks incurred in match testing with a $2.25 Sodial razor!!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Tired of razors with twelve blades that cost an arm and a leg to replace?</li>
            <li> I suppose if you like the twist-to-open style of safety razor you could do worse.</li>
            <li> So, those converting from a cartridge razor will not leave themselves a bloody mess while learning.  </li>
            <li> This is so wrong.</li>
            <li> Difficult to maneuver around chin and mustache area.</li>
            <li> Sorry if I might have bored anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use expensive shaving lotion; I bought some witch hazel when it was on sale and rub it into my face afterward.</li>
            <li> Ditch those expensive razors and get 5 blades for a dollar.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s easier to use the Bic in the shower because the shape of the handle makes it impossible to hold it the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I learned to shave with one of these and after being sick of the mediocre shaves from 4 and 5 blade cartridges (I&#x27;m looking at you DSC, Gillette, Schick), I decided to revisit the safety</li>
            <li> I thought I got a bad order of  Personna Reds.</li>
            <li> I like the size and construction, but hate the way this razor shaves.  </li>
            <li> Bad experience!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the first safety razor I bought when returning to the wet shaving scene.  I&#x27;m used to an Atra double blade cartridge affair that&#x27;s worked well for years, but wanted to try a double edge setup to see if I could get comparable shaves, possibly saving some money, too.  This razor is from Germany, it&#x27;s well made, of good quality materials, and easy to use and clean.  So far I&#x27;ve found that the blades sold at CVS seem to give a good shave, and last me about 4 to 6 shaves.  These are made in Israel by the American Safety Razor Co. who make most blades available in the US.  I&#x27;ve tried other blades and believe the blades you use are far more critical to a good shave than the razor itself.  Having said that, I may move up to a Mercur razor some day but for now I&#x27;m very pleased with this Mehaz.  I would recommend it without reservations.</li>
            <li> I love this little razor. It has good heft and feel, for my tastes. Very maneuverable and the stippling cuts on the handle give a good grip (I shave in the shower.). The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I have not tried any of the more expensive razors for comparison. I&#x27;ll give something like the M&amp;uuml;hle Grande a chance when we get permanently moved into our new house but, even if I end up liking the Grande more, the Mehaz will make a terrific travel razor due to the short handle. I&#x27;m not convinced I&#x27;m going to be in love with that long handle on the Grande.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mehaz for 1.5 months now, using it everyday.  This is an outstanding product that shaves very close with little irritation.  The manufacturer recommends Personna blades for this razor, which gave a great shave.  I also have used Derby and Dorco blades which also did great.  I suspected the good initial result was because of the blade rather than the razor, which is why I have been alternating blades with good results with each.  The butterfly action has performed flawlessly so far.  The finish is satin rather than polished which is fine.  For the price, this is represents a very good value.    Update on 8/24/14-The razor continues to shave close with no irritation.  It has begun to lose the \\&quot;satin\\&quot; finish on either side of the butterfly doors.  That is on the part that comes in contact with my face from shaving.  Other than that, great razor.</li>
            <li> Real nice razor for the money. I really like the satin brushed finish.&lt;br /&gt;A single double-edge razor blade is the best way to shave. They&lt;br /&gt;are easy to keep clean, unlike multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor that&#x27;s well built made in Germany. I&#x27;ve used the Derby and the Dorco 301 blades with it and it does a great job. It&#x27;s veer non aggressive and I can shave my neck in any direction and not get any nicks or cuts! I would at times get one or two with my first razor that came from the Shaving factory but they were very small ones. Since I purchased this razor I&#x27;ve gone from shaving every other day to everyday. Love using it! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor especially if your a first time user. I would highly recommend this razor for anyone. Mine come thru wasatch and the shipping was great. Got the razor 3 days before it was scheduled to arrive! But this razor you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Bought it, use it and Love it.  No issues.</li>
            <li> It should since it&#x27;s a German copy.  Been using it for a month.  Old Gillette&#x27;s sell on auction sites for a small fortune.  If you don&#x27;t have a small fortune, this razor just might be what you&#x27;re looking for.  More cuts than the multi-blade models, but that&#x27;s what being a man is all about.</li>
            <li> We started using disposable razors back in the 80&#x27;s I had forgotten what a close shave feels like. This razor has a good weight and lifetime warranty If  you are looking for a good shave this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I went from a Merkur 180 to this and I love it. The butterfly design makes it easier to change blades. It has a small gap between the two protective edges and the blade vs the Merkur so there is less of a chance to carve your face up. In fact, this is the only DE Safety Razor I can start out shaving against the grain... I don&#x27;t need to do an initial with-the-grain stroke.  It&#x27;s all metal except for the end cap insert which feels like plastic.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Tired of razors with twelve blades that cost an arm and a leg to replace? Ask your dad or grandpa about safety razors, and try this one. Blades are $6 for 10, so you replace them when they get dull and not when you can afford to. Great shave, especially if you use oil.</li>
            <li> This is so wrong. I doubt that is is made in Germany.  The comb wasn&#x27;t machined properly and if I was to shave with it I would be cut, not by the blade but by the imperfections of the razor. No worth it. Better spend $10 more and get a Parker 99R or Parker 22R. Pending refund from buyer, I hope I get no hassle.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews after reviews on pretty much everything j buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I see some that are very good and very few that are bad about this razor.I see that a lot on stuff I purchase through here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You as a consumer have to remember that not everyone is the same, you cannot make everyone happy. Some are stuck on a product and you cannot even change their mind if it is guest thing they ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this RAZOR IS AWESOME!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I had bought the Wilkinson safety razor plastic one.  It was OK I am new too safety razor shaving and kick my self everyday for not converting sooner. But the Wilkinson nicked me not very close at all, so I figured I&#x27;d give another razor a try before I went back to spending money on disposable junk.&lt;br /&gt;So I looked and looked and read review after review . I ran across the Mehaz razor and there were a lot of comments about this that were positive and few negative . I am sooooooooooo glad I listened to myself and bought this one. I shaved with it and after I was in total shock ..... not one nick that bleed! I did not have razor burn afterword like I did with the Wilkinson. I did not even know I was shaving with a blade. I had to check over and over again to make sure the blade was in correctly. Sure enough it was and I got the closest smoothest most comfortable shave without nicks and razor burn I have ever had!!!&amp;iexcl;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No I do not understand why, what the difference was or is because I used the same blades I used in the Wilkinson ? But the people that explained why this safety razor is awesome proved to me they know what they are talking about! And the ones that were negative well they were or are new to DE safety razor shaving and did something wrong or used a bad blade or a terrible shave soap or they do not do it right or plan and simple they are happier with another brand of style. And you just cannot make everyone happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I feel this razor is worth way more than they are charging for it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It performs perfectly . I am extremely happy and recommend it to any an everyone! There is not much more I can say to convince anyone to buy this razor , the only thing I can say or do is to say it is your loss to not at least try it out?they are charging for it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It performs perfectly . I am extremely happy and recommend it to any an everyone! There is not much more I can say to convince anyone to buy this razor , the only thing I can say or do is to say it is your loss to not at least try it out?</li>
            <li> This is a great razor once you learn what angle to hold it at it shaves close and no nicks.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively inexpensive yet excellent safety razor. True German quality. I actually prefer this one to a more expensive razor -- the Merkur Futur adjustable (which is, BTW, another great German product). Mehaz razor looks great and is not very aggressive (although aggressiveness depends more on the blades, of course). I definitely recommend this Mehaz razor to anyone who wants to try wet shaving using an old style double-edge safety razor (which is arguably the best way to shave). It&#x27;s a a butterfly-style (or turn-to-open) razor, which is definitely a plus, in my view.</li>
            <li> Not like the multi-blade razors at all. Takes some getting used to the weight and the angle is critical. Short strokes work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs like the disposable razors did and I haven&#x27;t cut my mole or any skin so far. Seems very well made and cleans and operates easily. I could learn to love using this razor with a little more practice.</li>
            <li> This is a very &amp;#34;non-aggressive&amp;#34; razor, it needed several passes for my 3 day old beard. But, my skin feels great and much, much less irritation than my Mach 3 disposable cartridges.  Seems well made with a nice finish. Would recommend to anyone who wants a less aggressive razor.</li>
            <li> decent product, decent shave. It&#x27;s the closest first time pass shave, but, for first timers that&#x27;s actually a good thing. It&#x27;s very forgiving when trying to find that perfect angle and technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once that angle is found it&#x27;s pretty good. I have very sensitive skin that nicks even with Gillette cartridges so i expected some type of nicks of scratches. Although it did ultimately happen i never even felt or noticed it until it bled. With cartridges i could tell before it would even bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this razor, along with Personnal blades i didn&#x27;t even feel the blade unlike with cartridges where i would feel the scrape and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero complaints. Best shave i&#x27;ve had in years, probably ever.</li>
            <li> Sometimes new isn&#x27;t always the best!  Since purchasing my Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor, I&#x27;ve learned that razors with four, five and even six edges don&#x27;t provide the satisfaction of a clean shave like an old-fashioned double edge razor.  Now I must just learn to go a little slower when shaving, I have bumpy skin and tend to nick myself a little easier.  Slow and easy wins the race and gives me a very close shave (and without a lot of cuts)!</li>
            <li> Razor has a great size and weight.The mechanisim works perfectly.This is a great razor for home or travel.I&#x60;d recommend this razor to anyone!</li>
            <li> Using Wilkinson Sword blades, this razor does not shave closely, leaving stubble. Difficult to maneuver around chin and mustache area. I had to re-shave using my Gillette two blade Sensor to get a closer shave. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My husband decided that instead of buying the expensive cartridges with 4 or 5 blades in each one, he was going to &amp;#34;go old school&amp;#34; and try the type of razor that my Dad used his whole life.  He said that this one is well made (I can attest to it&#x27;s weight being substantial), and it is well balanced.  It also fits his hand well.</li>
            <li> I got this razor to replace the money sucking Fusion.  The butterfly design makes it easy and fast to change out the blade.  The size and weight make it very comfortable to use.  I get a smooth and clean shave every time.  I recommend buying a verity pack of blades, to see what feels best on your face.  Best of all, the money you save on blades will make you want to kick yourself in the ass for not buying one of these sooner!</li>
            <li> This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever used. At first I was not impressed but after starting to get my technique down with a vintage Gillette Super Speed. I changed my blade choice from Derby &amp;#34;I will never use Derby ever again&amp;#34; to Astra platinum I got an amazing shave. After today this might be my favorite razor and for anyone that has shaved with a Vintage Gillette to say that is really saying something. The shave was so smooth I had to check about 5 times to make sure the blade was even touching my face. I really enjoy this razor. I plan on buying a second one to keep with my luggage so I can have great shaves when I travel. Lastly I would like to add that this razor has proven that it is possible to get a baby bottom smooth or bbs for short out of a very mild shaver. Thanks to everyone who reviewed this razor. before me for leading me to a great shave.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and works well.  Love the butterfly opening style of the razor, very easy to clean and change blades.  And at this price I am very satisfied with the quality.  This razor is very solid and sturdy.  Nicely finished, feels great to use.  I don&#x27;t want to drop it, it may get damaged or hurt me; it is that hefty.  (And if it were damaged in a drop that&#x27;d be my fault, not the razor&#x27;s.  Some people seem to miss this point when they review a product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the quality and function for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have grown a bead and the two to five blade razors are not good for trimming between nose and moustache. Most safety razors are chrome plated brass. In the harsh environment of the bathroom, stainless steel is best. This is a clearly precision made device. It seems as though it is made of milled billet stock.</li>
            <li> It is my first double edge razor and I bought it just to try it and to protect razor burns. For a guys like me who shaves every day except off days I have been using Schick twin razor for years and I couldn&#x27;t find replacement for it till now and now I that I bought Mehaz I still have Schick to make neat side lines. I&#x27;m easily adopting to Mehaz double edge and I have notice that when I use it I don&#x27;t see razor burns. My skin feels relieve from razor burns. Only thing that is difficult is making lines but overall I love it. I will recommend this to anyone. I will continue to experience more of this type of razors.</li>
            <li> It does the job well, good feel and balance &amp; more than fair price-wise! Not sure about going back to the good old double-edge? Start with this razor ! Low cost - great results!</li>
            <li> I learned to shave with one of these and after being sick of the mediocre shaves from 4 and 5 blade cartridges (I&#x27;m looking at you DSC, Gillette, Schick), I decided to revisit the safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired the Mehaz with Personna blades and was a little nervous at first, flashing back to a teenage me with lots of t.p. on his face.  I was pleasantly surprised when I came away from my first shave without a nick.  I did take my time and was amazed by the closeness of the shave from a single blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try one, but go slow, use a good shaving cream or lotion and rinse the blade often.</li>
            <li> In using this great old time razor I had to readjust my shaving  technique, but the results are excellent, this model is a bit to&lt;br /&gt;heavy for me. Trying different blades to find the right feel, This razor is well made, great quality</li>
            <li> I learned how to shave over 45 years ago with a safety razor and double edged blades. I got tempted to get more modern when I was young and foolish, but was never really satisfied with the shave I got from any of the cartridge systems, or my electric razor. They were good, but not great. And the expense was ridiculous. I shave my head, as well as my face, so I went through replacement blades quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to go back to the old-fashioned ways. At first I flirted with the idea of a straight razor. But from my research I quickly discovered that it can be very expensive to get set up with a dependable straight razor that will keep an edge, and with a leather strop, etc.. It seems that with the tempting inexpensive straight razors, you really get what you pay for; that was a non-starter. So after deciding to go with a safety razor, and doing some research, the Mehaz appeared to be good value for money and I placed my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the razor today, and have already had my first shave. I was really impressed. The razor has a nice heft to it. The butterfly mechanism works well, and the blade sits as it should. For my face there was no learning curve at all. I got a wonderfully close shave, and no nicks (even going against the grain). For my head there was a slight learning curve. But I only got three micro-nicks that my block of alum took care of in no time. And again, the shave was nice and close&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave four stars instead of five for this razor, is because for shaving my head a slightly longer handle might have been better for absolute control. But this is such a minor matter, that I would like for you to consider my rating to be a four and a half.</li>
            <li> SHAVES BETTER THAN TODAYS PLASTIC RAZORS&lt;br /&gt;BLADES LAST AS LONG AS PLASTIC RAZOR IF NOT LONGER&lt;br /&gt;GLAD I FOUND IT</li>
            <li> While the blade itself makes a big difference in your shaving experience, having a razor that holds the blade at exactly the angle and gap that works best for your face is essential.  Putting a top-quality blade in a poor quality razor isn&#x27;t any better than a lousy blade in the perfect razor.  For my beard, which ranges from light (mid sideburns) to very heavy (neck and chin), this razor is the perfect razor.  It holds the blade in a reliable, exactly aligned position, so I don&#x27;t get those little nicks I have with other razors.  Plus, I have always preferred a butterfly opening razor and I particularly like the fact that with this one, once you tighten the blade down, it stays that way.  I plan on having this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent aesthetics, great shave.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor has smooth open/close action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely machined,  and handsome finish. All metal. Makes my Feather Double Edge Razor  (works well, but is mostly plastic) seem cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for me with personna blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to improve? Maybe make an adjustable version, but really, I can&#x27;t ask for more. I&#x27;m getting 3 shaves on the personna blades, and that both Face and shaving head. My $13.00 box of blades will last a year! Once you go double edge, you&#x27;ll never go back, and with this stylish razor and great shave, why wait?</li>
            <li> Im not sure why people changed to electric or disposable razors from these. You can get a great shave and save some major money...what is old is new again</li>
            <li> Best safety razor bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This is an okay razor. Nicely made with a good finish and seems to seat the blade better than most. It&#x27;s a little light weight for my taste, and shaved a bit on the mild side. I suppose if you like the twist-to-open style of safety razor you could do worse. For me, though, using this just confirmed that I prefer a traditional three piece shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaves great even with the CVS razors Im waiting for my Feather blades to come in. The handle is a little short but it works VERY well!</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor! A much better razor for beginners than some cheap other choices. The finish is so much more appealing than the shiny chrome. Great to hold and use. Great for shaving heads as well as the face.</li>
            <li> My first safety razor, only nicked myself a couple of times in my first week with it. I&#x27;m using it with Feather razors and it&#x27;s a very smooth shave. I&#x27;m immensely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I like to reference Razors &amp; blades by name. That way new customers can relate a little more. My #3 razor is the Lord 6. #2 is Feather Popular. #1 is Parker 22. My Blade is persona red. Very forgiving &amp; comfortable. I am&lt;br /&gt;not much on aggressive razors. My Mehaz is a wonderful razor. I am not sure if it will be my #1 or a tied #1 yet. The&lt;br /&gt;Parker is a shade more aggressive if it is not handled right.It took me a while to figure out how to use it. The Mehaz has&lt;br /&gt;a  lifetime warranty. Big +. You know as I write down my +s &amp; -s i think I have just seen which razor is my #1. I&#x27;ll let you figure that one out. Actually The Parker is not as forgiving with the Polsilver blade. Plus I believe this razor is built in&lt;br /&gt;Germany. Got to love their craftsmanship. I had to throw in a tidbit of information. I use Vander Hagen&lt;br /&gt;shaving soap in a cup. I also use mineral oil on my face&lt;br /&gt;as a lubricant. I&#x27;ve noticed that my shave has not had that cut like butter lately. Anyway I have not been happy with my set up. I thought I got a bad order of  Personna Reds. You may not believe this but I went back to what I was doing when I was getting those butter cutting Personnas. the only thing I was doing was. I can&#x27;t tell you yet. Anyway I tried my Parker 22R. &amp; it&lt;br /&gt;was the same butter cutter I had before I knew what happened to that magic feeling. Are you ready to hear what the missing link was. Oh I forgot to mention that I get this done with about 1 1/2 passes. Sorry for hangging on to the supense way to long. What I was doing when I was getting those magic butter cutting shaves was washing my face with Irish Spring original bar soap. Then rinse. Churn up my Vander Hagen. Then I washed my face with pretty hot water &amp; Irish Spring leaving the Irish Spring on my face. Then I applied the Vander Hagen. There was that magic butter again. Sorry if I might have bored anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I am back with another tidbit for this razor. I must sound like I work forMehaz but I don&#x27;t. Anyway I went back to no Irish Spring as a test, sure enough after&lt;br /&gt;4 days the butter cut was gone. Back to my normal routine &amp; back to butter. I do&lt;br /&gt;not work for Irish Spring either. The last thing I have to say is I have not ordered the Feather AS-D2. If you don&#x27;t try my routine with this razor you will be searching for a long while for that elusive shave. One word (BUTTER). One last thing to Butter shaving is your angle. I used to use a 30 Deg. Now I use 15-20 deg. Changes characteristic completly. No cuts &amp; feels BBS clean burn free shave.</li>
            <li> This thing is a great,great little shaver. It&#x27;s made in solingen,Germany and it is very well made. I have a EJ DE89 that I use every day and this Actually shaves better!! I originally bought this  for a travel shaver but it shaves so well that it may turn in to my new every day shaver. Well done Mehaz</li>
            <li> To establish my perspective, I am 83 years old. Therefore, I had been shaving with double-edge safety razors for quite a number of years before the two, three and four bladed types entered the picture. When double-edge razors and blades stopped showing up at drug stores, etc., I simply assumed they were no longer made. Not long ago however, I saw an ad for one on one of those high-end cable channels and finally got curious.  W hen I logged onto Amazon, much to my amazement several brands in a wide variety of prices turned out to be still available. After checking out numerous consumer reviews, I settled on the Mehaz along with a pack of Persona blades, both of which got excellent reviews for the most part. In summary, they arrived sooner than the initial delivery estimate, following which I enjoyed the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.Although they certainly do well, when I finally use them up, I may switch from the Personas to Wilkinsons, the ones I liked best &#x27;way back when. Also, I should not fail to mention the savings. My Scottish heritage has always made me cringe at having to pay fifteen bucks or so for five blades that never really gave me a good shave--no more. I once more look forward daily to a nice, refreshing shave.  (December 25, 2015) Having used this  razor for quite a while now, I must comment further on my choice of blades. I did make the switch to Wilkinson and found they are no better than the Personnas--so far, about equal. The result? I now have nearly 200 blades I purchased for peanuts and won&#x27;t be needing more for a long, long, long time--Merry Christmas.  January 1, 2016 I just decided it would be nice to have a razor with a longer handle. Which one? Mehaz does not appear to make one. Upon searching, I notice one by    Edward London &amp; Co. that had no reviews, however, the photo and description seemed appealing so I ordered one. Lo and behold, it&#x27;s the exact same razor as the Mehaz (how do they come up with these names?). So, if anyone out therelikes the Mehaz but would like one with a longer handle, go for Edward London.</li>
            <li> All good. Great material, construction and weight. Handle a bit short for me but I order two others for my sons.</li>
            <li> It seems like a sturdy well-made safety razor. I wish the handle was just a bit longer, though, but it&#x27;s not a biggie. I&#x27;ve gone to this type of shaving after my 70$ electric shaver died after 2 years of use. This will last a lifetime and the blades cost me 13 cents each when bought in packs of 100. It takes a bit longer to shave with one of these but it gives a MUCH closer shave than any electric or disposable. Buy a shower mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog up and shave in the shower. Get a can of shaving gel. Let the weight of the razor do the work for you, don&#x27;t press down. Shave twice, both with and then against the grain. When you are done, loosen the razor a bit by turning the handle, run it under the hot shower to clean it of debris, dip it (or spray it) with a bit of rubbing alcohol (to disperse rust causing water and to sanitize), and you are done. I don&#x27;t even use expensive shaving lotion; I bought some witch hazel when it was on sale and rub it into my face afterward. That&#x27;s all you need. Don&#x27;t waste another buck on some gimmicky cartridge. This shaves as close as you need.</li>
            <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had real high hopes for this razor - but was very disappointed with the nicks incurred in match testing with a $2.25 Sodial razor!!&lt;br /&gt;My Gillette, Feather and Sodial are superior to this razor - on its way to Amazon for a refund-eh!!</li>
            <li> Handle is a tad short, but still a nice razor.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 safety razors, a Merkur for my husband and this one for me.  I like that this has a smaller handle than the Merkur and the blade is a bit easier to change.  I am amazed at how well this little razor works.  After I got the hang of it, I have had no cuts or razor burns on my legs at all.  If you&#x27;re thinking about switching to a safety razor, DO IT!  It takes a minute to get used to, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my results!</li>
            <li> I have used several safety razors but this razor is the best. This is a razor with a shorter handle but it is much easier for me to control. I have had the best shave with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the shave is as close as a Schick Quattro (I used Persona blades as recommended) but the cost savings makes the double edge razor worth it.</li>
            <li> Great build quality, nicely weighted and works well.  Great starter and first time safety razor.</li>
            <li> Wow, if I had known wet shaving was going to be so much fun, I would have done so 40 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Mehaz along with the Utopia Care (a gold plated, good looking heavy razor). While the Utopia razor is hefty and gold plated, it is poorly engineered and takes skill and patience to center the blade in the razor. They could have made the bolts that the blade sits on larger thus trivially easier to center. Also the shaving experience is more akin to a feeling of scraping. The Mehaz on the other hand it incredibly engineered. Just open the butterfly wings and drop the blade and tighten. Perfect centering and tightening every time. The shaving experience if simply euphoric. It is a buttery glide and makes you wonder if you are actually shaving. I am blown by it. Stupendous razor and I find it impossible to think it could be better (well, maybe if it was a bit heavier).</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for several months, not one nick or cut.  Blades (Astra),last for two weeks shaving every day. Beats any I have tried over the last  50+ years.  Well made and holds the blade just right, good feel and heft.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it he says it gives him a closer shave than any of the disposable razors thank you</li>
            <li> Now I remember why I spend $40 bucks on cassette razors, and the darned blades never showed up.  Bad experience!</li>
            <li> Great Shaver and I save alot of money inthe process. Good quality and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from ingrown hairs and razor bumps since I started shaving over 50 years ago. This razor was the answer to my problem. It&#x27;s very mild and not aggressive at all. I use a feather or a crystal blade and I make up to three passes with the grain and my face is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and no irritation or bumps. It&#x27;s simply the best. I do change out the blade every five days but I&#x27;m sure I could go longer.</li>
            <li> Well constructed and works well.</li>
            <li> Ok I have seen where people are saying this is really the Weishi cheap Chinese razor - and owning this one and the Weishi I have to say they are waaay to close in design to be not from the same company. Even the knurling is identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Weishi I got is none other than the one advertised by Rick Harris of PawnStars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They claim it is made in Germany, but it came in a cheap paper box wrapped in rice paper! And the razor has nowhere on it MADE IN GERMANY. The Germans are funny about things like that, so a lack of GERMANY on it and the cheap packaging leads me to believe it is masquerading as a German product (legally???).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that aside, the differences in this and the Weishi do exist. The quality of the Mehaz seems to be a tad bit tighter, the finish on it is not cheap but is more or less a matte finish. The razor does seem to shave better than the Weishi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both were inexpensive and the Mehaz branded one is definitely better. I am not a huge DE razor fanboy, but this one works great and is inexpensive. The mechanism is smooth, and not glitchy. The weight is good and does not feel like a $0.59 plastic razor.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap razor in the blue case ($8 ) just to try out shaving with a safety razor. After using it for about a month I was going to quit and go back to a 4, 5, 6 blade/ $5 a blade. But a friend told me I needed a better razor so I still did not want to spend a lot of money. I&#x27;m cheap and some times it cost me more. This razor is great compared to the cheap one. I get a closer and cleaner shave the Mehaz Double Edge safety razor. It&#x27;s a nice razor. The weight is right on and has a good balance. So save you money just buy this one and skip buying the cheap ones. I should of believed the reviews when numerous people said buy a good razor.I think I want to try out a high end razor in the future just got to get over the cost.</li>
            <li> Its a very good razor. I learned to shave with a razor like this, but I made the mistake of switching to disposables.I finally got tired of trying to clean the whiskers from between the dual blades and throwing away a hunk of plastic for the land fill. This is a razor you will put in your shave kit and use with no complaints. If you don&#x27;t abuse it it should last a long time, but this is not a razor you will hand down to your son. You will be using it. Ha!! The blades are cheep and very sharp. If you have never used this type of razor, be careful there is a learning curve, slow down enjoy a hot soapy shave, like your father, or grandfather did .  The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating is because it has a little rattle in it.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor and mild on the shave. I like the frost look on the finish of the razor, something different than all the rest. The quality of the razor is very high and the blades set in it perfect. I used a Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge blade to shave with and it was a perfect shave, nice and smooth. Thank&#x27;s for a very good razor.</li>
            <li> nice razor, works great, wish I would have gotten a longer handled one, but that is personal preference.  Would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let any one fool you these don&#x27;t shave as close or nearly as easy as a Schick or Gillette simple 3 blade . The construction on this is really good  but I am sad to say they are hard to get a good shave with and I don&#x27;t mean this razor in particular I mean safety razors as a whole. There is a reason they went the way of the dinosaurs</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave with no pulling . I use persona blades nice and sharp and very inexpensive .&lt;br /&gt;I payed $13 for 100 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Shave coser than my 4 dollar blade for my Gillette fusion</li>
            <li> It is a very well made razor. Absolutely no complaints. It actually turned out better than the Merkur I had earlier.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much this is the best of the four I bought .  know I can stop buying .&lt;br /&gt;I have a small mole on my cheek with this razor it glides right over with no nicks&lt;br /&gt;To me that is great!</li>
            <li> Solid construction with the fancier butterfly opening. Not to heavy with a good balance point. Ditch those expensive razors and get 5 blades for a dollar. Take your time and you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly good razor for the price, it give a fairly good shave and is easy to use, it may be the blades I am using that is giving a lower quality shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it harder and harder to find disposable razors with fewer than four blades that are sharp enough to shave close. It seemed like a waste of money, besides being environmentally wasteful. After learning it&#x27;s possible to buy double-edge razors online, I decided on the Mehaz because other users talked about how hard it is to nick yourself. I&#x27;ve found this to be true--it&#x27;s very gentle. However, I&#x27;ve also found that it takes a little longer to get a close shave with the Mehaz than with, for example, a Bic Hybrid Advance 4 (four-blade semi-disposable razor). Also, it&#x27;s easier to use the Bic in the shower because the shape of the handle makes it impossible to hold it the wrong way. But the double-edge blades are definitely cheaper, and I&#x27;ve been able to find them at a local Kroger that probably stocks them because a lot of foreign college students shop there. So I&#x27;m going to use the Mehaz whenever I have time enough to give myself a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a well made safety razor. I am very pleased with the product with that said if you are getting this expecting the same shave you can get as far as closeness as some of the new 3 and 4 blade plastic razors it won&#x27;t happen, maybe if your 16 and just started shaving. I started shaving with one of these type razors many years ago and didn&#x27;t really remember what kind of shave you can get with one. If you have a tough beard it will take a few passes with this to get close and then it still won&#x27;t be up to par as the new 3 or 4 blades. I wanted to see how it would do and save some money but I may go back to the plastic and use this as a back up or weekender when it doesn&#x27;t matter so much. Still it&#x27;s a good product for what it is, just don&#x27;t be surprised when you can&#x27;t get as close a shave with it. I may try another safety razor that has the adjustable height feature I think that would work better for my purpose. I will add one thing I recently started using shaving soap and a brush, now if you want to improve your shaving experience try one, it is so much better than the foam or gel creams and one thing I really like is you can have a hot shave instead of putting on a cold foam or gel it really makes a difference and feels much better on the face as well. Hope this help.</li>
            <li> The Mehaz Double-Edge Safety Razor is a great buy for the first time user of double-edged razor.  The size is comparable to the old Gillette safety razors.  The butterfly mechanism is well made.  The first time user will find this double-edge razor to be very forgiving while he learns the technique of shaving with a double-edge.  I am using a Shark blade in the razor, which is considered an extremely sharp blade, and I have not nicked myself once.  So, those converting from a cartridge razor will not leave themselves a bloody mess while learning.  It is a German made razor like the Merkur, made in the same town in Germany.  A good buy for the double-edge shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for daily use as others have stated it has a mildly aggressive blade angle. I have sensitive skin and a thick beard so this razor with  Wilkinson Sword or Feather blades is truly a pleasure to use. I keep my De89 for special occasions but this is my everyday go-to razor. Very pleased</li>
            <li> The razor is not bad at all but I question if it is really made in Germany since it looks exactly like a Weishi 9306 series razor. I have a Weishi and this razor is exactly the same as that one. The only difference is that Mehaz is written on one of the butterfly doors on this one. Still not a bad razor but a little to mild for my taste. If you have a light beard or sensitive skin then this will be a great everyday razor. Works well Derby,feather,merkur and wilkinson sword blades. It was hard to tell which blade was better since this razor is mild, even the feather produced similar results to the derby. Overall decent quality razor but I prefer something a bit more aggressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those kooks that have a habit of collecting razors. Including this one, I have 6 DE razors, 3 true straight razors, and 2 shavettes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some have speculated that this is a re-branded Weishi, but I don&#x27;t think so. It is immaculately machined, and the fit and finish, and the alignment of the blade to the head is spot on. I have no doubt that it is actually made in Solingen, Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS  a very mild shave, and great for beginners... you would be hard pressed to cut yourself with this razor. Although it is in my rotation for normal shaving. I use what I want, whenever I feel like it... variety is the spice of life, no? But I also find myself reaching for it (or my Feather Popular) to touch up my problem areas that I have problems with, with a straight razor (under the neck, near the adams apple), if I want a truly BBS shave everywhere. Since it is such a mild razor, I pair it with my most aggressive blades, like a Feather. This results in a smooth, great shave, without the cuts, nicks, or razor burn, and I have fairly sensitive skin... which is why I changed from the multi-blade razors (in addition to the cost of replacement blades) and even electrics... both rotary and foil type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a beginner to wet shaving, or have very sensitive skin, this is the razor for you! Very well machined, fit, finish and blade alignment are awesome, and a very safe, comfortable shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick edit to cover a couple of things I missed the first time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller... Lock and Mane... fast shipping. Doesn&#x27;t include anything, just comes in a box with the razor, but very fast service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some reviewers have commented that it has a nice, heavy weight to it. I don&#x27;t find this to be the case. It is the lightest razor I own, with the possible exception of the partially plastic Feather Popular. I have a Pearl travel razor, and it is the heaviest razor I have... even heavier than my full size razors, and as one reviewer said, once it is assembled, you cannot tell it is a travel razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, don&#x27;t expect a heavy razor... it is VERY light weight. However, it DOES provide a very safe, close shave, especially for the beginner, or for touch ups after a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about going back to a double edged razor for some time. I got on line and did research on the razors that were offered.  I determined that the Mehaz was the one to go with. Is does a very good job at giving me a very close shave. I particularly liked the way you twist the base of the handle to install and remove the blade. I had this type of razor years ago so I wanted the same type again. The only dislike I have with the razor is that the handle is a little short for my hands. Other than that  I would recommend this razor to anyone that wants a close shave from a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> saving lots of money in blades over the throw away razors, and gives a decent shave too</li>
            <li> This is not bad quality for the price.  I use a three piece that cost twice as much when I&#x27;m home and I have to admit, I do like that one better.  It has more weight and a longer handle.  A long handle and a weighted head are most helpful when shaving with a DE blade.  This one is light, particularly in the head, and it is relatively short handled.  But it is a decent razor for traveling.  I find that lighter razors like this one do better with lighter &amp;#34;gauge&amp;#34; blades such as the Feathers or Derbys that you can also buy on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the first Safety Razor I used after about a 40 year break, and the basic butterfly design hasn&#x27;t changed much.  Mechanically it works well and provided a safe shave, making it a good choice as a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; razor.  As you can see from the picture, the finish is not really chrome, but more of a satin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this for a short time, I purchased a Merkur 33, which is a 3 three piece razor with a true chrome finish and a little more aggressive blade angle.  I&#x27;ve found I prefer the three piece design, as it provides a more secure lock on the blade isn&#x27;t that much more difficult to change blades on once you&#x27;ve used it a several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to conclude, I think the Mehaz is a fine razor if you like the satin finish, don&#x27;t have a coarse beard and prefer the butterfly design over a three piece.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this butterfly razor.  I just wish the handle was a little longer.  It is a great value for the price.  I would still recommend it to someone.</li>
            <li> Product is well made, and has groves in the metal of the razor to help guide hairs to the blade. Which makes for a close, and irritation free shave.I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first, but am glad I switched from the expensive disposable razors.  I just have to come up with a travel plan, since you can&#x27;t carry on the blades, and I never check bags.</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Good materials and build, easy to open and replace the blade.  Holds the blade securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick fast growing hair and shave every morning.  I have seen some people comment that this razor is so gentle it is like you are not even shaving and I agree.  But, whereas they for some reason see that as a negative, I see it as a great thing.  I like a quick easy shave that is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison I also have the following razors:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Futur- I like the way it shaves, but I do not like that it is so big and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Merkur HD 34C- I like the size and construction, but hate the way this razor shaves.  It always tears up my skin and cuts me.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fat Boy Adjustable- I like this razor.  It shaves almost like the Mehaz, but maybe a tiny bit more agressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have used lots of different creams and soaps.  Currently using Kiss My Face Moisture Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like using the extra sharp blades, like Shark or Feather, want to spend the time and effort to get as close as a shave as you can and don&#x27;t mind getting some cuts than maybe this isn&#x27;t the razor for you.  If you want a good, painless, fast, easy shave then this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> I am no longer getting ripped off by Bic or Gillette&#x27;s $5 a razor scam. This shaves better, the blades are dirt cheap, and they can be used for a few days per blade. The quality of the build is excellent. Nicely manufactured, great design, this razor is fantastic.</li>
            <li> best for the money no cuts at all the only razor I recommend for beginners you would not regret it.</li>
            <li> Back to the future shaving</li>
    </ol>
