            <li> little treasure.. smells so</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> there was very little smell.  </li>
            <li> I am guessing this product  is a knock off made in a back room in some scary</li>
            <li> Then I had the misfortune of dropping in on tile and even though it was broken all over my bathroom floor</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed about staying power in this roller ball.</li>

            <li> Wonderful!  I love it. I don&#x27;t use any other perfume.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner.  The perfume isn&#x27;t as strong as I would like, but I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love all of the Philosophy Amazing Grace fragrances &amp; products</li>
            <li> The fraquence is the best soft smell of heaven.  I love the name of it and it surelly is amazing Grace.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and very nice way to carry around in my purse. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I chose this roll-on Eau de Parfum as I was low on funds to replenish my usual order.  It actually does not smell the same. The company though was very prompt with the shipment.</li>
            <li> I love this roller ball! I don&#x27;t particularly like intense smells. I can wear this because it just smells like light, fresh, and clean...no strong aromas.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this through recommend by a friend and I love this. Almost running out need more.</li>
            <li> This was  great purchase. Fits in my purse and always have it close. I always get compliments on it. Love it</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed about staying power in this roller ball. The aroma is so fleeting. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THESE ITEMS AS STOCKING STUFFERS.  IAMRATING  THEM BASED ON THE RECIPIENTs Reaction to them.  They were  wanted and in the person &#x27; s area  of interest and need.  THE GINGERBREAD  book was the correct age level  We read it before making gingerbread man cookies.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to write reviews but I must warn you about this product. It took me several weeks to figure out what was making my eyes swell and my face look like the guy who owns the LA Clippers.  I am guessing this product  is a knock off made in a back room in some scary country.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Grace for ten years and I am not allergic to anything.  It almost ruined my vacation.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that there are a lot of  problems with knock offs on Amazon and am here to tell you that if it goes on your skin or in your body be extra careful what you order.</li>
            <li> I purchased this  roller ball and was immediately suspicious that the product fragrance was not what I was accustomed to.  Then I had the misfortune of dropping in on tile and even though it was broken all over my bathroom floor there was very little smell.  I don&#x27;t think this product is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fragrance not as intense as spray or solid stick...</li>
            <li> Just love the fragrance, now I can easily keep it with me where ever I go.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh, clean, and lightly floral fragrance. Which is exactly&lt;br /&gt;what I was looking for. I, also, found it to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent!!!  But I can&#x27;t find it available in retail stores in the roller ball any more.  :-(</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but does not last at all. Philosophy needs to do something to prolong the fragrance. The product would sell more if it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Great way to carry my favorite fragrance in my purse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anybody would order this for $33. It sells for $18 at Sephora, and according to other reviews this doesn;t even smell like it should. Please be warned!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents and now I can carry it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of that reason.&lt;br /&gt;Make the smell last and I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Theses roller balls are great for your purse or to travel with.  I love this scent, I happened to get this as a gift and loved it</li>
            <li> Why did they discontinue this...love it</li>
            <li> this is a nice light fragrance with an easy roll on style..&lt;br /&gt;perfect little treasure.. smells so good!!&lt;br /&gt;fresh scent..</li>
