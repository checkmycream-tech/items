            <li>It is great for me</li>
            <li>but as soon as I put it on it smells great  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is concentrated so once you hit the pump 1 or 2 times; you should be good for the rest of the day.</li>

            <li>Good longevity and projection.</li>

            <li>Love this bottle.</li>
            <li>I simply love this scent.</li>
            <li>Women love it on me.</li>
            <li>Love the cologne.  </li>
            <li>i will be ordering more</li>
            <li>only the scent is very good and can&#x27;t help</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique and more of a heavier musk type smell.</li>
            <li>It is a slightly heavy fragrance so summer wear may not be an option however it&#x27;s perfect for the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the kind of cologne I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I wanna to say that it&#x27;s great middle cool smell</li>
            <li>Unique in every way</li>
            <li>I had an original one and know what to</li>
            <li>smell goes sweet to cool degree .</li>
            <li>Amazon should really do something more to ensure the quality and the rotation of the stock.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a genuinely good smelling perfume, but all they sold me is water and a bit of fragrance which would not even last for 10 mins, trust me dont buy this product online, just buy it from a department or fragrance store but not from any seller online</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with price and shiping</li>
            <li>Not in the androgynous D&amp;G/Armani/YSL \\&quot;ohh you smell so sweet and fruity\\&quot; type of way; this fragrance triggers some kind of primal animal attraction in the opposite sex.  </li>
            <li>My first &amp;#34;really expensive&amp;#34; cologne and worth it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very hard to find but has one of the best smells</li>
            <li>The smell is very unique and musky, but it sends a clear message - I am a man, and if you give me a chance I&#x27;m gonna shag your friggin socks off!  </li>
            <li>If you want a nice fragrance, that is different and not everyone has, this may be the one for you.  </li>
            <li>smells good, The only thing is that,doesnt last more then couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Worth for your money.</li>
            <li>it stays on forever which may or may not be desirable, apparently depending on whether you&#x27;re in love with this scent</li>
            <li>Its very intense which I usally do not like</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s normal sweet.</li>
            <li>have read a lot of reviews that bring out this same problem on many colognes and perfumes bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot, after the first sprey..........</li>
            <li>No biggie though, &amp;#60;;).</li>
            <li>I must admit that the first time i applied this I was the least bit impressed initially</li>
            <li>on the positive side, definitely original, very recognizable, and if you click with it, you&#x27;ll like it big time.</li>
            <li>I was visiting with a friend that works in a dept. store and he was talking about this cologne and how much he likes it.</li>
            <li>This smells very powdery.</li>
            <li>Very manly smell to it</li>
            <li>The fragrance is I bit spicy and come off very manly.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s for kind of man being specific and romantic.</li>
            <li>As so few stores actually carry it - it&#x27;s nice to be able to get it delivered directly.</li>
            <li>I mean elegant dinners, ballroom private parties and presidential meeting kind of cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, but it is very light and has a very subtle aroma, so it is probably not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in a new fragrance when this one surfaced as an option at the fragrance counter, I smelled it and decided at that moment I needed to make this purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly a Fall and Winter scent.</li>
            <li>Normally would buy this from Sephora</li>
            <li>A very masculine scent that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>but after it settles, WOW!</li>
            <li>Can never be mistaken for anything else but masculine.</li>
            <li>Wow.........</li>
            <li>uncompromisingly masculine which is another reason for attention.  </li>
            <li>- this scent drives women wild.  </li>
            <li>but it subsides rather quickly and have to go with the bottle in my briefcase and once in a while spray a little bit on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will tell you that the prices on Amazon are very similar to those in the major department stores.</li>
            <li>I mean a true</li>
            <li>the female version is great but the male :-(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not order this product from Amazon so I cannot tell you anything about the shipping process. I will tell you that the prices on Amazon are very similar to those in the major department stores. I was interested in a new fragrance when this one surfaced as an option at the fragrance counter, I smelled it and decided at that moment I needed to make this purchase. It is a slightly heavy fragrance so summer wear may not be an option however it&#x27;s perfect for the fall and winter. The fragrance is concentrated so once you hit the pump 1 or 2 times; you should be good for the rest of the day. I&#x27;d suggest business casual or suit wear.  I wore some to an event and had a few women ask what I was wearing. If you want a nice fragrance, that is different and not everyone has, this may be the one for you.  I hope this helps. As always.... YMMV.........NEOSOUL</li>
            <li> For the man with discerning taste. Raw. Can never be mistaken for anything else but masculine.</li>
            <li> Great Price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping very good price</li>
            <li> My son wanted this cologne for his birthday but Nordhstrom&#x27;s did not have it in stock, within 3 days I was able to have it delivered before his birthday and he loves it</li>
            <li> This stuff is very hard to find but has one of the best smells and everyone is always asking me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> The quality is there. Very sophisticated. Night out fragrance only.This scent means business.Projection two hours.Longevity five to six hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did a review on this cologne earlier which was a mistake. Someone on ebay sold me a fake bottle of this cologne.I feel bad that I only gave it 3 stars.This cologne should be 5 stars I feel.Just one spray and it stays with you all day.Its very intense which I usally do not like only the scent is very good and can&#x27;t help but like it.I was visiting with a friend that works in a dept. store and he was talking about this cologne and how much he likes it.So I sampled it only to find out I had purchased a fake bottle from someone on ebay.This is a very good scent,one spray is all I need for all day.I guess I will be more carefull where I buy my cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those scents that random people compliment you on. It&#x27;s unique and more of a heavier musk type smell. A very masculine scent that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanna to say that it&#x27;s great middle cool smell, it&#x27;s smell goes sweet to cool degree . It&#x27;s not agressive  but it&#x27;s normal sweet. It is great for me and I think it&#x27;s for kind of man being specific and romantic.</li>
            <li> Good perfume. smells good, The only thing is that,doesnt last more then couple of hours. Overall very satisfied with price and shiping</li>
            <li> Love this bottle. This one my second bottle. Good longevity and projection. Worth for your money. This one of the best product in the market in this category.</li>
            <li> Yes, as a description I read once said, &amp;#34;she&#x27;ll know what&#x27;s on your mind&amp;#34; when wearing this... she does and she likes it! Works for me!</li>
            <li> This smells very powdery. Not like I thought it would at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but as soon as I put it on it smells great  but it subsides rather quickly and have to go with the bottle in my briefcase and once in a while spray a little bit on.&lt;br /&gt;I have read a lot of reviews that bring out this same problem on many colognes and perfumes bought on Amazon. I do not seem to have this issue when I buy my cologne in a department store. Amazon should really do something more to ensure the quality and the rotation of the stock.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes I&#x27;ve ever had. Very manly smell to it that gets me a lot of compliments every time I wear it. As so few stores actually carry it - it&#x27;s nice to be able to get it delivered directly. This arrived less than a week after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely examples of a little dab will you do you!! I simply love this scent.It&#x27;s mainly a Fall and Winter scent.</li>
            <li> Another gift for my boyfriend. He really smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a genuinely good smelling perfume, but all they sold me is water and a bit of fragrance which would not even last for 10 mins, trust me dont buy this product online, just buy it from a department or fragrance store but not from any seller online</li>
            <li> Musky, evocative of rain on a mountain, and flower-laden gravestones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressive sillage. My only complaint is that it is lacking in longevity.</li>
            <li> Unique in every way and I think I am the only one with it. Always get compliments. Women love it on me.</li>
            <li> I must admit that the first time i applied this I was the least bit impressed initially I said to myself &amp;#34;great, I cannot begin to even describe this scent what the heck is this?&amp;#34;.........but hold on, hold on. (Stopped in my tracks) what is that aroma? Is that me? Yup, that is me the scent of violet leaf and musk is an odd combination but after it settles, WOW! I mean a true Wow.........this is a must have that causes you to break this out ever so once in awhile. I mean elegant dinners, ballroom private parties and presidential meeting kind of cologne. Give it a shot, after the first sprey..........(SMH) then comes the delight. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent. I bought it for him as a gift.  Normally would buy this from Sephora but they didn&#x27;t have it in stock anymore.</li>
            <li> not for every one.  it stays on forever which may or may not be desirable, apparently depending on whether you&#x27;re in love with this scent (I got annoyed).  uncompromisingly masculine which is another reason for attention.  night only.  on the positive side, definitely original, very recognizable, and if you click with it, you&#x27;ll like it big time.</li>
            <li> You need some hair on your chest and a swagger in your step to pull this one off.  Let me tell you something gentlemen - this scent drives women wild.  Not in the androgynous D&amp;G/Armani/YSL \\&quot;ohh you smell so sweet and fruity\\&quot; type of way; this fragrance triggers some kind of primal animal attraction in the opposite sex.  The smell is very unique and musky, but it sends a clear message - I am a man, and if you give me a chance I&#x27;m gonna shag your friggin socks off!  I feel like roaring after I put it on.  One squirt (only one please!) and you&#x27;re off to the races...</li>
            <li> words cant explain the scent this gives off. Its like euphoria in a bottle. Good stuff. Gonna order another one when this one is on half.. Only downside is, I cant see when its on half due to the dark design. No biggie though, &amp;#60;;).</li>
            <li> Ladies like it, but you&#x27;ll get tired of smelling it</li>
            <li> Love the cologne.  My wife too.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product, I hated the smell and all of my friends hated it as well, Take it from me if you are going to buy this sample it first. Great Designer but horrible product the female version is great but the male :-(</li>
            <li> This is a very good fragrance for the price. This is one of the nicest bottles that I own. The fragrance is I bit spicy and come off very manly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the kind of cologne I was looking for.  A little goes a long way, and it smells great!  My first &amp;#34;really expensive&amp;#34; cologne and worth it!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FAKE!!!  DON&amp;#34;T BUY IT!!! SEE ITEM PICTURES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Bottle is so poorly made that I can see the painting defects inside the bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Plastic on the spray area is not complete&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Smell is horrible I had an original one and know what to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got a refund from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, but it is very light and has a very subtle aroma, so it is probably not for everyone.  It is very hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne,i purchase  4 from Amazon and the price is great  Saks do not have this cologne anymore so i decide to stack up i will be ordering more</li>
            <li> This is not the one I thought I was buying though i has the same brand and a similar looking. However it smells like s***.</li>
