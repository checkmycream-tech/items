            <li>This stuff is wonderful and I am actually excited about trying more CD products.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The scent of Mimosa Hair Honey is amazing -- it has a hint of sweetness(honey) and citrus(orange oil) in the product.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>but already I am LOVING this product.</li>
            <li>Here is my honest feedback on the products.  </li>
            <li>Not that great on shine, but it does smell great and leaves hair soft.    </li>
            <li>After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma</li>
            <li>It is very light so there is no build up as with petroleum based products.</li>
            <li>It is a VERY light oil and seems to be most appropriate for very fine textured, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the reviews, and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how glad I am to have the Hair Honey.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I have many hair care products that have scents, and I can smell those scents as I use them.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my relaxed hair was damaged, this worked great and was very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I decided it would be better for my hair than one of the water based products.</li>
            <li>I am using this and the CD Healthy Hair Butter as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>This product is more like grease, I guess.  </li>
            <li>If you do need to re-apply, you can re-apply as many times as you want and it won&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li>and I abolutely love the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never received more compliments than I have while using CD products and I will continue using them, I suspect, for years to come.</li>
            <li>My hair kept shedding all the time and thinned out my hair even more.</li>
            <li>Update: If you&#x27;re sensitive -- I recommend using Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful products if you can find them online.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair.</li>
            <li>The Mimosa Hair Honey, in combination with some of the other CD products, is an excellent finishing pomade.</li>
            <li>Also has a strong, medicinal smell.    </li>
            <li>Was good at providing high shine.  </li>
            <li>It smells like pomade but its a light moisturizer with NO water.</li>
            <li>Use your own discretion with how much to use.  </li>
            <li>This does great on my permed short cut and makes my hair shine without feeling greasy!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important not to over do it.</li>
            <li>The company is always reformulating and updating it&#x27;s products which is very exciting.</li>
            <li>My curls are clean, light, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>But, when I am finished shampooing, or using my conditioner, there is no scent remaining except that of clean hair.  </li>
            <li>This pomade by far is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried in my entire life</li>
            <li>It is great for dry ends too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with every product I&#x27;ve purchased from CD and other than my favorite, which is the hair butter, I&#x27;d have to say the hair honey is my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more Carol&#x27;s Daughter products thanks to the results of this one.</li>
            <li>Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust the drugstore brands that are full of mineral oil and petroleum products designed, not to help our hair but to fill up the jar and turn a profit.</li>
            <li>True</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard quite a few great things about Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I find that it works better on natural hair and relaxed hair that is damaged.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair moist and soft and with more curl definition.</li>
            <li>This product was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 4 years - I recently went natural and this works great for pressing my hair -</li>
            <li>The smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Basically, this is a nice smelling product, but I do not desire to smell like a Yankee Candle Shop all day long.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, although heavy.</li>
            <li>This product is rich, but at the same time light.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that this product does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it arrived on the date promised.</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly potent since I&#x27;ve been using the same 8 oz jar (weekly applications) since Christmas &#x27;05 and have a ways to go.</li>
            <li>When I use it on my ends just before adding hot rollers or hot curlers</li>
            <li>Love the fact that the shipping was free and that it was priced reasonably well and arrived sooner than expected!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much of any of the CD products, they are very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>Hair honey definitely smells better than any of the other CD hair products I have tried - hair milk, healthy hair butter, lisa&#x27;s elixir, loc butter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll leave your hair super soft, shiny and with no frizzies.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite CD hair product (hair balm is, but I have not tried any of them outside of wearing my natural curls - trying to stay away from heat for a while!).</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from sweating out and puffing up when the weather gets a little warm &amp; humid - try it</li>
            <li>Ultimately, however, the scent of the product is why I had a huge problem with the product.</li>
            <li>It can give a greasy appearance if you put too much, or put it to close to your scalp.</li>
            <li>and I find that this product does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I have to agree that the fragrances can catch you off guard if you&#x27;re unprepared, but before purchasing the products I read all reviews for every CD product on Amazon, the CD web site and others before purchasing it which really helped.</li>
            <li>my hair is very shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Now I use Whole Foods 365 shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that they provide an option for those sensitive to allergens (with unscented products), or the option of choosing different scents.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go near this company!!!</li>
            <li>Replace it with a smell more like that of black vanilla or mimosa.    </li>
            <li>But just a smidge for my dry hair means I can use a light gel.</li>
            <li>but once my hair got better this even in the smallest amount made my hair very greasy and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from Carol&#x27;s Daughter last week since they offered free shipping</li>
            <li>If you do not have allergies, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural, and am not interested in waves, shine, etc, just healthy hair.</li>
            <li>And I was really excited about purchasing the Mimosa Hair Honey for my dry, 4A hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural hair products that have just left my hair feeling dry and brittle...</li>
            <li>The downside of this product is that I&#x27;m highly sensitive/allergic to anything containing natural floral ingredients (even if it&#x27;s perfume).</li>
            <li>It creates very soft looking curls.</li>
            <li>but I really like the Hair Honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front.</li>
            <li>Mimosa Hair honey has the consistency of some of the hair pomades/greases you&#x27;d find at your local drug stores -- except that the ingredients are of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li>In general,  these products are not that much better than what you get on the open market of black hair care products for a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>I am a black woman with natural, fine kinky hair</li>
            <li>I was afraid of trying out Carol&#x27;s Daughter at first because I didn&#x27;t hear good things about it.</li>
            <li>The frangrance is stronger than other products, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>Whether you have straight wavy hair, coarse hair, natural curly hair or processed hair, it works for everyone!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it was too oily for me... even using a little tiny bit.    </li>
            <li>moisturizes my hair and made it extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Since I am transitioning (from a perm)back to my natural hair state, I decided to try out Carol&#x27;s Daughter products versus Jane Carter products.</li>
            <li>So far I am liking Jane Carter products?</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you are allergic to/highly sensitive to pollen -- stay away from this product.    </li>
            <li>Her chic hair products (hair milk and hair butter) work -- they are moisturizing (a bonus for natural heads).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable and noticeably reduces breakage.</li>
            <li>daughters and I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a life saver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Carol&#x27;s Daughter since my hair was natural and she was mixing up concoctions in Brooklyn.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair also feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>while i did love the smell and shine it provided, my hair is simply to thick and coarse to see any real advantage.</li>
            <li>They listen to their customer base and perfect products from there.</li>
            <li>This product can weight down your hair very quickly, you only need the tinest amount.</li>
            <li>Some of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butters list water as the first ingredient, which would dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>There has been  noticeably less breakage, and it makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>However, I will keep using the Hair Butter for daily use, the Khoret Amen Hair Oil for my skin, and the Elixir for hot oil treatments and rinse it (Elixir) out with VO5 deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>With my texture, it may be heavy for flat ironing as I have very bouncy hair, but I don&#x27;t know that to be true yet.</li>
            <li>I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair manageable and after I blow dry the hair, I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair if I don&#x27;t want to because it&#x27;s straight!</li>
            <li>I know natural oils (like olive oil, coconut oil) are terrific for type 3C/4A/4B hair.</li>
            <li>I had to give this product away to a relative who isn&#x27;t sensitive to flower pollens.</li>
            <li>With natural hair you have to try products yourself to see if you&#x27;ll have the same results as the next naturally curly girl.</li>
            <li>so far, the only CD products I&#x27;ll stick with are the hair balm &amp; hair milk.</li>
            <li>This line of products is the only line that has completely tamed my hair and eliminated my breakage.    </li>
            <li>All in all,I really disliked this product and threw it away when I received my Keune Shaping Fibres (which I had used previously and had enjoyed).  </li>
            <li>As suggested in some of the reviews I have read, I have only used this around my edges and to brush my naturally curly hair back into a ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li>I use it as a sheen for my natural curls as well as to balance my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>the Black Vanilla just makes my Hair even more thick.</li>
            <li>For my little bro, his natural hair loves this product, it makes the curls softer and gives his hair a natural shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products to tame my very huge and very thick, natural afro, and</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much of any of the CD products, they are very concentrated.  </li>
            <li> Hair honey definitely smells better than any of the other CD hair products I have tried - hair milk, healthy hair butter, lisa&#x27;s elixir, loc butter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll leave your hair super soft, shiny and with no frizzies.</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite CD hair product (hair balm is, but I have not tried any of them outside of wearing my natural curls - trying to stay away from heat for a while!).</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair from sweating out and puffing up when the weather gets a little warm &amp; humid - try it</li>
            <li> Ultimately, however, the scent of the product is why I had a huge problem with the product.</li>
            <li> It can give a greasy appearance if you put too much, or put it to close to your scalp.</li>
            <li> and I find that this product does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I have to agree that the fragrances can catch you off guard if you&#x27;re unprepared, but before purchasing the products I read all reviews for every CD product on Amazon, the CD web site and others before purchasing it which really helped.</li>
            <li> my hair is very shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Now I use Whole Foods 365 shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that they provide an option for those sensitive to allergens (with unscented products), or the option of choosing different scents.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go near this company!!!</li>
            <li> Replace it with a smell more like that of black vanilla or mimosa.    </li>
            <li> But just a smidge for my dry hair means I can use a light gel.</li>
            <li> but once my hair got better this even in the smallest amount made my hair very greasy and heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from Carol&#x27;s Daughter last week since they offered free shipping</li>
            <li> If you do not have allergies, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural, and am not interested in waves, shine, etc, just healthy hair.</li>
            <li> And I was really excited about purchasing the Mimosa Hair Honey for my dry, 4A hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural hair products that have just left my hair feeling dry and brittle...</li>
            <li> The downside of this product is that I&#x27;m highly sensitive/allergic to anything containing natural floral ingredients (even if it&#x27;s perfume).</li>
            <li> It creates very soft looking curls.</li>
            <li> but I really like the Hair Honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front.</li>
            <li> Mimosa Hair honey has the consistency of some of the hair pomades/greases you&#x27;d find at your local drug stores -- except that the ingredients are of a higher quality.  </li>
            <li> In general,  these products are not that much better than what you get on the open market of black hair care products for a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman with natural, fine kinky hair</li>
            <li> I was afraid of trying out Carol&#x27;s Daughter at first because I didn&#x27;t hear good things about it.</li>
            <li> The frangrance is stronger than other products, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Whether you have straight wavy hair, coarse hair, natural curly hair or processed hair, it works for everyone!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it was too oily for me... even using a little tiny bit.    </li>
            <li> moisturizes my hair and made it extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Since I am transitioning (from a perm)back to my natural hair state, I decided to try out Carol&#x27;s Daughter products versus Jane Carter products.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking Jane Carter products?</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you are allergic to/highly sensitive to pollen -- stay away from this product.    </li>
            <li> Her chic hair products (hair milk and hair butter) work -- they are moisturizing (a bonus for natural heads).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable and noticeably reduces breakage.</li>
            <li> daughters and I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Carol&#x27;s Daughter since my hair was natural and she was mixing up concoctions in Brooklyn.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair also feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> while i did love the smell and shine it provided, my hair is simply to thick and coarse to see any real advantage.</li>
            <li> They listen to their customer base and perfect products from there.</li>
            <li> This product can weight down your hair very quickly, you only need the tinest amount.</li>
            <li> Some of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butters list water as the first ingredient, which would dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> There has been  noticeably less breakage, and it makes my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li> However, I will keep using the Hair Butter for daily use, the Khoret Amen Hair Oil for my skin, and the Elixir for hot oil treatments and rinse it (Elixir) out with VO5 deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> With my texture, it may be heavy for flat ironing as I have very bouncy hair, but I don&#x27;t know that to be true yet.</li>
            <li> I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair manageable and after I blow dry the hair, I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair if I don&#x27;t want to because it&#x27;s straight!</li>
            <li> I know natural oils (like olive oil, coconut oil) are terrific for type 3C/4A/4B hair.</li>
            <li> I had to give this product away to a relative who isn&#x27;t sensitive to flower pollens.</li>
            <li> With natural hair you have to try products yourself to see if you&#x27;ll have the same results as the next naturally curly girl.</li>
            <li> so far, the only CD products I&#x27;ll stick with are the hair balm &amp; hair milk.</li>
            <li> This line of products is the only line that has completely tamed my hair and eliminated my breakage.    </li>
            <li> All in all,I really disliked this product and threw it away when I received my Keune Shaping Fibres (which I had used previously and had enjoyed).  </li>
            <li> As suggested in some of the reviews I have read, I have only used this around my edges and to brush my naturally curly hair back into a ponytail or bun.</li>
            <li> I use it as a sheen for my natural curls as well as to balance my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> the Black Vanilla just makes my Hair even more thick.</li>
            <li> For my little bro, his natural hair loves this product, it makes the curls softer and gives his hair a natural shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products to tame my very huge and very thick, natural afro, and</li>
            <li> I really hope that in the future that Carol&#x27;s Daughter produces a hair line that&#x27;s all natural -- but hypoallergenic (free of pollens and other scents that can make highly sensitive people like myself easily sick.)</li>
            <li> The Black Vanilla left my hair even more thick -- once I washed it!</li>
            <li> I, too, have dry coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> After only using it 3-4 times, that big ole jar sat in my medicine cabinet (along with 4-5 other CD products) for over a year before I tossed it in the trash.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be using this for a long time to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My ends did not look dry, frizzy, or damaged.</li>
            <li> I air dry my hair and do not add any heat products to it.</li>
            <li> Then I towel dry and put just a tad of the mimosa honey on my hands and scrunch it into my hair.</li>
            <li> Three hours after using this product, I had a headache -- which only went away after I washed the product out of my hair a few hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not conversant with the number/alpha system of grading hair, but mine is an abundance of  thick, soft and kinky loveliness, so breakage is a concern as well as finding a product with enough oils (and of course without mineral oil or petroleum).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick, but if you have very course &amp; dry hair, then this product is definitely what you need.</li>
            <li> The only thing is a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered several Carol&#x27;s Daughter products:  Honey mimosa pomade, hair milk, black vanilla leave-in conditioner and the Tui hair oil.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> I had very bad split ends most of my life and the hair honey eliminated it completely.     </li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t mind the citrus scent competing with your perfume/cologne or other products, then enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply it at night so it won&#x27;t compete with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from mousse&#x27;s, gels, sprays, other curly/antifrizz creams and nothing</li>
            <li> I have long hair and using other hair greases/moisturizers leave my hair stringy and limp.  </li>
            <li> Before you think I am just slamming Carol&#x27;s Daughter, I want you to know that I gave Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla a number of tries before disliking it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman whose hair curls when wet and frizzes in humidity.</li>
            <li> My bottle arrived in a small, black, ultra chic Sephora cinch bag with a red tassle.     </li>
            <li> My sister loves it, but I felt that CD took the style over substance approach -- it wasn&#x27;t terribly conditioning/softening for me, so I don&#x27;t know what it is really good for.</li>
            <li> We usually go down about an inch from our roots.</li>
            <li> I am only sorry I didn&#x27;t get the larger size.</li>
            <li> Black vanilla---seems to be just water.  </li>
            <li> a black women</li>
            <li> I need to use a product for nothing but black women not a product where any nationality can use.</li>
            <li> A black womens hair like mine cannot hold all of that perfume s</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> After some of the reviews, I was a little unsure about this, but I used it</li>
            <li> This product is now in my everyday regimen.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly thin hair that tends to get frizzy a lot!</li>
            <li> i used this for a few months and it took out of my hair.</li>
            <li> As some have said, the mimosa honey is heavy.</li>
            <li> I tried a very little bit on the ends of my hair when I flatironed it this weekend.</li>
            <li> I have been using CD products intermittently over the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I flat twisted my hair and placed it on my hair</li>
            <li> This has a delicate scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to both add shine and moisture to my thick course shoulder length hair...</li>
            <li> but my hair became worse to the point where my hair kept falling out.</li>
            <li> I just hate that I have bought all of these Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and cannot exchange them.</li>
            <li> Hair Milk-helped with curls, but smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews, and I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how glad I am to have the Hair Honey.  It is wonderful!!  It leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy.  The smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;m ordering this product again.  I found that if you leave the lid off the jar, the smell lessens over a period of time.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about the shine and the control the Mimosa brings to my hair.  I, too, have dry coarse hair.  Also works great for blow drying!!!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this product does exactly what it claims.  It holds my hair well, and it has a pleasant scent.  However, I did not think before I ordered.  I have many hair care products that have scents, and I can smell those scents as I use them.  But, when I am finished shampooing, or using my conditioner, there is no scent remaining except that of clean hair.  With this product, I was enticed by the citrus scent, but did not stop to realize that the scent would stay with me throughout the day.  Basically, this is a nice smelling product, but I do not desire to smell like a Yankee Candle Shop all day long.  So, if you don&#x27;t mind the citrus scent competing with your perfume/cologne or other products, then enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upadte 10/24/09:  Revised my review one star lower as this product is incredbly greasy.  I found myself, throughout the day, taking paper towels and wiping my head in order remove excess greasy content from my hair.  All in all,I really disliked this product and threw it away when I received my Keune Shaping Fibres (which I had used previously and had enjoyed).  I can not recommend Mimosa Hair Honey to anyone.</li>
            <li> As suggested in some of the reviews I have read, I have only used this around my edges and to brush my naturally curly hair back into a ponytail or bun. It has worked well for this use. With my texture, it may be heavy for flat ironing as I have very bouncy hair, but I don&#x27;t know that to be true yet. It is not my favorite CD hair product (hair balm is, but I have not tried any of them outside of wearing my natural curls - trying to stay away from heat for a while!). Hair honey definitely smells better than any of the other CD hair products I have tried - hair milk, healthy hair butter, lisa&#x27;s elixir, loc butter (on a friends hair), and hair balm.      UPDATE - I tried a very little bit on the ends of my hair when I flatironed it this weekend. I dabbed my finger just so that there was only a trace and rolled the ends of each piece of my hair before flatironing. I was pleased with the results. My ends did not look dry, frizzy, or damaged.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my hair and made it extremely soft. I flat twisted my hair and placed it on my hair and I loved the results! I was afraid of trying out Carol&#x27;s Daughter at first because I didn&#x27;t hear good things about it. This stuff is wonderful and I am actually excited about trying more CD products. It smells like pomade but its a light moisturizer with NO water. It kept my hair from getting frizzy and puffy. I like the fact that I have something now to moisturize my hair just in case I want to straighten it. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This product can weight down your hair very quickly, you only need the tinest amount. I find that it works better on natural hair and relaxed hair that is damaged. When my relaxed hair was damaged, this worked great and was very moisturizing but once my hair got better this even in the smallest amount made my hair very greasy and heavy feeling. I had to wash it only a couple days. For my little bro, his natural hair loves this product, it makes the curls softer and gives his hair a natural shine.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to both add shine and moisture to my thick course shoulder length hair...I think that I have FINALLY found what I am looking for!  It is great for dry ends too!  It has only been a couple days but already I am LOVING this product. Mind you I air dry my hair and do not add any heat products to it. Please do not change a thing!  It smells good and works!  My fear is that it will get discontinued for some reason...so I had to leave my review on this product and I ordered another 5 jars just in case!  Love the fact that the shipping was free and that it was priced reasonably well and arrived sooner than expected!  And it works wonderfully!  I have tried many natural hair products that have just left my hair feeling dry and brittle...just can&#x27;t get the moisture that I needed.  Thank you, thank you, Carol&#x27;s Daughter!!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I am transitioning (from a perm)back to my natural hair state, I decided to try out Carol&#x27;s Daughter products versus Jane Carter products. Before you think I am just slamming Carol&#x27;s Daughter, I want you to know that I gave Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla a number of tries before disliking it.  The Black Vanilla left my hair even more thick -- once I washed it! I followed the HOW To Steps on the Carol&#x27;s Daughter website and even tried some the YOUTUBE fans idea but the Black Vanilla just makes my Hair even more thick. I will never use the shampoo&#x27;s, conditioner, nor the leave in conditioner again!!!!  However, I will keep using the Hair Butter for daily use, the Khoret Amen Hair Oil for my skin, and the Elixir for hot oil treatments and rinse it (Elixir) out with VO5 deep conditioning. So far I am liking Jane Carter products? It makes my hair manageable and after I blow dry the hair, I don&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair if I don&#x27;t want to because it&#x27;s straight! I just hate that I have bought all of these Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and cannot exchange them. I guess I will just donate them to someone.</li>
            <li> It was sticky and overscented. My sister loves it, but I felt that CD took the style over substance approach -- it wasn&#x27;t terribly conditioning/softening for me, so I don&#x27;t know what it is really good for.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product (honey)did not bother me at all.  I didn&#x27;t even smell it after I applied it.  I have dry, thick hair.  This product gives your hair the control and manageability that you may not find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The Mimosa Hair Honey is wonderful! First of all, it arrived on the date promised. Based on the reviews I decided it would be better for my hair than one of the water based products. I&#x27;m not conversant with the number/alpha system of grading hair, but mine is an abundance of  thick, soft and kinky loveliness, so breakage is a concern as well as finding a product with enough oils (and of course without mineral oil or petroleum). I wear my hair natural, and am not interested in waves, shine, etc, just healthy hair. Some of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butters list water as the first ingredient, which would dry out my hair. The smell is pleasant, although heavy. I apply it at night so it won&#x27;t compete with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I just started using Carols Daughters products but I really like the Hair Honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front. I just use a little water and hair honey, tie a scarf for about ten minutes, and my all-natural new growth is smooth, soft, and exactly where I want it to be without using harsh gels, sprays, or spritzes. I am using this and the CD Healthy Hair Butter as a leave-in. I love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard quite a few great things about Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products. And I was really excited about purchasing the Mimosa Hair Honey for my dry, 4A hair. My bottle arrived in a small, black, ultra chic Sephora cinch bag with a red tassle.     Mimosa Hair honey has the consistency of some of the hair pomades/greases you&#x27;d find at your local drug stores -- except that the ingredients are of a higher quality.  The scent of Mimosa Hair Honey is amazing -- it has a hint of sweetness(honey) and citrus(orange oil) in the product.     Ultimately, however, the scent of the product is why I had a huge problem with the product. I know natural oils (like olive oil, coconut oil) are terrific for type 3C/4A/4B hair. The downside of this product is that I&#x27;m highly sensitive/allergic to anything containing natural floral ingredients (even if it&#x27;s perfume). Three hours after using this product, I had a headache -- which only went away after I washed the product out of my hair a few hours later. I had to give this product away to a relative who isn&#x27;t sensitive to flower pollens. She loves the product.    I really hope that in the future that Carol&#x27;s Daughter produces a hair line that&#x27;s all natural -- but hypoallergenic (free of pollens and other scents that can make highly sensitive people like myself easily sick.) If you do not have allergies, I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. Otherwise, if you are allergic to/highly sensitive to pollen -- stay away from this product.    2010 Update: If you&#x27;re sensitive -- I recommend using Karen&#x27;s Body Beautiful products if you can find them online. (Google it). Her chic hair products (hair milk and hair butter) work -- they are moisturizing (a bonus for natural heads). What&#x27;s even better is that they provide an option for those sensitive to allergens (with unscented products), or the option of choosing different scents. Not a KBB Shill, but I&#x27;m a fan now.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago.  I have thick, long, relaxed hair.  After some of the reviews, I was a little unsure about this, but I used it and I already feel a difference.  The frangrance is stronger than other products, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  Use your own discretion with how much to use.  This product is more like grease, I guess.  I use it on my scalp, and I rub it on my hands... then on my ends before I wrap it.  There has been  noticeably less breakage, and it makes my hair super soft.  Its a winner with me!</li>
            <li> This product is now in my everyday regimen. Even though I don&#x27;t need to, I use this with a leave in conditioner. This product leaves my hair moist and soft and with more curl definition. With natural hair you have to try products yourself to see if you&#x27;ll have the same results as the next naturally curly girl. This product was well worth the money. This has a delicate scent to it. If you use another scented product it will not over power.I plan on buying more Carol&#x27;s Daughter products thanks to the results of this one.</li>
            <li> This pomade by far is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried in my entire life and i&#x27;m not just exaggerating. I have natural curly thin hair that tends to get frizzy a lot! I&#x27;ve used everything from mousse&#x27;s, gels, sprays, other curly/antifrizz creams and nothing tames my hair the way this does. You don&#x27;t even have to re-apply it. It&#x27;ll leave your hair super soft, shiny and with no frizzies. And it smells great! If you do need to re-apply, you can re-apply as many times as you want and it won&#x27;t get greasy. I hope this product never discontinues cause I have found the solution to my hair. It&#x27;s awesome awesome awesome! It&#x27;s for all kinds of hair by the way. Whether you have straight wavy hair, coarse hair, natural curly hair or processed hair, it works for everyone!</li>
            <li> Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  This product is rich, but at the same time light.  After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn&#x27;t detect the \\&quot;cirtus\\&quot; smell in the product description.  I am only sorry I didn&#x27;t get the larger size.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with natural, fine kinky hair and I use this product on my hair daily as needed. It makes my hair soft and manageable and noticeably reduces breakage. It is a great moisturizer. On top of that it smells GREAT. It is very light so there is no build up as with petroleum based products.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it was too oily for me... even using a little tiny bit.    After only using it 3-4 times, that big ole jar sat in my medicine cabinet (along with 4-5 other CD products) for over a year before I tossed it in the trash.     so far, the only CD products I&#x27;ll stick with are the hair balm &amp; hair milk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair products to tame my very huge and very thick, natural afro, and CD&#x27;s Mimosa Hair Honey is one of my favorites. I use it as a sheen for my natural curls as well as to balance my dry scalp. It&#x27;s a little thick, but if you have very course &amp; dry hair, then this product is definitely what you need.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;My daughters and I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a life saver. It gives shine, and hold without stiffness. It creates very soft looking curls. The only thing is a little goes a long way. It can give a greasy appearance if you put too much, or put it to close to your scalp. We usually go down about an inch from our roots. It also leaves your hair touchable without that gross grimy feeling on your hands. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using CD products intermittently over the past 4 years. The company is always reformulating and updating it&#x27;s products which is very exciting. They listen to their customer base and perfect products from there. I have 3C/4A grade African American Hair. The Mimosa Hair Honey, in combination with some of the other CD products, is an excellent finishing pomade. You don&#x27;t have to use very much of any of the CD products, they are very concentrated.  It adds shine,defines/defrizzes curls, and best of all it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Carol&#x27;s Daughter since my hair was natural and she was mixing up concoctions in Brooklyn.  Now, my hair is relaxed and the Mimosa Hair Honey is the ONLY thing I use on my scalp.  I don&#x27;t trust the drugstore brands that are full of mineral oil and petroleum products designed, not to help our hair but to fill up the jar and turn a profit. I have long hair and using other hair greases/moisturizers leave my hair stringy and limp.  When I apply this only to my scalp, massage and comb my hair, it is lustrous and keeps flakes at bay.  It is also incredibly potent since I&#x27;ve been using the same 8 oz jar (weekly applications) since Christmas &#x27;05 and have a ways to go.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I find that this product does absolutely nothing. It is a VERY light oil and seems to be most appropriate for very fine textured, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered several Carol&#x27;s Daughter products:  Honey mimosa pomade, hair milk, black vanilla leave-in conditioner and the Tui hair oil.  Here is my honest feedback on the products.  I want to continue buying some of them, but they would need some changes.    Hair mimosa---no complaints about this product.  It basically does what it says.  Not that great on shine, but it does smell great and leaves hair soft.    Hair Milk-helped with curls, but smells terrible.  Please change the smell or offer an unscented version. People would literally complain about the smell of my hair.  It is too medicinal.  Replace it with a smell more like that of black vanilla or mimosa.    Black vanilla---seems to be just water.  Smells good; no affect on the condition of the hair whatsoever.    Tui oil-terrible product.  Caused itching and flaking of my scalp.  Was good at providing high shine.  Also has a strong, medicinal smell.    Bottom line---two products smell delightful; two horrible.  In general,  these products are not that much better than what you get on the open market of black hair care products for a much lower cost.  These products contain a lot of plant material.  Be careful if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from Carol&#x27;s Daughter last week since they offered free shipping and I abolutely love the product.  This does great on my permed short cut and makes my hair shine without feeling greasy!  The smell is also great.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I order several products as gifts from Carols Daughter and they promised to ship the merchandise in 2 to 5 days.  It is now over 3 weeks and still no order. Their customer service does not respond to emails and NO ONE EVER picks up the customer service telephone number. You just get a recording that goes around in a loop forever. Don&#x27;t go near this company!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years - I recently went natural and this works great for pressing my hair - It keeps my hair from sweating out and puffing up when the weather gets a little warm &amp; humid - try it and you&#x27;ll agree - It works great!!!</li>
            <li> while i did love the smell and shine it provided, my hair is simply to thick and coarse to see any real advantage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman whose hair curls when wet and frizzes in humidity. I&#x27;ve tried an extensive variety of hair products throughout my life and NONE of them have compared to the CD line. I&#x27;ve been using CD products for 4 months. This line of products is the only line that has completely tamed my hair and eliminated my breakage.    I have to agree that the fragrances can catch you off guard if you&#x27;re unprepared, but before purchasing the products I read all reviews for every CD product on Amazon, the CD web site and others before purchasing it which really helped. I&#x27;ve also had eczema (skin rashes) since I was 4 so the reviews concerned me when reading how some had allergic reactions.     Surprisingly, the CD products have had no adverse effects to my skin. I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with every product I&#x27;ve purchased from CD and other than my favorite, which is the hair butter, I&#x27;d have to say the hair honey is my new favorite product! When I use it on my ends just before adding hot rollers or hot curlers my hair is very shiny and bouncy. I had very bad split ends most of my life and the hair honey eliminated it completely.     I&#x27;ve never received more compliments than I have while using CD products and I will continue using them, I suspect, for years to come.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. Im a black women and i have relaxed hair. i used this for a few months and it took out of my hair. My hair kept shedding all the time and thinned out my hair even more. The reason why I bought this was to help my hai grow thicker and healthier but my hair became worse to the point where my hair kept falling out. Carols daughter is a product for white women or women that are mixed with white, Asian maybe even Indian. Im not mixed with anything and this is not for me. I need to use a product for nothing but black women not a product where any nationality can use. These product have a lot of perfumed mixed in the ingredients. I need vitamins and nutrients not no damn perfume flowers. A black womens hair like mine cannot hold all of that perfume s***.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve been looking for an alcohol-free styling combo for years for my coarse, curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried no-poo, lo-poo, aloe, etc. And everything would leave my hair frizzy or with build up or with an itchy scalp. Now I use Whole Foods 365 shampoo and conditioner. Then I towel dry and put just a tad of the mimosa honey on my hands and scrunch it into my hair. I rub a bit just on the ends. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. Then I put a bit of 99% aloe vera gel on my hair. It&#x27;s amazing. My curls are clean, light, and bouncy. The combo also provides great hold in the Chicago humidity without being crunchy or greasy. My hair also feels soft and moisturized. As some have said, the mimosa honey is heavy. True so it&#x27;s important not to over do it. But just a smidge for my dry hair means I can use a light gel. Love this stuff!!!</li>
