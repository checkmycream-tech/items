    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I gave a can to my roommate who shaves his head, and he said that it&#x27;s the best shaving cream for head-shaving.  </li>
            <li>Best Shaving Gel ever - for girls and boys!</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving cream I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not the best review in the world</li>
            <li>This is one of the best shaving gel i have used .....</li>
            <li>Great price on a great product!</li>
            <li>Good job Gillette!</li>
            <li>This gel provides great lubrication and razor glide.  </li>
            <li>The shave gel, aftershave and razors are great products that have made a world of difference in his shaving needs.</li>
            <li>In fact I think it&#x27;s so great</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>great work P&amp;G ...</li>
            <li>My husband won&#x27;t use anything else great product</li>
            <li>have used this for years and it does a great job softening the stubble and is a great lubricant to keep you from nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Great product at a good price,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always thought that Gillette Fusion shaving gel is one of the best on the market, so I was glad to find it at this price.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Although this is the best quality shaving cream, barbasol is almost as good and available at dollar stores.</li>
            <li>Seems good.</li>
            <li>good product....</li>
            <li>good price too</li>
            <li>Both Schick and Gillette have good power-manuals</li>
            <li>Good price online here as well.</li>
            <li>Quality product at a good price.</li>
            <li>A good deal cheaper than the drug or grocery store.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I did not think of this product before, it is the best out there, very comfortable and quick shave!!</li>
            <li>more could a person ask for!</li>
            <li>but I will fully admit that Gillette did their research on a good gel for a sensitive face and has worked perfectly every time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>I have used this gel for years and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>good product at a great price with fast delivery......</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>He bought a can of this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Fusion Hydra Gel, claiming that it&#x27;s the best.  </li>
            <li>a separate note, since I have stopped using this shaving gel, I have switched to the Nivea Q10 Energy Shaving Gel and I am pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The gel is good but the can stopped working when it was about 4/5ths full.</li>
            <li>and I feel this works even better then the more costly Nivea.</li>
            <li>and I will not have to buy any more shaving cream for another 8 months.</li>
            <li>He prefers this brand over most others, and at $3.47 a can, I defy you to find it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure &#x27;something&#x27; out there can beat that claim</li>
            <li>Being able to buy it in bulk where I now won&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for awhile?</li>
            <li>Even better.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Yes the bottle, and more specifically the dispenser.</li>
            <li>It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
            <li>Gives him a great shave every day and helps with his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have had more than 3 of these bottles stop dispensing the gel while the unit was more than 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>As a shaving cream, it works fine.</li>
            <li>I definitely agree that this is a really great shave gel.</li>
            <li>However, I have always been somewhat unsatisfied with the natural products I&#x27;ve tried, because I ended up with a good deal of nicks and razor-burn.  </li>
            <li>When the price drops down to $20.82 for six cans, including super saver shipping, this is an excellent purchase.  </li>
            <li>I generally prefer to use products on my face/body whose ingredients I can recognize and understand, but this shaving cream is so superior that I make an exception.</li>
            <li>These last three were not the first time I experienced this either.  </li>
            <li>The can dispenses the gel at a consistent pace and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have very sensitive skin on my face, and have tried many brands.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is that Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Hydra Ultra Sensitive is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It lubricates better than the other brand and seems to be more concentrated</li>
            <li>The only positive about this that I can find is that it makes a nice spreadable lather</li>
            <li>anyone with sensitive skin, I would hands-down recommend this product, and in addition I have found that the &amp;#34;powered&amp;#34; manual razors work best and have the least irritation.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to cover your beard completely.  </li>
            <li>However, the main thing is that this is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite shave gels because his skin is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the bottle I bought last time for more than 1 year</li>
            <li>The first time this happened</li>
            <li>But this kept happening 2 more times and my brother just had the same issue with his.</li>
            <li>First, I did not purchase this on Amazon, and this review is in no way a reflection on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use the cap, then no matter how clean you leave the spout, there will be a tiny bit of gel that will magically grow into a large crusty foam blob that gets on anything that happens to be near by.</li>
            <li>I had more than enough since it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>What confuses me so much is why would anyone want to buy this in packs of 6?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the point of buying this 6 pack unless someone wants to use it as shower gel or so.   </li>
            <li>It really adds to the already close shave with the Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>For a long time I didn&#x27;t use Gillette shaving cream, because I was more interested in trying natural shaving products (shaving creams, shaving soaps, shaving oils, etc).  </li>
            <li>My most recent brand before this was the Nivea for men (sensitive skin variety)</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better it is that all the other stuff I tried.  </li>
            <li>It works like many other products work.  </li>
            <li>It have tried many other brands before this.  </li>
            <li>So unless you have a sensitive skin, I would say they are all good: as long as they &#x27;dispense&#x27;, a simple test not passed by the Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel.</li>
            <li>As a side note: Changing my blades more frequently made the greatest improvement in skin irritation, which is unfortunate, because they&#x27;re not cheap.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it, especially for those with sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the same product for which I would may much more at the local pharmacy or even a big box store.</li>
            <li>, I agree with one of the other reviewers that the scent is very strong (although this could just be a matter of personal preference).</li>
            <li>am writing this so that other buyers are able to make an informed decision, as I think this product is a huge waste of money with fancy packaging that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, if you&#x27;re not careful you can get too much lather and have the stuff making quite a mess (luckily I shave in the shower</li>
            <li>Keeping the Gillette Fusion blades extra clean and dry after shaving will extend its life.  </li>
            <li>B001E5E24K Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Ultra Sensitive, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]]ck of 6?  </li>
            <li>pea sized drop will be enough to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>becuse it works on my sensitive skin without leaving any razor</li>
            <li>I finally found one I really like with Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel.  </li>
            <li>I find even the sensitive skin foam doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Man of house has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There are a ton of different shaving gels out there, and honestly, they all get the job done (at least for me).</li>
            <li>Recently I switched to this brand from the most common shave gel brand.  </li>
            <li>though it produces a nice lather and has a bit of a nice heating effect the worst part about it is that like older soaps, when you rinse it off your skin is tacky while still wet.  </li>
            <li>He tried several different kinds of shave gel, aftershave and razors to help his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a few extra pennies for the extra quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given that this is one of the most expensive (if not THE most expensive) cans of shaving cream on the shelf at the grocery store, I find it completely unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>reason I am giving this such a poor review is that for the second time I have had the trigger at the top of the can \\&quot;jamb\\&quot;, causing the entire contents of the can to come oozing out the from underneath the trigger assembly.  </li>

            <li> I have been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> have used several of the other companies brand and this tops</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d try this product to see if it helped keep my skin from being irritated by shaving (I only shave every other day because of this).  </li>
            <li> it happened once, I could chalk it up to a a single fault . . .</li>
            <li> I have not bought this shaving gel on Amazon and normally do not leave reviews for products that I haven&#x27;t purchased from that site.</li>
            <li> I used it off and on for a few weeks with the same complaint:  a decent shave</li>
            <li> but the gel can felt almost empty except the weight indicated otherwise.  </li>
            <li> He no longer has razor burn or breakouts due to shaving.</li>
            <li> Check out other 1 star reviews as others have complained about the same issue.</li>
            <li> and it still has at least 1/3rd remaining (Even after shaving daily with lavish amount of gel.)</li>
            <li> So 6 pack should at least last for 6 years or so.</li>
            <li> I agree with a few other reviewers, I have had a couple of cans where the trigger mechanism doesn&#x27;t work, but that has happened to me with other brands.  </li>
            <li> The less you use, the better...and keep the shaving</li>
            <li> Previous container I threw out while on holidays after it quite working.  </li>
            <li> twice (in less than 3 months) is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Only shaving cream I use</li>
            <li> For a long time I didn&#x27;t use Gillette shaving cream, because I was more interested in trying natural shaving products (shaving creams, shaving soaps, shaving oils, etc).  However, I have always been somewhat unsatisfied with the natural products I&#x27;ve tried, because I ended up with a good deal of nicks and razor-burn.  A few months ago a friend stayed with me and after trying my shaving cream he went to the store to \\&quot;get some real shaving cream\\&quot;.  He bought a can of this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Fusion Hydra Gel, claiming that it&#x27;s the best.  He left it at my house, and eventually I tried it.  I was amazed at how much better it is that all the other stuff I tried.  After I used up that can, I bought this 6-pack from Amazon.  I gave a can to my roommate who shaves his head, and he said that it&#x27;s the best shaving cream for head-shaving.  I generally prefer to use products on my face/body whose ingredients I can recognize and understand, but this shaving cream is so superior that I make an exception.</li>
            <li> Seems good. Does the job.</li>
            <li> good product....good price too</li>
            <li> I definitely agree that this is a really great shave gel. I have been using this for a long time. What confuses me so much is why would anyone want to buy this in packs of 6? I have been using the bottle I bought last time for more than 1 year and it still has at least 1/3rd remaining (Even after shaving daily with lavish amount of gel.) So 6 pack should at least last for 6 years or so. I don&#x27;t see the point of buying this 6 pack unless someone wants to use it as shower gel or so.   Also even with the subscribe and save option this is pricier than walmart or target.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It is definitely worth a few extra pennies for the extra quality.</li>
            <li> Although this is the best quality shaving cream, barbasol is almost as good and available at dollar stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I did not think of this product before, it is the best out there, very comfortable and quick shave!!</li>
            <li> I tend to have very sensitive skin on my face, and have tried many brands. My most recent brand before this was the Nivea for men (sensitive skin variety) and I feel this works even better then the more costly Nivea. I no longer get irritation or razor bumps when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To anyone with sensitive skin, I would hands-down recommend this product, and in addition I have found that the &amp;#34;powered&amp;#34; manual razors work best and have the least irritation. Both Schick and Gillette have good power-manuals but I would give the edge to Schick for the razor and Gillette for the shaving gel.</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else. Gives him a great shave every day and helps with his sensitive skin. Good price online here as well.</li>
            <li> My introduction was the travel size to meet TSA rules.  I was disappointed at the small amount it expelled.  I used it off and on for a few weeks with the same complaint:  a decent shave but the gel can felt almost empty except the weight indicated otherwise.  What gives?&lt;br /&gt;  The mystery was solved when I finally tried SHAKING the can vigorously...ample gel was eager to escape when prompted!  I had more than enough since it doesn&#x27;t take much. The less you use, the better...and keep the shaving are moist.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve sampled several brands of shaving cream and blades.  My conclusion is that Gillette&#x27;s Fusion Hydra Ultra Sensitive is outstanding.  Keeping the Gillette Fusion blades extra clean and dry after shaving will extend its life.  Remember to shake the gel can before using.&lt;br /&gt;  Why a pa[[ASIN:B001E5E24K Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Ultra Sensitive, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]]ck of 6?  Beats me.</li>
            <li> Makes for the closest shave ever.  Gillette knows.</li>
            <li> Best Shaving Gel ever - for girls and boys!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price,  and I will not have to buy any more shaving cream for another 8 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;A pea sized drop will be enough to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;I have used several of the other companies brand and this tops&lt;br /&gt;them all.&lt;br /&gt;A  good product at a great price with fast delivery......&lt;br /&gt;what more could a person ask for!</li>
            <li> When the price drops down to $20.82 for six cans, including super saver shipping, this is an excellent purchase.  However, the main thing is that this is one of my husband&#x27;s favorite shave gels because his skin is so sensitive.  This gel provides great lubrication and razor glide.  He prefers this brand over most others, and at $3.47 a can, I defy you to find it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The gel is good but the can stopped working when it was about 4/5ths full. This is the scoend time it has happened. These cans are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure &#x27;something&#x27; out there can beat that claim but I will fully admit that Gillette did their research on a good gel for a sensitive face and has worked perfectly every time I&#x27;ve used it. Being able to buy it in bulk where I now won&#x27;t have to worry about buying more for awhile? Even better.</li>
            <li> Order this product when I need it becuse it works on my sensitive skin without leaving any razor burn on my bald head.  I use an electric for the face so I do not cut it up.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a good price.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin. He tried several different kinds of shave gel, aftershave and razors to help his sensitive skin.When we stumbled upon Gillette Fusion products we looked no further. The shave gel, aftershave and razors are great products that have made a world of difference in his shaving needs. He no longer has razor burn or breakouts due to shaving. We stock up on these products because nothing else works as well.Good job Gillette!</li>
            <li> As a shaving cream, it works fine. For some reason, I thought this was unscented, but it&#x27;s not, there is a definite perfumy odor to it. The packaging is where I have the biggest problems. When your hands are wet, it is nearly impossible to remove the cap. It doesn&#x27;t have any ridges to make it easier to grab, and the cap has a sort of conical shape that resists any attempt to open it. If you don&#x27;t use the cap, then no matter how clean you leave the spout, there will be a tiny bit of gel that will magically grow into a large crusty foam blob that gets on anything that happens to be near by.</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands and a number of types of shaving cream.  I finally found one I really like with Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel.  It is very easy to use.  The can dispenses the gel at a consistent pace and it goes on smoothly.  It really adds to the already close shave with the Gillette Fusion blades.  I strongly recommend it, especially for those with sensitive skin like mine.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It works like many other products work.  not the best review in the world but it will work for me and Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used this gel for years and liked it.  Only problem is that they refuse to make a dispenser that works properly.  The last one lost pressure.  I opened it up and found 3/4 of the gel remaining.  Previous container I threw out while on holidays after it quite working.  It had been a replacement for one that was dead on arrival.  Three strikes and you are out Gillette.  These last three were not the first time I experienced this either.  I am now using a competitors brand.  What a shame since I have read reviews that go back years that indicate this problem.</li>
            <li> I have not bought this shaving gel on Amazon and normally do not leave reviews for products that I haven&#x27;t purchased from that site. But my frustration with these shaving gel &#x27;bottles&#x27; has surpassed my patience. Yes the bottle, and more specifically the dispenser. I have had more than 3 of these bottles stop dispensing the gel while the unit was more than 2/3 full. Some have failed within a week of use. The first time this happened I thought I had just purchased a lemon. But this kept happening 2 more times and my brother just had the same issue with his. I have concluded that there is a flaw in the design of these bottles. Check out other 1 star reviews as others have complained about the same issue. I have no problem with the shaving Gel and in fact I like the scent. But what is the point when I cannot get it dispensed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a separate note, since I have stopped using this shaving gel, I have switched to the Nivea Q10 Energy Shaving Gel and I am pretty happy with it. There are a ton of different shaving gels out there, and honestly, they all get the job done (at least for me). So unless you have a sensitive skin, I would say they are all good: as long as they &#x27;dispense&#x27;, a simple test not passed by the Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel.</li>
            <li> The scent for this product gives me a headache. Even after a day my face still smells like chemicals. There should at least be some indication of this on the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these products cannot be returned, so I am stuck with 6 containers of this piece of ----</li>
            <li> Yes folks, just like you imagined this is shaving cream and works as advertised. In fact I think it&#x27;s so great I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> ***First, I did not purchase this on Amazon, and this review is in no way a reflection on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving this such a poor review is that for the second time I have had the trigger at the top of the can \\&quot;jamb\\&quot;, causing the entire contents of the can to come oozing out the from underneath the trigger assembly.  Note that the unit was not dropped or damaged in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it happened once, I could chalk it up to a a single fault . . . twice (in less than 3 months) is unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that this is one of the most expensive (if not THE most expensive) cans of shaving cream on the shelf at the grocery store, I find it completely unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this so that other buyers are able to make an informed decision, as I think this product is a huge waste of money with fancy packaging that doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers that the scent is very strong (although this could just be a matter of personal preference).</li>
            <li> Great quality. It is exactly the same product for which I would may much more at the local pharmacy or even a big box store.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using my body wash as a lather and I thought I&#x27;d try this product to see if it helped keep my skin from being irritated by shaving (I only shave every other day because of this).  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in that regard.  The only positive about this that I can find is that it makes a nice spreadable lather so it&#x27;s easy to cover your beard completely.  In fact, if you&#x27;re not careful you can get too much lather and have the stuff making quite a mess (luckily I shave in the shower so it doesn&#x27;t matter much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it produces a nice lather and has a bit of a nice heating effect the worst part about it is that like older soaps, when you rinse it off your skin is tacky while still wet.  I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s because it washes away the oils on your skin or if it&#x27;s leaving a sticky/tacky film but it does go away after drying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;m done using this I will probably just go back to using my body wash.  As a side note: Changing my blades more frequently made the greatest improvement in skin irritation, which is unfortunate, because they&#x27;re not cheap.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving gel i have used ..... great work P&amp;G ... I will always recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> muy buen servico, sin ningun inconveniente, el despacho a tiempo y el producto de muy buena calidad, sin ninguna observacion</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else great product</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and shaving used to be painful.  Once I found this product (the sensitive gel) shaving is not so bad.  I find even the sensitive skin foam doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Nice product.  I agree with a few other reviewers, I have had a couple of cans where the trigger mechanism doesn&#x27;t work, but that has happened to me with other brands.  It have tried many other brands before this.  I think all companies are trying to save a little money on the quality of their containers.</li>
            <li> This is the only gel my husband will use. I bought a big pack of it and we still have some left over 7 months later</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shaving cream and makes lather</li>
            <li> I have always used shave gel.  Recently I switched to this brand from the most common shave gel brand.  It lubricates better than the other brand and seems to be more concentrated so I use less product.</li>
            <li> have used this for years and it does a great job softening the stubble and is a great lubricant to keep you from nicks and cuts. probably because of the millions of chemicals in it, though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that Gillette Fusion shaving gel is one of the best on the market, so I was glad to find it at this price. A good deal cheaper than the drug or grocery store. Great price on a great product!</li>
            <li> Man of house has sensitive skin this causes no irritation at all. We get it with us rube and save, delivered to the door, no running out.</li>
