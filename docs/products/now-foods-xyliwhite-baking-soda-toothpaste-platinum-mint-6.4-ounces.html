            <li>Love this toothpaste - very refreshing taste and it seems to be working great!!</li>
            <li>good product,,good combination of ingredients,,</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste, dentist recommend the product to my wife.</li>
            <li>Good bye Crest, Colgate, et al.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a good taste and it works in cleaning and whitening ones teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Tastes good and works just like a toothpaste would.</li>
            <li>a good tooth paste if you was baking Soda toothpaste</li>
            <li>Good consistency/texture.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the Cinnamon flavored,and both taste good and work well.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good because my gums were inflammed before and this took the sting out.&lt;br /&gt;he</li>
            <li>Just give it a good 6-12 months.</li>
            <li>And best part is... free of harmful ingredients like flouride.</li>
            <li>It contains mostly good chemicals.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it is healthier ingredient wise is a plus.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work good.</li>
            <li>I loved the taste, but the stuff got watery while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Does a good cleaning job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is good</li>
            <li>Everything about this product looks good.</li>
            <li>tastes good, works good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a good brusher all my life, but still somehow got cavities each time I went to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good.  </li>
            <li>Flavor and texture are good, but after months of using this I found it to be too abrasive and led to tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>This is really good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as natures gate, tea tree, or trader joes</li>
            <li>Good flavor.</li>
            <li>it contains xylitol which is supposed to be good for the teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, we&#x27;ve both been using this product for a couple of months now - it&#x27;s just the two of us, and it has a good taste and consistency.</li>
            <li>It tastes good</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine use to work but not as good as this.</li>
            <li>Still xyliwhite is a good product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li>Good taste.</li>
            <li>I keep using this product with good dentist reviews every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Price is good, I hope it will stay that way.</li>
            <li>but there is a great mint flavor &amp; it leaves my teeth feeling so clean !!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent toothpaste, great taste, gentle and with whitening.</li>
            <li>NOW makes superior products and I am satisfied with this paste time after time!</li>
            <li>You can taste the baking soda (which isn&#x27;t the most awesome flavor) but it does have a good, strong minty taste that stays.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it does not irritate my mouth in any way which is why I purchased this toothpaste in the first place!</li>
            <li>I am happy that all of my children won&#x27;t be exposed to any more fluoride than they&#x27;ve already inadvertedly consumed.</li>
            <li>The flavor is not that great but its ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to get him away from the flouride too :)</li>
            <li>Happy it has no flouride, just wished it foamed up a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m three weeks in to using it and mind you, I rarely went one week without a canker sore popping up, and I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t had one ucler!  </li>
            <li>It works well and is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results from this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for adults but skip it as a toddler fluoride-free paste.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the taste and it makes my teeth shiny after flossing and using an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>effective and good ingredients</li>
            <li>Nice taste, good price for &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; toothpaste</li>
            <li>Love 100% fluoride free toothpaste best tasting one they have imo</li>
            <li>One of my favorite toothpastes!  </li>

            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>

            <li>I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM ALL!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My favorite fluoride-free toothpaste!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably love it!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>tastes great, easy to brush with, have not gone to the dentist since started brushing so no info on that.</li>
            <li>Great fresh taste, awesome clean feeling in your mouth when you are done brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packed, attractive, sturdy tube and a good amount of product.  </li>
            <li>Great toothpaste that leaves my breath minty fresh and teeth bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Great fluoride free toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I would advice anyone staying away from fluoride to buy this amazing product with xylitol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is great and we switched from Tom&#x27;s Flouride Free to trying this.  </li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste for your dogs, please do not choose a toothpaste with Xylitol in it as you will be doing your dog more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Honestly, probably not.</li>
            <li>Nice toothpaste</li>
            <li>I have purchased two tubes of this product and use  it to avoid acute toxicity of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Effective and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>and the taste is nice without overpowering</li>
            <li>The minty taste is nice, but I have to get used to it.</li>
            <li>; I would recommend this product to my own family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easier than making my own.</li>
            <li>I liked the way this toothpaste smell</li>
            <li>It cleans well and does seem to provide a degree of whitening as well with a nice peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li>Xylitol doesn’t seem quite so warm and fuzzy anymore, does it?</li>
            <li>So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>I liked everything about it except that it was a gel.</li>
            <li>I really liked it but thought it was pricey.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice</li>
            <li>I am 40 now and I cannot honestly say I have ever found a toothpaste I like.  </li>
            <li>It has a gel/paste consistency and a nice smell in and out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I had thought about making my own toothpaste when I saw this one.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice product and</li>
            <li>As good or better than Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste feels very clean and fresh, and it whitens perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural toothpaste we&#x27;ve tried, and we&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li>Since I started using the Xylitol toothpaste I have had great checkups at the dentist to the point of the hygienist saying, wow there is no tarter on your teeth even below the gums, you&#x27;re doing great.</li>
            <li>Very good and reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>Awesome, natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste and my mouth feels clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste and the fact that xylitol is actually good for you is great, plus it&#x27;s fluoride free !</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone a safe effective product.</li>
            <li>The best all natural toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li>Probably one of the best products I have tried that claim having, &#x27;all natural&#x27; ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good, clean, and works well as a toothpaste, not just as a natural toothpaste, but in that category, it&#x27;s definitely excellent!</li>
            <li>After about 2 months use, she has had no mouth ulcers (yet!), but complains its too strong in the mint flavor-and she loves mint!</li>
            <li>Does not taste very good and simply did not do as good a job of whitening and removing tartar as Tom&#x27;s of Maine</li>
            <li>I was happy with the toothpaste at first.</li>
            <li>It tastes great and really helps me maintain whiter teeth without a bunch of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>I get a real clean feel after this, and I&#x27;m glad to have a toothpaste with ingredients I can trust.</li>
            <li>A couple more drops of oil would make it taste great and give that nice breath you really want after brushing.</li>
            <li>no bad stuff in it and also good stuff in it to make the teeth stronger.</li>
            <li>Xyliwhite is not too minty, and leaves your mouth feeling good with no bad aftertaste while the xylitol strengthens the teeth.</li>
            <li>Has a very light taste that doesn&#x27;t stay in your mouth for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great feeling teeth &amp; makes my mouth taste better first thing in the morning if I brush with this immediately before bed.  </li>
            <li>The taste was pleasant and I loved using a more natural alternative to the drugstore toothepastes.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Once you brush it in, the saltiness is replaced (more like overpowered) with a peppermint</li>
            <li>I love being able to brush my teeth without fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Essential</li>
            <li>I like the taste, but I cannot use it more than once per day</li>
            <li>I prefer toothpaste that lathers more.  </li>
            <li>But I need more lather.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to gradually remove plaque in areas</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this!</li>
            <li>Minty factor is just ok.</li>
            <li>He won&#x27;t use my homemade toothpaste, so this is the best second choice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better than both.  </li>
            <li>and i love it will buy more when run out.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste as part of my healthy living</li>
            <li>I like the flavor of the platinum mint much better than the refreshmint (more of a spearmint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Freshens better.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about whiter teeth, but it sure brightens my teeth.</li>
            <li>great tasting, great ingredients and fluoride free, thank you now foods for providing us a safe alternative to commercial fluoride toothpastes</li>
            <li>comes out the top and bottom of the tube.</li>
            <li>This product is more like brushing your teeth with baking soda, where it seems like you might need more, but you probably don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so soi think i like Jasons better.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.  </li>
            <li>Google around to read more about the fluoride bs.  </li>
            <li>I Love this toothpaste, even though people with Perioral Dermatitis aren&#x27;t supposed to use mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>A better healthy alterative is Tom&#x27;s of Maine propolis &amp; myrrh.   </li>
            <li>(She isn&#x27;t really sure</li>
            <li>I prefer the spearmint flavor, but i absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste needs a lot more Mint in it.  </li>
            <li>There are better products out there</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>My teeth fill a lot better tho.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Needs a better flavor</li>
            <li>Is refreshing, however I buy xylitol based products because of a corn allergy.</li>
            <li>I really love the misty taste</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Many times, it dripped out of my mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t have flouride.</li>
            <li>I will be re-purchasing for sure.</li>
            <li>SLS can lead to canker sores, so does tarter control (too many phosphates) and also leads to sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that this will work to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li>The price is much better.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>my attempt to try a more organic alternative, I switched to using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>More for the money</li>
            <li>I saw it was made by Now Foods, a company I trusted to produce safe, quality, wholesome products.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>okay, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>What the foaming affects lacks, the refreshing taste of mint make up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>3 stars for this product is ok.  </li>
            <li>Much better on your teeth and health than store bought poisons.  </li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Have used this brand for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I can find something without fluoride for my family.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want all the additives that come along with most brand name toothpastes and</li>
            <li>And I was even more please to find I can order it from Amazon.com and not have to travel 35 miles to get it...</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste...</li>
            <li>Not even Sensodyne Pronamel was able to do that.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Will deff buy some more when I run out</li>
            <li>so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Perhaps best used for occasional polishing.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>I love how it works on my teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve tried almost all the xylitol oral care products that I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps the formula of this Platinum Mint flavor (which includes peppermint oil) masks it better.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the case, Platinum Mint tastes better to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is yet one more flavor in the Xyliwhite line which I have not yet tried - Refreshmint.  </li>
            <li>What I also like about this is it&#x27;s not an overwhelming overpowering baking soda taste.</li>
            <li>This stuff was ok.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, this toothpaste was OK......</li>
            <li>I decided to look for a more cost-effective alternative.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I had been looking for a flouride-free toothpaste and decided on Xyli-White based on the ingredients and the reviews that said it also helped whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my teeth feel afterward.</li>
            <li>Great taste and leaves your mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it has worked for me like magic</li>
            <li>This is my favorite flavor of the NOW toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>Like its labeled it looks more like a gel.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>LOVE the fact that this toothpaste uses Xylitol and contains no sodium lauryl sulfate or flouride!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really cleans, great taste.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this toothpaste more than I.</li>
            <li>great product will order again very soon.</li>
            <li>Could use a bit more mint flavour</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s our review of Now Foods latest entry to the oral-care arena...  </li>
            <li>Xylitol is supposed to be good for reversing and preventing cavities, so it&#x27;s definitely worth testing out...  </li>
            <li>Hope they come out with a pepsodent flavor, as that is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li>So glad to have found this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I find that pastes polish the teeth much better than gels.</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My favorite-- glad Amazon is carrying it now.</li>
            <li>And I do not want any more of toothpastes with fluoride in them.</li>
            <li>This was an OK toothpaste, my teeth felt nice and clean.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>My mouth does indeed feel nice and clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li>Teeth will feel nice and clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It has an o.k. minty flavor and made our teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth and teeth feel very clean - you can feel the baking soda at work.</li>
            <li>There is a very clean taste in your mouth, even  upon waking in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>At $3.99 for a 6.4 ounce tube it is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>think it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It does not foam up but has a nice minty flavor without being too sweet like some others.</li>
            <li>toothpaste is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>If this product contains baking soda, I honestly could not taste it; this is not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li>On a side note, it did taste pretty good so if it wasn&#x27;t for the canker sore issue, I would have continued using it.</li>
            <li>Our favorite toothpaste, Xyliwhite is minty but not too strong even for our 4yo.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t come in the fancy-schmancy packaging that the top brands use, but the packaging works fine.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I can fine an additional product to work with this one.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean!</li>
            <li>The hardest part in finding a good non-fluoride toothpaste is finding one that tastes well and leaves your breath smelling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The toothpaste is nice to use and leaves a clean and light minty feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This is fluoride-free, tastes good and keeps my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean without any sugary aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>It also tastes great and cleans well, my teeth were also sensitive and with this toothpaste that&#x27;s not been a problem either.</li>
            <li>We love that is fluoride free.</li>
            <li>The flavor is fantastic, not sugary like most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>I will probably order more because it being fluoride free as I won&#x27;t use a fluoride tooth paste anymore.</li>
            <li>think this is a great toothpaste for those that don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth and not in need of a lot of whitening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the excess flouride in most commercial toothpastes, and after finding and enjoying Oralive by Ascended Health (which works great, though is pricey)</li>
            <li>Nice fresh taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but the cleansing ingredient 9SCS) doesn&#x27;t give one much motivation to switch from Tom&#x27;s of Maine -which uses SLS...  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully clean toothpaste, with excellent substitutes for the SLS and fluoride that are in most other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>Seemed to clean OK</li>
            <li>It is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth feeling very clean and my breath very fresh and doesn&#x27;t have any flouride.</li>
            <li>It is very mild tasting too.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great, much better than our regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The baking soda is very mild</li>
            <li>I kind of wonder what good it does long-term, such as overnight.</li>
            <li>I can still taste the soda, but it&#x27;s not so strong.</li>
            <li>but if you like having a strong minty feeling in your mouth, this might be for you.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t have a strong mint flavor and it don&#x27;t foam in the mouth</li>
            <li>The minty flavor is strong.</li>
            <li>this is a nice back up toothpaste, tastes good.</li>
            <li>People preferring strong mint will probably not be as fond of this.  </li>
            <li>I like it my family did not, the flavor is a bit strong for them.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a taste, which I like.  </li>
            <li>Might be a bit strong for a child&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Nothing special; just better than monopoly&#x27;s Brands like Crest,Colgate,etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I find that using a toothbrush full makes the experience better.  </li>
            <li>Love the cool minty feeling</li>
            <li>Pretty nice taste..  </li>
            <li>awesome product... Been meat/fluoride free for 90 days and feel an extreme difference.  </li>
            <li>is not as abrasive, its not whitening kind... ,its just keeping your mouth fresh and your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>, it leave the teeth very clean and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste works fine.  </li>
            <li>It works well, tastes fine, but I am upset that when I ordered I did not see in the ingredient list that it contains carrageenan.  </li>
            <li>The paste is fine, not grainy.  </li>
            <li>First off, I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I like this fine.  </li>
            <li>The taste is mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li>An okay toothpaste, but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The taste is okay definitely not sugary but pleasant.</li>
            <li>excellent product, it&#x27;s not like a normal toothpaste this one won&#x27;t leave you an extra fresh mint flavor or freshness as a regular one, but it does an excellent job and it has no fluoride, that what I care about</li>
            <li>Great mild taste/flavor which doesn&#x27;t overpower like so many other toothpastes and no fluoride which is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li>I expected better quality packaging since the tooth paste is of great quality and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist is a huge fan of Xylitol and approves of the percentage in this paste.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never had gluten-free toothpaste before, you must know it is not as smooth as a gluten or chemical-filled gel.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>fourth or fifth tube  great toothpaste</li>
            <li>Which justified the fact to me</li>
            <li>iam a fan of free of flouride, i have been using this toothpaste for a month now</li>
            <li>I always prefer fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of reviews and it is fluoride free and free of poison ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh breath</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 star rating because I like the idea that it is fluoride free</li>
            <li>This toothpaste, being flouride free, does what you would expect from toothpaste; cleans teeth.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I have even talked my husband and mom into using it.  </li>
            <li>normally available</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s SLS and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Since this is SLS free, it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li>Because my periodontal disease was worsening (despite great dental care), I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li>-white does not advertise itself as a pain-reducing toothpaste, but it is a GREAT one.</li>
            <li>the potential to be a great product</li>
            <li>Fluoride free</li>
            <li>I combine it with OraMD, a couple drops, It is Flouride Free, and uses Xylitol.</li>
            <li>this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Its fluoride free, but its taste is just &amp;</li>
            <li>I searched for sulfate free toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>Commercially available xylitol is produced by the industrialized process of sugar hydrogenation.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it really was cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>that it is flouride free, as none of us need that.  </li>
            <li>I came across this product because I was looking for a toothpaste that is free of fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste claims to be SLS free but sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium coco-sulfate</li>
            <li>soft bristles, easy touch and teeth stay clean and bright.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and squeaky-clean.</li>
            <li>I wanted a vegan and cruelty-free toothpaste without fluoride and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Leaves a freshly minty refreshing flavor in my mouth.</li>
            <li>whole Mouth was thrilled with the results after 4 mouth/teeth cleanings.</li>
            <li>Good all around natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m having a good experience with it.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste and better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Add a good source of natural occurring Fluoride, like from &#x27;Prevident&#x27;, to harden your enamel and that will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I get plenty of foaming action, and a nice refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good, natural, fluoride-free toothpaste - this is it.</li>
            <li>This is a much milder paste than others, however, for myself it works great and I am now not slowly poisoning myself from flouride!</li>
            <li>It is a lovely uncolored gel with just the right amount of EO&#x27;s to freshen the breath without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>I have tried their other tooth paste and while they are good, I just prefer they kind with baking soda in it.</li>
            <li>And best of all, the price is very reasonable for a high quality flouride free natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and clean after using.</li>
            <li>It tastes fine &amp; it isn&#x27;t full of all the chemicals that you find in store bought toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste so much!</li>
            <li>Taste aside, this is a good brand of toothpaste without many of the harsh chemicals found in most toothpastes today.</li>
            <li>I love this product, really!  </li>
            <li>deff worth the find!</li>
            <li>and I was excited about the xylitol in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth have been getting whiter since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
            <li>Get it, is worth it!</li>
            <li>Xylitol, no artificial chemical sweetness!</li>
            <li>However the pleasant taste from main stream toothpaste is due to added chemicals, which although provide good taste, should never me ingested.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I use this; it&#x27;s a much stronger minty taste than the &amp;#34;Refreshmint&amp;#34; flavor, which is great for our young kids.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others, but this toothpaste is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Leave me mouth feeling clean and moist.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but it does clean.</li>
            <li>and my mouth always feels clean.</li>
            <li>it helps my mouth stay clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a lot of xylitol products and like what they can do in terms of adjusting the pH of the mouth, making your teeth feel slippery clean, and providing a \\&quot;food\\&quot; for the bacteria in your mouth that they cannot digest.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>After hours of use still feel my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean our teeth as well as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I think it works well to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth look and feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The most enjoyable natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is not really what it claims but a lot better than the ones claiming good oral health and then damaging your teeth.</li>
            <li>Of course it uses baking soda, so it doesn&#x27;t have the strong fresh taste like the Colgate brand that I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I did not have success with whitening and didn&#x27;t care for the strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li>more positive from continued use.</li>
            <li>A most refreshing toothpaste, comes out of the tube easily, really prepares the mouth for its first morning sip or bite.  </li>
            <li>I loved this at first but after using it for awhile my husband and I both started to have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I prefer milder taste but overall its a really good clean feeling toothpaste.</li>
            <li>defer the oral health assessment to my dentist, but my teeth feel clean and look good so overall</li>
            <li>My gums are great, better than as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s convinced it makes her teeth whiter, which really motivates her to brush. :-)</li>
            <li>Good value (big tube for the price) and</li>
            <li>I have tried many things to make my teeth whiter and this product has made my teeth SO much whiter.</li>
            <li>This is a natural toothpaste that from my research didnt appear to have any offensive or hazardous ingredients.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s still a good brand of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>it gently whitens my teeth (not shockingly so, but it does help).</li>
            <li>Very Yummy, refreshing, tasty toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to venture in trying more.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling super clean...</li>
            <li>Even my husband (who hates my all natural toothpastes) liked the flavor of this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the taste, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into natural living, growing my own foods, using baking soda to brush my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really comment on the long-term quality (in cleaning the teeth/gums/mouth) because I can&#x27;t use this toothpaste for more than one brushing session when I&#x27;m in a pinch</li>
            <li>But not bad</li>
            <li>Taste isn&#x27;t great but other than that its really good for basic whitening .</li>
            <li>However, my teeth felt super clean after the very first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very good at whitening, but the flavour is pleasant and it does a good job getting your teeth clean without all the extra chemicals and junk that you find in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I like it, teeth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean feeling, helped my gums to stop bleeding</li>
            <li>We like to taste and you feel clean and fresh .....</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean and my breath feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth with a clean fresh taste.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the toothpaste on preventing cavities (I use it with a fluoride rinse), it does leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>BUT my teeth always feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>teeth are clean, fresh taste, would buy again</li>
            <li>The mint taste is mild.</li>
            <li>My favorite flouride free toothpaste so far.</li>
            <li>switching from Crest Herbal Mint liquid gel toothpase, the flavor of this toothpaste is fairly mild.</li>
            <li>I only wish the mintyness of it were more prominent.</li>
            <li>Whether Xyliwhite got rid of any cavities that I may or may not have had, I will remain loyal to this product for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>It is a mild scent and mild abrasive, but that works for me.</li>
            <li>the dentist and technician both commented that my teeth and gums are very healthy and better than at my previous check up.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I like the ingredients, taste, and feel of this toothpaste, my daughter loves it (which is very important to me!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will never understand why people prefer to brush their teeth with rat poison (sodium fluoride) instead of baking soda or other SAFE AND EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li>If an economical way can be found to buy one tube to sample, that&#x27;d be great, but for now, the shipping costs from other vendors, or the requirement of buying multi-packs prevents that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fluoride free tooth paste and tried this product first.</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used ever due to no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>My new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but this is one of my favorite new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite organic toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would recommend it to anyone who wants a safer way to brush ;)</li>
            <li>minty taste has a strong after-taste and made my breath feel it&#x27;s absolute best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bigger fan of Jason Healthy Mouth, but this is effective and I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY minty!!</li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing, makes teeth super white, without hurting the enamel.</li>
            <li>Besides, my 10 year old loves the fresh non-burning taste of this toothpaste and brushes her teeth more diligently.</li>
            <li>Feels really fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Love this natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>These tubes came packaged nicely and they are quite big tubes</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I use about 30% more toothpaste per brush than I did before, but that might be because I&#x27;m used to the bubbling and foaming of my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The price is worth the value, to me.  </li>
            <li>My 83 year old grandmother with failing vision was even able to tell that my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li>This is her favorite of the &#x27;natural&#x27; kinds of toothpastes she&#x27;s tried.  </li>
            <li>Looks like vaseline, but whitens and makes breath fresh cannot complain</li>
            <li>I also had frequent nightmares of my teeth falling out, those are gone too :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to make my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth feeling fresh and gingly.  </li>
            <li>Love the natural teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>This product does contain sorbitol which is most frequently derived from corn.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend for someone more sensitive.</li>
            <li>; that made her mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>However, after further research I realized that by switching to a fluoride free toothpaste and also only drinking bottled water, I have effectively cut out most of my fluoride intake, which is probably what caused the cavity.</li>
            <li>Well worth it to get away from flouride</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li>Fresh but not a burning fresh.</li>
            <li>and I know that I will still have fresh breath and nice white teeth</li>
            <li>You will have fresh breath.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s really important to you, this can be amended by simply using more than a pea-sized amount.</li>
            <li>I know there are some natural toothpastes that are able to reproduce this without adding SLS so for me XyliWhite didn&#x27;t deserve 5-stars.</li>
            <li>I wish the minty flavor were a bit stronger -- this isn&#x27;t the one for you to have lingering fresh breath.</li>
            <li>and my mouth always feels fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t giving it away, but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li>One of the only kind of toothpaste we use.</li>
            <li>So there it continues to sit, in my bathroom medicine cabinet, rarely taken out, but taking up place (and causing clutter) because as digusting as it is, I cringe at the thought of throwing $4 in the garbage</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying out, but the search is STILL on for all-natural organic tooth cleansers without any sodium-sulfate based cleansers ...</li>
            <li>Good product - light taste - no strong &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other brands without SLS that I&#x27;ve tried, in that the mint tastes better.</li>
            <li>it does taste pretty mild and i do like that.</li>
            <li>I used to use toms of main but came across this and like it just as much bit its a much better price.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste taste, it is natural and leaves your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Over all I feel that this one is superior to other toothpastes of this class.</li>
            <li>other words, if you are looking for a good, fluoride-free toothpaste, stay away from this  </li>
            <li>Whitens right on wth spot.</li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>it comes right to my door.  </li>
            <li>yes, that&#x27;s right, from using it one time.</li>
            <li>right, like this is going to work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering has just the right about a flavor.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste immediately reduces all sensitivity in our teeth and the taste is just right, tolerable.  </li>
            <li>but rather the results right?</li>
            <li>I got it today and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that it has only natural ingredients and still tastes amazing!</li>
            <li>Definitely feels a lot nicer and tastes better than stuff like Crest though which is so sickly sweet tasting.</li>
            <li>It really leaves the teeth feeling clean, like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>My older son went out to buy a fluoride brand toothpaste, this undermined all my efforts to keep them poison free.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean the teeth very well.</li>
            <li>The paste is a good consistency, the color is more of a translucent white than a pure white.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this for three days now; I will need more evidence of my own to determine the later of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the brush long.  </li>
            <li>But, I was having one heck of a time finding one that made my mouth feel clean and fresh and found myself resorting back to the free samples of fluoridated toothpaste strewn across the office.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best value you can get if you&#x27;re trying to avoid harsh chemicals and such.</li>
            <li>The preliminary research on Xylitol in oral health care does look promising as well, though I would suggest always trusting the peer-reviewed research over the latest natural foods blog.</li>
            <li>and it seems to keep my mouth as clean as the older non-fluoride toothpaste that I was using.</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, the best toothpaste out there!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I like this product very much</li>
            <li>I like this brand of toothpaste very much.</li>
            <li>Decent, more natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It does great in terms of flavor but negative points when it comes to staying power.  </li>
            <li>Though it holds together better then refreshmint, it still doesn&#x27;t stick around by the time you&#x27;re actually done brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Those interested in knowing the ingredients to this product:    </li>
            <li>Will definitely get more when the time come.</li>
            <li>i really like this product!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more whitening than your retail pastes (perhaps excluding arm and hammer advanced white for sensitive teeth, which i don&#x27;t think exists anymore).</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale the first time, and I keep buying it.</li>
            <li>My teeth are definitely white :)</li>
            <li>I was worried I would have to &amp;#34;bite the bullet&amp;#34; (punny) and finally go back to one who I was sure</li>
            <li>I love using this toothpaste, not only have my teeth gotten a lot whiter, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I no longer have tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Of coarse when i told her how i wasn&#x27;t using fluoridated toothpaste anymore, she scolded me, but  couldn&#x27;t complain about my oral health :)</li>
            <li>This was my first product to try.</li>
            <li>ACTUALLY MAKING MY TEETH WHITEN BETTER THAN THE TOXIC CREST 3D</li>
            <li>It cleans very well and has made a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my smile.  </li>
            <li>Simply put, I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My mistake, I have to be more discerning in my future purchases.</li>
            <li>(good by me because it means it has no artificial colors or preservatives), and is an &#x27;adjustment&#x27; if you prefer white, blue stripes or sweeteners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that xylitol is able to restore enamel where cavities once were by remineralization or restoring the enamel, and I&#x27;m totally convinced it did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything like this, but I think it cleans better than regular fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought yeah</li>
            <li>The first time, I purchased this product from a health food store.  </li>
            <li>I like the taste of cinnafresh  better, but this one seems to actually whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>but the check up&#x27;s so far have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Me and my boyfriend decided to switch to non fluoride toothpaste and this was the first brand we chose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Now Foods fan (I use a ton of their products), but this one is definitely up on my top ten list.</li>
            <li>It scrubs my teeth much better than regular toothpaste, without the fluoride, and it is cheaper than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>Plus its good to know im not putting any of that harmful fluoride in my body everyday</li>
            <li>Freshens up breath quick and certainly feels like it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>At first it doesnt feel clean and minty like regular toothpaste but for some reason after you brush and rinse, your mouth feels amazingly clean</li>
            <li>Over half way through this tube brushing twice (morning, night) and am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredients, the clean feeling in my mouth after brushing, and the thumbs up from my dentist at my most recent visit.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>tree oil may be fine for women, but according to a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, it&#x27;s highly estrogenic and can lead to feminization and lack of sex drive in males.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, and I think it whitens just as well as any other fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>For example colgate and other popular toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural toothpaste that leaves me with a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>nearly.... makes my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>It is an overall good toothpaste, especially for being gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the one I liked the least out of the flavors available.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried quite a few flouride free toothpastes and this is our favorite.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of problems over the years with sore mouth and even mouth ulcers when I use many of the commonly available commercial toothpastes, especially that gel types.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are feeling better and looking whiter than they have in a long time.  </li>
            <li>not bad as a natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>Simple toothpaste, no fluoride, high percentage of xylitol, what more do you need.  </li>
            <li>When I develop some tooth pain, I use this toothpaste a little more often and it cures my pain!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this toothpaste after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My hygienist just cleaned my teeth and even remarked at how clean they were and how my once slightly red gums around some problem spots were nice and pink again.</li>
            <li>Nice slightly minty taste after brushing.</li>
            <li>The gum crevices are still kind of there, though not nearly as noticeable, and most importantly, do not hurt.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my &#x27;main stream&#x27; toothpaste but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I prefer this flavor to the standard mint flavors because its just a little bit stronger, and it &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; more refreshing.</li>
            <li>Amazing (more like scary) what people put in their mouths.</li>
            <li>Also, if you get some on your tongue before you get brushing, it is very salty.</li>
            <li>I have been using XyliWhite for over a year now because it is one of the only options that is SLS and Flouride free.</li>
            <li>When people ask what I am using I always highly recommended this!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>the flavor is an intense peppermint</li>
            <li>but I got used to it really fast and don&#x27;t even notice it now.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this and has for almost two years.</li>
            <li>or so I noticed that my teeth are much cleaner than they were when I used the &amp;#34;major&amp;#34; brand toothpastes.</li>
            <li>But... I really like this paste.  </li>
            <li>is a phytoestrogen meaning it can block receptor sites for real estrogen and contribute to estrogen build up in your body.</li>
            <li>We really don&#x27;t need any toothpaste at all, but that&#x27;s another story.</li>
            <li>I order this for my whole family on subscription with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Let me start this review by saying that I&#x27;m very picky about toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste, really like that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the Now Foods toothpastes.</li>
            <li>still told me i had to brush the front better, but that was because of &#x27;wet plaque&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way that this toothpaste tastes.</li>
            <li>It was gritty but dissolved smoothly in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I was very please with the taste and the way it cleaned my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I only use flouride free toothpaste, so decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>No fluoride is a must and it really does whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I used it for 4 or 5 days and it really made my teeth hurt quite a bit.</li>
            <li>or I need to start reading things more carefully.</li>
            <li>My whole family really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like pastes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what she says when I&#x27;ve used it for the whole time between teeth</li>
            <li>I am getting used to the taste so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is because the government wants us to have what they claim is cavity prevention even though no scientific study has ever indicated this.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Really seems to whiten my teeth up some</li>
            <li>Thanks again S. Ghosh ;</li>
            <li>Out of all of the natural toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried, this actually makes my mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>It it even foams (which is rare for a natural toothpaste).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally gentle on the mouth (doesn&#x27;t feel like you are stripping away the enamel on your teeth while brushing...)  </li>
            <li>Get rid of the sodium-sulfate based cleansers and make it Organic, the grade would definitely be much improved...  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonably priced xylitol based toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It burns my mouth so really haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t foam up much.</li>
            <li>and I find it actually cleans my teeth better than my old crest toothpaste without all the junk.</li>
            <li>It is minty and tastes pretty much like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The other flavors are just fine as well!</li>
            <li>I got really scared and started flossing a lot more which hurt due to the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste as the minty freshness does not leave the aftertaste that most other mint toothpastes leave.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it does minimize morning breath a lil bit better than other brands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you that the improvement is entirely due to this toothpaste (I am sure eliminating sugar</li>
            <li>Platinum mint is better then XyliWhite&#x27;s other toothpaste, refreshmint.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that many of those are pretty gross tasting, and do not leave a really freshly brushed aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use more of it than other toothpaste I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Any other XyliWhite is much better IF it doesn&#x27;t have baking soda.</li>
            <li>Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Platinum Mint Toothpaste]] -- there are other better toothpastes out there, including [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Gave everyone in the house a tube, as I bought nine, my 18 yo said that it left his teeth and mouth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands of  fluoride-free paste including Tom&#x27;s, Jason&#x27;s and others, but I like this one---both its minty taste and the clean feeling I have after use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert from fluoride and have been amazed by how clean and slippery my teeth feel after using this.</li>
            <li>no fluoride or junk and my teeth actually feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have fluoride or the chemical foaming agents in it and my teeth get clean and stay white--</li>
            <li>This is only minimally sweetened and has a lovely mint flavor with out the burn of so many commercial pastes.</li>
            <li>Much, much better than conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>this is a good purchase, especially since its much less than the product I was using.</li>
            <li>Regular toothpastes are far too strongly mint for me to handle.</li>
            <li>As long as this is available, I will keep buying this paste.</li>
            <li>For some reason, most brands of toothpaste give me a sore throat when I lay down after brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My new go-to!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean, my mouth feels fresh, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harmful chemicals placed in typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li>You will have to pay more for less.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different from regular toothpastes, but I like it much better.  </li>
            <li>I love that it contains none of the following: fluoride, SLS, gluten and paraben; core damaging ingredients the big ups want you to BELIEVE is not harming for ones health and family.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that there is no floride</li>
            <li>The flavour is much more subdued than commercial toothpastes so takes some getting used to as there is not such a &#x27;burst&#x27; of mint.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one in particular</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it is fluoride free and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My teeth were super duper white,  </li>
            <li>I like this brand but didn&#x27;t particularly like the flavor of this one.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m most likely gonna stay with this toothpaste even if my YL comes back in stock.</li>
            <li>I practice Oil Pulling with Coconut Oil and in conjunction with using regular baking soda as a mouth rinse, I wanted a natural Baking Soda toothpaste and this seemed to fit my requirement.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s brought positive results and I look forward</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to try this toothpaste, particularly if you have dental issues.</li>
            <li>so definitely -- the flavor could be a little more robust to make the breath freshening aspect more lasting...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone that don&#x27;t a lot of chemicals in their toothpaste but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I use this toothpaste because it has a high concentration of xylitene.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Once I learned how poisonous fluoride was to the body; I knew I had to switch to a toothpaste other than the popular brands such as Crest and Colgate.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit thinner than your Colgate, say, but it reminds me the most of the mainstream toothpastes.</li>
            <li>If you are used to a conventional toothpaste that is very sweet, this might take some getting used to.</li>
            <li>Overall, a pretty standard xylitol-based cavity fighting product that leaves your teeth feeling clean without over-stripping the enamel...  </li>
            <li>It costs a little more than regular toothpaste, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>, that is why I purchased it, I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it seems to make your teeth feel and look clean</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean just like when I was using the plain baking soda.</li>
            <li>I would recommend who wants to buy natural non-chemical toothpaste to their family.</li>
            <li>but I bought it for my 2 year old who isn&#x27;t ready for fluoride.  </li>
            <li>It makes my teeth very white and my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m allergic to them) and the rashes went away within a few days of switching to xyliwhite. :)</li>
            <li>95% of the toothpaste sold in the U.S. now contains fluoride, with many grocery stores carrying few if any non-fluoridated brands.</li>
            <li>I switched to another natural toothpaste since and most likely won&#x27;t be coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>It cleans and brightens teeth and freshens breath  without flouride, and with simple ingredients that I am not afraid to put in my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is true that xylitol is a naturally occurring substance, manufactured xylitol is another matter entirely.  </li>
            <li>it seems to get the job done with a normal amount of paste.</li>
            <li>Having used Crest, Aquafresh, Colgate, and Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past, I can honestly say this is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that consistently prevents morning breath.</li>
            <li>minor downside is the taste which i found to be just OK, it just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Bought this instead of my normal Earthpaste by Redmond Clay.</li>
            <li>Been looking for less abrasive and more natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It is mild, and as you brush, it seems to break down fast and not leave much of a flavor.  </li>
            <li>Bland flavor, which disappears fast as you are brushing, this toothpaste quickly became very unpopular in my house, the teenagers refused to use it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle mint flavor and doesn&#x27;t foam like normal toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>Also, there is new evidence that xylitol can support your dental health well.</li>
            <li>My new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I need new glasses.</li>
            <li>* we live in NJ, which doesn&#x27;t have fluoridated water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this new paste .This</li>
            <li>The use of fluoride toothpaste, particularly during early childhood, presents health risks.</li>
            <li>At the least as good as what you can get in the middle of Georgia.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product, except I have not seen Amazon having it available  on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>, it made my teeth VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>For one thing, they were very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Made them very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have a condition of the mouth that is very sensitive to a lot od things that set my mouth on fire.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love the clean feeling and the taste is very minty, but not that fake mint taste like many common toothpastes out</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to this toothpaste which surprised me because I don&#x27;t normally have allergies.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s mouth chemistry is different but this has whitened my teeth better than any other thing I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Keeping it natural!</li>
            <li>(they were pretty white to start with), but also haven&#x27;t yellowed at all.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed if it whitens, but my teeth are pretty white anyway.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are pretty solid.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is it actually does work.  </li>
            <li>normally rely on Young Living toothpaste now</li>
            <li>I am sticking with this as it makes my teeth feel clean and doesn&#x27;t have all the junk in it that other toothpastes have.</li>
            <li>and my breathe stays minty fresh for a long time after each brushing!</li>
            <li>, the downside is that it has very little mint taste and no foaming action, makes you want to use more than you need.</li>
            <li>Wish I liked it more :(</li>
            <li>i dont enjoy the taste of baking soda by any means, but the slightly salty undernote reminds me that</li>
            <li>light taste and slightly whitens.</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize that most advertised toothpastes are so abrasive that they break down the tooth enamel and actually cause cavities.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive I had four cavities in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Other toothpastes are so sweet they almost gags me.</li>
            <li>Although someone using it for the first time may not realize, until a few minutes later after you feel how clean your teeth fill.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste good at all, but most non fluoridated toothpaste tastes bad, so I expected that.</li>
            <li>Coupled with mouthwash, though, you&#x27;re in the clear.</li>
            <li>It doesnt foam or lather up like regular toothpaste so there doesnt feel like theres much between the brush and your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste asides from avoiding a lot of the harmful ingredients of common commercial toothpastes, has a clean mild mint flavor and feel.</li>
            <li>Xylitol is naturally occurring in plants, berries, etc.</li>
            <li>are the ingredients listed if anyone is interested:&lt;br /&gt;Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, sodium bicarbonate, glycerin, sorbitol, natural mint flavor, peppermint oil, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, papain, tea tree leaf oil, sodium carbonate, potassium sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to be whitening, which surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, sodium bicarbonate, glycerin, sorbitol, natural mint flavor, peppermint oil, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, papain, tea tree leaf oil, sodium carbonate and potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a tooth paste that was natural, without fluoride and would also whiten teeth.  </li>
            <li>By far the best-tasting, flouride-free toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li>I have tried thus far, but it is worth knowing I am not taxing my already fragile thyroid any further.</li>
            <li>but I found out not all natural and contains some chemicals.</li>
            <li>Natural cavity fighter.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothpaste for my daughter, age 9, who gets mouth sores frequently.</li>
            <li>All Natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have no complaints about this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but hopefully I can find it elsewhere because I paid $11 total with shipping &amp; that&#x27;s a bit much for toothpaste but</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I just had them professionally cleaned and</li>
            <li>I am allergic to glycols and toothpastes are one of the places they are in nearly every tube.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are the closest thing to natural that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work well and also has whitening without the flouride.</li>
            <li>It is a natural toothpaste, healthier than others.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive teeth caused by receding gum lines)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and experience no sensitivity when using Xyliwhite.</li>
            <li>It made my teeth ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far no issues at all.</li>
            <li>I got interested in natural toothpastes when the dentist noticed that my son had a strange thickening of the skin inside his cheeks.  </li>
            <li>but, a finishing rinse with a little (original) Listerine will remedy that...  </li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t bad for the size and it is offered on subscribe and save with free shipping, so it is very easy to order any quantity.</li>
            <li>None of the bad and all of the good!</li>
            <li>It keeps your mouth feeling fresh longer than any other toothpaste and keeps stains off my teeth.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth clean just like the poisonous fluoride toothpaste brands, but without putting toxic industrial waste fluoride poison in my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m a quarter way through the tube, I feel I&#x27;ve used it enough to write a decent review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this one better, the taste is pleasing and it does foam up nearly as much as the Thoms making less messy.  </li>
            <li>The mint is decent while brushing, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I also would like for it to foam up a little better, but I guess that&#x27;s the compromise for having such a simple ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Unlike some whitening toothpastes that leave a strange film on teeth, this rinses very well.  </li>
            <li>The mint is not strong but strong enough.</li>
            <li>bought this toothpaste back on November 18, 2014 (and with free 2-day Prime Shipping, likely got it by the 20th or 21st) and its now March, and I&#x27;ve probably only used this toothpaste maybe a handful of times (if not less!)</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes good, and feels much less caustic than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if this is any better than regular toothpaste, I may have noticed a worsening of my cavities but it is hard to blame the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;s not an essential ingredient and they can remove it from a new and improved</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is not overpowering like most of the common commercial brands.</li>
            <li>Pretty much like any ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My teeth are generally very sensitive, especially when i use whitening agents.</li>
            <li>every time I make a major order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time to get away from the major brand chemically produced products.</li>
            <li>These types of products have certainly come a long way and this is clearly a 21st century product.</li>
            <li>The tubes are large and one tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Great for X-rays, bad for continued exposure.</li>
            <li>I have been using fluoride free toothpaste to protect my thyroid gland (I have hypothyroidism) from the negative effects of fluoride, which was once used to treat overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).  </li>
            <li>what else can be said, the primary reason I purchased it was to avoid fluoride and other chemicals that come with other brands.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a clear gel that resembles petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>I did not read the description closely enough and was surprised when I got it that this was a gel not a paste.  </li>
            <li>The minty flavor is not very pronounced and the toothpaste does not feel very &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; but closer to a gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Teenage and preteen boys who use tea tree oil (and lavender, another estrogenic \\&quot;health\\&quot; product) have developed female breasts, which take months to go away after you stop using estrogenic products.  </li>
            <li>guess some people want the all-natural feel of having just brushed their teeth naturally with dirt of moss or something, but my wife hoped for something that would make her breath feel and smell</li>
            <li>I had to switch back to a sensitive toothpaste and I am grateful for the relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Growing up, I always used to purchase Arm-and-Hammer toothpaste because I craved that foaming action and taste only baking-soda based toothpastes can provide.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY downfall has been getting over the lack of foaming action, which took about a week for me.  </li>
            <li>Not sure I&#x27;ve seen any actual whitening, but it is the only fluoride and SLS free toothpaste</li>
            <li>The paste isn&#x27;t very grainy like other brands.</li>
            <li>Though I deducted a star, taste is secondary - I want clean, and this delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(me and my younger son are fans of their thieves toothpaste), but we recently ran out and Young Living has all of their toothpastes out of stock...</li>
            <li>like the peppermint flavor, although it did taste a little salty at first (from the baking soda),</li>
            <li>It freshens your breath more than ordinary toothpaste, and is less frothy in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Still, just because it lacks the foam doesn&#x27;t mean it lacks the clean.</li>
            <li>Now, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad or anything, but it&#x27;s really super mild, almost to the point where you feel like you have to rinse, whereas with other tooth cleansers you feel the minty freshness right away,</li>
            <li>Though at the beginning it tastes a little bit weird, you will absolutely like it after a week!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Compared to other toothpastes I feel like this one really whitens my teeth and in a short time period.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste because it was SLS Free, but if you look at the other comments it has another irritant just as harsh as SLS.&lt;br /&gt;It irritated my gums and gave me sores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first few times you use this you will be undoubtadly be turned off by the taste.</li>
            <li>is my first go round of this product/brand</li>
            <li>The gel tastes like pure baking soda with a slight hint of mint.  </li>
            <li>once you start brushing your teeth, it becomes very runny, and dribbles down your chin.</li>
            <li>And for everyone who hasn&#x27;t down their homework: Xylitol is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is a huge step-up from other former toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp; Earthpaste: which is a total scam); see my previous review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but the flavor is weak.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste cleans very well with a soft mint flavor, that sadly doesn&#x27;t lasts for a long time (that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like), but what I do like is the jelly texture and the clean sensation that leaves in my teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li>After a few formula changes and a bad reaction, I can no longer use the more widely available product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth minty taste; that doesn&#x27;t taste artificially made but provides real, sustainability to ones mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is great EXCEPT it does not have Fluoride in it.</li>

            <li> My tongue even looks great and it does well with my coffee stained teeth/tongue in the morning.</li>
            <li> Happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam, but that&#x27;s a great trade off for not having toxic SLS.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it tastes!!</li>
            <li> Very nice flavor.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective.</li>

            <li> Awesome fluoride free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value, good price for the size... for me it lasts forever, or</li>
            <li> So nice to have a product to replace my Toms, since they changed their formula after selling out!</li>
            <li> One of the best, that is for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste - very refreshing taste and it seems to be working great!!</li>
            <li> good product,,good combination of ingredients,,</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste, dentist recommend the product to my wife.</li>
            <li> Good bye Crest, Colgate, et al.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a good taste and it works in cleaning and whitening ones teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and works just like a toothpaste would.</li>
            <li> a good tooth paste if you was baking Soda toothpaste</li>
            <li> Good consistency/texture.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the Cinnamon flavored,and both taste good and work well.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good because my gums were inflammed before and this took the sting out.&lt;br /&gt;he</li>
            <li> Just give it a good 6-12 months.</li>
            <li> And best part is... free of harmful ingredients like flouride.</li>
            <li> It contains mostly good chemicals.</li>
            <li> And the fact that it is healthier ingredient wise is a plus.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work good.</li>
            <li> I loved the taste, but the stuff got watery while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Does a good cleaning job on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is good</li>
            <li> Everything about this product looks good.</li>
            <li> tastes good, works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a good brusher all my life, but still somehow got cavities each time I went to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good.  </li>
            <li> Flavor and texture are good, but after months of using this I found it to be too abrasive and led to tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This is really good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as natures gate, tea tree, or trader joes</li>
            <li> Good flavor.</li>
            <li> it contains xylitol which is supposed to be good for the teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, we&#x27;ve both been using this product for a couple of months now - it&#x27;s just the two of us, and it has a good taste and consistency.</li>
            <li> It tastes good</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine use to work but not as good as this.</li>
            <li> Still xyliwhite is a good product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li> Good taste.</li>
            <li> I keep using this product with good dentist reviews every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Price is good, I hope it will stay that way.</li>
            <li> but there is a great mint flavor &amp; it leaves my teeth feeling so clean !!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothpaste, great taste, gentle and with whitening.</li>
            <li> NOW makes superior products and I am satisfied with this paste time after time!</li>
            <li> You can taste the baking soda (which isn&#x27;t the most awesome flavor) but it does have a good, strong minty taste that stays.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it does not irritate my mouth in any way which is why I purchased this toothpaste in the first place!</li>
            <li> I am happy that all of my children won&#x27;t be exposed to any more fluoride than they&#x27;ve already inadvertedly consumed.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not that great but its ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to get him away from the flouride too :)</li>
            <li> Happy it has no flouride, just wished it foamed up a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m three weeks in to using it and mind you, I rarely went one week without a canker sore popping up, and I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t had one ucler!  </li>
            <li> It works well and is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for adults but skip it as a toddler fluoride-free paste.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the taste and it makes my teeth shiny after flossing and using an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> effective and good ingredients</li>
            <li> Nice taste, good price for &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; toothpaste</li>
            <li> Love 100% fluoride free toothpaste best tasting one they have imo</li>
            <li> One of my favorite toothpastes!  </li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love Xyliwhite&#x27;s Platinum Mint Toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> My teeth look better by just using it a couple of times too!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM ALL!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite fluoride-free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably love it!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> tastes great, easy to brush with, have not gone to the dentist since started brushing so no info on that.</li>
            <li> Great fresh taste, awesome clean feeling in your mouth when you are done brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed, attractive, sturdy tube and a good amount of product.  </li>
            <li> Great toothpaste that leaves my breath minty fresh and teeth bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Great fluoride free toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I would advice anyone staying away from fluoride to buy this amazing product with xylitol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Flavor is great and we switched from Tom&#x27;s Flouride Free to trying this.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste for your dogs, please do not choose a toothpaste with Xylitol in it as you will be doing your dog more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Honestly, probably not.</li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have purchased two tubes of this product and use  it to avoid acute toxicity of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Effective and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> and the taste is nice without overpowering</li>
            <li> The minty taste is nice, but I have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> ; I would recommend this product to my own family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easier than making my own.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this toothpaste smell</li>
            <li> It cleans well and does seem to provide a degree of whitening as well with a nice peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> Xylitol doesn’t seem quite so warm and fuzzy anymore, does it?</li>
            <li> So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> I liked everything about it except that it was a gel.</li>
            <li> I really liked it but thought it was pricey.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice</li>
            <li> I am 40 now and I cannot honestly say I have ever found a toothpaste I like.  </li>
            <li> It has a gel/paste consistency and a nice smell in and out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I had thought about making my own toothpaste when I saw this one.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice product and</li>
            <li> As good or better than Tom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste feels very clean and fresh, and it whitens perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural toothpaste we&#x27;ve tried, and we&#x27;ve tried many!</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Xylitol toothpaste I have had great checkups at the dentist to the point of the hygienist saying, wow there is no tarter on your teeth even below the gums, you&#x27;re doing great.</li>
            <li> Very good and reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> Awesome, natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste and my mouth feels clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste and the fact that xylitol is actually good for you is great, plus it&#x27;s fluoride free !</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone a safe effective product.</li>
            <li> The best all natural toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best products I have tried that claim having, &#x27;all natural&#x27; ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good, clean, and works well as a toothpaste, not just as a natural toothpaste, but in that category, it&#x27;s definitely excellent!</li>
            <li> After about 2 months use, she has had no mouth ulcers (yet!), but complains its too strong in the mint flavor-and she loves mint!</li>
            <li> Does not taste very good and simply did not do as good a job of whitening and removing tartar as Tom&#x27;s of Maine</li>
            <li> I was happy with the toothpaste at first.</li>
            <li> It tastes great and really helps me maintain whiter teeth without a bunch of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> I get a real clean feel after this, and I&#x27;m glad to have a toothpaste with ingredients I can trust.</li>
            <li> A couple more drops of oil would make it taste great and give that nice breath you really want after brushing.</li>
            <li> no bad stuff in it and also good stuff in it to make the teeth stronger.</li>
            <li> Xyliwhite is not too minty, and leaves your mouth feeling good with no bad aftertaste while the xylitol strengthens the teeth.</li>
            <li> Has a very light taste that doesn&#x27;t stay in your mouth for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great feeling teeth &amp; makes my mouth taste better first thing in the morning if I brush with this immediately before bed.  </li>
            <li> The taste was pleasant and I loved using a more natural alternative to the drugstore toothepastes.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Once you brush it in, the saltiness is replaced (more like overpowered) with a peppermint</li>
            <li> I love being able to brush my teeth without fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Essential</li>
            <li> I like the taste, but I cannot use it more than once per day</li>
            <li> I prefer toothpaste that lathers more.  </li>
            <li> But I need more lather.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to gradually remove plaque in areas</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this!</li>
            <li> Minty factor is just ok.</li>
            <li> He won&#x27;t use my homemade toothpaste, so this is the best second choice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better than both.  </li>
            <li> and i love it will buy more when run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste as part of my healthy living</li>
            <li> I like the flavor of the platinum mint much better than the refreshmint (more of a spearmint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Freshens better.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about whiter teeth, but it sure brightens my teeth.</li>
            <li> great tasting, great ingredients and fluoride free, thank you now foods for providing us a safe alternative to commercial fluoride toothpastes</li>
            <li> comes out the top and bottom of the tube.</li>
            <li> This product is more like brushing your teeth with baking soda, where it seems like you might need more, but you probably don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so soi think i like Jasons better.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.  </li>
            <li> Google around to read more about the fluoride bs.  </li>
            <li> I Love this toothpaste, even though people with Perioral Dermatitis aren&#x27;t supposed to use mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> A better healthy alterative is Tom&#x27;s of Maine propolis &amp; myrrh.   </li>
            <li> (She isn&#x27;t really sure</li>
            <li> I prefer the spearmint flavor, but i absolutely love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste needs a lot more Mint in it.  </li>
            <li> There are better products out there</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> My teeth fill a lot better tho.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Needs a better flavor</li>
            <li> Is refreshing, however I buy xylitol based products because of a corn allergy.</li>
            <li> I really love the misty taste</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Many times, it dripped out of my mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have flouride.</li>
            <li> I will be re-purchasing for sure.</li>
            <li> SLS can lead to canker sores, so does tarter control (too many phosphates) and also leads to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this will work to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> The price is much better.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> my attempt to try a more organic alternative, I switched to using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> More for the money</li>
            <li> I saw it was made by Now Foods, a company I trusted to produce safe, quality, wholesome products.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> okay, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> What the foaming affects lacks, the refreshing taste of mint make up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> 3 stars for this product is ok.  </li>
            <li> Much better on your teeth and health than store bought poisons.  </li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I can find something without fluoride for my family.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want all the additives that come along with most brand name toothpastes and</li>
            <li> And I was even more please to find I can order it from Amazon.com and not have to travel 35 miles to get it...</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Not even Sensodyne Pronamel was able to do that.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Will deff buy some more when I run out</li>
            <li> so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Perhaps best used for occasional polishing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> I love how it works on my teeth and mouth</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried almost all the xylitol oral care products that I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps the formula of this Platinum Mint flavor (which includes peppermint oil) masks it better.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the case, Platinum Mint tastes better to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is yet one more flavor in the Xyliwhite line which I have not yet tried - Refreshmint.  </li>
            <li> What I also like about this is it&#x27;s not an overwhelming overpowering baking soda taste.</li>
            <li> This stuff was ok.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, this toothpaste was OK......</li>
            <li> I decided to look for a more cost-effective alternative.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I had been looking for a flouride-free toothpaste and decided on Xyli-White based on the ingredients and the reviews that said it also helped whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my teeth feel afterward.</li>
            <li> Great taste and leaves your mouth feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it has worked for me like magic</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flavor of the NOW toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> Like its labeled it looks more like a gel.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fact that this toothpaste uses Xylitol and contains no sodium lauryl sulfate or flouride!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really cleans, great taste.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this toothpaste more than I.</li>
            <li> great product will order again very soon.</li>
            <li> Could use a bit more mint flavour</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s our review of Now Foods latest entry to the oral-care arena...  </li>
            <li> Xylitol is supposed to be good for reversing and preventing cavities, so it&#x27;s definitely worth testing out...  </li>
            <li> Hope they come out with a pepsodent flavor, as that is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I find that pastes polish the teeth much better than gels.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My favorite-- glad Amazon is carrying it now.</li>
            <li> And I do not want any more of toothpastes with fluoride in them.</li>
            <li> This was an OK toothpaste, my teeth felt nice and clean.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> My mouth does indeed feel nice and clean after each brushing.</li>
            <li> Teeth will feel nice and clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It has an o.k. minty flavor and made our teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth and teeth feel very clean - you can feel the baking soda at work.</li>
            <li> There is a very clean taste in your mouth, even  upon waking in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> At $3.99 for a 6.4 ounce tube it is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> think it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It does not foam up but has a nice minty flavor without being too sweet like some others.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> If this product contains baking soda, I honestly could not taste it; this is not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> On a side note, it did taste pretty good so if it wasn&#x27;t for the canker sore issue, I would have continued using it.</li>
            <li> Our favorite toothpaste, Xyliwhite is minty but not too strong even for our 4yo.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t come in the fancy-schmancy packaging that the top brands use, but the packaging works fine.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I can fine an additional product to work with this one.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean!</li>
            <li> The hardest part in finding a good non-fluoride toothpaste is finding one that tastes well and leaves your breath smelling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The toothpaste is nice to use and leaves a clean and light minty feeling in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is fluoride-free, tastes good and keeps my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean without any sugary aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> It also tastes great and cleans well, my teeth were also sensitive and with this toothpaste that&#x27;s not been a problem either.</li>
            <li> We love that is fluoride free.</li>
            <li> The flavor is fantastic, not sugary like most toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I will probably order more because it being fluoride free as I won&#x27;t use a fluoride tooth paste anymore.</li>
            <li> think this is a great toothpaste for those that don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth and not in need of a lot of whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the excess flouride in most commercial toothpastes, and after finding and enjoying Oralive by Ascended Health (which works great, though is pricey)</li>
            <li> Nice fresh taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but the cleansing ingredient 9SCS) doesn&#x27;t give one much motivation to switch from Tom&#x27;s of Maine -which uses SLS...  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully clean toothpaste, with excellent substitutes for the SLS and fluoride that are in most other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Seemed to clean OK</li>
            <li> It is easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling very clean and my breath very fresh and doesn&#x27;t have any flouride.</li>
            <li> It is very mild tasting too.  </li>
            <li> It tastes great, much better than our regular toothpaste!</li>
            <li> The baking soda is very mild</li>
            <li> I kind of wonder what good it does long-term, such as overnight.</li>
            <li> I can still taste the soda, but it&#x27;s not so strong.</li>
            <li> but if you like having a strong minty feeling in your mouth, this might be for you.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t have a strong mint flavor and it don&#x27;t foam in the mouth</li>
            <li> The minty flavor is strong.</li>
            <li> this is a nice back up toothpaste, tastes good.</li>
            <li> People preferring strong mint will probably not be as fond of this.  </li>
            <li> I like it my family did not, the flavor is a bit strong for them.</li>
            <li> Not too strong of a taste, which I like.  </li>
            <li> Might be a bit strong for a child&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Nothing special; just better than monopoly&#x27;s Brands like Crest,Colgate,etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I find that using a toothbrush full makes the experience better.  </li>
            <li> Love the cool minty feeling</li>
            <li> Pretty nice taste..  </li>
            <li> awesome product... Been meat/fluoride free for 90 days and feel an extreme difference.  </li>
            <li> is not as abrasive, its not whitening kind... ,its just keeping your mouth fresh and your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> , it leave the teeth very clean and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste works fine.  </li>
            <li> It works well, tastes fine, but I am upset that when I ordered I did not see in the ingredient list that it contains carrageenan.  </li>
            <li> The paste is fine, not grainy.  </li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I like this fine.  </li>
            <li> The taste is mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li> An okay toothpaste, but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay definitely not sugary but pleasant.</li>
            <li> excellent product, it&#x27;s not like a normal toothpaste this one won&#x27;t leave you an extra fresh mint flavor or freshness as a regular one, but it does an excellent job and it has no fluoride, that what I care about</li>
            <li> Great mild taste/flavor which doesn&#x27;t overpower like so many other toothpastes and no fluoride which is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I expected better quality packaging since the tooth paste is of great quality and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist is a huge fan of Xylitol and approves of the percentage in this paste.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had gluten-free toothpaste before, you must know it is not as smooth as a gluten or chemical-filled gel.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> fourth or fifth tube  great toothpaste</li>
            <li> Which justified the fact to me</li>
            <li> iam a fan of free of flouride, i have been using this toothpaste for a month now</li>
            <li> I always prefer fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of reviews and it is fluoride free and free of poison ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh breath</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating because I like the idea that it is fluoride free</li>
            <li> This toothpaste, being flouride free, does what you would expect from toothpaste; cleans teeth.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I have even talked my husband and mom into using it.  </li>
            <li> normally available</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s SLS and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Since this is SLS free, it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent mouth ulcers.</li>
            <li> Because my periodontal disease was worsening (despite great dental care), I decided to try something different.  </li>
            <li> -white does not advertise itself as a pain-reducing toothpaste, but it is a GREAT one.</li>
            <li> the potential to be a great product</li>
            <li> Fluoride free</li>
            <li> I combine it with OraMD, a couple drops, It is Flouride Free, and uses Xylitol.</li>
            <li> this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Its fluoride free, but its taste is just &amp;</li>
            <li> I searched for sulfate free toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> Commercially available xylitol is produced by the industrialized process of sugar hydrogenation.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it really was cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> that it is flouride free, as none of us need that.  </li>
            <li> I came across this product because I was looking for a toothpaste that is free of fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste claims to be SLS free but sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium coco-sulfate</li>
            <li> soft bristles, easy touch and teeth stay clean and bright.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and squeaky-clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted a vegan and cruelty-free toothpaste without fluoride and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Leaves a freshly minty refreshing flavor in my mouth.</li>
            <li> whole Mouth was thrilled with the results after 4 mouth/teeth cleanings.</li>
            <li> Good all around natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m having a good experience with it.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Add a good source of natural occurring Fluoride, like from &#x27;Prevident&#x27;, to harden your enamel and that will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I get plenty of foaming action, and a nice refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, natural, fluoride-free toothpaste - this is it.</li>
            <li> This is a much milder paste than others, however, for myself it works great and I am now not slowly poisoning myself from flouride!</li>
            <li> It is a lovely uncolored gel with just the right amount of EO&#x27;s to freshen the breath without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> I have tried their other tooth paste and while they are good, I just prefer they kind with baking soda in it.</li>
            <li> And best of all, the price is very reasonable for a high quality flouride free natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean after using.</li>
            <li> It tastes fine &amp; it isn&#x27;t full of all the chemicals that you find in store bought toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste so much!</li>
            <li> Taste aside, this is a good brand of toothpaste without many of the harsh chemicals found in most toothpastes today.</li>
            <li> I love this product, really!  </li>
            <li> deff worth the find!</li>
            <li> and I was excited about the xylitol in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth have been getting whiter since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
            <li> Get it, is worth it!</li>
            <li> Xylitol, no artificial chemical sweetness!</li>
            <li> However the pleasant taste from main stream toothpaste is due to added chemicals, which although provide good taste, should never me ingested.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I use this; it&#x27;s a much stronger minty taste than the &amp;#34;Refreshmint&amp;#34; flavor, which is great for our young kids.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others, but this toothpaste is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Leave me mouth feeling clean and moist.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but it does clean.</li>
            <li> and my mouth always feels clean.</li>
            <li> it helps my mouth stay clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a lot of xylitol products and like what they can do in terms of adjusting the pH of the mouth, making your teeth feel slippery clean, and providing a \\&quot;food\\&quot; for the bacteria in your mouth that they cannot digest.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> After hours of use still feel my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean our teeth as well as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I think it works well to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth look and feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The most enjoyable natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is not really what it claims but a lot better than the ones claiming good oral health and then damaging your teeth.</li>
            <li> Of course it uses baking soda, so it doesn&#x27;t have the strong fresh taste like the Colgate brand that I used to use.  </li>
            <li> I did not have success with whitening and didn&#x27;t care for the strong mint flavor.</li>
            <li> more positive from continued use.</li>
            <li> A most refreshing toothpaste, comes out of the tube easily, really prepares the mouth for its first morning sip or bite.  </li>
            <li> I loved this at first but after using it for awhile my husband and I both started to have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I prefer milder taste but overall its a really good clean feeling toothpaste.</li>
            <li> defer the oral health assessment to my dentist, but my teeth feel clean and look good so overall</li>
            <li> My gums are great, better than as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s convinced it makes her teeth whiter, which really motivates her to brush. :-)</li>
            <li> Good value (big tube for the price) and</li>
            <li> I have tried many things to make my teeth whiter and this product has made my teeth SO much whiter.</li>
            <li> This is a natural toothpaste that from my research didnt appear to have any offensive or hazardous ingredients.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s still a good brand of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> it gently whitens my teeth (not shockingly so, but it does help).</li>
            <li> Very Yummy, refreshing, tasty toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to venture in trying more.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth feeling super clean...</li>
            <li> Even my husband (who hates my all natural toothpastes) liked the flavor of this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the taste, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into natural living, growing my own foods, using baking soda to brush my teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on the long-term quality (in cleaning the teeth/gums/mouth) because I can&#x27;t use this toothpaste for more than one brushing session when I&#x27;m in a pinch</li>
            <li> But not bad</li>
            <li> Taste isn&#x27;t great but other than that its really good for basic whitening .</li>
            <li> However, my teeth felt super clean after the very first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very good at whitening, but the flavour is pleasant and it does a good job getting your teeth clean without all the extra chemicals and junk that you find in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I like it, teeth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean feeling, helped my gums to stop bleeding</li>
            <li> We like to taste and you feel clean and fresh .....</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean and my breath feel fresh.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth with a clean fresh taste.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the toothpaste on preventing cavities (I use it with a fluoride rinse), it does leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> BUT my teeth always feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> teeth are clean, fresh taste, would buy again</li>
            <li> The mint taste is mild.</li>
            <li> My favorite flouride free toothpaste so far.</li>
            <li> switching from Crest Herbal Mint liquid gel toothpase, the flavor of this toothpaste is fairly mild.</li>
            <li> I only wish the mintyness of it were more prominent.</li>
            <li> Whether Xyliwhite got rid of any cavities that I may or may not have had, I will remain loyal to this product for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> It is a mild scent and mild abrasive, but that works for me.</li>
            <li> the dentist and technician both commented that my teeth and gums are very healthy and better than at my previous check up.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I like the ingredients, taste, and feel of this toothpaste, my daughter loves it (which is very important to me!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never understand why people prefer to brush their teeth with rat poison (sodium fluoride) instead of baking soda or other SAFE AND EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li> If an economical way can be found to buy one tube to sample, that&#x27;d be great, but for now, the shipping costs from other vendors, or the requirement of buying multi-packs prevents that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fluoride free tooth paste and tried this product first.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used ever due to no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> My new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but this is one of my favorite new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite organic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; would recommend it to anyone who wants a safer way to brush ;)</li>
            <li> minty taste has a strong after-taste and made my breath feel it&#x27;s absolute best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bigger fan of Jason Healthy Mouth, but this is effective and I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY minty!!</li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, makes teeth super white, without hurting the enamel.</li>
            <li> Besides, my 10 year old loves the fresh non-burning taste of this toothpaste and brushes her teeth more diligently.</li>
            <li> Feels really fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Love this natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> These tubes came packaged nicely and they are quite big tubes</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I use about 30% more toothpaste per brush than I did before, but that might be because I&#x27;m used to the bubbling and foaming of my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The price is worth the value, to me.  </li>
            <li> My 83 year old grandmother with failing vision was even able to tell that my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> This is her favorite of the &#x27;natural&#x27; kinds of toothpastes she&#x27;s tried.  </li>
            <li> Looks like vaseline, but whitens and makes breath fresh cannot complain</li>
            <li> I also had frequent nightmares of my teeth falling out, those are gone too :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to make my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth feeling fresh and gingly.  </li>
            <li> Love the natural teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> This product does contain sorbitol which is most frequently derived from corn.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend for someone more sensitive.</li>
            <li> ; that made her mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> However, after further research I realized that by switching to a fluoride free toothpaste and also only drinking bottled water, I have effectively cut out most of my fluoride intake, which is probably what caused the cavity.</li>
            <li> Well worth it to get away from flouride</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li> Fresh but not a burning fresh.</li>
            <li> and I know that I will still have fresh breath and nice white teeth</li>
            <li> You will have fresh breath.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s really important to you, this can be amended by simply using more than a pea-sized amount.</li>
            <li> I know there are some natural toothpastes that are able to reproduce this without adding SLS so for me XyliWhite didn&#x27;t deserve 5-stars.</li>
            <li> I wish the minty flavor were a bit stronger -- this isn&#x27;t the one for you to have lingering fresh breath.</li>
            <li> and my mouth always feels fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t giving it away, but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> One of the only kind of toothpaste we use.</li>
            <li> So there it continues to sit, in my bathroom medicine cabinet, rarely taken out, but taking up place (and causing clutter) because as digusting as it is, I cringe at the thought of throwing $4 in the garbage</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying out, but the search is STILL on for all-natural organic tooth cleansers without any sodium-sulfate based cleansers ...</li>
            <li> Good product - light taste - no strong &amp;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other brands without SLS that I&#x27;ve tried, in that the mint tastes better.</li>
            <li> it does taste pretty mild and i do like that.</li>
            <li> I used to use toms of main but came across this and like it just as much bit its a much better price.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste taste, it is natural and leaves your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Over all I feel that this one is superior to other toothpastes of this class.</li>
            <li> other words, if you are looking for a good, fluoride-free toothpaste, stay away from this  </li>
            <li> Whitens right on wth spot.</li>
            <li> Price is right.  </li>
            <li> it comes right to my door.  </li>
            <li> yes, that&#x27;s right, from using it one time.</li>
            <li> right, like this is going to work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering has just the right about a flavor.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste immediately reduces all sensitivity in our teeth and the taste is just right, tolerable.  </li>
            <li> but rather the results right?</li>
            <li> I got it today and used it right away.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that it has only natural ingredients and still tastes amazing!</li>
            <li> Definitely feels a lot nicer and tastes better than stuff like Crest though which is so sickly sweet tasting.</li>
            <li> It really leaves the teeth feeling clean, like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> My older son went out to buy a fluoride brand toothpaste, this undermined all my efforts to keep them poison free.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean the teeth very well.</li>
            <li> The paste is a good consistency, the color is more of a translucent white than a pure white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this for three days now; I will need more evidence of my own to determine the later of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the brush long.  </li>
            <li> But, I was having one heck of a time finding one that made my mouth feel clean and fresh and found myself resorting back to the free samples of fluoridated toothpaste strewn across the office.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best value you can get if you&#x27;re trying to avoid harsh chemicals and such.</li>
            <li> The preliminary research on Xylitol in oral health care does look promising as well, though I would suggest always trusting the peer-reviewed research over the latest natural foods blog.</li>
            <li> and it seems to keep my mouth as clean as the older non-fluoride toothpaste that I was using.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, the best toothpaste out there!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I like this product very much</li>
            <li> I like this brand of toothpaste very much.</li>
            <li> Decent, more natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It does great in terms of flavor but negative points when it comes to staying power.  </li>
            <li> Though it holds together better then refreshmint, it still doesn&#x27;t stick around by the time you&#x27;re actually done brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Those interested in knowing the ingredients to this product:    </li>
            <li> Will definitely get more when the time come.</li>
            <li> i really like this product!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more whitening than your retail pastes (perhaps excluding arm and hammer advanced white for sensitive teeth, which i don&#x27;t think exists anymore).</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale the first time, and I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are definitely white :)</li>
            <li> I was worried I would have to &amp;#34;bite the bullet&amp;#34; (punny) and finally go back to one who I was sure</li>
            <li> I love using this toothpaste, not only have my teeth gotten a lot whiter, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I no longer have tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Of coarse when i told her how i wasn&#x27;t using fluoridated toothpaste anymore, she scolded me, but  couldn&#x27;t complain about my oral health :)</li>
            <li> This was my first product to try.</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY MAKING MY TEETH WHITEN BETTER THAN THE TOXIC CREST 3D</li>
            <li> It cleans very well and has made a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my smile.  </li>
            <li> Simply put, I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My mistake, I have to be more discerning in my future purchases.</li>
            <li> (good by me because it means it has no artificial colors or preservatives), and is an &#x27;adjustment&#x27; if you prefer white, blue stripes or sweeteners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that xylitol is able to restore enamel where cavities once were by remineralization or restoring the enamel, and I&#x27;m totally convinced it did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this, but I think it cleans better than regular fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought yeah</li>
            <li> The first time, I purchased this product from a health food store.  </li>
            <li> I like the taste of cinnafresh  better, but this one seems to actually whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> but the check up&#x27;s so far have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Me and my boyfriend decided to switch to non fluoride toothpaste and this was the first brand we chose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Now Foods fan (I use a ton of their products), but this one is definitely up on my top ten list.</li>
            <li> It scrubs my teeth much better than regular toothpaste, without the fluoride, and it is cheaper than Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> Plus its good to know im not putting any of that harmful fluoride in my body everyday</li>
            <li> Freshens up breath quick and certainly feels like it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> At first it doesnt feel clean and minty like regular toothpaste but for some reason after you brush and rinse, your mouth feels amazingly clean</li>
            <li> Over half way through this tube brushing twice (morning, night) and am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients, the clean feeling in my mouth after brushing, and the thumbs up from my dentist at my most recent visit.</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> tree oil may be fine for women, but according to a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, it&#x27;s highly estrogenic and can lead to feminization and lack of sex drive in males.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, and I think it whitens just as well as any other fluoride toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> For example colgate and other popular toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural toothpaste that leaves me with a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> nearly.... makes my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> It is an overall good toothpaste, especially for being gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the one I liked the least out of the flavors available.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried quite a few flouride free toothpastes and this is our favorite.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems over the years with sore mouth and even mouth ulcers when I use many of the commonly available commercial toothpastes, especially that gel types.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are feeling better and looking whiter than they have in a long time.  </li>
            <li> not bad as a natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> Simple toothpaste, no fluoride, high percentage of xylitol, what more do you need.  </li>
            <li> When I develop some tooth pain, I use this toothpaste a little more often and it cures my pain!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this toothpaste after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My hygienist just cleaned my teeth and even remarked at how clean they were and how my once slightly red gums around some problem spots were nice and pink again.</li>
            <li> Nice slightly minty taste after brushing.</li>
            <li> The gum crevices are still kind of there, though not nearly as noticeable, and most importantly, do not hurt.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my &#x27;main stream&#x27; toothpaste but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I prefer this flavor to the standard mint flavors because its just a little bit stronger, and it &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; more refreshing.</li>
            <li> Amazing (more like scary) what people put in their mouths.</li>
            <li> Also, if you get some on your tongue before you get brushing, it is very salty.</li>
            <li> I have been using XyliWhite for over a year now because it is one of the only options that is SLS and Flouride free.</li>
            <li> When people ask what I am using I always highly recommended this!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> the flavor is an intense peppermint</li>
            <li> but I got used to it really fast and don&#x27;t even notice it now.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this and has for almost two years.</li>
            <li> or so I noticed that my teeth are much cleaner than they were when I used the &amp;#34;major&amp;#34; brand toothpastes.</li>
            <li> But... I really like this paste.  </li>
            <li> is a phytoestrogen meaning it can block receptor sites for real estrogen and contribute to estrogen build up in your body.</li>
            <li> We really don&#x27;t need any toothpaste at all, but that&#x27;s another story.</li>
            <li> I order this for my whole family on subscription with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying that I&#x27;m very picky about toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, really like that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the Now Foods toothpastes.</li>
            <li> still told me i had to brush the front better, but that was because of &#x27;wet plaque&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way that this toothpaste tastes.</li>
            <li> It was gritty but dissolved smoothly in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I was very please with the taste and the way it cleaned my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I only use flouride free toothpaste, so decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> No fluoride is a must and it really does whiten the teeth.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I used it for 4 or 5 days and it really made my teeth hurt quite a bit.</li>
            <li> or I need to start reading things more carefully.</li>
            <li> My whole family really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like pastes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what she says when I&#x27;ve used it for the whole time between teeth</li>
            <li> I am getting used to the taste so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is because the government wants us to have what they claim is cavity prevention even though no scientific study has ever indicated this.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Really seems to whiten my teeth up some</li>
            <li> Thanks again S. Ghosh ;</li>
            <li> Out of all of the natural toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried, this actually makes my mouth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> It it even foams (which is rare for a natural toothpaste).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally gentle on the mouth (doesn&#x27;t feel like you are stripping away the enamel on your teeth while brushing...)  </li>
            <li> Get rid of the sodium-sulfate based cleansers and make it Organic, the grade would definitely be much improved...  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced xylitol based toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It burns my mouth so really haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t foam up much.</li>
            <li> and I find it actually cleans my teeth better than my old crest toothpaste without all the junk.</li>
            <li> It is minty and tastes pretty much like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The other flavors are just fine as well!</li>
            <li> I got really scared and started flossing a lot more which hurt due to the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste as the minty freshness does not leave the aftertaste that most other mint toothpastes leave.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it does minimize morning breath a lil bit better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you that the improvement is entirely due to this toothpaste (I am sure eliminating sugar</li>
            <li> Platinum mint is better then XyliWhite&#x27;s other toothpaste, refreshmint.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that many of those are pretty gross tasting, and do not leave a really freshly brushed aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use more of it than other toothpaste I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Any other XyliWhite is much better IF it doesn&#x27;t have baking soda.</li>
            <li> Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Platinum Mint Toothpaste]] -- there are other better toothpastes out there, including [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Gave everyone in the house a tube, as I bought nine, my 18 yo said that it left his teeth and mouth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of  fluoride-free paste including Tom&#x27;s, Jason&#x27;s and others, but I like this one---both its minty taste and the clean feeling I have after use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert from fluoride and have been amazed by how clean and slippery my teeth feel after using this.</li>
            <li> no fluoride or junk and my teeth actually feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have fluoride or the chemical foaming agents in it and my teeth get clean and stay white--</li>
            <li> This is only minimally sweetened and has a lovely mint flavor with out the burn of so many commercial pastes.</li>
            <li> Much, much better than conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> this is a good purchase, especially since its much less than the product I was using.</li>
            <li> Regular toothpastes are far too strongly mint for me to handle.</li>
            <li> As long as this is available, I will keep buying this paste.</li>
            <li> For some reason, most brands of toothpaste give me a sore throat when I lay down after brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My new go-to!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean, my mouth feels fresh, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harmful chemicals placed in typical toothpaste.</li>
            <li> You will have to pay more for less.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from regular toothpastes, but I like it much better.  </li>
            <li> I love that it contains none of the following: fluoride, SLS, gluten and paraben; core damaging ingredients the big ups want you to BELIEVE is not harming for ones health and family.</li>
            <li> The main thing is that there is no floride</li>
            <li> The flavour is much more subdued than commercial toothpastes so takes some getting used to as there is not such a &#x27;burst&#x27; of mint.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one in particular</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it is fluoride free and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My teeth were super duper white,  </li>
            <li> I like this brand but didn&#x27;t particularly like the flavor of this one.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m most likely gonna stay with this toothpaste even if my YL comes back in stock.</li>
            <li> I practice Oil Pulling with Coconut Oil and in conjunction with using regular baking soda as a mouth rinse, I wanted a natural Baking Soda toothpaste and this seemed to fit my requirement.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s brought positive results and I look forward</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone to try this toothpaste, particularly if you have dental issues.</li>
            <li> so definitely -- the flavor could be a little more robust to make the breath freshening aspect more lasting...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone that don&#x27;t a lot of chemicals in their toothpaste but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste because it has a high concentration of xylitene.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Once I learned how poisonous fluoride was to the body; I knew I had to switch to a toothpaste other than the popular brands such as Crest and Colgate.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit thinner than your Colgate, say, but it reminds me the most of the mainstream toothpastes.</li>
            <li> If you are used to a conventional toothpaste that is very sweet, this might take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Overall, a pretty standard xylitol-based cavity fighting product that leaves your teeth feeling clean without over-stripping the enamel...  </li>
            <li> It costs a little more than regular toothpaste, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> , that is why I purchased it, I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it seems to make your teeth feel and look clean</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean just like when I was using the plain baking soda.</li>
            <li> I would recommend who wants to buy natural non-chemical toothpaste to their family.</li>
            <li> but I bought it for my 2 year old who isn&#x27;t ready for fluoride.  </li>
            <li> It makes my teeth very white and my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m allergic to them) and the rashes went away within a few days of switching to xyliwhite. :)</li>
            <li> 95% of the toothpaste sold in the U.S. now contains fluoride, with many grocery stores carrying few if any non-fluoridated brands.</li>
            <li> I switched to another natural toothpaste since and most likely won&#x27;t be coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> It cleans and brightens teeth and freshens breath  without flouride, and with simple ingredients that I am not afraid to put in my mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is true that xylitol is a naturally occurring substance, manufactured xylitol is another matter entirely.  </li>
            <li> it seems to get the job done with a normal amount of paste.</li>
            <li> Having used Crest, Aquafresh, Colgate, and Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past, I can honestly say this is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that consistently prevents morning breath.</li>
            <li> minor downside is the taste which i found to be just OK, it just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Bought this instead of my normal Earthpaste by Redmond Clay.</li>
            <li> Been looking for less abrasive and more natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It is mild, and as you brush, it seems to break down fast and not leave much of a flavor.  </li>
            <li> Bland flavor, which disappears fast as you are brushing, this toothpaste quickly became very unpopular in my house, the teenagers refused to use it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle mint flavor and doesn&#x27;t foam like normal toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> Also, there is new evidence that xylitol can support your dental health well.</li>
            <li> My new toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I need new glasses.</li>
            <li> * we live in NJ, which doesn&#x27;t have fluoridated water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this new paste .This</li>
            <li> The use of fluoride toothpaste, particularly during early childhood, presents health risks.</li>
            <li> At the least as good as what you can get in the middle of Georgia.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, except I have not seen Amazon having it available  on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> , it made my teeth VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> For one thing, they were very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Made them very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have a condition of the mouth that is very sensitive to a lot od things that set my mouth on fire.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the clean feeling and the taste is very minty, but not that fake mint taste like many common toothpastes out</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to this toothpaste which surprised me because I don&#x27;t normally have allergies.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s mouth chemistry is different but this has whitened my teeth better than any other thing I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Keeping it natural!</li>
            <li> (they were pretty white to start with), but also haven&#x27;t yellowed at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed if it whitens, but my teeth are pretty white anyway.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are pretty solid.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing is it actually does work.  </li>
            <li> normally rely on Young Living toothpaste now</li>
            <li> I am sticking with this as it makes my teeth feel clean and doesn&#x27;t have all the junk in it that other toothpastes have.</li>
            <li> and my breathe stays minty fresh for a long time after each brushing!</li>
            <li> , the downside is that it has very little mint taste and no foaming action, makes you want to use more than you need.</li>
            <li> Wish I liked it more :(</li>
            <li> i dont enjoy the taste of baking soda by any means, but the slightly salty undernote reminds me that</li>
            <li> light taste and slightly whitens.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t realize that most advertised toothpastes are so abrasive that they break down the tooth enamel and actually cause cavities.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive I had four cavities in the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Other toothpastes are so sweet they almost gags me.</li>
            <li> Although someone using it for the first time may not realize, until a few minutes later after you feel how clean your teeth fill.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste good at all, but most non fluoridated toothpaste tastes bad, so I expected that.</li>
            <li> Coupled with mouthwash, though, you&#x27;re in the clear.</li>
            <li> It doesnt foam or lather up like regular toothpaste so there doesnt feel like theres much between the brush and your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste asides from avoiding a lot of the harmful ingredients of common commercial toothpastes, has a clean mild mint flavor and feel.</li>
            <li> Xylitol is naturally occurring in plants, berries, etc.</li>
            <li> are the ingredients listed if anyone is interested:&lt;br /&gt;Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, sodium bicarbonate, glycerin, sorbitol, natural mint flavor, peppermint oil, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, papain, tea tree leaf oil, sodium carbonate, potassium sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be whitening, which surprised me.  </li>
            <li> Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, sodium bicarbonate, glycerin, sorbitol, natural mint flavor, peppermint oil, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, papain, tea tree leaf oil, sodium carbonate and potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tooth paste that was natural, without fluoride and would also whiten teeth.  </li>
            <li> By far the best-tasting, flouride-free toothpaste out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried thus far, but it is worth knowing I am not taxing my already fragile thyroid any further.</li>
            <li> but I found out not all natural and contains some chemicals.</li>
            <li> Natural cavity fighter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste for my daughter, age 9, who gets mouth sores frequently.</li>
            <li> All Natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have no complaints about this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but hopefully I can find it elsewhere because I paid $11 total with shipping &amp; that&#x27;s a bit much for toothpaste but</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I just had them professionally cleaned and</li>
            <li> I am allergic to glycols and toothpastes are one of the places they are in nearly every tube.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are the closest thing to natural that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work well and also has whitening without the flouride.</li>
            <li> It is a natural toothpaste, healthier than others.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive teeth caused by receding gum lines)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and experience no sensitivity when using Xyliwhite.</li>
            <li> It made my teeth ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I got interested in natural toothpastes when the dentist noticed that my son had a strange thickening of the skin inside his cheeks.  </li>
            <li> but, a finishing rinse with a little (original) Listerine will remedy that...  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad for the size and it is offered on subscribe and save with free shipping, so it is very easy to order any quantity.</li>
            <li> None of the bad and all of the good!</li>
            <li> It keeps your mouth feeling fresh longer than any other toothpaste and keeps stains off my teeth.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth clean just like the poisonous fluoride toothpaste brands, but without putting toxic industrial waste fluoride poison in my body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a quarter way through the tube, I feel I&#x27;ve used it enough to write a decent review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this one better, the taste is pleasing and it does foam up nearly as much as the Thoms making less messy.  </li>
            <li> The mint is decent while brushing, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I also would like for it to foam up a little better, but I guess that&#x27;s the compromise for having such a simple ingredient list.</li>
            <li> Unlike some whitening toothpastes that leave a strange film on teeth, this rinses very well.  </li>
            <li> The mint is not strong but strong enough.</li>
            <li> bought this toothpaste back on November 18, 2014 (and with free 2-day Prime Shipping, likely got it by the 20th or 21st) and its now March, and I&#x27;ve probably only used this toothpaste maybe a handful of times (if not less!)</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good, and feels much less caustic than normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is any better than regular toothpaste, I may have noticed a worsening of my cavities but it is hard to blame the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;s not an essential ingredient and they can remove it from a new and improved</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is not overpowering like most of the common commercial brands.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like any ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My teeth are generally very sensitive, especially when i use whitening agents.</li>
            <li> every time I make a major order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time to get away from the major brand chemically produced products.</li>
            <li> These types of products have certainly come a long way and this is clearly a 21st century product.</li>
            <li> The tubes are large and one tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for X-rays, bad for continued exposure.</li>
            <li> I have been using fluoride free toothpaste to protect my thyroid gland (I have hypothyroidism) from the negative effects of fluoride, which was once used to treat overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).  </li>
            <li> what else can be said, the primary reason I purchased it was to avoid fluoride and other chemicals that come with other brands.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a clear gel that resembles petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> I did not read the description closely enough and was surprised when I got it that this was a gel not a paste.  </li>
            <li> The minty flavor is not very pronounced and the toothpaste does not feel very &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; but closer to a gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teenage and preteen boys who use tea tree oil (and lavender, another estrogenic \\&quot;health\\&quot; product) have developed female breasts, which take months to go away after you stop using estrogenic products.  </li>
            <li> guess some people want the all-natural feel of having just brushed their teeth naturally with dirt of moss or something, but my wife hoped for something that would make her breath feel and smell</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to a sensitive toothpaste and I am grateful for the relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Growing up, I always used to purchase Arm-and-Hammer toothpaste because I craved that foaming action and taste only baking-soda based toothpastes can provide.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY downfall has been getting over the lack of foaming action, which took about a week for me.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ve seen any actual whitening, but it is the only fluoride and SLS free toothpaste</li>
            <li> The paste isn&#x27;t very grainy like other brands.</li>
            <li> Though I deducted a star, taste is secondary - I want clean, and this delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (me and my younger son are fans of their thieves toothpaste), but we recently ran out and Young Living has all of their toothpastes out of stock...</li>
            <li> like the peppermint flavor, although it did taste a little salty at first (from the baking soda),</li>
            <li> It freshens your breath more than ordinary toothpaste, and is less frothy in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Still, just because it lacks the foam doesn&#x27;t mean it lacks the clean.</li>
            <li> Now, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad or anything, but it&#x27;s really super mild, almost to the point where you feel like you have to rinse, whereas with other tooth cleansers you feel the minty freshness right away,</li>
            <li> Though at the beginning it tastes a little bit weird, you will absolutely like it after a week!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Compared to other toothpastes I feel like this one really whitens my teeth and in a short time period.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because it was SLS Free, but if you look at the other comments it has another irritant just as harsh as SLS.&lt;br /&gt;It irritated my gums and gave me sores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first few times you use this you will be undoubtadly be turned off by the taste.</li>
            <li> is my first go round of this product/brand</li>
            <li> The gel tastes like pure baking soda with a slight hint of mint.  </li>
            <li> once you start brushing your teeth, it becomes very runny, and dribbles down your chin.</li>
            <li> And for everyone who hasn&#x27;t down their homework: Xylitol is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is a huge step-up from other former toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp; Earthpaste: which is a total scam); see my previous review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but the flavor is weak.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste cleans very well with a soft mint flavor, that sadly doesn&#x27;t lasts for a long time (that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like), but what I do like is the jelly texture and the clean sensation that leaves in my teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li> After a few formula changes and a bad reaction, I can no longer use the more widely available product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth minty taste; that doesn&#x27;t taste artificially made but provides real, sustainability to ones mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste because I was tired of putting a hazardous waste (fluoride) in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very minty and has a very slight baking soda taste to it, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> be used with some other natural remedies.</li>
            <li> Also, oddly enough, my teeth feel like they are freshly brushed all day long.  </li>
            <li> They say it is impossible to build enamel, I am not so sure anymore!  </li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw that Amazon was offering the same product for less.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus it was a good bit less expensive than some of the other brands she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> so each one will last long.  </li>
            <li> I saw no major difference in taste or use</li>
            <li> Not a major issue.</li>
            <li> Way better than the nasty chemical filled products.</li>
            <li> and i noticed my mouth doesnt get dry 10 minutes later like with colgate or even sensodyne.</li>
            <li> have healthy teeth and for over a year I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity of my teeth which use to happen often especially with cold drinks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bacteria on my tongue has appeared to markedly decrease; considerably less to remove with a tongue scraper.  </li>
            <li> The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit clear.</li>
            <li> That surprised me a little, but it makes no difference.</li>
            <li> but sadly doesn&#x27;t clean teeth well enough even after a longer blush time.</li>
            <li> the taste doesn&#x27;t taste like artificial mint and it doesnt leave an overwhelming flavor in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have dangerous chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> teeth are whiter now than they&#x27;ve ever been in a long time</li>
            <li> not very sudsy and had to tell if it actually works.</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face&#x27;s Triple Action Toothpaste]] (which seems to be a few dollars cheaper in some brick &amp; mortar stores than on Amazon) or some of the \\&quot;Nature</li>
            <li> Kiss My Face&#x27;s Triple Action Toothpaste]] (which seems to be a few dollars cheaper in some brick &amp; mortar stores than on Amazon) or some of the \\&quot;Nature</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m certainly never going back to fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the lack of &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34;, I am a regular coffee drinker so this was important, also because I have sensitive teeth, I needed to stop using this since there wasn&#x27;t made for this issue.  </li>
            <li> I had the same experience as other reviewers.</li>
            <li> However, since NOW omits foaming agents such as sulfites/sulfates and all the other garbage companies put in their products, I will deal with it.</li>
            <li> No more pain from sweet, hot or cold.</li>
            <li> all day long!</li>
            <li> oddly enough my little sister commented that my teeth were white (?!)</li>
            <li> This one is mint but next time I want to try the other flavor.</li>
            <li> like somebody else was saying, it doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth very long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my mouth like Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Dabur Meswak toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you think you need foam or soapy bubbles to clean your teeth, you are wrong.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste also has another sugar based ingredient called &amp;#34;sorbitol&amp;#34; used to lower dry mouth.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later she was told the same thing by her dental hygienist, so</li>
            <li> Further proof--an unsightly blackhead turned white pus-filled pimple that&#x27;s been lingering for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> After a while, I couldn&#x27;t drink cold water when it&#x27;s so hot where I live.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because I do not use a single brand all the time.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, but that was my own oversight.  </li>
            <li> but my wife went back to her previous toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth will stay minty for less time than regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i think it doesn&#x27;t do much for long lasting breath freshness and the whitening power is questionable as well.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you though, this is a good toothpaste alternative to the typical fluoride ridden crap sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you want a toothpaste that&#x27;s natural with less of the bad ingredients, this product will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars only because it tends to get a little watery while brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having done a little research on fluoride and finding how it might be detrimental to your health (especially when disclaimers on fluoride products state that you should seek help immediately if you swallow it, and that it could be linked to canker sores), I decided to make the switch to a xylitol product.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t need fluoride in anything, it&#x27;s terrible and will rot your brain, hence this great toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had them, canker sores are much more painful than you can guess.</li>
            <li> Only one person complained that it did not have enough flavor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and there is a definite whitening effect.</li>
            <li> Careful you don&#x27;t drip on clothing because this will lighten what it touches.</li>
            <li> I will see after the tube is empty.  </li>
            <li> Really, no pun intended.  </li>
            <li> In this case carrageenan is used to hold the ingredients together, the quantity is minimal and you shouldn&#x27;t be swallowing or eating your toothpaste anyways</li>
            <li> and I said no thanks.  </li>
            <li> worse than the taste, this stuff gets VERY watery.</li>
            <li> So i started doing some research and found that maybe the fluoride was actually causing the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased another famous brand of natural toothpaste in the past, and was disappointed to find flouride in its ingredients.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that bitter salty sort of taste that may be an arm and Hammer does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the labels on toothpaste carefully.</li>
            <li> This one has absolutely no problem with that</li>
            <li> Compared to other pastes, it has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the MOST VILE and DISGUSTING toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used -- and before going organic and trying to avoid/reduce/eliminate toxic chemicals &amp; additives, I used to use (a fairly long time ago)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you that fresh wow minty feeling in your mouth however :(  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately most of the flouride free toothpastes out there--if you can even find them--taste bad; and they have SLS, a terrible chemical that causes certain people (like me) to suffer canker sores.</li>
            <li> A few seconds into brushing, I have to tip my head back so it doesn&#x27;t dribble down my face.</li>
            <li> I am perfectly aware of the fact that the foam isn&#x27;t what cleans my mouth, but am so irreversibly addicted to having that feeling that I couldn&#x27;t help but feel I had to use ridiculous amounts of toothpaste every time I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Why use the other tooth pastes that have all the stuff you DON&#x27;T need in them?</li>
            <li> It actually comes out of the tube like a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitens as well if not better than any other whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that sounds crazy but this toothpaste has done wonders for me and I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Xyliwhite flavors.</li>
            <li> well as other brands-</li>
            <li> Returned, didn&#x27;t even use it due to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use Crest, Colgate or other mainstream marketed toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I wish it would foam up like the other brands that have flouride, but I can deal with it, considering it is one of the safest out there.  </li>
            <li> As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases.</li>
            <li> With nothing to lose and reading other reviews of Xyliwhite, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> yet he will use other minty ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a texture issue for me but its competitive in price to other brands</li>
            <li> compared to when I used other toothpaste products.  </li>
            <li> Trying to avoid harmful fluoride, SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), parabens and other toxins, I bought [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> There are very very few toothpastes left with no flouride.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine the taste is very strange and bland if you are used to using typical colgate sort of toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Not very sweet, which I like about this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a toothpaste that was free of chemicals that was not super expensive.  </li>
            <li> I want to get sick when I have a toothpaste that is so strong</li>
            <li> I switched from conventional toothpaste to this brand to avoid fluoride</li>
            <li> Baking soda is a gentle dentifrice, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> The baking soda ruins this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve been fighting recurring canker sores (aphthous ulcers) and most of us know how painful they can be.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for 17yr old son who keeps us poor at the dentist office.  </li>
            <li> tastes really bad and doesn&#x27;t keep my breath very fresh</li>
            <li> I mean the white minty foam that toothpastes with SLS produce.</li>
            <li> My older daughter suffers from ailments resulting from unadequate US medical care (such as diagnostic services), fluoride in the water and other factors stemming from unhealthy nutrition politics in this country.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR DOGS - SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using this toothpaste for brushing my dogs&#x27; teeth.  </li>
            <li> Bland compared to Toms.</li>
            <li> I had rashes from using a flouride toothpaste previously</li>
            <li> I have a lot less plaque and tartar.</li>
            <li> I had what I guess was receding gum lines, with slight cavities at the gum line that looked like crevices.</li>
            <li> They preach fluoride around the office and I am the odd ball who stays away from it.</li>
            <li> about 5 or 6 weeks after I started using it my hygienist kept saying, &amp;#34;What have you been doing, your teeth almost have no plaque&amp;#34; That was using it for less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> Also, one previous reviewer mentioned using a generous amount on your toothbrush</li>
            <li> which is probably what I&#x27;m used to in previous toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have SLS so its consistency is going to be runnier than normal as it is, but the baking soda turns this into a slipper soap water once you start brushing rendering it useless in the mouth.</li>
            <li> This does not contain fluoride which is not good for you, especially if you have thyroid disease.</li>
            <li> If you feel fluoride helps, you are right, If you think it is poisonous and a communist plot, you are very wrong</li>
            <li> Watery, thin when start using, not fresh enough.  </li>
            <li> I use a sonicare toothbrush, and like to let the paste sit on my teeth for a little bit before rinsing.</li>
            <li> it will take a little getting use to if you have always used the name brands because this will not foam in your mouth &amp; you can taste the baking soda</li>
            <li> This stuff takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> of course you can taste the baking soda a little bit, but for me that is a plus.</li>
            <li> she also didn&#x27;t like that there was little &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34</li>
            <li> BUT it does give you little tongue sores after use.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a little baking soda to give it a little grit.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy him the garbage in the stores as the pastes are so gritty and very hard to find anything without fluoride.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not filled with fluoride.</li>
            <li> few Xyliwhite toothaste</li>
            <li> It may take a few days to adjust to this toothpaste&#x27;s mildness, but after a while I started to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> reviews mentioned this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam, which took me a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a few months now</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and dentist tried to prescribe this expensive toothpaste for me</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste a few years ago.</li>
            <li> im brushing my teeth with natural ingredients instead of questionable chemicals.</li>
            <li> am still using this stuff, because I do not believe in waste (I&#x27;m almost done with it...).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months, I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity in my mouth</li>
            <li> we say heavy metal residue?  </li>
            <li> Whatever abrasives they are using are wayyyy too harsh.</li>
            <li> Plus in the few months I used it I ended up having a cavity when I went to the dentist for a check up.</li>
            <li> Make this your everyday toothpaste for life</li>
            <li> , just wish Colgate had not soiled the latter with their completely unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> All the right ingredients and none of the bad.  </li>
            <li> Instead of making you feel clean, you feel dirty with worse smelling breath.  </li>
            <li> My 6 years can use it because it&#x27;s has no strong taste.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and I don&#x27;t mind the taste even though I hate mint.  </li>
            <li> Less toothpaste and less packaging convenience and NO HAZARDOUS WASTE!</li>
            <li> European counties have actually banned fluoride years ago because of bad health effects.</li>
            <li> It makes it a little hard to rub into your teeth at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A biopsy was performed which came back negative, but the dentist said he was probably sensitive to some of the nasty chemicals used in traditional toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Since we began using this product, none of us have had any cavities and very little tarter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that flouride has harmful effects on our teeth and body even in the small amounts</li>
            <li> Between spitting it out when brushing &amp; not being crazy sensitive,  it does not effect me.  </li>
            <li> Messy!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;There are none so blind as those that will not see!&amp;#34; It sells is the only reason they make non-fluoridated toothpaste but SLS (soap is the danger and why you are told not to swallow toothpaste).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if it will protect my teeth as well as Fluoride toothpaste, since I&#x27;m prone to cavities over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this tooth paste for the past 6 years</li>
            <li> I HAD USED IN THE PAST.</li>
            <li> : if you purchase this through Prime pantry it&#x27;s usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whitening ability though.</li>
            <li> We usually use Earthpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer anxious about those appointments.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient was causing this</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can say</li>
            <li> Left a weird taste in our mouths after brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth squeaky clean without all the nasty chemicals like in your conventional store toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it was some sort of chemical in the other brands that was irritating my throat.</li>
            <li> The taste is generally not very strong.  </li>
            <li> , however I can say that I don&#x27;t notice any negative effects of it yet</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has brightened my teeth by at least three shades whiter than they were before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still got canker sores with this toothpaste and felt it actually got worse when using this.  </li>
            <li> I tried another brand (not Tom&#x27;s) of non-fluoride toothpaste that was very disappointing, particularly in how hard it was to squeeze out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> Wine, blueberries, grape juice and other things cause stains that are stubborn and difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> know what I mean).</li>
            <li> I purchased this because, per ounce, it&#x27;s less expensive than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase after this tube is gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive &amp; NO flouride.</li>
            <li> This product is much less expensive and leaves my teeth feeling</li>
            <li> I have a serious issue with any toothpaste having fluoride or any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> You can definitely taste the saltiness of the baking soda over the mint, but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because it has ingredients that I don&#x27;t feel weird about putting into my mouth everyday.</li>
            <li> I was so sick of fluoride toothpaste not working, I finally made the switch to Xyliwhite after reading about the benefits of xylitol for teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t brush very hard...</li>
            <li> It gets the job done without a bunch of unnecessary chemicals, plus I like the feel and the taste.</li>
            <li> leaves a coat behind on the teeth, does not go in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have no clue why, but it was getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> Then I learned about all the crap in regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MUCH worse than the Crest.</li>
            <li> Does not have lauryl sulfate or other bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> So after some research on fluoride and how bad it supposedly is and being someone who suffers from canker sores i decided to search for an alternative to regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m not a fan of baking soda pastes because I hate the taste.</li>
            <li> I guess I was so used to using the other crap.  </li>
            <li> Looking for an SLS-free toothpaste is difficult.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s in a lot of so-called \\&quot;health\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Do a bit of homework on flouride&#x27;s nasty effects on the human body and you will never EVER use fouride toothpaste</li>
            <li> It is a gel with a weird taste that stays in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Another issue I had was it was difficult to brush my teeth without me getting a gag reflex.</li>
            <li> it does not taste chemically or smell weird.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel wary of drinking water after brushing as I do with fluoridated toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I am sorry for you, and</li>
            <li> All other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried either taste like chemicals, are ineffective, or taste awful.  </li>
            <li> Toothpaste with other artificial sweeteners have a nasty aftertaste</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with this yucky toothpaste, its IMPOSSIBLE for me to figure it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> It tastes like a mix of menthol and triaminic cold medicine.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disappointing...</li>
            <li> heard fluoride is actually destructive to your teeth, so I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to eliminate that nasty aftertaste that you usually get from toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Very wrong.  </li>
            <li> it Doesnt taste bad.</li>
            <li> you are someone with naturally bad breath</li>
            <li> Not to bad.</li>
            <li> my breathe is not as bad either -as</li>
            <li> I do believe the Xylitol is killing germs that make you sick.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that Tom&#x27;s of Maine contains SLS.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HATE going to the dentist,</li>
            <li> and I HATE</li>
            <li> I cannot change your belief; and you probably hate dental treatment for you and your kids, and the costs.  </li>
            <li> but it has a minty flavor and none of the crap that you don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> and you would think that with our savvy technological advances, they could come up with a safer, non-sodium-sulfate cleansing base at this point--)..</li>
            <li> I switched as I get very bad canker sores and wanted to avoid toothpastes with SLS.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use whitening strips because it becomes very painful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed it this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the worst tasting toothpastes that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The taste is nasty.  </li>
            <li> Hate it, ughhhhhh!!!  </li>
            <li> To me, it tastes nasty.</li>
            <li> But put together nasty and watery....forget about it.</li>
            <li> potassium fluoride&#x3D;the worst for your teeth and bones ;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;0</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it, teeth feel clean and fresh. Doesn&#x27;t make foam as regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done without a bunch of unnecessary chemicals, plus I like the feel and the taste.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this; it&#x27;s a much stronger minty taste than the &amp;#34;Refreshmint&amp;#34; flavor, which is great for our young kids.</li>
            <li> Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Toothpaste, Platinum Mint, 6.4-Ounces: Good all around natural toothpaste.  The taste is generally not very strong.  It is not gritty.  It does not generate alot of foam like toothpastes with detergents in them.  This version does not have fluoride in it.  I do use  a fluoride rinse with it.  At $3.99 for a 6.4 ounce tube it is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste, severely allergic to lots of chemicals/preservatives found in toothpaste, makeup, etc.  This is an excellent toothpaste, great taste, gentle and with whitening.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that Tom&#x27;s of Maine contains SLS. Not only do I like the ingredients, taste, and feel of this toothpaste, my daughter loves it (which is very important to me!). She&#x27;s convinced it makes her teeth whiter, which really motivates her to brush. :-)</li>
            <li> No fluoride in this toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Great taste and cleans well.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> works well.. some ingredients I would rather not use..  Price could be cheaper</li>
            <li> Works great. Whitens right on wth spot.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR DOGS - SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using this toothpaste for brushing my dogs&#x27; teeth.  It did work well, BUT, I just learned that Xylitol is TOXIC to dogs and can poison and/or kill a dog.  So, if you are looking for a fluoride-free toothpaste for your dogs, please do not choose a toothpaste with Xylitol in it as you will be doing your dog more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste so much!</li>
            <li> It has no fluoride! The taste doesn&#x27;t suck either. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste that I have found.  It keeps your mouth feeling fresh longer than any other toothpaste and keeps stains off my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is an overall good toothpaste, especially for being gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you&#x27;ve never had gluten-free toothpaste before, you must know it is not as smooth as a gluten or chemical-filled gel. It makes it a little hard to rub into your teeth at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also, if you get some on your tongue before you get brushing, it is very salty. Once you brush it in, the saltiness is replaced (more like overpowered) with a peppermint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It does its job, but like somebody else was saying, it doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth very long. I kind of wonder what good it does long-term, such as overnight. Does it help &amp;#34;fight&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; plaque like chemical toothpastes? Honestly, probably not. It almost dissolves on your teeth as you brush it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Nice toothpaste but you might as well use baking soda in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean feeling, helped my gums to stop bleeding</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised...it&#x27;s toothpaste what else can be said, the primary reason I purchased it was to avoid fluoride and other chemicals that come with other brands.</li>
            <li> I love being able to brush my teeth without fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils are also great for your health.  Look them up!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m having a good experience with it. I do recommend it, simply for not having fluoride in it it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> My older daughter suffers from ailments resulting from unadequate US medical care (such as diagnostic services), fluoride in the water and other factors stemming from unhealthy nutrition politics in this country. I am happy that all of my children won&#x27;t be exposed to any more fluoride than they&#x27;ve already inadvertedly consumed. Besides, my 10 year old loves the fresh non-burning taste of this toothpaste and brushes her teeth more diligently. She told me she thinks her teeth look whiter after brushng with this stuff. It might be of course just the result of not actually avoiding brushing her teeth any longer.</li>
            <li> good product,,good combination of ingredients,,</li>
            <li> I have been using XyliWhite for over a year now because it is one of the only options that is SLS and Flouride free. Also, there is new evidence that xylitol can support your dental health well. I use a sonicare toothbrush, and like to let the paste sit on my teeth for a little bit before rinsing. The mint taste is mild. When I develop some tooth pain, I use this toothpaste a little more often and it cures my pain! It&#x27;s pretty amazing. You can catch it on sale at local stores every now and again (I just got mine for $2.99).</li>
            <li> My favorite flouride free toothpaste so far. Feels really fresh.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dentist</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste, dentist recommend the product to my wife. We are both happy with it.</li>
            <li> I did not read the description closely enough and was surprised when I got it that this was a gel not a paste.  Disappointed, but that was my own oversight.  Good value (big tube for the price) and I like the taste, but I cannot use it more than once per day, it made my teeth VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and there is a definite whitening effect. It&#x27;s very minty and has a very slight baking soda taste to it, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> Bland compared to Toms. But still a great vegan toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Nice fresh taste. Can&#x27;t do without this toothpaste anymore!</li>
            <li> They flavor is just a teeny bit off, but I like that it is not filled with fluoride.</li>
            <li> I prefer toothpaste that lathers more.  The taste is great.  But I need more lather.</li>
            <li> I luv this toothpaste.  I highly recommend to anyone that don&#x27;t a lot of chemicals in their toothpaste but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my mouth like Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Dabur Meswak toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Awesome, natural toothpaste. Does not have lauryl sulfate or other bad ingredients. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and healthy. Use with oregano oil as a mouth wash. Together they got rid of my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> leaves a coat behind on the teeth, does not go in between the teeth. Because it does not have foam, the paste does not go in between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;meaning if your brush your teeth every day with this, the gum will start swelling up in between the teeth and bleed.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I love that it is all natural. It makes my teeth very white and my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without the fluoride!</li>
            <li> Gift for my vegan son.</li>
            <li> fourth or fifth tube  great toothpaste</li>
            <li> Good bye Crest, Colgate, et al.  I only wish I knew of this product sooner.  My teeth and my health thank you</li>
            <li> I was happy with the toothpaste at first. After using for two days, the inside of my lips began to swell. So I am guessing I am allergic to something in the toothpaste. I finally found my toothpaste truthpaste.</li>
            <li> Love 100% fluoride free toothpaste best tasting one they have imo</li>
            <li> Best Toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good taste and it works in cleaning and whitening ones teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to gradually remove plaque in areas I could never before&lt;br /&gt;from years of trying flouride toothpaste like Colgate, Pepsodent, Aim etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, it seemed as though using those products were weakening my teeth&lt;br /&gt;and they seemed to be adding plaque to my teeth. Which justified the fact to me&lt;br /&gt;that flouride has harmful effects on our teeth and body even in the small amounts&lt;br /&gt;in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Xyliwhite toothpaste for almost two months now, I must say that&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to flouride toothpaste again- and I don&#x27;t think I will&lt;br /&gt;need another brand of non-flouride toothpaste either. Which is why I will keep ordering&lt;br /&gt;a few Xyliwhite toothaste every time I make a major order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are whiter now than they&#x27;ve ever been in a long time and I think they are getting&lt;br /&gt;whiter still: they also feel stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it wasn&#x27;t just an add-on item though...would not mind buying some of this in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s that good. And what&#x27;s more: $3.99 is a very great price that I can afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep evaluating this product. So far, it&#x27;s brought positive results and I look forward&lt;br /&gt;to more positive from continued use.</li>
            <li> The flavor is ok, but it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth feel clean. I prefer Jason&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works Great taste good it will take a little getting use to if you have always used the name brands because this will not foam in your mouth &amp; you can taste the baking soda but there is a great mint flavor &amp; it leaves my teeth feeling so clean !! I love it &amp; would recommend it to anyone who wants a safer way to brush ;)</li>
            <li> Love this natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Works well. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> WOW! These are the only words I can think of to describe how I feel about this product. I have tried many things to make my teeth whiter and this product has made my teeth SO much whiter. When people ask what I am using I always highly recommended this! Way better than the nasty chemical filled products.</li>
            <li> Thought i&#x27;d give this toothpaste a shot and I am glad I did. It tastes great and really helps me maintain whiter teeth without a bunch of chemicals in it! Really enjoy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of toothpaste that foams up or bubbles up when brushing my teeth but this product does not do that. It does not foam up. Minty factor is just ok. Doesn&#x27;t give you that fresh wow minty feeling in your mouth however :(  I noticed that it does minimize morning breath a lil bit better than other brands. Maybe the baking soda. If you want a toothpaste that&#x27;s natural with less of the bad ingredients, this product will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> So after some research on fluoride and how bad it supposedly is and being someone who suffers from canker sores i decided to search for an alternative to regular toothpaste.  These tubes came packaged nicely and they are quite big tubes so each one will last long.  The gel tastes like pure baking soda with a slight hint of mint.  It doesnt foam or lather up like regular toothpaste so there doesnt feel like theres much between the brush and your teeth.  it Doesnt taste bad. At first it doesnt feel clean and minty like regular toothpaste but for some reason after you brush and rinse, your mouth feels amazingly clean and i noticed my mouth doesnt get dry 10 minutes later like with colgate or even sensodyne. I find that using a toothbrush full makes the experience better.  Dont skimp on it.</li>
            <li> Taste isn&#x27;t great but other than that its really good for basic whitening . I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent, effective product. I tried &amp;#34;health food store&amp;#34; toothpastes years ago and they didn&#x27;t work well. These types of products have certainly come a long way and this is clearly a 21st century product. The mint is not strong but strong enough. Careful you don&#x27;t drip on clothing because this will lighten what it touches. I now buy it regularly as my toothpaste of choice. Much, much better than conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpaste. Purchased for 17yr old son who keeps us poor at the dentist office.  I hope it helps.  He won&#x27;t use my homemade toothpaste, so this is the best second choice.  I won&#x27;t buy him the garbage in the stores as the pastes are so gritty and very hard to find anything without fluoride.</li>
            <li> I am in my second tube of this toothpaste and am reviewing it now. This toothpaste asides from avoiding a lot of the harmful ingredients of common commercial toothpastes, has a clean mild mint flavor and feel. The minty flavor is not very pronounced and the toothpaste does not feel very &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; but closer to a gel. It may take a few days to adjust to this toothpaste&#x27;s mildness, but after a while I started to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Ok.  Watery, thin when start using, not fresh enough.  Fresher than Tom&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve used better than both.  If I could remember the name I&#x27;d put it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite toothpastes!  Great mild taste/flavor which doesn&#x27;t overpower like so many other toothpastes and no fluoride which is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I like it, no chemical in my mouth and taste great!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  I have been using it for a while now and when I recently had my cleaning and check up my dentist said there were no problems.  Why use the other tooth pastes that have all the stuff you DON&#x27;T need in them?</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as other reviewers. I&#x27;m allergic to this toothpaste which surprised me because I don&#x27;t normally have allergies.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but my body doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toothpaste. My husband and I really like it.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Like the taste and feel of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> iam a fan of free of flouride, i have been using this toothpaste for a month now and i love it will buy more when run out.</li>
            <li> the flavor is an intense peppermint</li>
            <li> I would recommend who wants to buy natural non-chemical toothpaste to their family. We like to taste and you feel clean and fresh .....</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems over the years with sore mouth and even mouth ulcers when I use many of the commonly available commercial toothpastes, especially that gel types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to eat unrefined foods and eliminate added sugar.  I have been using this toothpaste as part of my healthy living plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had a routine dental checkup, there was no dental work to be done and the dentist and technician both commented that my teeth and gums are very healthy and better than at my previous check up.  I can&#x27;t tell you that the improvement is entirely due to this toothpaste (I am sure eliminating sugar had something to do with it) but using Xyliwhite does not cause me any mourh discomfort and  I will continue to  brush with it!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! Does its job and tastes great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 2 months and I love it! I had rashes from using a flouride toothpaste previously (I&#x27;m allergic to them) and the rashes went away within a few days of switching to xyliwhite. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the peppermint flavor, although it did taste a little salty at first (from the baking soda), but I got used to it really fast and don&#x27;t even notice it now. I like the flavor of the platinum mint much better than the refreshmint (more of a spearmint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviews mentioned this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam, which took me a few days to get used to. However, my teeth felt super clean after the very first use. The lack of &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; does not bother me at all now.</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Xylitol toothpaste I have had great checkups at the dentist to the point of the hygienist saying, wow there is no tarter on your teeth even below the gums, you&#x27;re doing great.</li>
            <li> We like this flavor the best. Freshens better.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst tasting toothpastes that I have ever used.  It tastes like a mix of menthol and triaminic cold medicine.  Looking for an SLS-free toothpaste is difficult.  I purchased this because, per ounce, it&#x27;s less expensive than Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase after this tube is gone.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste cleans very well with a soft mint flavor, that sadly doesn&#x27;t lasts for a long time (that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like), but what I do like is the jelly texture and the clean sensation that leaves in my teeth and mouth. It&#x27;s a great alternative for the comercial toothpaste. 100% recommended!!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste came on time. It was packaged well. This cleaned my teeth well. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Seemed to clean OK but I could not get used to the flavor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tooth paste. what do you want me to say?</li>
            <li> Very nice flavor.  Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product, but stopped when Learned that it contains tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil may be fine for women, but according to a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine, it&#x27;s highly estrogenic and can lead to feminization and lack of sex drive in males.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s in a lot of so-called \\&quot;health\\&quot; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teenage and preteen boys who use tea tree oil (and lavender, another estrogenic \\&quot;health\\&quot; product) have developed female breasts, which take months to go away after you stop using estrogenic products.  If I were a parent, I would not allow my children to use any product containing tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very good at whitening, but the flavour is pleasant and it does a good job getting your teeth clean without all the extra chemicals and junk that you find in most toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I always prefer fluoride free toothpaste. This one cleans my teeth and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed. The price isn&#x27;t bad for the size and it is offered on subscribe and save with free shipping, so it is very easy to order any quantity. Now Foods is a great quality brand too!</li>
            <li> been using this non-fluoride toothpaste for a while and now I don&#x27;t like to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Xylitol has awesome dental benefits, and this formula has baking soda as well, very good toothpaste</li>
            <li> tastes great, easy to brush with, have not gone to the dentist since started brushing so no info on that. I bought it because of reviews and it is fluoride free and free of poison ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural toothpaste that leaves me with a clean feeling. I&#x27;ve also tried Toms of Maine and Jason&#x27;s naturals. Out of the three, I like this one the best. I have it four stars though because it could be &amp;#34;mintier.&amp;#34; I also don&#x27;t notice any of the whitening power it&#x27;s supposed to have.</li>
            <li> A great toothpaste.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. No overpowering taste. Unlike some whitening toothpastes that leave a strange film on teeth, this rinses very well.  I don&#x27;t know about whiter teeth, but it sure brightens my teeth. I will see after the tube is empty.  I gave it four stars only because it tends to get a little watery while brushing. However, since NOW omits foaming agents such as sulfites/sulfates and all the other garbage companies put in their products, I will deal with it.</li>
            <li> great tasting, great ingredients and fluoride free, thank you now foods for providing us a safe alternative to commercial fluoride toothpastes</li>
            <li> It actually comes out of the tube like a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitens as well if not better than any other whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works pretty good. My dental hygenist told me my gums have improved since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh breath</li>
            <li> The tubing came busted so when I squeeze the tooth paste comes out the top and bottom of the tube. I expected better quality packaging since the tooth paste is of great quality and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking two stars away for packaging</li>
            <li> The hardest part in finding a good non-fluoride toothpaste is finding one that tastes well and leaves your breath smelling clean and fresh.  I&#x27;ve tried several others, but this toothpaste is the best so far.  Pleasant taste and my mouth feels clean after using it.  Would recommend to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like ingesting sodium fluoride.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a life changer, Before switching to this I had recurring mouth sores. Not now. It also tastes great and cleans well, my teeth were also sensitive and with this toothpaste that&#x27;s not been a problem either. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m a quarter way through the tube, I feel I&#x27;ve used it enough to write a decent review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having done a little research on fluoride and finding how it might be detrimental to your health (especially when disclaimers on fluoride products state that you should seek help immediately if you swallow it, and that it could be linked to canker sores), I decided to make the switch to a xylitol product. Xylitol is naturally occurring in plants, berries, etc. and is used as a diabetic sweetener too. It also can&#x27;t be used as an energy source by the bacteria found in your mouth, and that&#x27;s how it helps to keep the cavities at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently switching from Crest Herbal Mint liquid gel toothpase, the flavor of this toothpaste is fairly mild. I also noticed that I use about 30% more toothpaste per brush than I did before, but that might be because I&#x27;m used to the bubbling and foaming of my old toothpaste. This product is more like brushing your teeth with baking soda, where it seems like you might need more, but you probably don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients listed if anyone is interested:&lt;br /&gt;Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, sodium bicarbonate, glycerin, sorbitol, natural mint flavor, peppermint oil, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, papain, tea tree leaf oil, sodium carbonate, potassium sorbate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;TL/DR: Great alternative to fluoride, but lacking in the taste department.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this and has for almost two years. We love that is fluoride free. We&#x27;ve never had any compliants from our dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. No fluoride and tastes great.  Just use like regular toothpaste. Great for reducing unwanted chemicals in your body. It costs a little more than regular toothpaste, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. We&#x27;ll continue using this product. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes a little getting used to but after a week or so I noticed that my teeth are much cleaner than they were when I used the &amp;#34;major&amp;#34; brand toothpastes. I have a lot less plaque and tartar. It does not foam up but has a nice minty flavor without being too sweet like some others.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste. I&#x27;d been using it for years already and my visits to the dentist has been bloodless.</li>
            <li> Used a tub and am now using a tub of Tom&#x27;s of Maine. I haven&#x27;t noticed any differences in my mouth between this and the tub of Tom&#x27;s. Xyliwhite tastes a lot nicer though so I might switch back. Definitely feels a lot nicer and tastes better than stuff like Crest though which is so sickly sweet tasting.</li>
            <li> It works cleans my teeth. Deduct one star for flavor not lasting one, star for price. I have purchased two tubes of this product and use  it to avoid acute toxicity of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 95% of the toothpaste sold in the U.S. now contains fluoride, with many grocery stores carrying few if any non-fluoridated brands. The use of fluoride toothpaste, particularly during early childhood, presents health risks. This is why the FDA requires a poison warning on every tube of fluoride toothpaste now sold in the US.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite natural toothpaste. I use it but the lack of foam bothers me and the flavor is so soi think i like Jasons better.</li>
            <li> Okay, truth be told, this is not the best tasting toothpaste I have ever had.  Just spitting it out.  Really, no pun intended.  But... I really like this paste.  I have gotten used to the taste.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.  It is easy to work with.  It seems to be whitening, which surprised me.  The price is worth the value, to me.  As long as this is available, I will keep buying this paste.</li>
            <li> Good product - light taste - no strong &amp;#34;after brush&amp;#34; feeling in your mouth to ruin the taste of foods (if you brush during the day - I do!)</li>
            <li> This is a natural toothpaste that from my research didnt appear to have any offensive or hazardous ingredients. Tastes good and works just like a toothpaste would.</li>
            <li> Amazing, makes teeth super white, without hurting the enamel.</li>
            <li> a good tooth paste if you was baking Soda toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have expensive veneers on my top teeth and need my bottom teeth to match.  I bought this because I am switching all my body products to those with healthier ingredients - no fluoride or xenoestrogens… Everyone&#x27;s mouth chemistry is different but this has whitened my teeth better than any other thing I have tried.  However it does have tee tree oil which I just learned is a phytoestrogen meaning it can block receptor sites for real estrogen and contribute to estrogen build up in your body. (see estrogen dominance)  I will look for a paste with no tea tree oil and use this after I know my estrogen is back in balance.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t need fluoride in anything, it&#x27;s terrible and will rot your brain, hence this great toothpaste.  Google around to read more about the fluoride bs.  We really don&#x27;t need any toothpaste at all, but that&#x27;s another story.</li>
            <li> Title says it all. I Love this toothpaste, even though people with Perioral Dermatitis aren&#x27;t supposed to use mint toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste!  The flavor is fantastic, not sugary like most toothpastes.  And it definitely does whiten the teeth.  My 83 year old grandmother with failing vision was even able to tell that my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> I use it because it doesn&#x27;t have any toxic fluoride in it. Keeping it natural!</li>
            <li> Our favorite toothpaste, Xyliwhite is minty but not too strong even for our 4yo.  Leaves a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  All other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried either taste like chemicals, are ineffective, or taste awful.  This toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean.  Also, I like that it has only natural ingredients and still tastes amazing!</li>
            <li> Platinum mint is better then XyliWhite&#x27;s other toothpaste, refreshmint.  It does great in terms of flavor but negative points when it comes to staying power.  Though it holds together better then refreshmint, it still doesn&#x27;t stick around by the time you&#x27;re actually done brushing your teeth.  A better healthy alterative is Tom&#x27;s of Maine propolis &amp; myrrh.   That toothpaste has great flavor and sticks with brushing your teeth to the point you&#x27;re done.    Those interested in knowing the ingredients to this product:    Water, xylitol, hydrated silica, sodium bicarbonate, glycerin, sorbitol, natural mint flavor, peppermint oil, sodium coco-sulfate, carrageenan, papain, tea tree leaf oil, sodium carbonate and potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li> Really good taste! Good consistency/texture. My new favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this toothpaste.  My wife has a weird allergy to some ingredient in most toothpastes.  (She isn&#x27;t really sure what ingredient.)  She finds that she can use a lot of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;lots-of-stuff free&amp;#34; kinds of toothpastes.  The problem is that many of those are pretty gross tasting, and do not leave a really freshly brushed aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess some people want the all-natural feel of having just brushed their teeth naturally with dirt of moss or something, but my wife hoped for something that would make her breath feel and smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is pretty good.  You can taste the baking soda (which isn&#x27;t the most awesome flavor) but it does have a good, strong minty taste that stays.  This is her favorite of the &#x27;natural&#x27; kinds of toothpastes she&#x27;s tried.  As a bonus it was a good bit less expensive than some of the other brands she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and better than I expected. It&#x27;s VERY minty!! Will definitely get more when the time come. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather make toothpaste with baking soda and peroxide then use this. I just can&#x27;t get over the texture. The gel doesn&#x27;t foam at all, it&#x27;s like rubbing over your teeth, rather then cleaning them. Wish I liked it more :(</li>
            <li> I order this for my whole family on subscription with Amazon.  I have great smiles and they are brighter now!</li>
            <li> i really like this product!  it tastes good and works great!</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying that I&#x27;m very picky about toothpaste.  For some reason, most brands of toothpaste give me a sore throat when I lay down after brushing my teeth.  My wife bought me several type of toothpaste before we found this one.  I&#x27;m guessing it was some sort of chemical in the other brands that was irritating my throat.</li>
            <li> I prefer the spearmint flavor, but i absolutely love this toothpaste. it&#x27;s more whitening than your retail pastes (perhaps excluding arm and hammer advanced white for sensitive teeth, which i don&#x27;t think exists anymore). It&#x27;s fluoride-free, and wonderful. My teeth are generally very sensitive, especially when i use whitening agents. I can&#x27;t use whitening strips because it becomes very painful. This toothpaste feels very clean and fresh, and it whitens perfectly. i love it. I recommend it to everyone, even if you don&#x27;t oppose the use of fluoride.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a xylitol convert.  As these toothpastes go, I prefer those that don&#x27;t have baking soda, and will not buy again despite price advantage. If these folks made a non-soda paste, I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating because I like the idea that it is fluoride free, that is why I purchased it, I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it seems to make your teeth feel and look clean, the downside is that it has very little mint taste and no foaming action, makes you want to use more than you need. I will probably order more because it being fluoride free as I won&#x27;t use a fluoride tooth paste anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this after doing a lot of research regarding flouride. Flouride is analogous to radiation. Great for X-rays, bad for continued exposure. This toothpaste, being flouride free, does what you would expect from toothpaste; cleans teeth.  The first few times you use this you will be undoubtadly be turned off by the taste. However the pleasant taste from main stream toothpaste is due to added chemicals, which although provide good taste, should never me ingested.  Over half way through this tube brushing twice (morning, night) and am very satisfied with the product.  Do a bit of homework on flouride&#x27;s nasty effects on the human body and you will never EVER use fouride toothpaste again.&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone with naturally bad breath this toothpaste probably won&#x27;t kick it. This is a much milder paste than others, however, for myself it works great and I am now not slowly poisoning myself from flouride!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tooth paste that was natural, without fluoride and would also whiten teeth.  I do believe I have found all three in this product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste needs a lot more Mint in it.  The taste is nasty.  However, I do like the idea of no fluoride.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale the first time, and I keep buying it. Compared to other pastes, it has minimal ingredients. Normally I&#x27;m not a fan of baking soda pastes because I hate the taste. However, this is different -- it might be the mint or Xylitol. I can still taste the soda, but it&#x27;s not so strong. My dentist is a huge fan of Xylitol and approves of the percentage in this paste.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste that leaves my breath minty fresh and teeth bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have started to notice teeth getting whiter.</li>
            <li> My new toothpaste.  Not overbearing flavor, just enough.</li>
            <li> Effective and gets the job done.  The taste is okay definitely not sugary but pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste, really like that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride.  and the taste is nice without overpowering</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I ever used. Leave me mouth feeling clean and moist. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Me encanto, deja los dientes muy limpios ylo mejor: sin fluor!. pienso seguir comprandolo y recomendarlo a mis amigos. Me parece un abuso que pidan mas de veinte palabras. No es necesario.</li>
            <li> Hate it, ughhhhhh!!!  It is a gel with a weird taste that stays in your mouth.  Instead of making you feel clean, you feel dirty with worse smelling breath.  Would NOT recommend!!!</li>
            <li> By far the best-tasting, flouride-free toothpaste out there. You go glen coco</li>
            <li> Gave everyone in the house a tube, as I bought nine, my 18 yo said that it left his teeth and mouth feeling so clean. He liked it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a few months now and I love it!  It has a nice subtle mint flavor and doesn&#x27;t foam like normal toothpastes.  I liked it so much I have even talked my husband and mom into using it.  This is the only toothpaste they use now too!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to use more of it than other toothpaste I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd tube and I really like the Now Foods toothpastes. They work great and I did not notice the difference in taste like some of the reviews stated. Cleans and whitens with minty flavor.</li>
            <li> Carrageenan is toxic. Avoid this product. Carrageenan is linked to intestinal inflammation and cancer. There are better products out there</li>
            <li> I love Xyliwhite&#x27;s Platinum Mint Toothpaste! It&#x27;s helped whiten my teeth and my breathe stays minty fresh for a long time after each brushing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste! It tastes great and is Fluoride-Free! I have also tried the Cinnamon flavored,and both taste good and work well.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste, it works and doesn&#x27;t have poison like all the normally available toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never understand why people prefer to brush their teeth with rat poison (sodium fluoride) instead of baking soda or other SAFE AND EFFECTIVE alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if we can just get the Fluoride out of the water, we would all be a lot healthier as a society.</li>
            <li> went to the dentist afterwards, and no complaints. that&#x27;s good because my gums were inflammed before and this took the sting out.&lt;br /&gt;he still told me i had to brush the front better, but that was because of &#x27;wet plaque&#x27;. so, this has 9% baking soda, and 25%xyilitol.</li>
            <li> I will no longer purchase this product since it contains carrageenan.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! Great taste!</li>
            <li> This is the one I liked the least out of the flavors available. It is too minty for me but if you like having a strong minty feeling in your mouth, this might be for you. Taste aside, this is a good brand of toothpaste without many of the harsh chemicals found in most toothpastes today. Some people might complain about this toothpaste containing carrageenan. In this case carrageenan is used to hold the ingredients together, the quantity is minimal and you shouldn&#x27;t be swallowing or eating your toothpaste anyways so don&#x27;t sweat it. Overall it&#x27;s still a good brand of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Looks like vaseline, but whitens and makes breath fresh cannot complain</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and dentist tried to prescribe this expensive toothpaste for me and I said no thanks.  I am sticking with this as it makes my teeth feel clean and doesn&#x27;t have all the junk in it that other toothpastes have. Great taste as well.  This is the only toothpaste I will use Now.</li>
            <li> I have been using fluoride free toothpaste to protect my thyroid gland (I have hypothyroidism) from the negative effects of fluoride, which was once used to treat overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).  I have used several brands of  fluoride-free paste including Tom&#x27;s, Jason&#x27;s and others, but I like this one---both its minty taste and the clean feeling I have after use.  For those craving the foamy texture of regular toothpaste, you won&#x27;t find it here or in any fluoride brand I have tried thus far, but it is worth knowing I am not taxing my already fragile thyroid any further.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to try this stuff. The taste is mild and refreshing. Xylitol is supposed to help combat harmful bacteria in the mouth. My next dental appointment will answer that question. Not as tasty as the cinnamon flavored brand.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is nice to use and leaves a clean and light minty feeling in my mouth. My teeth are definitely white :)</li>
            <li> Everyone and their mother ought to hurry and pick up a tube of this fluoride-free stuff.  Toothpaste without poison.  &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste a few years ago. I had several problems with my teeth.  For one thing, they were very sensitive. Even something really sweet had me wincing, along with hot and cold.  I had what I guess was receding gum lines, with slight cavities at the gum line that looked like crevices. If I put a finger nail in them, pain shot through my head.  Another issue I had was it was difficult to brush my teeth without me getting a gag reflex. I have no clue why, but it was getting worse and worse.  I HATE going to the dentist, haven&#x27;t been to one in about 25 years. I was worried I would have to &amp;#34;bite the bullet&amp;#34; (punny) and finally go back to one who I was sure would be charging thousands of dollars to fix the problems.  So I figured I would give this toothpaste a shot. Glad I did.  All of the issues I had are gone. The gag reflex stopped immediately. After about 6 months of using this toothpaste, I could feel like my teeth had another layer on them. They feel bigger, and stronger, in my mouth. Maybe all in my head, maybe not. My gums are great, better than as far back as I can remember. No more pain from sweet, hot or cold. The gum crevices are still kind of there, though not nearly as noticeable, and most importantly, do not hurt.  And, my teeth are even whiter! I highly recommend everyone to try this toothpaste, particularly if you have dental issues. Just give it a good 6-12 months. They say it is impossible to build enamel, I am not so sure anymore!  EDIT: I also had frequent nightmares of my teeth falling out, those are gone too :)</li>
            <li> I fill the difference but I found out not all natural and contains some chemicals. My teeth fill a lot better tho.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much from this toothpaste after the first time I used it. It turns out that I didn&#x27;t use enough toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;to make my mouth feel fresh. It is very effective. Best of all, it does not irritate my mouth in any way which is why I purchased this toothpaste in the first place! I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth feeling fresh and gingly.  Teeth appear whiter.  And best part is... free of harmful ingredients like flouride.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste taste, it is natural and leaves your teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> My entire family loves this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothpaste, not only have my teeth gotten a lot whiter, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I no longer have tooth sensitivity. I&#x27;m sure that sounds crazy but this toothpaste has done wonders for me and I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> If you are used to a conventional toothpaste that is very sweet, this might take some getting used to. I like that it&#x27;s SLS and cruelty free. My teeth don&#x27;t seem any whiter (they were pretty white to start with), but also haven&#x27;t yellowed at all.</li>
            <li> This made my teeth hurt! I used it twice. Too bad, it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> Natural cavity fighter.</li>
            <li> tastes really bad and doesn&#x27;t keep my breath very fresh</li>
            <li> Soooo...I work for a dentist. They preach fluoride around the office and I am the odd ball who stays away from it. But, I was having one heck of a time finding one that made my mouth feel clean and fresh and found myself resorting back to the free samples of fluoridated toothpaste strewn across the office. Then I found this stuff and have been happy every since! My teeth feel clean, my mouth feels fresh, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harmful chemicals placed in typical toothpaste. My hygienist just cleaned my teeth and even remarked at how clean they were and how my once slightly red gums around some problem spots were nice and pink again. Of coarse when i told her how i wasn&#x27;t using fluoridated toothpaste anymore, she scolded me, but  couldn&#x27;t complain about my oral health :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff! I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s different from regular toothpastes, but I like it much better.  Love the cool minty feeling my mouth has after brushing.</li>
            <li> Needs a better flavor</li>
            <li> This has no SLS.  Helps prevent cavities.  Works great for our family.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to improve their tooth health.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because I do not use a single brand all the time. I use fluoride, baking soda, peroxide, &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; brands at various times and depending on what I have been eating or drinking. Wine, blueberries, grape juice and other things cause stains that are stubborn and difficult to remove. Add to that I whiten my teeth regularly and this toothpaste gives me a &amp;#34;really clean&amp;#34; feeling after the whitening process. Besides my grandmother used to insist that I use just baking soda to brush my teeth outside on the back porch when I visited and who am I to go against that reasoning? I miss her advice to this day.</li>
            <li> Love the natural teeth whitening. It works really well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothpaste for my daughter, age 9, who gets mouth sores frequently. Since this is SLS free, it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent mouth ulcers. After about 2 months use, she has had no mouth ulcers (yet!), but complains its too strong in the mint flavor-and she loves mint!</li>
            <li> I keep buying it because it has ingredients that I don&#x27;t mind putting into my body. I&#x27;m a bigger fan of Jason Healthy Mouth, but this is effective and I do highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Is refreshing, however I buy xylitol based products because of a corn allergy. This product does contain sorbitol which is most frequently derived from corn.  Between spitting it out when brushing &amp; not being crazy sensitive,  it does not effect me.  I would not recommend for someone more sensitive.</li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling very clean and my breath very fresh and doesn&#x27;t have any flouride.</li>
            <li> I used Sensodyne for years, because of the pain at the intersection of my gums and teeth.  It didn&#x27;t do a great job, but I assumed that it was the best bet.  Because my periodontal disease was worsening (despite great dental care), I decided to try something different.  With great trepidation, I bought and tried Xyli-white.  To my amazement, after ONE use my pain went away!!!  I can now use a regular toothbrush (I had been reduced to using a Sonicare before, to avoid pressure on the areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyli-white does not advertise itself as a pain-reducing toothpaste, but it is a GREAT one.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is great. it does not taste chemically or smell weird. the taste doesn&#x27;t taste like artificial mint and it doesnt leave an overwhelming flavor in your mouth. of course you can taste the baking soda a little bit, but for me that is a plus. i dont enjoy the taste of baking soda by any means, but the slightly salty undernote reminds me that im brushing my teeth with natural ingredients instead of questionable chemicals. it gently whitens my teeth (not shockingly so, but it does help). i plan to continue using this product. i use this together with babu bamboo toothbrushes to help combat my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan. It doesn&#x27;t bubble up so it feels like it&#x27;s not working. Not a big fan.</li>
            <li> Compared to other toothpastes I feel like this one really whitens my teeth and in a short time period. Nice slightly minty taste after brushing. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I needed</li>
            <li> We like this toothpaste. It contains mostly good chemicals. The mint flavor is not overpowering like most of the common commercial brands. It contains xylitol, which our dentist recommends. When this tube runs out will will likely order again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean and my breath feel fresh. I really love the misty taste and I don&#x27;t feel wary of drinking water after brushing as I do with fluoridated toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t read great things about Carageenan. Hopefully it&#x27;s not an essential ingredient and they can remove it from a new and improved formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.cornucopia.org/shopping-guide-to-avoiding-organic-foods-with-carrageenan/</li>
            <li> It has an o.k. minty flavor and made our teeth feel very clean. It seemed to keep them cleaner for longer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> An okay toothpaste, but nothing extraordinary. Pretty much like any ordinary toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you think you need foam or soapy bubbles to clean your teeth, you are wrong.  Very wrong.  This toothpaste is all it claims to be.  It cleans your teeth and mouth.  And the fact that it is healthier ingredient wise is a plus.</li>
            <li> once you start brushing your teeth, it becomes very runny, and dribbles down your chin.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews before I bought this instead of just looking at the star rating.  While this product is, technically, \\&quot;SLS-free,\\&quot; it is NOT sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> At the least as good as what you can get in the middle of Georgia. Yep, that&#x27;s where I stay.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste because I was tired of putting a hazardous waste (fluoride) in my mouth.  This toothpaste works fine.  Of course it uses baking soda, so it doesn&#x27;t have the strong fresh taste like the Colgate brand that I used to use.  It also doesn&#x27;t come in the fancy-schmancy packaging that the top brands use, but the packaging works fine.  You will have to pay more for less.  Less toothpaste and less packaging convenience and NO HAZARDOUS WASTE!</li>
            <li> Still using it. but it seems to work good.</li>
            <li> The minty taste is nice, but I have to get used to it. It doesn&#x27;t foam up, but it does clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed if it whitens, but my teeth are pretty white anyway.</li>
            <li> I prefer my &#x27;main stream&#x27; toothpaste but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for a reasonable price.  Has a very light taste that doesn&#x27;t stay in your mouth for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m never using toxic toothpaste again if I can help it.</li>
            <li> I switched from conventional toothpaste to this brand to avoid fluoride and I find it actually cleans my teeth better than my old crest toothpaste without all the junk. It also feels like my mouth is cleaner longer abd I like the taste. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I used to use Crest toothpaste (regular paste). I loved the taste, but the stuff got watery while brushing my teeth. Many times, it dripped out of my mouth while brushing. Messy! Still, I kept using it, because I didn&#x27;t like Colgate or Aim. Then I learned about all the crap in regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this stuff. I don&#x27;t like it. To me, it tastes nasty. I can&#x27;t rinse my mouth enough to get the taste out. Sometimes, I rinse with Listerine to get rid of the taste.....and I HATE Listerine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worse than the taste, this stuff gets VERY watery. MUCH worse than the Crest. A few seconds into brushing, I have to tip my head back so it doesn&#x27;t dribble down my face. I&#x27;m talking.... WATERY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this stuff, because I do not believe in waste (I&#x27;m almost done with it...). But I will never buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tube of this stuff in cinnamon (cinnafresh) that I use at work. It too is watery, but I like the taste of the cinnamon. But put together nasty and watery....forget about it.</li>
            <li> I Just used this and it leaves your teeth shining! like shining white, not matte white. It reminds me of when you go to the dentist and get your teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> after learning about the harmfull effects of flauride, this is now my toothpaste of choice</li>
            <li> This was an OK toothpaste, my teeth felt nice and clean. The taste was pleasant and I loved using a more natural alternative to the drugstore toothepastes.  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34;, I am a regular coffee drinker so this was important, also because I have sensitive teeth, I needed to stop using this since there wasn&#x27;t made for this issue.  After a while, I couldn&#x27;t drink cold water when it&#x27;s so hot where I live. I had to switch back to a sensitive toothpaste and I am grateful for the relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great toothpaste for those that don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth and not in need of a lot of whitening.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste and the fact that xylitol is actually good for you is great, plus it&#x27;s fluoride free ! European counties have actually banned fluoride years ago because of bad health effects. I recommend this to everyone a safe effective product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, really!  but if the description says I will get four and only two arrived then it&#x27;s disappointing...</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste works well. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have flouride.</li>
            <li> SLS-free, Flouride-free -----has the potential to be a great product but sadly doesn&#x27;t clean teeth well enough even after a longer blush time. And it claim to &amp;#34;whiten teeth&amp;#34;, how ionic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to Tom&#x27;s of Maine Flouride-free Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ve seen any actual whitening, but it is the only fluoride and SLS free toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that I like. It tastes alright and my mouth always feels clean. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this toothpaste.  My teeth are feeling better and looking whiter than they have in a long time.  I will be re-purchasing for sure.</li>
            <li> This is great EXCEPT it does not have Fluoride in it. If you feel fluoride helps, you are right, If you think it is poisonous and a communist plot, you are very wrong and I am sorry for you, and I cannot change your belief; and you probably hate dental treatment for you and your kids, and the costs.  Add a good source of natural occurring Fluoride, like from &#x27;Prevident&#x27;, to harden your enamel and that will do the trick. &amp;#34;There are none so blind as those that will not see!&amp;#34; It sells is the only reason they make non-fluoridated toothpaste but SLS (soap is the danger and why you are told not to swallow toothpaste). SLS can lead to canker sores, so does tarter control (too many phosphates) and also leads to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that this toothpaste tastes. Only time will tell whether or not my teeth show improvement.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice taste..  All Natural ingredients.  I&#x27;m just not sure if it will protect my teeth as well as Fluoride toothpaste, since I&#x27;m prone to cavities over the years.  I alternate between this toothpaste and a fluoride one.</li>
            <li> Does a good cleaning job on my teeth.  I mix it with fluoride toothpaste, so I get the benefits of xylitol and fluoride.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT tasting toothpaste!  It leaves my mouth with a clean fresh taste.&lt;br /&gt;And, it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride!</li>
            <li> I bought this because Dr. Oz said something about xylitol being great for your teeth. When we received it we both tried it for a week. The paste isn&#x27;t very grainy like other brands. My wife decided to stop using it because after 15 or so seconds there was no taste. she also didn&#x27;t like that there was little &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; that made her mouth feel fresh. I still use it but my wife went back to her previous toothpaste.  I&#x27;m hoping that this will work to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
            <li> Just switched to non- fluoride toothpaste. This was my first product to try. Not to bad. I&#x27;m going to try the cinnamon next.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpaste, great taste and awesome cleaning power. Xylitol protects your tooth enamel. Baking soda is a gentle dentifrice, so you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. NOW makes superior products and I am satisfied with this paste time after time!</li>
            <li> I also use Thoms of Maine no fluoride toothpaste ... I like this one better, the taste is pleasing and it does foam up nearly as much as the Thoms making less messy.  The price is much better.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tooth paste for the past 6 years and I love it. Once I learned how poisonous fluoride was to the body; I knew I had to switch to a toothpaste other than the popular brands such as Crest and Colgate. This was is awesome and it leaves your mouth feeling a lot cleaner that the store brand toothpaste.</li>
            <li> this stuff is good try it i never used to brush my teeth before this thank you Xyliwhite</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good, and feels much less caustic than normal toothpaste. My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY MAKING MY TEETH WHITEN BETTER THAN THE TOXIC CREST 3D I HAD USED IN THE PAST.</li>
            <li> So far, I have no complaints about this toothpaste.  It cleans very well and has made a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my smile.  It also has a pleasant taste, something I wasn&#x27;t expecting!  Would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want fluoride in their toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Been looking for less abrasive and more natural toothpastes. Not sure if this one is exactly &amp;#34;more natural&amp;#34;, but I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride but does contain xylitol.</li>
            <li> Hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my attempt to try a more organic alternative, I switched to using this toothpaste. I rarely drink sodas or eat candy and maintain a regular brush cycle of at least twice a day. Also, I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in 14 years. After using this product for 4 months, I went to the dentist for a cleaning and discovered I had a cavity! I consulted with my dentist to determine if this could be the reason why and he agreed that It was probably a result from using the toothpaste. However, after further research I realized that by switching to a fluoride free toothpaste and also only drinking bottled water, I have effectively cut out most of my fluoride intake, which is probably what caused the cavity. So either I switch toothpaste or start drinking tap water. I&#x27;ll just use a different brand of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended xylitol toothpaste  so I did some research and tried 3 brands.  I saw no major difference in taste or use but this one was a best buy here.  More for the money and I am happy with it. My grandson and I use  and like it.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine the taste is very strange and bland if you are used to using typical colgate sort of toothpastes. I think this is the best value you can get if you&#x27;re trying to avoid harsh chemicals and such. I only wish the mintyness of it were more prominent.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I love this toothpaste. I just hope that the xylitol is not made in China. Anyone know? .</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed it this toothpaste.  It works well, tastes fine, but I am upset that when I ordered I did not see in the ingredient list that it contains carrageenan.  I saw it was made by Now Foods, a company I trusted to produce safe, quality, wholesome products.  I avoid any and everything that contains carrageenan. My mistake, I have to be more discerning in my future purchases.</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients, the clean feeling in my mouth after brushing, and the thumbs up from my dentist at my most recent visit.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever!  Please see the cinnamon flavor review and apply it to this one.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Price is right.  No fluoride.  But not bad</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t have a strong mint flavor and it don&#x27;t foam in the mouth but I like Xilothol it helps my mouth stay clean</li>
            <li> I bought this because it doesn&#x27;t have SLS. It&#x27;s better than other brands without SLS that I&#x27;ve tried, in that the mint tastes better.</li>
            <li> The best all natural toothpaste on the market. I prefer this flavor to the standard mint flavors because its just a little bit stronger, and it &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; more refreshing. The other flavors are just fine as well! It&#x27;s just a personal preference. My mouth does indeed feel nice and clean after each brushing. I get plenty of foaming action, and a nice refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, natural, fluoride-free toothpaste - this is it.</li>
            <li> Very Yummy, refreshing, tasty toothpaste. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product looks good. It definitely gets the job done. However, if you want to get some foam when brushing your teeth, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. I am perfectly aware of the fact that the foam isn&#x27;t what cleans my mouth, but am so irreversibly addicted to having that feeling that I couldn&#x27;t help but feel I had to use ridiculous amounts of toothpaste every time I brushed my teeth. I switched to another natural toothpaste since and most likely won&#x27;t be coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Not very sweet, which I like about this toothpaste. Makes my mouth and teeth feel very clean - you can feel the baking soda at work. Awesome.</li>
            <li> The baking soda ruins this toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t have SLS so its consistency is going to be runnier than normal as it is, but the baking soda turns this into a slipper soap water once you start brushing rendering it useless in the mouth. I&#x27;ve tried other Xyliwhite flavors. Any other XyliWhite is much better IF it doesn&#x27;t have baking soda. I found baking soda is only bearable if the toothpaste has SLS in it to offset the increased watery-ness and slippery-ness.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 star rating based on the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Taste: Probably one of the best products I have tried that claim having, &#x27;all natural&#x27; ingredients. This is a huge step-up from other former toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried (Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp; Earthpaste: which is a total scam); see my previous review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;page&#x3D;1&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview#RUSKVL61X3LWU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minty taste has a strong after-taste and made my breath feel it&#x27;s absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Gel: This product foams okay, I just wish it lasted longer. What the foaming affects lacks, the refreshing taste of mint make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If this product contains baking soda, I honestly could not taste it; this is not necessarily a bad thing. It was gritty but dissolved smoothly in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first go round of this product/brand and I am ready to venture in trying more. I love that it contains none of the following: fluoride, SLS, gluten and paraben; core damaging ingredients the big ups want you to BELIEVE is not harming for ones health and family. Xyli White reduces plaque and claim to whiten ones teeth. I&#x27;ve only tried this for three days now; I will need more evidence of my own to determine the later of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it&#x27;s smooth minty taste; that doesn&#x27;t taste artificially made but provides real, sustainability to ones mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh breath and an healthier toothpaste alternative; I would recommend this product to my own family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on that note...I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Review has been brought to you by &#x27;Awakened1&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** See all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.The flavor is not that great but its ok.We will get use to it.The main thing is that there is no floride</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! I&#x27;m a recent convert from fluoride and have been amazed by how clean and slippery my teeth feel after using this. I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> 3 stars for this product is ok.  It definitely whitens on command and doesn&#x27;t create sensitivity issues BUT it does give you little tongue sores after use.  I probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> effective and good ingredients</li>
            <li> Much better on your teeth and health than store bought poisons.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste. Fluoride free and it works great!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of this stuff!! tastes good, works good. I combine it with OraMD, a couple drops, It is Flouride Free, and uses Xylitol. Anyone still using toothpaste or drinking water with FLOURIDE, please do the research and save yourself!!!</li>
            <li> Decent, more natural toothpaste. Looks like Vaseline, rather than paste, but works well.</li>
            <li> i think it doesn&#x27;t do much for long lasting breath freshness and the whitening power is questionable as well. it does taste pretty mild and i do like that.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a toothpaste that was free of chemicals that was not super expensive.  I am very happy with this and the price is great.  I also have very sensitive teeth and this paste does not bother them at all.  I just use a pea size amount.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand for years and love it.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have fluoride also.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it, will keep using it. Easier than making my own.</li>
            <li> My family of 7 likes this toothpaste allot.  It freshens your breath more than ordinary toothpaste, and is less frothy in your mouth.  I am glad I can find something without fluoride for my family. Great product.</li>
            <li> I believe I am allergic to this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I orignially found this toothpaste at a health food store and tried it.  I don&#x27;t want all the additives that come along with most brand name toothpastes and this fit the bill.  I was very please with the taste and the way it cleaned my teeth.  And I was even more please to find I can order it from Amazon.com and not have to travel 35 miles to get it...it comes right to my door.  Thank you for carrying this product and for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is fluoride-free, tastes good and keeps my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean without any sugary aftertaste.  The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a clear gel that resembles petroleum jelly (good by me because it means it has no artificial colors or preservatives), and is an &#x27;adjustment&#x27; if you prefer white, blue stripes or sweeteners.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste...no fluoride or junk and my teeth actually feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it claims so no problems here.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packed, attractive, sturdy tube and a good amount of product.  The flavour is much more subdued than commercial toothpastes so takes some getting used to as there is not such a &#x27;burst&#x27; of mint.  Density of the product is identical to commercial toothpastes.  Well worth it to get away from flouride that&#x27;s endemic to all store-bought toothpastes.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for over a year. After I found the harmful affects of fluoride I decided to take control of my life and the chemicals I was putting in / on it. For over a YEAR I have been using this toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Cavaties? NO&lt;br /&gt;PLaque ? NO&lt;br /&gt;Gum pain or bleeding? NO&lt;br /&gt;I have healthy teeth and for over a year I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity of my teeth which use to happen often especially with cold drinks.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say. BUY it lol</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste Ive ever used. Leaves my teeth feeling super clean...all day long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a good brusher all my life, but still somehow got cavities each time I went to the dentist.  I was even on a prescribed toothpaste with the highest level of fluoride you can get.  Still no luck.  So i started doing some research and found that maybe the fluoride was actually causing the trouble.  So one day I started having a lot of sensitivity in the back of my mouth when I ate and drank.  I got really scared and started flossing a lot more which hurt due to the sensitivity.  I&#x27;m positive I had four cavities in the back of my mouth.  I was so sick of fluoride toothpaste not working, I finally made the switch to Xyliwhite after reading about the benefits of xylitol for teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months, I didn&#x27;t feel any sensitivity in my mouth AT ALL.  Not even Sensodyne Pronamel was able to do that.  This is an amazing product, and I think it whitens just as well as any other fluoride toothpaste.  I bought this one in particular because it has baking soda - another beneficial ingredient for teeth.  Now, about a year after I started using this product, I just recently went to the dentist.  He said everything looked great, NOT ONE CAVITY!!  I&#x27;ve read that xylitol is able to restore enamel where cavities once were by remineralization or restoring the enamel, and I&#x27;m totally convinced it did.  Whether Xyliwhite got rid of any cavities that I may or may not have had, I will remain loyal to this product for the rest of my life.  And I&#x27;m certainly never going back to fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 3/11/17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 years later and I&#x27;m still using this stuff, y&#x27;all!  Never going back to fluoride toothpaste.  Tip: if you purchase this through Prime pantry it&#x27;s usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  Tastes good.  Leaves my mouth fresh.  The ingredients are pretty solid.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my teeth feel. Fresh but not a burning fresh. My teeth look better by just using it a couple of times too! Will deff buy some more when I run out but hopefully I can find it elsewhere because I paid $11 total with shipping &amp; that&#x27;s a bit much for toothpaste but deff worth the find!</li>
            <li> great tooth paste I don&#x27;t have to worry about fluoride and I know that I will still have fresh breath and nice white teeth so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I only use flouride free toothpaste, so decided to try this product. I bought this for myself, but my husband likes it too, which is an added bonus. I&#x27;m happy to get him away from the flouride too :)</li>
            <li> Its toothpaste.  What else is there to say.  Its fluoride free, but its taste is just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;Platinum Mint&amp;#34; flavor is; it not peppermint, spearmint, or U.S. Mint (they could have made it cherry-flavored, or even coriander, thyme, or potato... but they made it, well, just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great fluoride free toothpaste.  Even my husband (who hates my all natural toothpastes) liked the flavor of this one. It tastes great.  Not sure about the whitening ability though.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I could tell a difference in one use...yes, that&#x27;s right, from using it one time. It cleans my teeth but doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like some mint flavored toothpastes do.&lt;br /&gt;And no bad stuff in it and also good stuff in it to make the teeth stronger. The tubes are large and one tube will last a long time. I bought two when I ordered and I will use it from now on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product. Goodbye poisonous toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Flavor and texture are good, but after months of using this I found it to be too abrasive and led to tooth sensitivity. Perhaps best used for occasional polishing.</li>
            <li> Looking for a non-flouride toothpaste option? This is the one to try! I had purchased another famous brand of natural toothpaste in the past, and was disappointed to find flouride in its ingredients. Not so with NOW Foods Xyli-White. It cleans and brightens teeth and freshens breath  without flouride, and with simple ingredients that I am not afraid to put in my mouth. And best of all, the price is very reasonable for a high quality flouride free natural toothpaste! This is now a staple in our household, and I recommend to everyone, great product.</li>
            <li> after using this paste my lips was have inflomations</li>
            <li> I liked the way this toothpaste smell and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel smooth and clean after using. No sensitivity from fluoride so a win-win!</li>
            <li> The minty flavor is strong. I prefer milder taste but overall its a really good clean feeling toothpaste. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I searched for sulfate free toothpastes.  While this does not have SLS, it does have a different sulfate.  Sulfates make my mouth bleed, so I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered this if I had this info.</li>
            <li> This is really good toothpaste.  My teeth feel clean and I don&#x27;t mind the taste even though I hate mint.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth squeaky clean without all the nasty chemicals like in your conventional store toothpastes. Freshens up breath quick and certainly feels like it cleans very well. One thing it doesn&#x27;t do well is foam up but I&#x27;m assuming it is because it does not have foaming agents and this is gel toothpaste. Nonetheless, I like this product very much and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this, but I think it cleans better than regular fluoride toothpaste. My teeth feel like I just had them professionally cleaned and the sensitivity I had is gone. It&#x27;s only been a week, and I&#x27;m already sold.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste on a whim since I am concerned with what I ingest.  To my family&#x27;s surprise, we all have noticed results with using this toothpaste.  At first, I thought yeah right, like this is going to work.  Funny thing is it actually does work.  I will re-order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> We usually use Earthpaste but I saw this on Amazon and I was excited about the xylitol in it. Ordered it, used it a couple of times and then (our mistake) read the ingredients. It has carrageenan which we stay away from since it&#x27;s an inflammatory and my husband has an auto immune disease which is prone to inflammation. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It cleans well and does seem to provide a degree of whitening as well with a nice peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> Really like this toothpaste. No fluoride is a must and it really does whiten the teeth. I didn&#x27;t even buy it for the whitening aspect.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous toothpaste!  I love how it works on my teeth and mouth and I love how it tastes!!</li>
            <li> this is a nice back up toothpaste, tastes good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> I like this brand of toothpaste very much. It really leaves the teeth feeling clean, like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Does not work for tooth sensitivity. I like it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Xylitol is a poisonous metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How Xylitol is Manufactured&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is true that xylitol is a naturally occurring substance, manufactured xylitol is another matter entirely.  Commercially available xylitol is produced by the industrialized process of sugar hydrogenation.  In order to hydrogenate anything, a catalyst is needed, and in the case of xylitol, Raney nickel is used which is a powdered nickel-aluminum alloy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we say heavy metal residue?  Xylitol doesn’t seem quite so warm and fuzzy anymore, does it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a lot of xylitol products and like what they can do in terms of adjusting the pH of the mouth, making your teeth feel slippery clean, and providing a \\&quot;food\\&quot; for the bacteria in your mouth that they cannot digest.  I think I&#x27;ve tried almost all the xylitol oral care products that I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the flavor of this toothpaste, which is an agreeable middle-of-the-road mint.  People preferring strong mint will probably not be as fond of this.  It is mild, and as you brush, it seems to break down fast and not leave much of a flavor.  Though I deducted a star, taste is secondary - I want clean, and this delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyliwhite also makes a Cinnamint toothpaste which has similar ingredients, but seems to have a lingering \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; flavor.  Perhaps the formula of this Platinum Mint flavor (which includes peppermint oil) masks it better.  Whatever the case, Platinum Mint tastes better to me.  Both flavors by this brand claim 25% xylitol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is yet one more flavor in the Xyliwhite line which I have not yet tried - Refreshmint.  If an economical way can be found to buy one tube to sample, that&#x27;d be great, but for now, the shipping costs from other vendors, or the requirement of buying multi-packs prevents that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re checking out xylitol oral care products, you might do well to try both flavors -as well as other brands- to find your favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyliwhite Platinum Mint ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;xylitol&lt;br /&gt;hydrated silica&lt;br /&gt;sodium bicarbonate&lt;br /&gt;glycerin&lt;br /&gt;sorbitol&lt;br /&gt;natural mint flavor&lt;br /&gt;peppermint oil&lt;br /&gt;sodium coco-sulfate&lt;br /&gt;carrageenan&lt;br /&gt;papain&lt;br /&gt;tea tree leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;sodium carbonate&lt;br /&gt;potassium sorbate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyliwhite Cinnamint ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water&lt;br /&gt;xylitol&lt;br /&gt;hydrated silica&lt;br /&gt;glycerin&lt;br /&gt;sorbitol&lt;br /&gt;sodium bicarbonate&lt;br /&gt;sodium carbonate&lt;br /&gt;sodium coco-sulfate&lt;br /&gt;carrageenan&lt;br /&gt;cinnamon leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;tea tree leaf oil&lt;br /&gt;papain&lt;br /&gt;potassium sorbateleaf oil&lt;br /&gt;papain&lt;br /&gt;potassium sorbate</li>
            <li> Returned, didn&#x27;t even use it due to the ingredients.  I will stick with earthpaste tooth paste for now.</li>
            <li> Blah. Not as good as natures gate, tea tree, or trader joes</li>
            <li> In the two years I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve had the easiest dental cleanings!  Thank you!!!!!!  I&#x27;m no longer anxious about those appointments.</li>
            <li> I needed a non-fluoride toothpaste for my endeavors in oil pulling. I generally only use this paste after doing so.  Not a lot of foaming with my Sonicare, but it seems to get the job done with a normal amount of paste.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried quite a few flouride free toothpastes and this is our favorite.</li>
            <li> I cannot use Crest, Colgate or other mainstream marketed toothpastes. I am allergic to glycols and toothpastes are one of the places they are in nearly every tube. So I have found xyli-white toothpaste. It is a little bit thinner than your Colgate, say, but it reminds me the most of the mainstream toothpastes. I like the taste, minty but not too minty</li>
            <li> This toothpaste gave me chemical or friction burns on my gums. It doesn&#x27;t taste good at all, but most non fluoridated toothpaste tastes bad, so I expected that. Whatever abrasives they are using are wayyyy too harsh.</li>
            <li> I will never use another toothpaste again, it made my teeth feel cleaner than anything else ive tried. Plus its good to know im not putting any of that harmful fluoride in my body everyday</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully clean toothpaste, with excellent substitutes for the SLS and fluoride that are in most other toothpastes.  Xyliwhite is not too minty, and leaves your mouth feeling good with no bad aftertaste while the xylitol strengthens the teeth.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in the cinnamon version of this toothpaste before... I love this toothpaste! I switch off between the cinnamon and mint flavors, and also switch between my homemade coconut oil and baking soda toothpaste! I LOVE THEM ALL!</li>
            <li> Growing up, I always used to purchase Arm-and-Hammer toothpaste because I craved that foaming action and taste only baking-soda based toothpastes can provide.  After a few formula changes and a bad reaction, I can no longer use the more widely available product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the toothpaste on preventing cavities (I use it with a fluoride rinse), it does leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh.  The preliminary research on Xylitol in oral health care does look promising as well, though I would suggest always trusting the peer-reviewed research over the latest natural foods blog.</li>
            <li> I would advice anyone staying away from fluoride to buy this amazing product with xylitol. recommend to your family and friends!</li>
            <li> Happy it has no flouride, just wished it foamed up a bit more.  Other than that, it leave the teeth very clean and squeaky clean.  Although someone using it for the first time may not realize, until a few minutes later after you feel how clean your teeth fill.  I guess I was so used to using the other crap.  I wish it would foam up like the other brands that have flouride, but I can deal with it, considering it is one of the safest out there.  This is the only toothpaste we now use at home!   As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases. So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  If this review was helpful to you please press YES in the link below.</li>
            <li> I used to use toms of main but came across this and like it just as much bit its a much better price. Toothpaste with other artificial sweeteners have a nasty aftertaste and I prefer to get ones without fluoride. I have tried their other tooth paste and while they are good, I just prefer they kind with baking soda in it. Definitely will but again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste. It&#x27;s not overpowering has just the right about a flavor. What I also like about this is it&#x27;s not an overwhelming overpowering baking soda taste. I know that if anybody&#x27;s ever used baking soda toothpaste before you understand what I&#x27;m trying to say. It doesn&#x27;t have that bitter salty sort of taste that may be an arm and Hammer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak on longevity of the product because I&#x27;ve only had it for several weeks now, however I can say that I don&#x27;t notice any negative effects of it yet and it seems to keep my mouth as clean as the older non-fluoride toothpaste that I was using. I was using the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand non-fluoride toothpaste just prior to this and I can say that I definitely think this is 2 to 3 steps above.</li>
            <li> switched over to xyliwhite to avoid fluoride. not a fan of this product but it seems to get the work done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be placing another order soon... Just opened my second tube....  Fast delivery. awesome product... Been meat/fluoride free for 90 days and feel an extreme difference.  Thnx a milion.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Good flavor.</li>
            <li> This stuff was ok. Not sure if I would buy again. But it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fluoride free tooth paste and tried this product first. I used it for 4 or 5 days and it really made my teeth hurt quite a bit. Made them very sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had that problem. Switched to Tom&#x27;s after that and have had no problems. This toothpaste was definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> I liked everything about it except that it was a gel. I keep making the same mistake when picking out toothpaste. I grab a tube that says toothPASTE and it turns out to be a gel. Companies need to make that word bigger in their packaging or I need to start reading things more carefully. Perhaps I need new glasses.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste! My whole family really enjoys it. I especially like the fact that it is fluoride free and has natural ingredients. Tastes great too!</li>
            <li> The first time, I purchased this product from a health food store.  I really liked it but thought it was pricey.  I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw that Amazon was offering the same product for less.  Regular store-bought toothpaste seems to aggravate my tinnitus (ringing in the ears).  This toothpaste helps to reduce my tinnitus.  It is very mild tasting too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like it my family did not, the flavor is a bit strong for them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. You will have fresh breath. I can&#x27;t say it is the greatest for whitening. My teeth were super duper white,  but I&#x27;m sure I can fine an additional product to work with this one. Not a major issue.</li>
            <li> excellent product, it&#x27;s not like a normal toothpaste this one won&#x27;t leave you an extra fresh mint flavor or freshness as a regular one, but it does an excellent job and it has no fluoride, that what I care about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth have been getting whiter since I&#x27;ve started using this. It&#x27;s also nice that I know I&#x27;m not ingesting fluoride. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is the best tasting Xylitol toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  I stay away from the harmful ingredients in regular toothpastes.  This doesn&#x27;t have fluoride or the chemical foaming agents in it and my teeth get clean and stay white--and I&#x27;m a coffee drinker!</li>
            <li> I like this brand but didn&#x27;t particularly like the flavor of this one.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste because it has a high concentration of xylitene. My dentists recommended it. He told me that xylitene actually does two things:&lt;br /&gt;1) rebalances the ph in your mouth as you brush so you don&#x27;t remove enamel (which happens if your mouth is too acidic)&lt;br /&gt;2) the xylitene is actually perceived as &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; by the non-beneficial bacteria in your mouth, so the bacteria will go after the xylitene rather than rotting your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist mentioned that even if I could not brush, just putting some of this toothpaste in my mouth (or xylitene gum) and swishing it around would help prevent tooth decay. So far so good! Look ma, no cavities!</li>
            <li> Wish I could report a great story on this stuff. It works as advertised, but I went back to flouride toothpaste based on the recommendation of my dentist. Plus in the few months I used it I ended up having a cavity when I went to the dentist for a check up.</li>
            <li> It tastes fine &amp; it isn&#x27;t full of all the chemicals that you find in store bought toothpaste. It&#x27;s less expensive &amp; NO flouride. I like that it&#x27;s a gel. I don&#x27;t really like pastes.</li>
            <li> YES!  I am 40 now and I cannot honestly say I have ever found a toothpaste I like.  This one takes the cake.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Not too strong of a taste, which I like.  I want to get sick when I have a toothpaste that is so strong it feels like I just ate a peppermint flavored Sucrets.  This toothpaste immediately reduces all sensitivity in our teeth and the taste is just right, tolerable.  The paste is fine, not grainy.  Also, oddly enough, my teeth feel like they are freshly brushed all day long.  Even if I forget that morning, my teeth still feel clean!!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is any better than regular toothpaste, I may have noticed a worsening of my cavities but it is hard to blame the toothpaste.  I do like the flavor and it does serve the purpose of brushing, but I may return to Sensodyne for the Anticavity properties.  ??</li>
            <li> I like the taste of cinnafresh  better, but this one seems to actually whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> light taste and slightly whitens. i will but this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because it was SLS Free, but if you look at the other comments it has another irritant just as harsh as SLS.&lt;br /&gt;It irritated my gums and gave me sores.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, this toothpaste was OK...... Honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it really was cleaning my teeth. Would never use this solo.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth clean just like the poisonous fluoride toothpaste brands, but without putting toxic industrial waste fluoride poison in my body.&lt;br /&gt;I heard fluoride is actually destructive to your teeth, so I don&#x27;t want it. I also try to avoid fluoride in my drinking water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the excess flouride in most commercial toothpastes, and after finding and enjoying Oralive by Ascended Health (which works great, though is pricey) I decided to look for a more cost-effective alternative. It does run out of flavor before the standard 2-minute brush time, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. If it&#x27;s really important to you, this can be amended by simply using more than a pea-sized amount. Having used Crest, Aquafresh, Colgate, and Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past, I can honestly say this is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that consistently prevents morning breath.</li>
            <li> I like it. Leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter told us about this tooth paste and how our 2 grand-kids had their best checkup ever. A few weeks later she was told the same thing by her dental hygienist, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and about 5 or 6 weeks after I started using it my hygienist kept saying, &amp;#34;What have you been doing, your teeth almost have no plaque&amp;#34; That was using it for less than 2 months. Fastest cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had. I can&#x27;t wait to see what she says when I&#x27;ve used it for the whole time between teeth cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say much about the taste, it&#x27;s OK but the check up&#x27;s so far have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve been fighting recurring canker sores (aphthous ulcers) and most of us know how painful they can be.  Something had to change.  I have no underlying conditions and after google-ing canker sores, I ran across a possible culprit in my toothpaste...sodium lauryl sulfate. With nothing to lose and reading other reviews of Xyliwhite, I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m three weeks in to using it and mind you, I rarely went one week without a canker sore popping up, and I&#x27;m happy to say I haven&#x27;t had one ucler!  Coincidence?  I don&#x27;t believe so.  The ONLY downfall has been getting over the lack of foaming action, which took about a week for me.  Also, one previous reviewer mentioned using a generous amount on your toothbrush and I second that.  BUT my teeth always feel clean and fresh.  There&#x27;s no looking back for me.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to poison (fluoride) toothpastes. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpastes. And its without fluoride.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Me and my boyfriend decided to switch to non fluoride toothpaste and this was the first brand we chose.It has the same minty taste as regular toothpaste but it&#x27;s healthier. The taste is not as &amp;quot;in your face&amp;quot; as store brand toothpaste but you don&#x27;t brush your teeth for the taste but rather the results right?</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste because it has ingredients that I don&#x27;t feel weird about putting into my mouth everyday. The paste is a good consistency, the color is more of a translucent white than a pure white. The mint is decent while brushing, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I had been looking for a flouride-free toothpaste and decided on Xyli-White based on the ingredients and the reviews that said it also helped whiten teeth. I got it today and used it right away. It tastes great, much better than our regular toothpaste! I didn&#x27;t pay attention if it had made a difference on the color of my teeth but oddly enough my little sister commented that my teeth were white (?!) and I have only used it one time!...Hmm, don&#x27;t know but I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Simple toothpaste, no fluoride, high percentage of xylitol, what more do you need.  Remember Fl is a poison in any amount.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my teeth feel afterward. I like that it contains xylitol which is supposed to be good for the teeth. My teeth do look whiter and there is no sensitivity.  It has a gel/paste consistency and a nice smell in and out of your mouth.  I would definitely recommend this gel/paste. My dental assistant recommended it.</li>
            <li> My 6 years can use it because it&#x27;s has no strong taste. She loves it. After hours of use still feel my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into natural living, growing my own foods, using baking soda to brush my teeth, etc. I had thought about making my own toothpaste when I saw this one. This toothpaste is a great choice. The ingredients are the closest thing to natural that I&#x27;ve seen. I like the way it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean just like when I was using the plain baking soda. This one is mint but next time I want to try the other flavor.</li>
            <li> ginger taste is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural toothpaste we&#x27;ve tried, and we&#x27;ve tried many! Great taste and leaves your mouth feeling super clean. Wish there was a version with fluoride.</li>
            <li> Great fresh taste, awesome clean feeling in your mouth when you are done brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is flouride free, as none of us need that.  Might be a bit strong for a child&lt;br /&gt;but great for adults!</li>
            <li> I wanted to stop using flouride toothpaste and found this online. So far it seems to work well and also has whitening without the flouride. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I came across this product because I was looking for a toothpaste that is free of fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate. This toothpaste claims to be SLS free but sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium coco-sulfate (which is listed in the ingredients) are the same thing.. If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you though, this is a good toothpaste alternative to the typical fluoride ridden crap sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> sine I&#x27;ve started using this and the xyletol nose spray I  have had no sinus, mouth throat, or chest infections&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has worked for me like magic</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this toothpaste and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have dangerous chemicals in it.  I have been using this toothpaste for about 5 yrs and since using it, I have had no cavities.  People don&#x27;t realize that most advertised toothpastes are so abrasive that they break down the tooth enamel and actually cause cavities.  This does not contain fluoride which is not good for you, especially if you have thyroid disease.</li>
            <li> I switched to this toothpaste about a year ago, and haven&#x27;t looked back since! My husband and I love the clean feeling and the taste is very minty, but not that fake mint taste like many common toothpastes out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend switching over to this!</li>
            <li> Make this your everyday toothpaste for life</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful natural toothpaste.  This is my favorite flavor of the NOW toothpastes.  It works well and is very refreshing.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> I got interested in natural toothpastes when the dentist noticed that my son had a strange thickening of the skin inside his cheeks.  A biopsy was performed which came back negative, but the dentist said he was probably sensitive to some of the nasty chemicals used in traditional toothpaste.  Then I started reading about fluoride and the potential risks it seems to have, so I figured we&#x27;d try something totally without fluoride as well. (thank G** we live in NJ, which doesn&#x27;t have fluoridated water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we&#x27;ve both been using this product for a couple of months now - it&#x27;s just the two of us, and it has a good taste and consistency. Seems to clean our teeth as well as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this at first but after using it for awhile my husband and I both started to have very sensitive teeth. I had bought a tube for my mom also and she recently told me she was having the same issue. I&#x27;m not sure what ingredient was causing this but we definitely won&#x27;t be using this again. It hurt to even drink water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been working well for us as a no fluoride toothpaste substitute.</li>
            <li> It is a natural toothpaste, healthier than others. I researched the ingredients and found the that the Xyli is a sugar based ingredient. This toothpaste also has another sugar based ingredient called &amp;#34;sorbitol&amp;#34; used to lower dry mouth. Like its labeled it looks more like a gel. It tastes good so overall I liked it.</li>
            <li> Awesome fluoride free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Your mouth will stay minty for less time than regular toothpaste. It seems to work okay. It is minty and tastes pretty much like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the worst-tasting I have every tried, but don&#x27;t let that deter you. I am getting used to the taste so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much anymore.  I think it works well to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that this toothpaste uses Xylitol and contains no sodium lauryl sulfate or flouride!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor downside is the taste which i found to be just OK, it just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; enough in my opinion. Another quality that XyliWhite lacks from my perspective is minty foamy goodness. By minty foamy goodness I mean the white minty foam that toothpastes with SLS produce. I know there are some natural toothpastes that are able to reproduce this without adding SLS so for me XyliWhite didn&#x27;t deserve 5-stars. Still, just because it lacks the foam doesn&#x27;t mean it lacks the clean.</li>
            <li> My favorite fluoride-free toothpaste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> teeth are clean, fresh taste, would buy again</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can say but this is one of my favorite new toothpaste.  Really cleans, great taste.  I have sensitive teeth Tom&#x27;s of Maine use to work but not as good as this.</li>
            <li> There are very very few toothpastes left with no flouride. This is because the government wants us to have what they claim is cavity prevention even though no scientific study has ever indicated this. Unfortunately most of the flouride free toothpastes out there--if you can even find them--taste bad; and they have SLS, a terrible chemical that causes certain people (like me) to suffer canker sores. If you&#x27;ve never had them, canker sores are much more painful than you can guess. For years, doctors and dentists were puzzled why canker sores happened. I don&#x27;t know who made the SLS connection, but I&#x27;d give him or her a Nobel Prize. SO: an affordable, whitening toothpaste with no SLS. PLUS: no flouride to clog up your brain waves and poison your system. PLUS: it takes great. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from this toothpaste.  Since we began using this product, none of us have had any cavities and very little tarter.  There is a very clean taste in your mouth, even  upon waking in the morning.  I also oil pull as part of my oral routine.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product, except I have not seen Amazon having it available  on a regular basis. Very good and reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> If you ever try toothpaste with Xylitol instead of Fluoride I promise you&#x27;ll never think of toothpaste the same. It&#x27;s a great value, good price for the size... for me it lasts forever, or nearly.... makes my teeth feel clean and I don&#x27;t brush very hard... soft bristles, easy touch and teeth stay clean and bright. Try it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for myself because I don&#x27;t use it but I bought it for my 2 year old who isn&#x27;t ready for fluoride.  He cries...hates it...yet he will use other minty ones.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for adults but skip it as a toddler fluoride-free paste.</li>
            <li> Nice toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on the brush long.  I wish it had a little baking soda to give it a little grit.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. It leaves your mouth feeling very clean. The taste is pleasant and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t like the taste.  Left a weird taste in our mouths after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel after brushing with this toothpaste. They are smooth and squeaky-clean. The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much which is probably what I&#x27;m used to in previous toothpastes. But the end result is super-clean and white teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this toothpaste more than I. It&#x27;s a texture issue for me but its competitive in price to other brands but I think our go to brand will stay Spry.</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve tried but it has a minty flavor and none of the crap that you don&#x27;t want.  You&#x27;ll probably love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted a vegan and cruelty-free toothpaste without fluoride and this fit the bill. I get a real clean feel after this, and I&#x27;m glad to have a toothpaste with ingredients I can trust. I wish the minty flavor were a bit stronger -- this isn&#x27;t the one for you to have lingering fresh breath. Coupled with mouthwash, though, you&#x27;re in the clear. I also would like for it to foam up a little better, but I guess that&#x27;s the compromise for having such a simple ingredient list. And for everyone who hasn&#x27;t down their homework: Xylitol is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! None of the bad and all of the good! Read the labels on toothpaste carefully. Amazing (more like scary) what people put in their mouths.</li>
            <li> Nice product and it works well. I especially love the fact that it does not have fluoride.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Great flavor and works well. I will order again as I have before.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite organic toothpaste. Really seems to whiten my teeth up some and my mouth always feels fresh after I use it. My new go-to! They aren&#x27;t giving it away, but it&#x27;s worth it for me.</li>
            <li> One of the truly great toothpastes out there.  All the right ingredients and none of the bad.  I buy this for people I care about.  Only one person complained that it did not have enough flavor.  I prefer it that way.</li>
            <li> great product will order again very soon.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste gave 2 of my 4 kids a rash around their mouths, so I won&#x27;t buy this again.  maybe the mint?</li>
            <li> Update: Another consumer was awesome and contacted Now Foods to find out the RDA levels (as it&#x27;s not indicated on the packaging). According to the user, Now Foods indicated that the RDA Value is 85 for those concerned about abrasion. Thanks again S. Ghosh ;-)&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I normally rely on Young Living toothpaste now (me and my younger son are fans of their thieves toothpaste), but we recently ran out and Young Living has all of their toothpastes out of stock...sooo, I decided to try this stuff and I must admit, I LOOOOOVVVEEE IT! This stuff actually makes my mouth feel like I&#x27;m using \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpaste (those that use \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpastes know what I mean). Out of all of the natural toothpastes that I&#x27;ve tried, this actually makes my mouth feel super clean. It it even foams (which is rare for a natural toothpaste). My tongue even looks great and it does well with my coffee stained teeth/tongue in the morning. Further proof--an unsightly blackhead turned white pus-filled pimple that&#x27;s been lingering for a few weeks now. After I squeezed all the yucky goo out, I applied this toothpaste and it FINALLY seems to be healing. I&#x27;m a Now Foods fan (I use a ton of their products), but this one is definitely up on my top ten list. I&#x27;m still gonna try some Squiggle&#x27;s that I bought to help with my gums (I have sensitive teeth caused by receding gum lines) but I&#x27;m most likely gonna stay with this toothpaste even if my YL comes back in stock.</li>
            <li> I like the taste.  Don&#x27;t think that my teeth are any whiter because of this toothpaste.  I  would purchase it again</li>
            <li> Tastes good, clean, and works well as a toothpaste, not just as a natural toothpaste, but in that category, it&#x27;s definitely excellent!</li>
            <li> I did not have success with whitening and didn&#x27;t care for the strong mint flavor. Still xyliwhite is a good product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this instead of a similar xylitol toothpaste.  This product is much less expensive and leaves my teeth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will defer the oral health assessment to my dentist, but my teeth feel clean and look good so overall this is a good purchase, especially since its much less than the product I was using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  The bacteria on my tongue has appeared to markedly decrease; considerably less to remove with a tongue scraper.  In the morning my breathe is not as bad either -as compared to when I used other toothpaste products.  My teeth look and feel clean.  Time will tell how it effects my overall dental hygiene (dental visits will reveal).</li>
            <li> I like this fine.  It&#x27;s minty but for me there&#x27;s not enough foam.  I do believe the Xylitol is killing germs that make you sick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but the flavor is weak.  A couple more drops of oil would make it taste great and give that nice breath you really want after brushing.</li>
            <li> Could use a bit more mint flavour but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li> You can definitely taste the saltiness of the baking soda over the mint, but it isn&#x27;t bad. It scrubs my teeth much better than regular toothpaste, without the fluoride, and it is cheaper than Tom&#x27;s of Maine. Over all I feel that this one is superior to other toothpastes of this class. I have sensitive teeth and experience no sensitivity when using Xyliwhite.</li>
            <li> So nice to have a product to replace my Toms, since they changed their formula after selling out!</li>
            <li> Does not taste very good and simply did not do as good a job of whitening and removing tartar as Tom&#x27;s of Maine, just wish Colgate had not soiled the latter with their completely unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> not very sudsy and had to tell if it actually works. I do like the idea of a lot of chemicals not in it</li>
            <li> I only buy toothpaste without fluoride and I like the mint especially.  One of the only kind of toothpaste we use.</li>
            <li> Trying to avoid harmful fluoride, SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), parabens and other toxins, I bought [[ASIN:B000XPB60U Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Platinum Mint Toothpaste]]...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the MOST VILE and DISGUSTING toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used -- and before going organic and trying to avoid/reduce/eliminate toxic chemicals &amp; additives, I used to use (a fairly long time ago) [[ASIN:B0000530SD Ultra Brite Toothpaste]]!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment on the long-term quality (in cleaning the teeth/gums/mouth) because I can&#x27;t use this toothpaste for more than one brushing session when I&#x27;m in a pinch (like when I&#x27;m out of the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothpaste[s] brands I use) before being so grossed out pushes me to replenish my regular toothpaste(s). For example, this toothpaste claims to be \\&quot;Platinum Mint\\&quot;...........what the HECK is \\&quot;Platinum Mint\\&quot;? Is it peppermint, or spearmint or wintergreen? Unfortunately, with this yucky toothpaste, its IMPOSSIBLE for me to figure it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the best I can tell, this toothpaste is (or would be, if I or anyone ever did!) like brushing with a \\&quot;minty\\&quot; chalk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this toothpaste back on November 18, 2014 (and with free 2-day Prime Shipping, likely got it by the 20th or 21st) and its now March, and I&#x27;ve probably only used this toothpaste maybe a handful of times (if not less!) since then. Yet after spending $4 on this fluoride-free toothpaste, I can&#x27;t bring myself to toss it out in the garbage where it belongs, either. So there it continues to sit, in my bathroom medicine cabinet, rarely taken out, but taking up place (and causing clutter) because as digusting as it is, I cringe at the thought of throwing $4 in the garbage so casually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, if you are looking for a good, fluoride-free toothpaste, stay away from this  [[ASIN:B000XPB60U Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Platinum Mint Toothpaste]] -- there are other better toothpastes out there, including [[ASIN:B00CLH90TM Kiss My Face&#x27;s Triple Action Toothpaste]] (which seems to be a few dollars cheaper in some brick &amp; mortar stores than on Amazon) or some of the \\&quot;Nature Gate\\&quot; or \\&quot;Tom&#x27;s of Maine\\&quot; fluoride-free toothpastes!!luding [[ASIN:B00CLH90TM Kiss My Face&#x27;s Triple Action Toothpaste]] (which seems to be a few dollars cheaper in some brick &amp; mortar stores than on Amazon) or some of the \\&quot;Nature Gate\\&quot; or \\&quot;Tom&#x27;s of Maine\\&quot; fluoride-free toothpastes!!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s our review of Now Foods latest entry to the oral-care arena...  Pros and Cons: Cons: 1. The flavor. Now, it doesn&#x27;t taste bad or anything, but it&#x27;s really super mild, almost to the point where you feel like you have to rinse, whereas with other tooth cleansers you feel the minty freshness right away, so definitely -- the flavor could be a little more robust to make the breath freshening aspect more lasting... but, a finishing rinse with a little (original) Listerine will remedy that...  2. Contains sodium-coco-sulfate...  3. It is NOT Organic (or at-least it didn&#x27;t indicate anywhere on the box...)  Pros: 1. It&#x27;s totally gentle on the mouth (doesn&#x27;t feel like you are stripping away the enamel on your teeth while brushing...)  2. Teeth will feel nice and clean after brushing.  3. Xylitol is supposed to be good for reversing and preventing cavities, so it&#x27;s definitely worth testing out...  4. Lists/markets  No SLS (but contains SCS / Sodium-COCO-Sulfate) -- And I am wholly suspect of anything described as Sodium-BLANK-Sulfate (or Sodium-Sulfate) at this point-- and you would think that with our savvy technological advances, they could come up with a safer, non-sodium-sulfate cleansing base at this point--).. It&#x27;s a good product, but the cleansing ingredient 9SCS) doesn&#x27;t give one much motivation to switch from Tom&#x27;s of Maine -which uses SLS...  Overall, a pretty standard xylitol-based cavity fighting product that leaves your teeth feeling clean without over-stripping the enamel...  So, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying out, but the search is STILL on for all-natural organic tooth cleansers without any sodium-sulfate based cleansers ...Get rid of the sodium-sulfate based cleansers and make it Organic, the grade would definitely be much improved...  Our grade: C++; or 3.75-Stars!</li>
            <li> I tried another brand (not Tom&#x27;s) of non-fluoride toothpaste that was very disappointing, particularly in how hard it was to squeeze out of the tube.  This tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh.  As good or better than Tom&#x27;s.  Hope they come out with a pepsodent flavor, as that is my favorite flavor.</li>
            <li> Happy with the price.</li>
            <li> I became a Vegan recently and was no longer inclined to use the popular toothpaste brands loaded with chemicals and artificial sugar.  I practice Oil Pulling with Coconut Oil and in conjunction with using regular baking soda as a mouth rinse, I wanted a natural Baking Soda toothpaste and this seemed to fit my requirement.  I was very pleased with the taste and it makes my teeth shiny after flossing and using an electric toothbrush.  I would absolutely recommend and buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has brightened my teeth by at least three shades whiter than they were before I started using it. Very satisfied will most likely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bland flavor, which disappears fast as you are brushing, this toothpaste quickly became very unpopular in my house, the teenagers refused to use it. My older son went out to buy a fluoride brand toothpaste, this undermined all my efforts to keep them poison free.</li>
            <li> I like this new paste .This is not as abrasive, its not whitening kind... ,its just keeping your mouth fresh and your teeth clean. Nothing special; just better than monopoly&#x27;s Brands like Crest,Colgate,etc. that taste like hydrogen peroxide with a hint ov potassium fluoride&#x3D;the worst for your teeth and bones ;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;0</li>
            <li> Nice taste, good price for &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; toothpaste</li>
            <li> Good taste. Xylitol helps. inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced xylitol based toothpaste. I really like this toothpaste as the minty freshness does not leave the aftertaste that most other mint toothpastes leave. I have found it helps with my morning breath as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t have Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). I wanted to eliminate that nasty aftertaste that you usually get from toothpaste. I&#x27;m happy. I got what I wanted. The paste is not as opaque as I have become used to. It&#x27;s a little bit clear. That surprised me a little, but it makes no difference.</li>
            <li> The only toothpase I use now. Great product! Keeps my teeth clean!</li>
            <li> It burns my mouth so really haven&#x27;t used it but one time.  I have a condition of the mouth that is very sensitive to a lot od things that set my mouth on fire.</li>
            <li> Bought this instead of my normal Earthpaste by Redmond Clay. BIG MISTAKE! It is way over powering in taste - leaving my tastebuds feeling fried. It made my teeth ultra sensitive. I used it for about a week then just couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste - very refreshing taste and it seems to be working great!!</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this. Other toothpastes are so sweet they almost gags me. This is only minimally sweetened and has a lovely mint flavor with out the burn of so many commercial pastes.</li>
            <li> not bad as a natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> I switched as I get very bad canker sores and wanted to avoid toothpastes with SLS.  Unfortunately, I still got canker sores with this toothpaste and felt it actually got worse when using this.  Ended up throwing away the tube half-way through.  On a side note, it did taste pretty good so if it wasn&#x27;t for the canker sore issue, I would have continued using it.</li>
            <li> I like this. It is a mild scent and mild abrasive, but that works for me. Regular toothpastes are far too strongly mint for me to handle. So far no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Now Foods Xyliwhite, Baking Soda Toothpaste, Platinum Mint, 6.4-Ounces got it and I like it a lot! Leaves a freshly minty refreshing flavor in my mouth. The baking soda is very mild so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums. Get it, is worth it!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste took some getting used to, but I like it. It just doesn&#x27;t foam up much.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;My whole Mouth was thrilled with the results after 4 mouth/teeth cleanings. :)</li>
            <li> A most refreshing toothpaste, comes out of the tube easily, really prepares the mouth for its first morning sip or bite.  I find that pastes polish the teeth much better than gels.</li>
            <li> The most enjoyable natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
            <li> Great feeling teeth &amp; makes my mouth taste better first thing in the morning if I brush with this immediately before bed.  Xylitol fights plaque-making bacteria.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste.  Doesn&#x27;t foam, but that&#x27;s a great trade off for not having toxic SLS.  My teeth feel cleaner after using this.  Flavor is great and we switched from Tom&#x27;s Flouride Free to trying this.  Hubby&#x27;s teeth are getting whiter.  It has a bit of grit.</li>
            <li> My favorite-- glad Amazon is carrying it now.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used ever due to no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I have a serious issue with any toothpaste having fluoride or any harmful ingredients. It will show on my skin!! This one has absolutely no problem with that and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!!! Though at the beginning it tastes a little bit weird, you will absolutely like it after a week!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I keep using this product with good dentist reviews every 6 months. Time to get away from the major brand chemically produced products.</li>
            <li> I paid for 6 &amp; only 1 got delivered</li>
            <li> Has baking soda to help with whitening</li>
            <li> This was a VERY pleasant surprise. I bought this for my husband and children as they prefer the minty flavors of toothpaste. They have requested that we continue to purchase this. It is a lovely uncolored gel with just the right amount of EO&#x27;s to freshen the breath without overdoing it. It seems to clean the teeth very well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, the best toothpaste out there! Would give ten stars if I could! I used this on a hunch just trolling for a toothpaste that wouldn&#x27;t leave slime in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is not really what it claims but a lot better than the ones claiming good oral health and then damaging your teeth. For example colgate and other popular toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;Must be used with some other natural remedies. I use it along with oild pulling</li>
            <li> One of the best, that is for sure. Xylitol, no artificial chemical sweetness! I will stick with this one. Price is good, I hope it will stay that way. And I do not want any more of toothpastes with fluoride in them. No need to put that poison in my mouth!</li>
            <li> I wish this didnt contain sorbitol.  Will not buy again untill this is changed</li>
            <li> Excellent taste and came on time</li>
