            <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;I added a little to my saline nasal spray and made it much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;It taste good and is sweet.</li>
            <li> I use this in alot DIY recipes. Hand soaps and other things...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I use to make my juices vaping, excellent quality, excellent product, the shipment was successful</li>
            <li> Has a really strong aftertaste compared with another brand i use. Wouldnt use in an herbal tincture again.. The point of glycerites are to extract and preserve full body flavor and character to its fullest extent..</li>
            <li> very good value - using this in quite a few of my homemade household and beauty recipes.</li>
            <li> Everything was a pleasure including the product!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product to make my own face serums with.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff I use it for my e-juice DIY and it has no additional flavoring great thickness and the bottle opens with a spout so I can just pour it into my 15 or 30ml bottles without making a mess at all! 5 stars plant Guru</li>
            <li> super clean, great product</li>
            <li> I very much appreciated the value of this item. So much better than any other like product I found during my search of Amazon.  Love that it is available on Prime.  It came fast and I have used it a couple times already. I watched a particular YouTube video by TheFrugalCrafter (I believe it was she) that made me realize the myriad uses for gylcerin. This was after seeing other YouTube Videos and reading an article here or there listing glycerin&#x27;s craft uses.</li>
            <li> Love this, the only brand of vegetable glycerine I use in my products</li>
            <li> Use this for DIY e juice. Vapes great</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a preservative from making flower essences and I absolutely love it. It has a nice light sweetness to it and it&#x27;s not overpowering to my flower essences. I recommend giving this a try for anyone who does not like to use alcohol as a preservative for their flower essences.</li>
            <li> Seems to be fine. My first time using this type of product.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Use with baking soda, peppermint oil, clove oil and tee tree oil to whiten my teeth.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, fine product.</li>
    </ol>
