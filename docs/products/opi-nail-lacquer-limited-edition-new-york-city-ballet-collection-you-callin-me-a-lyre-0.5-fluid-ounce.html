            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love OPI nail polish?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anybody who doesn&#x27;t love OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li>ENjoyed</li>
            <li>One coat is barely visible, 2-3 are perfect, and anything over that doesn&#x27;t look quite right on my nails.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful subtle color that looks great with OPI &amp;#34;Pirouette my whistle&amp;#34; overtop.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very runny and takes 3 coats to get a nice color.</li>
            <li>Great colors that go on smoothly and have long wear.</li>
            <li>As usual OPI nail polish is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I have arrived!\\&quot; but sometimes you need that, and the glitter overlay that was sold with the collection jazzes things up smoothly if you just can&#x27;t take the calm anymore.</li>
            <li>So Much I&#x27;m Ordering More.</li>
            <li>It looked to be like it was going to be opaque, but it gives a nice, natural shine just like shown in this picture.</li>
            <li>This brand of polish looks great and doesn&#x27;t chip like other nail polish</li>
            <li>Would be great to wear all year around if your not into dark colors.</li>
            <li>This is a light pink color that is a really nice spring color.</li>
            <li>With just 2, it&#x27;s a nice sheer polish.</li>
            <li>It wears well, has a nice subtle shade and matches so many of my clothes!</li>
            <li>It is very nude and perfect to add a little color rather than just a clear coat.</li>
            <li>This shade is so pretty and neutral.  </li>
            <li>I tried this color at the nail salon and totally fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is really a pretty nail color.</li>
            <li>I like OPI polishes, although I don&#x27;t know how much is for the quality and how much is for the fun of the names...but why choose when you can have both?</li>
            <li>Very pretty and looks really professional.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it to be a little more pink.  </li>
            <li>wonder if this is really an OPI product.</li>
            <li>I Really Like This Polish</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like this polish.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Too much a cloudy see-through lacquer.</li>
            <li>Several coats were required and it quickly chipped, as in lasted</li>
            <li>Lovely shade of translucent pink, the natural shade of my nails.  </li>
            <li>I needed a sheer pink for my own French - evidently this one is going to be it. ;}</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear color</li>
            <li>And, bonus, this shade does very well with only one coat!</li>
            <li>Natural color.</li>
            <li>It is almost sheer, so it can be applied for a light sheer look or layered to bring out the pink.</li>
            <li>This works wonderful as a base for my french tips.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend for gals who want a very natural color.</li>

            <li> and it last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a pale pink color, but after 3 applications it&#x27;s like a clear milky color</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Very pretty for a tinted base on a French mani, but still sheer at four coats.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy collections from OPI, rather than the singles, but I had to replace this bottle, along with Barre My Soul, from the Ballet Collection, due to the fact that my Mom wanted to borrow a pale pink shade this summer, and now won&#x27;t give them back!</li>
            <li> Was a little lighter than I expected but it OPI all is well.</li>
            <li> does (for me, at least) need about 2 coats before it actually shows up or hides the imperfections in my nails.</li>
            <li> A bit deeper pale pink would have been nicer, but it will work with almost anything.</li>
            <li> less than 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even with 3 coats it was still too pale for me.  </li>
            <li> More of a beige color very disappointed</li>
            <li> If what you are looking for is a very pale nude -- this color fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> When you get the bottle you&#x27;ll be disappointed until you put it on.</li>
            <li> For OPI it was horrible.  </li>

            <li> For OPI it was horrible.  Several coats were required and it quickly chipped, as in lasted less than 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if this is really an OPI product.</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish!  This shade is so pretty and neutral.  I use to get Gel polish done at the nail salon faithfully until I discovered OPI.  This brand of polish looks great and doesn&#x27;t chip like other nail polish and it last a very long time.  Now, I do my nails at home and save money and the polish looks great and doesn&#x27;t chip as fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the shade is not as described. More of a beige color very disappointed</li>
            <li> I Really Like This Polish,I Like It So Much I&#x27;m Ordering More.Thanks Amazon.P.flagle</li>

These are both shades that were built to blend in, rather than scream \\&quot;I have arrived!\\&quot; but sometimes you need that, and the glitter overlay that was sold with the collection jazzes things up smoothly if you just can&#x27;t take the calm anymore. I like OPI polishes, although I don&#x27;t know how much is for the quality and how much is for the fun of the names...but why choose when you can have both?</li>
            <li> If what you are looking for is a very pale nude -- this color fits the bill.  Even with 3 coats it was still too pale for me.  Would have liked it to be a little more pink.  BUT -- OPI polish stays and does not chip -- is extremely good quality</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love OPI nail polish? Great colors that go on smoothly and have long wear. I don&#x27;t know anybody who doesn&#x27;t love OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> I think this nail polish is so wonderful I love it, makes your nails look like they have lipgoss on. My nails look so shinning and love how the light color looks very pretty on nails and toes great for summer months to wear. Would be great to wear all year around if your not into dark colors. Perfrect color to wear with any outfit as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE it!!!! ENjoyed it&#x27;s clear color and I can wear it anytime and anywhere.  I definitely recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> As usual OPI nail polish is the best I have used. Since using this polish my nails have been in great condition. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Very pretty for a tinted base on a French mani, but still sheer at four coats. Six might do it, but I lost interest lol. I needed a sheer pink for my own French - evidently this one is going to be it. ;}</li>
            <li> Lovely shade of translucent pink, the natural shade of my nails.  It was exactly what I wanted.  And, bonus, this shade does very well with only one coat!</li>
            <li> Natural color. Great product</li>
            <li> This is a light pink color that is a really nice spring color. It is almost sheer, so it can be applied for a light sheer look or layered to bring out the pink.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Great price and shipped promptly ad FREE.</li>
            <li> A bit deeper pale pink would have been nicer, but it will work with almost anything. Also does not stink for days.</li>
            <li> This just looks nice no matter how many coats you apply. With just 2, it&#x27;s a nice sheer polish. 3 or 4 coats is closer to opaque. The quality is great, it&#x27;s easy to put it on, no globs or running.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful subtle color that looks great with OPI &amp;#34;Pirouette my whistle&amp;#34; overtop. OPI lasts forever and does not chip!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, neutral color.</li>
            <li> Was a little lighter than I expected but it OPI all is well. Will try to find a darker one to use with water color nails.</li>
            <li> This is really a pretty nail color. When you get the bottle you&#x27;ll be disappointed until you put it on. It looked to be like it was going to be opaque, but it gives a nice, natural shine just like shown in this picture.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a pale pink color, but after 3 applications it&#x27;s like a clear milky color and you can still see my fingernail.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish.  It wears well, has a nice subtle shade and matches so many of my clothes!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, was a gift and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves the OPI Nail Lacquer and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and looks really professional. It is very nude and perfect to add a little color rather than just a clear coat. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great polish and coverage.</li>
            <li> Too much a cloudy see-through lacquer.</li>
            <li> Beautiful flattering color.  Easy to use.</li>
