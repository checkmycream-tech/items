            <li>However, I was impressed that it did not irritate my gums because they are often quite sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this seemed like the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>was happy to find that the Prime Time Whitening Pen works as well as the product my dentist gave me.  </li>
            <li>So, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get great results</li>
            <li>; on your whitening, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They claim you just apply in &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all well and good as a way to touch up any whitening work you may have had done before.</li>
            <li>I like this whitening pen, but need to use if longer to fairly rate it.</li>
            <li>By the way, the dispenser would be great as a hair-streaking device; it is so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nothing amazing but a noticeable lightening-</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say that the peroxide is effective.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and good results.  </li>
            <li>but if you want a quick, one shot thing for an event it would be great for that.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use--much easier to use then whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I do wish they were more effective.  </li>
            <li>Being able to paint it on your teeth was convenient and not using the clumpy pre-solution was nice.  </li>
            <li>It would be perfect for touch ups after having a professional whitening.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li>So I felt it was safe to try on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I will update the review once I have used it more towards</li>
            <li>way more so than fussing with a strip or a tray,</li>
            <li>want to love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Or you can do it from home with any number of kits from mostly toothpaste</li>
            <li>a day after I brushed my teeth to go to bed, to give the goo the best chance to spend some time on the tooth surfaces.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Anyway, after applying to the top and bottom of my teeth</li>
            <li>So if you have already gotten whitening done by your dentist these pens may be good to help keep it fresh, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working too well for stains.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE how easy these pens are to use.  </li>
            <li>These aren’t cheap, and I can only be diligent about so many things in a day, so the pen would be ideal for me on that count – just grab and go.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use anywhere.  </li>
            <li>It is certainly easy to apply in the pen format.  </li>
            <li>If you want just a shade lighter, this product is one you can apply almost anywhere, very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about as easy as it get.</li>
            <li>but it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t bother me once it&#x27;s on my teeth.</li>
            <li>No after taste, easy to use and it works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to forget and drink or eat something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had no sensitivity to the product, it tastes fine and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this product is probably fine for you.</li>
            <li>If your teeth are already white and you want to use it for maintenance, maybe, but don&#x27;t expect great, noticeable results otherwise.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I did not break out in a rash or even noticeable redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that my teeth started out as a light yellowish color</li>
            <li>So far so good?</li>
            <li>The pens are easy to use, easy to keep handy, and dont make my teeth sensitive like the pro kits do.</li>
            <li>The product was simple to use and had no negative side effects - so I&#x27;d count this experience as a win!</li>
            <li>I noticed the biggest difference in the first couple treatments, but used it about half a dozen times for best results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full treatment session.</li>
            <li>Two pens is enough for a  morning &amp; night treatment for 10 days, so you are getting a fair bit of use for your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Call it our obsession with vanity or our desire to cover up the sins of that daily Starbucks fix, we just want our teeth to look as good as they can.</li>
            <li>It’s something my dentist noticed, and it’s not really bad for a person to have ample saliva, so</li>
            <li>I saw a very mild change in color after the first day, but then nothing since.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty compact and can be easily slipped into a handbag or into a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After having my teeth professionally whitened, my dentist gave me a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; whitening pen that helped keep my teeth light for a good 6 months after the original professional job.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to increase, quickly diluting the gel.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>you just quickly paint on and go &amp;</li>
            <li>I could just quickly brush it on and take off out the door for work.  </li>
            <li>These are a good way to maintain whiteness, or even remove some minor staining.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, none of those things happened when I used Prime Time Smile Fast and Easy Teeth</li>
            <li>this Prime Time Smile Fast and Easy Teeth Whitening Pen product is pretty unique.</li>
            <li>It will fit in the pocket or purse, so very portable.</li>
            <li>I received the Prime Time Smile Teeth</li>
            <li>As long as I am consistent about using it in the morning and evening, I have had good results with keeping my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The delivery system is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t experience any tooth or gum sensitivity after using PRIME TIME SMILE,</li>
            <li>If you do it as directed, applying the gel 2 X a day, it will take 10-days to a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t experience any tooth or gum sensitivity after using PRIME TIME SMILE,</li>
            <li>If you do it as directed, applying the gel 2 X a day, it will take 10-days to a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>My teeth look extremely clean but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>somewhat right before bed time.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty comfortable to use and apply as much liquid as needed.</li>
            <li>It is great for on-the-go people as it is small and travels well.  </li>
            <li>More expensive treatments are more effective.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made like a brush pen an artist would use but instead of water or ink they contain a pretty powerful tooth bleaching formula.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on whether it would do a good job of whitening teeth if you had not previously had a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyway that should give you an idea of how long it will take you to be photo ready for holiday pictures or special occasions.applying to the top and bottom of my teeth</li>
            <li>I did notice some whitening the first couple of days..</li>
            <li>To achieve some kind of effect with this whitening pen, I had to spend some time with it, and it was still not very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The results are not any better than simply using whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want an extra boost to your whitening treatment, I still think whitening strips work much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried a tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li>I give the PRIME TIME SMILE FAST TEETH</li>
            <li>For now it&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>This was my first Whitening attempt.</li>
            <li>I have had low sensitivity issues, and there is only a very mild taste which is mostly minty.</li>
            <li>did whiten my teeth about a good shade whiter, so that there&#x27;s a noticeable difference, and definitely in the white color</li>
            <li>But if this is your first exposure to getting your teeth whitened, forget about it showing that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying it to my teeth, which is fairly simple, you turn the bottom to expel the gel on to the applicator brush and apply to the teeth that are shown when you smile, although you never feel like you get the dosage quite right because you can turn too much and that pumps more gel out, but if you don&#x27;t turn enough some teeth won&#x27;t get covered, so I think the whitening strips are much easier in this regard.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>I am not noticing much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li>But, if you are really looking to whiten your teeth, start with something else and use this as an in between whitenings</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as a whitening strip.</li>
            <li>I wondered about that, but it seemed not to make too much difference.</li>
            <li>You can go see a dentist and have him do all those fancy-schmancy teeth whitening gimmicks with the gels, blue light and trays to wear.</li>
            <li>The whole reason I wanted a stick</li>
            <li>do I really want to be consuming it?  </li>
            <li>would say this is working slowly but surely - no unpleasant taste, VERY easy to use,</li>
            <li>Self contained and easy to take a long.  </li>
            <li>I loved that this was so portable - put one in my purse and left the other in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the last couple years my teeth have gotten a little stained (coffee and tea drinker), and I&#x27;ve found these teeth whitening pens do a good job of restoring them to the color I&#x27;d achieved at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>Anyway that should give you an idea of how long it will take you to be photo ready for holiday pictures or special occasions.</li>
            <li>This is a peroxide and alcohol blend in a clever brush-type dispenser.</li>
            <li>(though it&#x27;s not instructed to do so) because I didn&#x27;t want the solution to be disturbed by my lips, plus I didn&#x27;t want the inside of my lips to be in constant contact with the hydrogen peroxide, so I would keep them open for a minute or so, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>(though it&#x27;s not instructed to do so) because I didn&#x27;t want the solution to be disturbed by my lips, plus I didn&#x27;t want the inside of my lips to be in constant contact with the hydrogen peroxide, so I would keep them open for a minute or so, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Teeth whitening products have been a huge boon to the dental industry over the past decade or so and this service used to only be for famous movie stars and people who work in television.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive teeth be cautious!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence about this product; the first use I could see a definite bleaching on my teeth-</li>
            <li>In my experience, it&#x27;s better to avoid the gums when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the whitening, it&#x27;s hard to compare.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really hard to keep from having the stuff wash off with saliva or rub off from touching your lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this whitening pen and the Dual action one that has the pre-solution.  </li>
            <li>But, like the Dual action one, the results were practically non-existent.  </li>
            <li>I had my teeth professionally whitened (Zoom)</li>
            <li>And maybe it beats the strips for me, the person too busy / scatterbrained to do the strips, often.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking to remove years of tobacco and coffee stains, you should save your money for a professional job.  </li>
            <li>I had to do it this way because I always drink water while reading and just before turning in, so I couldn&#x27;t do the pen at that time because I had to make a conscious effort not to eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li>And you have to do this twice a day for ten days straight.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t continue with the 2nd treatment tube because I was finding each day the irritation and dryness of lips, mouth and throat were lasting longer and becoming more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>use, you brush your teeth (not floss, just brush), twist the dial until the gel is visible, brush it onto your front teeth (as far to the sides as appear when you smile), and then you don&#x27;t eat or drink for half an hour.</li>
            <li>However, without the “shielding” of the solid part of traditional strips, I have to wonder if I am getting much bleaching action from this pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are not particularly stained because I use whitening toothpaste, but there was a distinct lightening to the color of my teeth visible as soon as the next day.</li>
            <li>With the whitening strips from other brands, since they&#x27;re covering your teeth throughout the process, you can&#x27;t really eat or drink anything with them on, so it&#x27;s not that much of an effort, but with the PRIME TIME PENS you only have the gel on your teeth, which feels like nothing, so</li>
            <li>The good thing is if it doesn&#x27;t do what you thought, at least you didn&#x27;t waste a butt load of money on it.</li>
            <li>On the upside, it was not uncomfortable to use and it did not burn or sting like other treatments often can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Others have said they&#x27;re highly sensitive and this caused pain, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to see how much gel is actually being applied to your teeth, and there are not instructions/directions recommending how many times to twist the pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I’m the person who always forgets to complete the strip regimen because it is just a big P.I.A.  </li>
            <li>The directions seemed clear enough but as the treatment days passed, I discovered that I had a lot of product left when the tube should have been used up.</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for nearly a month now, shortly after getting my teeth cleaned at my regular check-up.</li>
            <li>This is a very nifty little item.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As long as I am consistent about using it in the morning and evening, I have had good results with keeping my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The delivery system is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t experience any tooth or gum sensitivity after using PRIME TIME SMILE,</li>
            <li> If you do it as directed, applying the gel 2 X a day, it will take 10-days to a whiter smile.</li>

            <li> If you do it as directed, applying the gel 2 X a day, it will take 10-days to a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> My teeth look extremely clean but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> somewhat right before bed time.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty comfortable to use and apply as much liquid as needed.</li>
            <li> It is great for on-the-go people as it is small and travels well.  </li>
            <li> More expensive treatments are more effective.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made like a brush pen an artist would use but instead of water or ink they contain a pretty powerful tooth bleaching formula.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on whether it would do a good job of whitening teeth if you had not previously had a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyway that should give you an idea of how long it will take you to be photo ready for holiday pictures or special occasions.applying to the top and bottom of my teeth</li>
            <li> I did notice some whitening the first couple of days..</li>
            <li> To achieve some kind of effect with this whitening pen, I had to spend some time with it, and it was still not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The results are not any better than simply using whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want an extra boost to your whitening treatment, I still think whitening strips work much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li> I give the PRIME TIME SMILE FAST TEETH</li>
            <li> For now it&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> This was my first Whitening attempt.</li>
            <li> I have had low sensitivity issues, and there is only a very mild taste which is mostly minty.</li>
            <li> did whiten my teeth about a good shade whiter, so that there&#x27;s a noticeable difference, and definitely in the white color</li>
            <li> But if this is your first exposure to getting your teeth whitened, forget about it showing that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying it to my teeth, which is fairly simple, you turn the bottom to expel the gel on to the applicator brush and apply to the teeth that are shown when you smile, although you never feel like you get the dosage quite right because you can turn too much and that pumps more gel out, but if you don&#x27;t turn enough some teeth won&#x27;t get covered, so I think the whitening strips are much easier in this regard.</li>
            <li> They really work.</li>
            <li> I am not noticing much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li> But, if you are really looking to whiten your teeth, start with something else and use this as an in between whitenings</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as a whitening strip.</li>
            <li> I wondered about that, but it seemed not to make too much difference.</li>
            <li> You can go see a dentist and have him do all those fancy-schmancy teeth whitening gimmicks with the gels, blue light and trays to wear.</li>
            <li> The whole reason I wanted a stick</li>
            <li> do I really want to be consuming it?  </li>
            <li> would say this is working slowly but surely - no unpleasant taste, VERY easy to use,</li>
            <li> Self contained and easy to take a long.  </li>
            <li> I loved that this was so portable - put one in my purse and left the other in my bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the last couple years my teeth have gotten a little stained (coffee and tea drinker), and I&#x27;ve found these teeth whitening pens do a good job of restoring them to the color I&#x27;d achieved at the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Anyway that should give you an idea of how long it will take you to be photo ready for holiday pictures or special occasions.</li>
            <li> This is a peroxide and alcohol blend in a clever brush-type dispenser.</li>
            <li> (though it&#x27;s not instructed to do so) because I didn&#x27;t want the solution to be disturbed by my lips, plus I didn&#x27;t want the inside of my lips to be in constant contact with the hydrogen peroxide, so I would keep them open for a minute or so, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> (though it&#x27;s not instructed to do so) because I didn&#x27;t want the solution to be disturbed by my lips, plus I didn&#x27;t want the inside of my lips to be in constant contact with the hydrogen peroxide, so I would keep them open for a minute or so, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Teeth whitening products have been a huge boon to the dental industry over the past decade or so and this service used to only be for famous movie stars and people who work in television.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive teeth be cautious!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product; the first use I could see a definite bleaching on my teeth-</li>
            <li> In my experience, it&#x27;s better to avoid the gums when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the whitening, it&#x27;s hard to compare.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really hard to keep from having the stuff wash off with saliva or rub off from touching your lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this whitening pen and the Dual action one that has the pre-solution.  </li>
            <li> But, like the Dual action one, the results were practically non-existent.  </li>
            <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened (Zoom)</li>
            <li> And maybe it beats the strips for me, the person too busy / scatterbrained to do the strips, often.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to remove years of tobacco and coffee stains, you should save your money for a professional job.  </li>
            <li> I had to do it this way because I always drink water while reading and just before turning in, so I couldn&#x27;t do the pen at that time because I had to make a conscious effort not to eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> And you have to do this twice a day for ten days straight.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t continue with the 2nd treatment tube because I was finding each day the irritation and dryness of lips, mouth and throat were lasting longer and becoming more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> use, you brush your teeth (not floss, just brush), twist the dial until the gel is visible, brush it onto your front teeth (as far to the sides as appear when you smile), and then you don&#x27;t eat or drink for half an hour.</li>
            <li> However, without the “shielding” of the solid part of traditional strips, I have to wonder if I am getting much bleaching action from this pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are not particularly stained because I use whitening toothpaste, but there was a distinct lightening to the color of my teeth visible as soon as the next day.</li>
            <li> With the whitening strips from other brands, since they&#x27;re covering your teeth throughout the process, you can&#x27;t really eat or drink anything with them on, so it&#x27;s not that much of an effort, but with the PRIME TIME PENS you only have the gel on your teeth, which feels like nothing, so</li>
            <li> The good thing is if it doesn&#x27;t do what you thought, at least you didn&#x27;t waste a butt load of money on it.</li>
            <li> On the upside, it was not uncomfortable to use and it did not burn or sting like other treatments often can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others have said they&#x27;re highly sensitive and this caused pain, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to see how much gel is actually being applied to your teeth, and there are not instructions/directions recommending how many times to twist the pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I’m the person who always forgets to complete the strip regimen because it is just a big P.I.A.  </li>
            <li> The directions seemed clear enough but as the treatment days passed, I discovered that I had a lot of product left when the tube should have been used up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for nearly a month now, shortly after getting my teeth cleaned at my regular check-up.</li>
            <li> This is a very nifty little item.</li>
            <li> at least I think trays, or at least strips that you take off and then throw away, are the best way to go because I want to rinse my mouth afterwards rather than swallow chemicals, and I don&#x27;t want to be forced not to drink anything for an hour everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I suspect that the vast majority of the peroxide and alcohol are diluted and swallowed long before the 30 minutes have passed.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a plus, and I didn&#x27;t really get a strange taste from it, but maybe that&#x27;s because I kept my lips and mouth open with my teeth closed for a few minutes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thus it is impossible to compare this to the kind they sell at the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening products in the past that worked a bit faster, but the tradeoff was that your teeth became INCREDIBLY sensitive (breathing with your mouth open while outside?</li>
            <li> I think this one is the same white solution as in the other box.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, MUCH less expensive, and seemingly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I recently found a partially used set of strips in my bathroom cabinet, which expired in 2011!  </li>
            <li> But the benefit is noticeably less than with traditional strips, so an on-the-fence three stars from me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get my teeth WHITE, like people do with the expensive stuff your dentist sells.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to say how much it whitens because I had my teeth cleaned recently</li>
            <li> I brushed a few strands of my hair with this about five minutes before shampooing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fast.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not really telling a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are not a real replacement for that.  </li>
            <li> This seems to whiten my teeth but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working on the harder Diet Coke stains on my front teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have not had the problems other people have stated they&#x27;ve encountered with this product.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself or your teeth if you try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of other whitening methods and didn&#x27;t expect to like this one either</li>
            <li> but the lightening seemed to get no better with subsequent uses.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat how easy it is to use and doesn&#x27;t have to bad of a taste.</li>
            <li> works but loses one star because of the issues above.</li>
            <li> works but loses one star because of the issues above.</li>
            <li> You take off the cap and twist the other end of the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; to advance the teeth cleaner to the little brush.</li>
            <li> All you do is paint it on your teeth a few times during the day, being careful to avoid your gums ( it stings a little if you let it touch.).</li>
            <li> It has visibly brightened my teeth about a half shade.</li>
            <li> ; as their advertisement claims is because I don&#x27;t have the time to mess around with trays and the like.  </li>
            <li> The taste is also a little off putting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I have seen a little whitening..</li>
            <li> In the past, using other teeth cleaners, the little plastic strips, they used to start washing out of my mouth in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> it was not a strong flavor that made me not want to use it.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to use compared to other whitening tools - those messy, awful strips, for instance.  </li>
            <li> This apparently has a different chemical base, so that is not a problem, either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when using it, the taste is not very good</li>

            <li> When I say that I have a lot of saliva, I don’t mean I’m drooling on my shoes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t have badly stained teeth but because I drink a lot of tea and coffee they aren&#x27;t as white as I&#x27;d like them to be.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t too bad and it&#x27;s simple to brush on the stuff and forget about it.</li>
            <li> I think there was a subtle whitening; if you are looking for a dramatic change, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> You brush it on and have to wait approximately 30 minutes before eating.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity to the other teeth cleaners, and they are actually painful.</li>
            <li> The product had a weird taste to it - tho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is difficult because of saliva production.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to admit I buy these over and over. They really work. Teeth are noticeably whiter after just a couple days. Very easy to use. Just wish each pen lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how easy these pens are to use.  Self contained and easy to take a long.  I do wish they were more effective.  I am not noticing much in the way of results.  The taste is also a little off putting.</li>
            <li> I received the Prime Time Smile Teeth Whitening Pens thru the Vine program.  I used them for 10 days as is directed.  I did notice some whitening the first couple of days..but that is about it.  I really didn&#x27;t get my teeth WHITE, like people do with the expensive stuff your dentist sells.  The product had a weird taste to it - tho it was not a strong flavor that made me not want to use it.  I have sensitive teeth and this did not bother them.  I loved that this was so portable - put one in my purse and left the other in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;d have to recommend this perhaps as a &amp;#34;between whitenings&amp;#34; type of product.  It is great for on-the-go people as it is small and travels well.  It is easy to use anywhere.  But, if you are really looking to whiten your teeth, start with something else and use this as an in between whitenings product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this whitening pen and the Dual action one that has the pre-solution.  I think this one is the same white solution as in the other box.  Like the Dual action one, the taste wasn&#x27;t bad. Being able to paint it on your teeth was convenient and not using the clumpy pre-solution was nice.  But, like the Dual action one, the results were practically non-existent.  I saw a very mild change in color after the first day, but then nothing since.  When the instructions say you need to turn the knob a lot of times to get the solution to move into the brush, they weren&#x27;t kidding.  Painting it on your teeth is convenient, but I don&#x27;t think it stays on, even without eating or drinking or rinsing for 30 minutes.  If your teeth are already white and you want to use it for maintenance, maybe, but don&#x27;t expect great, noticeable results otherwise.</li>
            <li> After having my teeth professionally whitened, my dentist gave me a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; whitening pen that helped keep my teeth light for a good 6 months after the original professional job.  When it ran out, I asked to buy another from my dentist, but they only offered it with a  $99 whitening procedure.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find that the Prime Time Whitening Pen works as well as the product my dentist gave me.  As long as I am consistent about using it in the morning and evening, I have had good results with keeping my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;I have had no sensitivity to the product, it tastes fine and is easy to use.  I can&#x27;t really comment on whether it would do a good job of whitening teeth if you had not previously had a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is a peroxide and alcohol blend in a clever brush-type dispenser. It&#x27;s difficult for me to say how much it whitens because I had my teeth cleaned recently so they weren&#x27;t too bad when I started using this. However, I was impressed that it did not irritate my gums because they are often quite sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this, I tested it for allergy by brushing some on the inside of my elbow and leaving it overnight. Fortunately I did not break out in a rash or even noticeable redness. So I felt it was safe to try on my teeth. Again, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had showed the package to my dental hygienist and she said the ingredients should work except that the strength is not listed. Thus it is impossible to compare this to the kind they sell at the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried an off-label experiment. I brushed a few strands of my hair with this about five minutes before shampooing. It did brighten the strands so I&#x27;d say that the peroxide is effective. By the way, the dispenser would be great as a hair-streaking device; it is so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for teeth whitening are to leave the gel on for 30 minutes. I&#x27;d say this is difficult because of saliva production. It seemed to increase, quickly diluting the gel. So I can&#x27;t give this an unqualified recommendation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as a whitening strip. It would be perfect for touch ups after having a professional whitening. You can&#x27;t beat how easy it is to use and doesn&#x27;t have to bad of a taste.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feeling about this product. It&#x27;s very easy and convenient to use--much easier to use then whitening strips. The brush is pretty comfortable to use and apply as much liquid as needed. It&#x27;s also pretty compact and can be easily slipped into a handbag or into a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when using it, the taste is not very good and there&#x27;s an unpleasant feeling on the teeth afterwards. In my experience, it&#x27;s better to avoid the gums when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the whitening, it&#x27;s hard to compare. More expensive treatments are more effective. To achieve some kind of effect with this whitening pen, I had to spend some time with it, and it was still not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this product a 3 star review for now. I have not had the problems other people have stated they&#x27;ve encountered with this product. I have had low sensitivity issues, and there is only a very mild taste which is mostly minty. Others have said they&#x27;re highly sensitive and this caused pain, but everyone is different. So if you have sensitive teeth be cautious! Otherwise this product is probably fine for you. I have used this system twice now, along with my whitening toothpaste (Crest 3D White) and Listerine whitening mouth wash. It has visibly brightened my teeth about a half shade. I will update the review once I have used it more towards it&#x27;s full treatment session.</li>
            <li> 1) It&#x27;s not fast. You have to use this product for several days in a row before you see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s difficult to see how much gel is actually being applied to your teeth, and there are not instructions/directions recommending how many times to twist the pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The results are not any better than simply using whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an extra boost to your whitening treatment, I still think whitening strips work much better.</li>
            <li> So far so good? I&#x27;ve used whitening products in the past that worked a bit faster, but the tradeoff was that your teeth became INCREDIBLY sensitive (breathing with your mouth open while outside? shooting pains. Plus random shooting pains even when there wasn&#x27;t air hitting your teeth).&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is working slowly but surely - no unpleasant taste, VERY easy to use, way more so than fussing with a strip or a tray, and I&#x27;d buy this again. Two pens is enough for a  morning &amp; night treatment for 10 days, so you are getting a fair bit of use for your money.&lt;br /&gt;To use, you brush your teeth (not floss, just brush), twist the dial until the gel is visible, brush it onto your front teeth (as far to the sides as appear when you smile), and then you don&#x27;t eat or drink for half an hour. It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
            <li> This is a very nifty little item. It is the size of a ball point pen. It will fit in the pocket or purse, so very portable. You take off the cap and twist the other end of the &amp;#34;pen&amp;#34; to advance the teeth cleaner to the little brush. You then &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; the cleaner on your front teeth. You are not supposed to disturb the cleaner for 30 minutes, then you are done. One problem I have with this, is that I am I guess, an over salivator. I wondered about that, but it seemed not to make too much difference. In the past, using other teeth cleaners, the little plastic strips, they used to start washing out of my mouth in a few minutes. There are no strips here, so no problem with that. I have sensitivity to the other teeth cleaners, and they are actually painful. This apparently has a different chemical base, so that is not a problem, either. I would recommend a try for this product if you wish to try to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and effective.  Just paint it on and go.  I had my teeth professionally whitened (Zoom) a couple years ago, and I had no idea how painful it was.  I don&#x27;t think I could go that route again.  Over the last couple years my teeth have gotten a little stained (coffee and tea drinker), and I&#x27;ve found these teeth whitening pens do a good job of restoring them to the color I&#x27;d achieved at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I noticed the biggest difference in the first couple treatments, but used it about half a dozen times for best results.</li>
            <li> When I say that I have a lot of saliva, I don’t mean I’m drooling on my shoes.  It’s something my dentist noticed, and it’s not really bad for a person to have ample saliva, so I don’t worry about it.  However, without the “shielding” of the solid part of traditional strips, I have to wonder if I am getting much bleaching action from this pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to love it.  I’m the person who always forgets to complete the strip regimen because it is just a big P.I.A.  I kid you not:  I recently found a partially used set of strips in my bathroom cabinet, which expired in 2011!  These aren’t cheap, and I can only be diligent about so many things in a day, so the pen would be ideal for me on that count – just grab and go.  (Remembering, of course, not to eat or drink for 30 minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I suspect that the vast majority of the peroxide and alcohol are diluted and swallowed long before the 30 minutes have passed.  I’m getting a whitening effect, yes.  And maybe it beats the strips for me, the person too busy / scatterbrained to do the strips, often.  But the benefit is noticeably less than with traditional strips, so an on-the-fence three stars from me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  So easy to use and good results.  Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> my kit came and the light was broken... also only one of the two tubes had gel in it</li>
            <li> Teeth whitening products have been a huge boon to the dental industry over the past decade or so and this service used to only be for famous movie stars and people who work in television. But not anymore. Call it our obsession with vanity or our desire to cover up the sins of that daily Starbucks fix, we just want our teeth to look as good as they can. You can go see a dentist and have him do all those fancy-schmancy teeth whitening gimmicks with the gels, blue light and trays to wear. Or you can do it from home with any number of kits from mostly toothpaste companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Prime Time Smile Fast and Easy Teeth Whitening Pen product is pretty unique. It&#x27;s simple, MUCH less expensive, and seemingly easy to use. They claim you just apply in &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re good to go. That&#x27;s all well and good as a way to touch up any whitening work you may have had done before. But if this is your first exposure to getting your teeth whitened, forget about it showing that much of a difference. There are a lot of factors that will determine whether this will work for you or not. The good thing is if it doesn&#x27;t do what you thought, at least you didn&#x27;t waste a butt load of money on it. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for nearly a month now, shortly after getting my teeth cleaned at my regular check-up. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not really telling a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using, I asked my dental hygienist whether or not I could use it, and she said no problem. However, she also said that it was not pharmaceutical grade and that it would probably not make a difference on my teeth. She was right. I do have some deep staining from years of coffee and cigarettes. This pen made no difference on these stains. On the upside, it was not uncomfortable to use and it did not burn or sting like other treatments often can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, and if you get your teeth cleaned regularly you may not see a difference. On the other hand, you&#x27;re not going to hurt yourself or your teeth if you try it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1UH1X41ZZX0SF]]Expect one shade of white improvement. It&#x27;s not expensive and so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a tooth whitener.  It is certainly easy to apply in the pen format.  I used it once a day after I brushed my teeth to go to bed, to give the goo the best chance to spend some time on the tooth surfaces.  I think there was a subtle whitening; if you are looking for a dramatic change, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  If you want just a shade lighter, this product is one you can apply almost anywhere, very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been rather skeptical of teeth whiteners. I always thought that it a) wouldn&#x27;t work, b) would somehow hurt, cause sensitivity, or c) make the user look like Ross from that unfortunate episode of FRIENDS. Luckily, none of those things happened when I used Prime Time Smile Fast and Easy Teeth Whitening Pens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t say that my teeth looked like the picture on the box, they definitely were whiter. Plus, I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity! The product was simple to use and had no negative side effects - so I&#x27;d count this experience as a win!</li>
            <li> I like this whitening pen, but need to use if longer to fairly rate it. I have noticed that it is whitening my teeth some. It&#x27;s easy to apply. You turn the dial and the stuff is dispensed and you brush it on your teeth. That&#x27;s about as easy as it get. And then you wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but I have seen a little whitening..</li>
            <li> I actually like using this. I&#x27;m not a fan of other whitening methods and didn&#x27;t expect to like this one either but it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t bother me once it&#x27;s on my teeth. You brush it on and have to wait approximately 30 minutes before eating. The only problem I have is that I notice no whitening. My teeth look extremely clean but it doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li> No after taste, easy to use and it works. You can see the difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will purchase in store when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product; the first use I could see a definite bleaching on my teeth- nothing amazing but a noticeable lightening- but the lightening seemed to get no better with subsequent uses. I was disappointed. And it&#x27;s really hard to keep from having the stuff wash off with saliva or rub off from touching your lips. So, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get great results but if you want a quick, one shot thing for an event it would be great for that. The delivery system is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Why haven&#x27;t I used these before?! They&#x27;re made like a brush pen an artist would use but instead of water or ink they contain a pretty powerful tooth bleaching formula. All you do is paint it on your teeth a few times during the day, being careful to avoid your gums ( it stings a little if you let it touch.). My teeth are not particularly stained because I use whitening toothpaste, but there was a distinct lightening to the color of my teeth visible as soon as the next day. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used the proffessional whitening kits provided by my dentist.  These are not a real replacement for that.  These are a good way to maintain whiteness, or even remove some minor staining.  If you are looking to remove years of tobacco and coffee stains, you should save your money for a professional job.  If you just want a &amp;#34;tune up&amp;#34; on your whitening, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt like the taste, but who would expect to?  The pens are easy to use, easy to keep handy, and dont make my teeth sensitive like the pro kits do.</li>
            <li> I give the PRIME TIME SMILE FAST TEETH WHITENING PENS a solid four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t have badly stained teeth but because I drink a lot of tea and coffee they aren&#x27;t as white as I&#x27;d like them to be. I&#x27;d say that my teeth started out as a light yellowish color and so I gave these pens a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did whiten my teeth about a good shade whiter, so that there&#x27;s a noticeable difference, and definitely in the white color category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it once a day, rather than the twice a day as instructed (and sometimes I skipped a day because I forgot) somewhat right before bed time. You cannot eat or drink anything for thirty minutes after applying, so what I would do is after brushing my teeth at night ( they recommend brushing teeth, but not flossing before application) I&#x27;d apply the gel and then wait for 30-minutes while watching the rest of my TV shows and then after that was done, I could go back to my nightly ritual of reading, which means I stay up about an hour or so after. I had to do it this way because I always drink water while reading and just before turning in, so I couldn&#x27;t do the pen at that time because I had to make a conscious effort not to eat or drink anything. With the whitening strips from other brands, since they&#x27;re covering your teeth throughout the process, you can&#x27;t really eat or drink anything with them on, so it&#x27;s not that much of an effort, but with the PRIME TIME PENS you only have the gel on your teeth, which feels like nothing, so it&#x27;s easy to forget and drink or eat something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it to my teeth, which is fairly simple, you turn the bottom to expel the gel on to the applicator brush and apply to the teeth that are shown when you smile, although you never feel like you get the dosage quite right because you can turn too much and that pumps more gel out, but if you don&#x27;t turn enough some teeth won&#x27;t get covered, so I think the whitening strips are much easier in this regard. Anyway, after applying to the top and bottom of my teeth I felt like I had to keep my mouth and lips open (though it&#x27;s not instructed to do so) because I didn&#x27;t want the solution to be disturbed by my lips, plus I didn&#x27;t want the inside of my lips to be in constant contact with the hydrogen peroxide, so I would keep them open for a minute or so, which I&#x27;m sure gave me a half-crazed expression. With the strips you don&#x27;t have to worry about this since your mouth doesn&#x27;t come into contact with the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any tooth or gum sensitivity after using PRIME TIME SMILE, so that&#x27;s a plus, and I didn&#x27;t really get a strange taste from it, but maybe that&#x27;s because I kept my lips and mouth open with my teeth closed for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works but loses one star because of the issues above. If you do it as directed, applying the gel 2 X a day, it will take 10-days to a whiter smile. If you do it like me, figure about 20 days if you do it just 1 X a day. Anyway that should give you an idea of how long it will take you to be photo ready for holiday pictures or special occasions.applying to the top and bottom of my teeth I felt like I had to keep my mouth and lips open (though it&#x27;s not instructed to do so) because I didn&#x27;t want the solution to be disturbed by my lips, plus I didn&#x27;t want the inside of my lips to be in constant contact with the hydrogen peroxide, so I would keep them open for a minute or so, which I&#x27;m sure gave me a half-crazed expression.

            <li> This seems to whiten my teeth but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working on the harder Diet Coke stains on my front teeth.  Still, I&#x27;ve used this for almost two weeks (11 days) and do notice some whitening but nothing like the photo on the box.  So if you have already gotten whitening done by your dentist these pens may be good to help keep it fresh, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working too well for stains.  I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s all gone, but am not expecting a miracle.  If the miracle happens, I&#x27;ll update my review.  For now it&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> This was my first Whitening attempt. The directions seemed clear enough but as the treatment days passed, I discovered that I had a lot of product left when the tube should have been used up. I didn&#x27;t continue with the 2nd treatment tube because I was finding each day the irritation and dryness of lips, mouth and throat were lasting longer and becoming more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use compared to other whitening tools - those messy, awful strips, for instance.  After about 10 days I can see a difference.  The taste isn&#x27;t too bad and it&#x27;s simple to brush on the stuff and forget about it.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it and post a review with my results, but now it&#x27;s been well over a month and I&#x27;ve never even used it.  With that said, I obviously can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness in actually whitening your teeth, but let me explain why I never used it.  The whole reason I wanted a stick you just quickly paint on and go &amp;#34;in seconds&amp;#34; as their advertisement claims is because I don&#x27;t have the time to mess around with trays and the like.  I knew if I was going to have to do all that I&#x27;d never actually use it so this seemed like the perfect solution.  I could just quickly brush it on and take off out the door for work.  The problem that they don&#x27;t tell you until you get the box and read the directions is that you once you brush this on you&#x27;re not allowed to eat, or drink, or have any liquids in your mouth for the next thirty minutes, and that continually put me off.  There&#x27;s simply not a time when I don&#x27;t have a bottle of water with me.  I even take a glass of water to bed.  It made doing it in the morning impossible because then you can&#x27;t drink your coffee on the way to work.  And you have to do this twice a day for ten days straight.  It was such an inconvenience that I never wanted to do it and kept putting it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got to thinking that these liquids they want me to avoid drinking must be so I&#x27;m not rinsing this stuff off and swallowing the gel, but you still have saliva in your mouth and whatever is in this product do I really want to be consuming it?  That&#x27;s why for me at least I think trays, or at least strips that you take off and then throw away, are the best way to go because I want to rinse my mouth afterwards rather than swallow chemicals, and I don&#x27;t want to be forced not to drink anything for an hour everyday.  If any of that is going to bother you too I&#x27;d steer clear of this product.</li>
