            <li> You get what you pay for, but i would spend a little extra money and get</li>
            <li> Came 3 days before expected.</li>
            <li> You can use hair dressing, detangler as well as other products on her hair</li>
            <li> My razor wasn&#x27;t sharp anymore.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very long, which my little one loves.</li>
            <li> It is a very realistic-looking face/head which I find creepy</li>

            <li> I GOT IT TO TEACH MY 2 LITTLE GIRLS HOW TO DO HAIR</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the quality was awful</li>
            <li> I purchased this mannequin to refresh my updo skills for an upcoming wedding I will be doing hair for. The hair is fine, I would rather practice on a real person, But this is fine.</li>
            <li> Bought to practice doing hair styles,worked out great,fast shipping</li>
            <li> My daughters age 10 12 and 14 loved them.they helped them learn how to do braids. Also now there learning how to blow dry and curl.</li>
            <li> This manikin was way different than what the picture showed..her face was smashed when I opened it an I was very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter to play with.  Her hair is nice and can be brushed, washed, curled etc.  Her hair is very long, which my little one loves.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do anything curling wise with the hair. And when I cut it the hair matted up. Good for braiding I guess...</li>
            <li> This mannequin head is so good.  Her hair feels real.  My daughter loves her.  We hate her because she scares us in the middle of the night! LOL</li>
            <li> The crown came bald and the hair was falling out. Can&#x27;t put heat to the hair and it&#x27;s does not have real hair</li>
            <li> The hair falls off easily and it is also hard to curl. The stand doesn&#x27;t stay still either its good but im afraid it will get bald soon lol. Its. A good thing to practice on but it would be up to you guys if you want to order</li>
            <li> Really well done for synthetic fiber hair - I&#x27;m happy with the purchase - just don&#x27;t use a flat iron on it! LOL  Works great with curling iron, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this,it is very well made and i love the way the hair parts. It&#x27;s like i&#x27;m doing a real human head.The hair flows very well.The only thing i hate is the fact that i thought the head was the size of a real human head.Other than that i love it and i am very satisfied.I would recommend this to others and i would buy from here again.It also came quickly.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 11 year old granddaughter. She loves it. What a great alternative activity to take her away from her cell phone sometimes. That is an accomplishment. A great gift for someone who loves to play with hairstyles.</li>
            <li> SHOWN HERE THE DOLL HAS WAY MORE HAIR THIS WAS FOR ME BAD..  CONSIDERING I GOT IT TO TEACH MY 2 LITTLE GIRLS HOW TO DO HAIR ....... I&#x27;D SAY IT WORTH 25 $$ WITH FREE SHIPPING .. IT GET 2 STARS.</li>
            <li> The stand does not fit. And the hair sheds way to much. I&#x27;m surprised she isn&#x27;t bald yet. Don&#x27;t really care for it</li>
            <li> nice doll head. loved that it came with the mounting device my daughter loves to practice the different hair styles</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year olds birthday after looking at the barbie heads that are ment for little girls. This was better quality and cheaper and my daughter absolutely loves doing her hair. I love that it came with a clamp so we leave it up in her bathroom for her so she can style it when ever she wants. Much better than those crappy tiny barbie heads that rat up and cant stay up by themselves</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 9 year old daughter for Christmas.  Its great for her as she loves applying makeup to it and braiding the hair.  Not sure if it would work great for an adult learning how to perm/color/style hair as the hair is synthetic and doesn&#x27;t have the same feel as real hair.</li>
            <li> I am a Cosmetologist and so far this manikin has been an excellent tool to advance with my hairstyles. I love it!! the price is amazing too</li>
            <li> This was in perfect condition and worked just as we had hoped! My daughter loved it so much and is constantly braiding!</li>
            <li> My daughter has now bought 2 separate doll heads and stands.  She likes these.</li>
            <li> face material is not the same as on a regular cosmetic head....It is just too smooth to practice facepaintimg on....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter so she could practice braiding and I wouldn&#x27;t have to be her guinea pig anymore.  It serves its purpose,  but the hair does get matted quickly.</li>
            <li> Really great, came faster than i expected.. Long soft realistic hair, if you want to learn how to do hairstyles this is the perfect doll for you and it comes with a table stand which is perfect to hold the head for you.</li>
            <li> This is a good manniken except I expected the hair to be thicker, I quickly got over that tho. The hair is in fact WELL layered at the tips, worth the money :]</li>
            <li> I like the mannequin head&#x27;s hair it is gorgeous yet the head is very small but worth the price I will find a way to increase the size due,to buying it to make wigs that is the only down fall</li>
            <li> My 11 year old purchased this mannequin head with her own earned money and is very pleased.  She makes the cutest styles.  You can use hair dressing, detangler as well as other products on her hair and it makes is smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> the way her hair is sewn in made it hard to cut all her hair did was fall to the front!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Great quality.  Hair is easy to work with. Wonderful that the head is adjustable and can be attached.</li>
            <li> She was bald, Her face was had bents in it. The hair is so think that you can not put in any clips in her head, I got my money back, So happy I use Paypal, This is JUNK</li>
            <li> my niece loves to do hair. it was a Christmas gift. she has been able to do so many different things with it. the stand is sturdy. arrived immediately. brand new condition</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece.  It is a very realistic-looking face/head which I find creepy but my niece LOVES.  The table clench is very helpful so she doesn&#x27;t have to hold it in her lap.</li>
            <li> STAND GOOD FACE CUTE HAIR THIN AND ONLY CAN COMB IN A SWIRL. I COULD NOT USE FOR STATE BOARD I HAD TO PURCHASE ONE FROM LOCAL SALLY&#x27; S</li>
            <li> It works great for my school studies. I love that it has the rotating stand and I can clamp it to the table while I do it&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Angela&#x27;s hair is thin on top so you see a lot of &amp;#34;scalp&amp;#34; wherever you part her hair. Her hair sheds badly so I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll last too long. When I opened the box I was surprised at how much smaller her head is then other mannequins I own. And on a frivolous note, I don&#x27;t care for her look. Her nose is squashed in or something for an unflattering profile.</li>
            <li> Great buyv...just as pictured</li>
            <li> Purchased for nieces who love to style hair.  They love it and say it works really well - better than the toy styling heads designed for kids.</li>
            <li> i am a cosmetologist and when i used a doll head from school the hair doesn&#x27;t burn off nor stay on the curling iron and this doll the hair sticks to the curling iron is there anyway i can return it?</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  My child enjoys combing this dolls hair for hours.  The stand makes it a practical doll as she is able to comb the hair with both hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my styling head. It works perfectly!  I have no problems with this item at all and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Brought for granddaughter... Happy with Angela....Love it came with stand, shipping fast, head &amp; stand wrap nice, face &amp;hair look like pic.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my head to practice on it. But if i were to french braid the hair, there would be a bald spot every place where i pulled hair into the braid. Also, in the front of the head, there were a lot of hairs that were shorter than the rest and stuck straight up. While combing through, a lot of the hair fell out or broke off. You get what you pay for, but i would spend a little extra money and get a better head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... On a positive note, it came through the mail really fast!</li>
            <li> I needed the real hair . This fake hair was so hard for me to cut. It ruined my razor. My razor wasn&#x27;t sharp anymore.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this to learn how to braid hair. Very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Hair tangles very easily!! Use only for cut and or styling</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t take heat. Its too small and of poor quality. Not a good choice if your trying to practice</li>
            <li> Came 3 days before expected. LOVE THE HAIR! It&#x27;s so soft. Can&#x27;t wait to work with it. And I like the stand, actually like it more than the one that came in my school kit.</li>
            <li> I would like to appologize for my bad comment on your product .I realized it was my fault for not reading properly. I wont be able to send it back though cause i have aleady  used them .I am truly sorry</li>
            <li> Awful. If you are a barber or cosmotolgy student, invest in a Jake. Hair is thin and falls out in clumps. Tangles SUPER easily and is hard to work with. 3 inches uneven from one side to the other. Not even remotely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It iss good for teaching your daughters and granddaughters how to style their hair.</li>
            <li> Good for demoing updos and braiding</li>
