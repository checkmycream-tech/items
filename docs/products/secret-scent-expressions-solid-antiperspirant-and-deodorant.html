            <li>My daughter and I both love this scent.  </li>
            <li>Works better than the clinical strength ones.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>My coworker said it smells &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; - which is OK.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love the beach?</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it was way cheaper to buy with subscribe</li>
            <li>I think I got it from my father, but who can be sure?</li>
            <li>As a teenager I tried a lot of deodorants and most didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of all-natural organic products and mostly use all-natural organic products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t stink at all while I wear this magic product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and I don&#x27;t wear perfume anyways-</li>
            <li>I love this deoderant</li>
            <li>Goes lovely with my vanilla parfumes (I used to buy Va Va Vanilla</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant in this scent for years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>and I love that it lasts all day, even through my workouts.</li>
            <li>It not only smells good but it lasts ALL day! :)</li>
            <li>love this product and it is hands down the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>love this product and it is hands down the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I was also looking for something that didn&#x27;t have too strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>So I needed something a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>But the real reason this deodorant is so amazing is that it eliminates 100% of the odor that comes with hormones and being a woman.</li>
            <li>Although it can still be messy, the scent in perfect</li>
            <li>I use normal deodorant, the kind with aluminum, and I will probably die.  </li>
            <li>Very effective, scent pleasant, quality packaging, long lasting.  </li>
            <li>, when I raise my arms I know I will only smell good because the scent lasts forever, even after taking a bath</li>
            <li>Also, it smells good and the Prime place is comparable to what I&#x27;d pay locally, so</li>
            <li>Even better- the product emits a very soft cocoa-butter scent that smells like a really sweet perfume.</li>
            <li>I love secret deodorant, it smells beautifully and keeps you fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The fact that they have added new scents makes them that much better.</li>
            <li>the deoderant is effective but can leave white marks on your clothes even if it is considered &amp;</li>
            <li>Right now, I rotate between this and Dove Go Sleeveless and Certain-Dri.</li>
            <li>I usually get compliments from people telling me how great I smell or people will assume that I just jumped out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I would say the wetness protection is standard and after application, my underarms feel comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve never failed me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as obnoxiously white as many of them are.  </li>
            <li>It really does smell like a dessert (I know what you&#x27;re thinking: why do I want my armpits to smell like dessert?!).</li>
            <li>® Completely Clean Clear Gel*</li>
            <li>live in Alaska, so I rarely sweat.</li>
            <li>I really like the Scent Expressions line.  </li>
            <li>It does smell really yummy, and lasts through the day.</li>
            <li>so having the added aroma is very welcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come back multiple times for more, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back to purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come back multiple times for more, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back to purchase this again.</li>
            <li>This works well on very hot days or when I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of physical sports or activity.</li>
            <li>Secret has been my go-to brand for a good five years now.</li>
            <li>I have used a stronger deodorant, but it really does do its job and last for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It does go on quite wet but dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;ve been using this product so long that when I do see a friendly with deodorant on their shirt, it takes me a second to realize what it is.</li>
            <li>#34;invisible solid.&amp;#34;  You just need to go on lightly and maybe dab it with a little kleenix before you dress.  </li>
            <li>This stuff goes on clear and stays clear.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on clear and stays clear.</li>
            <li>I had been using my husband&#x27;s Old Spice deodorant and been having BO</li>
            <li>With that being said anything natural does not work when it comes to my armpits.</li>
            <li>She says it much cheaper, than buying at the local stores.</li>
            <li>But seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for something other than \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; scent that still smells good after you&#x27;ve jogged 3 miles, try this.</li>
            <li>But for most of the time, especially if I want to smell more fragrant, I will usually reach for this Secret Scent Expressions Cocoa Butter Kiss.  </li>
            <li>The scent seems to last pretty long too.</li>
            <li>I adore their product and have been an avid user of &#x27;Cocoa Butter Kiss Scented Solid Deodorant&#x27; for a long time.</li>
            <li>If I want major wetness protection, I will use the Certain-Dri.</li>
            <li>I love Secret and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>I love all my Secret Deodorants abd this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>, it will leave noticably fewer white stains on your black shirt than many other solids will!</li>

            <li> I bought it recently after there was an Amazon coupon for it - plus the Subscribe and Save discount - and it was ridiculously</li>
            <li> After years of searching I grabbed this little stick off of the shelf in a hopeless attempt at finding something that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this scent! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. It smells heavenly! I usually rotate between a few antiperspirant deodorants. The scent seems to last pretty long too. Right now, I rotate between this and Dove Go Sleeveless and Certain-Dri. If I want major wetness protection, I will use the Certain-Dri. This works well on very hot days or when I&#x27;ll be doing a lot of physical sports or activity. For the usual leisurely day, I&#x27;ll use the Dove Go Sleeveless.  But for most of the time, especially if I want to smell more fragrant, I will usually reach for this Secret Scent Expressions Cocoa Butter Kiss.  It does have a stronger scent (but isn&#x27;t obnoxious) than the Dove and lasts all day. I usually get compliments from people telling me how great I smell or people will assume that I just jumped out of the shower.  I would say the wetness protection is standard and after application, my underarms feel comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Often difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this scent.  And it works good, too.  Not too sticky.  doen&#x27;s leave white marks on clothes when getting dressed.  Great deal with the Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li> great sent. Wish the formula was stronger.</li>
            <li> Have used secret for years without disappointment. The fact that they have added new scents makes them that much better. Have tried other brands and they have left brown stains on my shirts or not worked quite as well. Will never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant there is. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Works better than the clinical strength ones.</li>
            <li> I Love Secret!! It not only smells good but it lasts ALL day! :)</li>
            <li> I had been using my husband&#x27;s Old Spice deodorant and been having BO so I tried this and IT HAS BEEN GREAT!!! LOVE THE SMELL AND IT STAYS ON FOR LONG!!! Will continue using this!!!</li>
            <li> I have always used Secret and rely on this product.  Its a great value for the price I paid on Amazon</li>
            <li> This has a very pleasant scent, and is very strong. My coworker said it smells &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; - which is OK. Who doesn&#x27;t love the beach?</li>
            <li> I have used Secret for a long time. I really like the Scent Expressions line.  My favorites are the Cocoa Butter Kiss and the Va-Va-Vanilla.  I prefer the vanilla, but for some reason it is hard to find.  Still the Cocoa butter kiss is a close second.  the deoderant is effective but can leave white marks on your clothes even if it is considered &amp;#34;invisible solid.&amp;#34;  You just need to go on lightly and maybe dab it with a little kleenix before you dress.  otherwise this is my go-to deoderant.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent my daughter and I could agree on (we buy as a pack of two through subscribe and save). It does smell really yummy, and lasts through the day. My daughter does have to reapply after gym class.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it was way cheaper to buy with subscribe n save than at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Lets get a little personal, shall we? Time to talk about deodorant! Woo, this won&#x27;t be awkward at all. Let&#x27;s just start by saying that my armpits pretty much stink- bad. I think I got it from my father, but who can be sure? All I know is that I have BO that needs contained. As a teenager I tried a lot of deodorants and most didn&#x27;t work. I love the idea of all-natural organic products and mostly use all-natural organic products. With that being said anything natural does not work when it comes to my armpits. So I needed something a bit more powerful. After years of searching I grabbed this little stick off of the shelf in a hopeless attempt at finding something that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wah-lah, magic! No longer do I smell. Well- I do. I smell wonderful. I just don&#x27;t smell terrible anymore. I LOVE this stuff! Secret has been my go-to brand for a good five years now. They&#x27;ve never failed me. I adore their product and have been an avid user of &#x27;Cocoa Butter Kiss Scented Solid Deodorant&#x27; for a long time. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this deodorant for another. Their price could sky-rocket to $100 each and I would budget my groceries to afford this deodorant. It&#x27;s great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Alaska, so I rarely sweat. With that being said, when I do sweat, this deodorant does help contain any of the moisture. It limits it, so I&#x27;m not dripping profusely from my armpits. But the real reason this deodorant is so amazing is that it eliminates 100% of the odor that comes with hormones and being a woman. I don&#x27;t stink at all while I wear this magic product. Even better- the product emits a very soft cocoa-butter scent that smells like a really sweet perfume. I love the scent, and I don&#x27;t wear perfume anyways- so having the added aroma is very welcoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not leave white-streaks. In fact I&#x27;ve been using this product so long that when I do see a friendly with deodorant on their shirt, it takes me a second to realize what it is. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with white streaks in forever. This stuff goes on clear and stays clear. Long gone are my days of worrying about my deodorant marking up my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it is hands down the best deodorant I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve come back multiple times for more, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back to purchase this again. Everyone&#x27;s armpits are different, and this may not work for everyone. But it did work for me, so I&#x27;ll throw it out there that others should maybe give it a shot as well!e streaks in forever. This stuff goes on clear and stays clear.

            <li> I love secret deodorant, it smells beautifully and keeps you fresh and clean. I always try to buy it in bulk since deodorant is something everyone always needs. Its not invisible solid though, the white stuff is always left over. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this deoderant it is the best I have found, when I raise my arms I know I will only smell good because the scent lasts forever, even after taking a bath I can still smell it, it is awesome and has the best scent, sort of floral and fruity mixed.</li>
            <li> I know, I&#x27;m being a bad hippie.  I use normal deodorant, the kind with aluminum, and I will probably die.  But I will smell good when I do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is nice.  It&#x27;s not REALLY invisible (what deodorant is?) but it&#x27;s not as obnoxiously white as many of them are.  Also, it smells good and the Prime place is comparable to what I&#x27;d pay locally, so I like that I don&#x27;t have to leave my house to get it.</li>
            <li> Very effective, scent pleasant, quality packaging, long lasting.  An excellent product and I throughly recommend this brand of deodorant. Have tried several scents - prefer the solid rather than the gel in this range.</li>
            <li> I love Secret and it works wonders. No itching or sweating. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love all my Secret Deodorants abd this one is no exception.  Smells great and goes on smooth!  :-)  Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet, just perfect. Goes lovely with my vanilla parfumes (I used to buy Va Va Vanilla but for some reason it is not possible anymore - it&#x27;s not for sale to Finland)</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells amazing. It works pretty good, too! I have used a stronger deodorant, but it really does do its job and last for the whole day. Good buy!</li>
            <li> So, I decided I wanted to switch from a spray antiperspirant/deodorant to a solid or gel.  I tried a few solids that didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick.  I don&#x27;t usually use gels because they are messy.  I was also looking for something that didn&#x27;t have too strong of a scent.  Secret Scent Expressions Cocoa Butter Kiss was just what I was looking for.  Although it can still be messy, the scent in perfect and it keeps me dry and the scent is not overpowering.  It does go on quite wet but dries quickly.  If I continue to buy a gel, I am definitely sticking to this one! *I received free product from BzzAgent as promotion to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel*</li>
            <li> I bought it for the wife. She likes this brand. Says it works for her. She says it much cheaper, than buying at the local stores. Would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I always use Secret deodorant but I was disappointed with this one.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell and I didn&#x27;t feel that it lasted as long as the other Secrets that I have used.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, smells great.  Leaves a bit of a white residue on my dark shirts.  So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that invisible.</li>
            <li> My pits smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Everything is super!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant in this scent for years, and I love it.  It works wonderfully and leaves me smelling like something sweet and tropical rather than stink.</li>
            <li> For some reason I can never find this in the supermarket but Amazon (thank goodness) always has it! This is the BEST smelling antiperspirant/deodorant combo I have ever been able to find. It really does smell like a dessert (I know what you&#x27;re thinking: why do I want my armpits to smell like dessert?!). But seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for something other than \\&quot;Powder Fresh\\&quot; scent that still smells good after you&#x27;ve jogged 3 miles, try this. I bought it recently after there was an Amazon coupon for it - plus the Subscribe and Save discount - and it was ridiculously cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it will leave noticably fewer white stains on your black shirt than many other solids will!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot for a girl and have used just about every deodorant made over the last 15 years.  I have been using this one for the last 2 years and have not been disappointed.  I love the scent and I love that it lasts all day, even through my workouts.</li>
