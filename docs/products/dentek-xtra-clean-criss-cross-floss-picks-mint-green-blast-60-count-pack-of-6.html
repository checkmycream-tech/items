            <li>The floss end works great and really stands up to use allowing you to use it for most or all of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I love these picks.</li>
            <li>The crisscross pattern does a way better job of hugging each tooth to remove and avoid any build up.</li>
            <li>love this product, not in stores anymore</li>
            <li>I used to buy them at Walmart and fell in love with them</li>
            <li>and at a lot better price.</li>
            <li>These picks are better than floss.  </li>

            <li>These clean between your teeth better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>and they work great far better then</li>
            <li>These are the best floss picks I have tried, the pick end has a nice angle and is sturdy enough to use for your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>I am an avid flosser who flosses 2-4 times a day and these are by far the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>These picks are easy to carry around, so I always have some with me.  </li>
            <li>This are strong and durable.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I tried these,  I didn&#x27;t like it, however they soon became my favorite flossers.</li>
            <li>Very durable and even has a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li>The criss cross is a great feature.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They slide so smoothly between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Primarily, because they don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>They make flossing super easy.</li>
            <li>The floss does a good job getting food - much better than the single string</li>
            <li>The criss-cross floss strands really clean two adjacent teeth simultaneously.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel a clean now if I gave to use another type of flosser.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I keep a bag in my car, in my office and of course in the bathroom as well.</li>
            <li>Got plenty to last me at a good price.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is great not too strong and its not cheap plastic</li>
            <li>These floss picks are super sturdy.</li>
            <li>My 16 years old son love them.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even bother going into detail with this review since this product really speaks for itself and all I need to say is if you&#x27;re looking for floss picks, these are the ones for you!</li>
            <li>Seems like when you find something that really works well, you can&#x27;t re-find it!  </li>
            <li>The only floss that seems to work for me; my dentist is pleased I found a supplier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are amazing- believe the other reviews.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel extra clean with these flossers!</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and love feeling the clean spaces between my teeth.</li>
            <li>They make it easy to reach back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so it does not snap in your mouth if your using too much pressure.</li>
            <li>The criscross really gets the inside of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>Btw, I am very fussy about oral hygiene &amp; health.)  </li>
            <li>I like to REALLY push when I&#x27;m flossing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right shape for flossing AND the right shape on the pick to actually reach your gums on the inside.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than any other out there.</li>
            <li>Ive used floss and many other picks and nothing compares to these.</li>
            <li>They get really in there and do a better job than your average one string floss pick.</li>
            <li>A billion times better that the previous Dentek junk flossers I was using.  </li>
            <li>Have been using This particular Dentek product for three years.</li>
            <li>I do love two strings and am now using parallel strings that do not cross.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The floss is strong in these picks where it breaks after one insertion between teeth in the other picks.  </li>
            <li>so much stronger than the old ones</li>
            <li>, they get gunk out more easily as it is trapped between the crossed pieces of floss.</li>
            <li>seriously, they are so effective that they will revolutionize your dental health.</li>
            <li>The floss is super thin and does not fray easily.</li>
            <li>The criss-cross action of the picks helps get all sides of the two teeth in between the gaps.</li>
            <li>Target stopped carrying this item but Amazon offers it, thank goodness.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable difference in the cleanliness of my teeth from the single string flossers, which I will use on occasion (I get samples of the single flossers for free when I visit my dentist.  </li>
            <li>Might be a little tight fit but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different type floss picks and while this one doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as flatter, fatter &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s never broken on me.  </li>
            <li>I ordered &amp;#34;Dentek Xtra Clean Criss Cross Floss Picks, Mint Green Blast, 60 Count</li>
            <li>Husband loves these... searched high and low locally and they are not sold anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Tried these after brushing and flossing with regular dental string and still pulled out an amazing amount of stuff left behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to reach for a second one to complete the job</li>
            <li>My favorite picks and they are very hard to find in the local drug stores.</li>
            <li>If I try regular floss or a regular pick, it breaks before I can complete the task.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> If I try regular floss or a regular pick, it breaks before I can complete the task.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for these for a long time and I found them only through Amazon.</li>
            <li> (The plain, unflavored ones seem to have disappeared completely.)</li>
            <li> The floss constantly comes out of other picks, but not these.</li>
            <li> out from between teeth and don&#x27;t cut into my gums like some of the floss picks with the tape floss or the single string on them.</li>
            <li> Had to return, the strings were so loose.</li>
            <li> The crossing of the floss creates too wide of a thread for the spaces between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight next to one another, and literally every other floss breaks and gets entangled between them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t a clue why other businesses are dropping them and keeping those fatter picks that do not even come close to cleaning teeth and gums like these picks.  </li>
            <li> Dual lines put this ahead of any other.</li>
            <li> and I often break or split the floss on other brands.  </li>
            <li> but these guys are made extremely well and almost never split or break.  </li>
            <li> How can there possibly be so many badly shaped flossers out there!</li>
            <li> The floss is very hard to pull back out.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores near me.</li>
            <li> He uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> have all my teeth therefore, the spaces are very tight.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy all of the packs they had on the shelves at the grocery store because they were hard to find and then they stopped carrying them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why were these so hard to find?</li>
            <li> I like the thin point and the twisted floss.  </li>
            <li> I like how well they work to removes food, reduce tooth decay &amp; fights bad breath.</li>

The floss never falls off the plastic. Cleans better than any other out there. I&#x27;d buy a lifetime supply if I could.</li>
            <li> These are the only flossers I will use. My local grocery store doesn&#x27;t stock them, so I buy them in bulk on Amazon. My teeth feel extra clean with these flossers!</li>
            <li> Tried every darn pick there is. How can there possibly be so many badly shaped flossers out there! This one works. It&#x27;s the right shape for flossing AND the right shape on the pick to actually reach your gums on the inside. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> These disappeared from WalMarts shelves.  The best tooth flossing picks out there and they quit carrying them.  What&#x27;s with that anyway??  Amazon, please do not stop selling these.  I haven&#x27;t a clue why other businesses are dropping them and keeping those fatter picks that do not even come close to cleaning teeth and gums like these picks.  The floss is strong in these picks where it breaks after one insertion between teeth in the other picks.  These are the best.  Keep them on hand, Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for these for a long time and I found them only through Amazon. Great deal too.</li>
            <li> The best and strongest floss picks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> great floss picks really clean in between your teeth and do not hurt at all.  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> these are the best as far as i am concerred</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even bother going into detail with this review since this product really speaks for itself and all I need to say is if you&#x27;re looking for floss picks, these are the ones for you!</li>
            <li> The best floss on the market...by far.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was able to find it here. Target doesn&#x27;t carry these anymore. These is only floss which WORKS!!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> These are the best floss picks I have tried, the pick end has a nice angle and is sturdy enough to use for your whole mouth. The floss end works great and really stands up to use allowing you to use it for most or all of your teeth. Very durable and even has a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> These Floss picks are great,  They don&#x27;t break or crack.</li>
            <li> Best flossers ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love these picks. Ive used floss and many other picks and nothing compares to these. The mint flavor is great not too strong and its not cheap plastic so it does not snap in your mouth if your using too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Best floss picks out there!</li>
            <li> Tried these after brushing and flossing with regular dental string and still pulled out an amazing amount of stuff left behind. Big improvement over regular dental string flossing. Might be a little tight fit but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Had to return, the strings were so loose. Didn&#x27;t even have to open package to tell</li>
            <li> these are some of the best Flosser&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but these are so amazing that I have to tell the world!! :-) seriously, they are so effective that they will revolutionize your dental health. The crisscross pattern does a way better job of hugging each tooth to remove and avoid any build up.</li>
            <li> The criss cross is a great feature. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;Dentek Xtra Clean Criss Cross Floss Picks, Mint Green Blast, 60 Count (Pack of 6)&amp;#34; and only received 1 of the 6 packs promised.</li>
            <li> These clean between your teeth better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried! And they have a nice minty taste as well.</li>
            <li> Best Floss.  Could only find them on Amazon</li>
            <li> These are the greatest floss picks forget that these are the greatest floss of any type you can buy.  The criscross really gets the inside of your teeth.  If you are a bleeder these are probably not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different type floss picks and while this one doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as flatter, fatter &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s never broken on me.  I like the thin point and the twisted floss.  It cleans my teeth beautifully (just ask my dentist!).  I will be a repeat customer because I like being able to buy &amp;#34;in bulk&amp;#34; - never running out!</li>
            <li> Best floss picks ever!</li>
            <li> Husband loves these... searched high and low locally and they are not sold anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;The best Flossers out there!</li>
            <li> will not another brand or &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; i purchased 6 of 60pk.</li>
            <li> These are always sold out at my local Wal-Mart probably cause they work SO WELL. I have NEVER, EVER had one break on me. The criss-cross action of the picks helps get all sides of the two teeth in between the gaps. I use them everyday and love feeling the clean spaces between my teeth. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> criss-cross floss works well.</li>
            <li> Best dental picks ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have all my teeth therefore, the spaces are very tight.  If I try regular floss or a regular pick, it breaks before I can complete the task.  This are strong and durable.  I&#x27;ve never had to reach for a second one to complete the job</li>
            <li> love this product, not in stores anymore</li>
            <li> The best flossers ever. The only design that does not get shredded after two or three flossing motions. My teeth are very tight next to one another, and literally every other floss breaks and gets entangled between them. Not this one. It is fantastic. I love it so much that I keep a bag in my car, in my office and of course in the bathroom as well. Target stopped carrying this item but Amazon offers it, thank goodness.</li>
            <li> The floss does a good job getting food - much better than the single string floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this stuff almost never breaks - amazing!</li>
            <li> They work great at getting food etc. out from between teeth and don&#x27;t cut into my gums like some of the floss picks with the tape floss or the single string on them. I used to buy them at Walmart and fell in love with them but they stopped carrying them. Thank goodness I found them on here and at a lot better price.</li>
            <li> These are the very best disposable dental flossers.  The criss-cross floss strands really clean two adjacent teeth simultaneously.</li>
            <li> These picks are better than floss.  I will never use another another kind.  I use to purchase these at Target and they stopped carrying them, so I found them here and will continue to purchase even if Target starts selling then again!</li>
            <li> I love these and they work great far better then plaquers I use to buy.</li>
            <li> I like how well they work to removes food, reduce tooth decay &amp; fights bad breath. They make flossing super easy. They slide so smoothly between my teeth. These floss picks are super sturdy. The floss is super thin and does not fray easily. They make it easy to reach back teeth.  These picks are easy to carry around, so I always have some with me.  They make flossing enjoyable.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a timely manner.  They are the best picks and don&#x27;t break as easy as others. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The best flossers!  The crisscross design is very effective in flossing my teeth.  There is a noticeable difference in the cleanliness of my teeth from the single string flossers, which I will use on occasion (I get samples of the single flossers for free when I visit my dentist.  Btw, I am very fussy about oral hygiene &amp; health.)  My local CVS stopped stocking them and I searched far and wide till I found them, which was here, on Amazon.  Can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> I am an avid flosser who flosses 2-4 times a day and these are by far the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used.  Primarily, because they don&#x27;t break.  The floss constantly comes out of other picks, but not these.</li>
            <li> Dual lines put this ahead of any other.</li>
            <li> The very first time I tried these,  I didn&#x27;t like it, however they soon became my favorite flossers. They are very effective and I don&#x27;t feel a clean now if I gave to use another type of flosser.</li>
            <li> My favorite picks and they are very hard to find in the local drug stores. Glad to have them.</li>
            <li> Got plenty to last me at a good price.</li>
            <li> A billion times better that the previous Dentek junk flossers I was using.  If I hadn&#x27;t already tried these, I would have stayed away from this brand forever.  LOVE these, sooooo great, they get gunk out more easily as it is trapped between the crossed pieces of floss.</li>
            <li> so much stronger than the old ones</li>
            <li> Another item not found in local stores that I use. Have been using This particular Dentek product for three years.</li>
            <li> Seems like when you find something that really works well, you can&#x27;t re-find it!  Glad to find them on Amazon!  They are durable and have a widened area on the ends that cleans well after you get them in.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores near me. Had them once and loved them. Would recommend to all individuals who don&#x27;t require wax floss.</li>
            <li> Why were these so hard to find? (The plain, unflavored ones seem to have disappeared completely.) The only floss that seems to work for me; my dentist is pleased I found a supplier.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite floss picks. They get really in there and do a better job than your average one string floss pick. They are hardy and always have the discernible minty flavor.</li>
            <li> The crossing of the floss creates too wide of a thread for the spaces between my teeth.  The floss is very hard to pull back out.  I do love two strings and am now using parallel strings that do not cross.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the good s***.</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Can&#x27;t believe that they quit making them?</li>
            <li> Shred proof! I&#x27;ve tried and haven&#x27;t shredded on since I&#x27;ve been using them over a yesr.</li>
            <li> I like to REALLY push when I&#x27;m flossing and I often break or split the floss on other brands.  but these guys are made extremely well and almost never split or break.  they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Best Floss Picks on the Planet!</li>
            <li> My 16 years old son love them. He uses them everyday.</li>
