            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite perfume!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s sortof old school scent, but such a great summer scent, and the price was great!</li>
            <li>Not as strong.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is cheerful, feminine, and uplifting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really enjoy the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>Packaging looked cheap.</li>
            <li>Thank you for great packaging for a fragile product!</li>
            <li>But on my skin it changed to a very powerful scent that gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li>and I was familiar with the product</li>
            <li>AA++ Item as described and received quickly.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly, and the bottle are nice and large, much larger than drug stores that sometimes have this at holiday time.</li>
            <li>Just fine and much cheaper than at drug store, if you can find at drug store.</li>
            <li>I definitely worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>and I (still) absolutely love the clean fresh floral scent that last all day (on me).</li>
            <li>Sand &amp; Sable is light and clean, but lush.</li>
            <li>The order arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Although it smells the same when I first put it on, it seems to fade more quickly than what I remember.</li>
            <li>I received them very fast and packaged</li>
            <li>I remember when Sand &amp; Sable debuted it is such a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled sand &amp; sable back in 91/92 and fell in love with it!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>This scent brings back so many memories.</li>
            <li>It has been a while since I had noticed my mom wearing it, so when Christmas started rolling around I knew exactly what to get her.</li>
            <li>I wore it years ago and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I received it in just a few days.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the cheap price dissuade you-- Sand &amp; Sable is a fun, beachy white floral with just a hint of coconut.</li>
            <li>All told this was a good deal, shipping as usual is timely and also there were no shipping charges  </li>
            <li>It is VERY floral.</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t the real perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very flowery like some perfumes, and I like that.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Product was better than expected and shipping was on time!  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was wonderful, I&#x27;m just not sure the formulation is the same as what I&#x27;ve bought at conventional stores.  </li>
            <li>cant live with out it.</li>
            <li>I barely spritzed it on and the strange initial smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I always look here for those hard to find items, you can bet most of the time it&#x27;s here.</li>
            <li>No matter whether I&#x27;m on the ball field or out to dinner, playing with the kids or at an art gallery, it never lets me down and it makes me feel special.</li>
            <li>It has an old ...</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 1 star because the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>, this is an old perfume but one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t llet this old school perfume fool you...</li>
            <li>Ever since I was a young girl, I could recall my mom wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, she loved it.</li>
            <li>I sprayed my other bottle along with the new to compare, in which the scent is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>If you like Michael Kors, Fracas, or jasmine &amp; gardenia in general, give this one a go!</li>

            <li> My teenage daughter wears it to school and gets compliments from the other young girls on the smell</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This is clearly not the same S &amp; S</li>
            <li> Sorry, I hit wrong star, I loved it!</li>
            <li> But something in it made me feel strange</li>
            <li> but it smell like the old sandstone&amp;#34;&amp;#34; not sure about this</li>
            <li> After it dries down, it has a strange chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I detected gardenia in the dry down but the urine smell still lingered.  </li>
            <li> Seemed a little watered down from the last bottle we purchased.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that is the difference between the different kinds of perfume.</li>
            <li> been craving it for a while now cause the last REAL bottle I had was in 2007 :(</li>
            <li> But is is very hard to find in the local stores.  </li>
            <li> but I find a lot of expensive florals to be completely unwearable.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> so no items were broken.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These bottles however HAVE A FAINT ROACH SPRAY SMELL TO ALMOST NO SMELL</li>
            <li> got it for my wife and it stinks accordingly</li>
            <li> Over the years, it became almost impossible to find the fragrance until I came across it here, in which case I bought two of them for my mom&#x27;s Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Smh,a mess,I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> What can I say...can never go wrong with Sand &amp; Sable!!!</li>

            <li> It had been years since I&#x27;d worn this fragrance. I couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing it once I saw it on Amazon for such a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> My most favorite scent; E V E R!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the Sand &amp; Sable I remember.  It has an old ... well, urine smell.  I barely spritzed it on and the strange initial smell was overwhelming.  I detected gardenia in the dry down but the urine smell still lingered.  Of course I can&#x27;t return it so I guess I&#x27;ll try to yard sale it.  Very disappointed.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who wore this in the 80&#x27;s.  It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it used to.  I only gave it a 1 star because the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this thru Amazon, it&#x27;s sortof old school scent, but such a great summer scent, and the price was great! I always look here for those hard to find items, you can bet most of the time it&#x27;s here. Came very quickly, and the bottle are nice and large, much larger than drug stores that sometimes have this at holiday time. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume!! I definitely worth the price I paid. The order arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Sand &amp; Sable has always been a favorite of mine. The scent is one in which I have received many comments while wearing and the best part was finding it at this price! K-Mart sells the 2.0 ounce alone at $28! I sprayed my other bottle along with the new to compare, in which the scent is exactly the same. So if you love Sand &amp; Sable, grab a hold of this awesome offer before it&#x27;s all gone!</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long but it smell like the old sandstone&amp;#34;&amp;#34; not sure about this</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume my mom ever asks for at Christmas. It can be hard to find. Was thrilled to find it here. She&#x27;ll need it again and I&#x27;ll look here!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price dissuade you-- Sand &amp; Sable is a fun, beachy white floral with just a hint of coconut. The&lt;br /&gt;jasmine and gardenia together remind me of a Hawaiian pikake perfume that a friend once brought back to me from her vacation. This stuff is cheerful, feminine, and uplifting. It is VERY floral. Maybe not the most expensive-smelling stuff on the planet, but I find a lot of expensive florals to be completely unwearable. Sand &amp; Sable is light and clean, but lush. If you like Michael Kors, Fracas, or jasmine &amp; gardenia in general, give this one a go!</li>
            <li> Sand and Sable was on the list for Christmas and it got me hugs and kisses, and the price was  good to.</li>
            <li> I remember when Sand &amp; Sable debuted it is such a lovely fragrance.  But is is very hard to find in the local stores.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this 12 years ago by a friend.. Fell in love with it been wearing and buying every since absolutely love it I bought all they had at CVS so I turned to amazon to by them out lol...</li>
            <li> I thought the price was wonderful, I&#x27;m just not sure the formulation is the same as what I&#x27;ve bought at conventional stores.  Although it smells the same when I first put it on, it seems to fade more quickly than what I remember. All told this was a good deal, shipping as usual is timely and also there were no shipping charges  Yay. Plus no driving around to different stores looking for cologne and not finding it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance so I was very happy to be able to get these gift sets. I received them very fast and packaged&lt;br /&gt;great so no items were broken.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONT BUY!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yeah,it&#x27;s not a misspelling! I meant to put &amp;#34;FABLE&amp;#34;because this isn&#x27;t the real perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because of that. I first smelled sand &amp; sable back in 91/92 and fell in love with it!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been craving it for a while now cause the last REAL bottle I had was in 2007 :(&lt;br /&gt;These bottles however HAVE A FAINT ROACH SPRAY SMELL TO ALMOST NO SMELL AT ALL!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the tag looks handwritten,! Smh,a mess,I&#x27;m disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Started using this fragrance over 20 years ago and I still love it!  Packaging could have been just a bit sturdier, but, both bottles were received in great condition.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite. Good price</li>
            <li> This scent brings back so many memories. It has been a while since I had noticed my mom wearing it, so when Christmas started rolling around I knew exactly what to get her. Her face lit up! It always smells so wonderful!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to like this.  It smelled great out of the bottle and on clothes, like a rich buttery scent, really good.  But on my skin it changed to a very powerful scent that gave me a headache.  I might try it again in cooler weather but for now I can&#x27;t wear it.  Disappointed.  If it didn&#x27;t make me feel that way I&#x27;d really enjoy the smell of it.  It isn&#x27;t very flowery like some perfumes, and I like that.  But something in it made me feel strange and I had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find Sand and Sable in any store. I wore it years ago and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I received it in just a few days. Service was great. I will order it again before I run out.</li>
            <li> Sand and Sable is my favorite and my go to cologne.  No matter whether I&#x27;m on the ball field or out to dinner, playing with the kids or at an art gallery, it never lets me down and it makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little watered down from the last bottle we purchased.  Not as strong.  Not sure if that is the difference between the different kinds of perfume.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore for this price.  Will order again when my stash is depleted.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! One of my favorites, got this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> AA++ Item as described and received quickly.</li>
            <li> Great item and I love the price, price is very important to me and I was familiar with the product so was glad I could get 2 for the price of one, this is an old perfume but one of my favorites. When I need more I will reorder here</li>
            <li> I will never change perfume. This is the best. I keep ordering it before it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;I cant live with out it.</li>
            <li> got it for my wife and it stinks accordingly</li>
            <li> My grandmother used to wear this perfume and I (still) absolutely love the clean fresh floral scent that last all day (on me). This AWARD WINNING perfume is my favorite of all times... My teenage daughter wears it to school and gets compliments from the other young girls on the smell so don&#x27;t llet this old school perfume fool you...</li>
            <li> Totally excellent deal</li>
            <li> The Sand and Sable products met all my expectations because the person I bought it for loves this smell .</li>
            <li> My grand mother is very happy. Thanks</li>
            <li> One of my favorites for many, many years!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I hit wrong star, I loved it!</li>
            <li> Just fine and much cheaper than at drug store, if you can find at drug store.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping and spot-on product!</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a young girl, I could recall my mom wearing this perfume. Over the years, it became almost impossible to find the fragrance until I came across it here, in which case I bought two of them for my mom&#x27;s Christmas gift. Needless to say, she loved it.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Mother &amp; she loved it!!!  This was perfect &amp; I could not find the gift sets in any of the stores!</li>
            <li> Gave the perfume as a gift.</li>
            <li> Packaging looked cheap.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Just as good as I remember it being.</li>
            <li> In. Love. With. This.  Product was better than expected and shipping was on time!  Thank you for great packaging for a fragile product!</li>
            <li> nice fragrance....great product.</li>
            <li> What can I say...can never go wrong with Sand &amp; Sable!!! Wife loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is clearly not the same S &amp; S I remember.  After it dries down, it has a strange chemical smell.  Also, the fragrance vanished almost instantly. I will not be buying it again.  DJR</li>
