            <li>This isn&#x27;t the authentic product.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars because I really love the product</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the investment to treat yourself to healthy, shiny, soft hair that looks and feels great return customer</li>
            <li>Buy more time with you</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Had some leak in the packaging but love the product</li>
            <li>I usually love Moroccanoil</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After that it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>Nothing better.</li>
            <li>I also use the Moroccan oil and these product leave my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, my hair is usually frizzy but after using this it is smooth!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy using their oils and hydrating mist during the summers to keep my hair conditioned and repair sun damage.</li>
            <li>NOT THE REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product isn&#x27;t the best when comparing to some other professional lines, but the results outweigh any drawbacks.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair VERY soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>They actually bought some gift sizes for their friend who are always loving the way their hair smells.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is fine, but if I pay over $100 for a product or even if it was less than $100, everything should be TRUTHFUL!  </li>
            <li>The pumps make it so convenient to use and the large size lasts for more than a week with all my long hair girls.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it  is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The real deal as I was worried it would be a knock off version.</li>
            <li>This is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the efficiency and honesty.</li>
            <li>My older daughter came for a visit and used the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I much more like Moroccanoil repair shampoo, I&#x27;m going to go back to repair for next one.</li>
            <li>Just use a little and add water to make more of a lather.</li>
            <li>And after air drying my hair, it get even more crispy and stiff even before washing my hair with Morroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I have been buying these large sizes for my teenage girls and for me for years.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Moroccanoil products, and I used to use repair shampoo, and just wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>Takes about a week for it to actually get rid of all the old stuff in your hair to where you begin to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I only use professional brands such as pureology and bumble and bumble.</li>
            <li>She called me later to say that not only did her hair smell terrific but that it was so soft and silky</li>
            <li>I have thick straight hair with a coarse cuticle ; makes it so much easier to style my hair since it calms the cuticle and my hair gels like silk.</li>

            <li> My wife likes it, so she got these for a gift.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, my hair is usually frizzy but after using this it is smooth! I use it with the leave in conditioning treatment by Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the authentic product.  I have used Moroccan products for years and there is a problem with this as it is not the quality that they provide.  This appears to be a knock-off.  There was a label over the bar code?  Why would that be?  I wonder if we contacted Moroccanoil products if they could tell us if this is their product.  Someone needs to stop this rip off situation.  I paid almost $100 and this stuff and it  is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo! Smells so good, I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
            <li> I have been using Morroccanoil products for about five years now and I absolutely love them !! I use the hydrating shampoo and conditioner as well as the repair. They leave my hair VERY soft and healthy. The smell of this product isn&#x27;t the best when comparing to some other professional lines, but the results outweigh any drawbacks. I also enjoy using their oils and hydrating mist during the summers to keep my hair conditioned and repair sun damage. I would highly recommend this product line to anyone who needs a highly effective and great product to keep their hair healthy!</li>
            <li> The real deal as I was worried it would be a knock off version.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars because I really love the product but it lost 1 star because I received it and the conditioner was leaking. It is very expensive so having any wasted product is upsetting. I also use the Moroccan oil and these product leave my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the fragrance which is refreshing!</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair with a coarse cuticle ; makes it so much easier to style my hair since it calms the cuticle and my hair gels like silk. Just use a little and add water to make more of a lather.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner before and really loved the products.  This is not the real deal.  The shampoo makes my hair feel stripped of all moisture after using it.  It was an expensive mistake on my part not to purchase through a reputable beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these large sizes for my teenage girls and for me for years.  The pumps make it so convenient to use and the large size lasts for more than a week with all my long hair girls.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is incredible.  They actually bought some gift sizes for their friend who are always loving the way their hair smells.  My older daughter came for a visit and used the shampoo and conditioner.  She called me later to say that not only did her hair smell terrific but that it was so soft and silky she didn&#x27;t have to wash it for a few days.  She bought some immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the investment to treat yourself to healthy, shiny, soft hair that looks and feels great return customer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Moroccanoil products, and I used to use repair shampoo, and just wanted to try something new.  This Hydrating shampoo doesn&#x27;t good to me as repair.  I much more like Moroccanoil repair shampoo, I&#x27;m going to go back to repair for next one.</li>
            <li> I just love Moroccanoil, is by far the best product in the market.</li>
            <li> very good product at a good price</li>
            <li> This product always gets here when expected, professionally wrapped, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with packaging or leaking. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love! Calmed the frizz!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone. Thanks for the efficiency and honesty. Buy more time with you</li>
            <li> makes my head itch but maybe it&#x27;s my fault?</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. Had some leak in the packaging but love the product</li>
            <li> I usually love Moroccanoil but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake. It smells nothing like the one I got at the salon.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the packaging is terrible.  Both leaked in their packaging.  It was a mess.</li>
            <li> All of the pumps were broken upon receipt.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat this shampoo.  Its awesome.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Takes about a week for it to actually get rid of all the old stuff in your hair to where you begin to see a difference. After that it just keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> Damaged during shipping and had to return as it was a gift for a family member. The smell is absolutely terrible and way too strong. I only use professional brands such as pureology and bumble and bumble. But the smell of this product is hideous. I will never buy for myself.</li>
            <li> I like the Hydrating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner a lot but I made a mistake when I ordered - meant to get the Moisture Repair litre combo.  Still, I love Morocan Oil shampoos, so it&#x27;ll do!  Price was good and the fast delivery was awesome!</li>
            <li> I have used these products for years, there is no comparison out there</li>
            <li> It is very good for color hair I recommend</li>
            <li> Great value.  Good stuff .  Wife won&#x27;t use anything else.  Bought the lager size for the value.  Have used for several years. Nothing better.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and packaged great. I love Moroccanoil products, the smell is awesome and it makes my hair silky..</li>
            <li> RIP-OFF!!! NOT THE REAL THING!!!</li>
            <li> ReceiveD my product and it was spilled out all inside the bag.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling oily, heavy and slightly sticky. Waited too long to return it so I&#x27;m out $100 but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff unless you have a texture type that responds well to heavy, residue type products.</li>
            <li> The smell of this brand is amazing.  A bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Some of the shampoo and conditioner was spilled upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner, but the pumps were broken:(</li>
            <li> The description failed to admit that the pump top to the shampoo was damaged or broken.  The conditioner is fine, but if I pay over $100 for a product or even if it was less than $100, everything should be TRUTHFUL!  Don&#x27;t hide something important like the pump is broken!  That is called DECEITFULNESS and LYING!  Very, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this product and this vendor is awesome.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair fall out in clumps!!!! And after air drying my hair, it get even more crispy and stiff even before washing my hair with Morroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Best hair products ever!</li>
