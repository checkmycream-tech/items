            <li> Offers light peeling.</li>
            <li> This product is the best--I found it to be even more effective than maxi-peel 3.  I&#x27;ve already ordered 4 bottles because I didn&#x27;t want to run out and will continue to order in the future.  Hopefully company will send me a coupon to continue ordering since I&#x27;m now a devoted customer.</li>

            <li> It works well if you want to lighten your skin. I am dark skin and when I use this I appear a few shades lighter. Use this product with sunblock. I&#x27;ve tried many other products and this works the best.</li>
            <li> Love!  Babyface is awesome.  It has helped with my breakouts and to lighten my acne scars.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have used baby face #2 with no problems. I decided to try #3 and it worked the same. It produces micropeeling of the skin.</li>

            <li> Great product. My wife uses this from Philippines. Will reorder and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all. Waste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use this product. The instructions are extremely vague.</li>
            <li> way too intense for my sensitive skin; causing my face to become angry, itchy red &amp; even slightly swollen after use.</li>
            <li> Really love this! Buy again and again! Awesome</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a month so far I&#x27;m more then happy with my purchase it has helped a lot with the acne but its my dark spots that made me buy another bottle I have tried so many hyperpigmention products and this one so far is the very best give it a try can&#x27;t beat the price trust me.</li>
            <li> I love it! Thank you &amp; til next time. :)</li>
            <li> I just used it once and make my face swoled up for 4 days...Plus this product doesn&#x27;t have expiration date..</li>
            <li> Excellent seller andgood product.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast ..buying this again ! this product is good for darkspots,acne good buy.</li>
            <li> I have been through many bottles of this.  I always have a bottle of this on hand.  I do recommend moderate use.  You shouldn&#x27;t peel if you don&#x27;t go overboard with application. I use a cotton ball.  If you use one just be gentle and patience.  It really works miracles.</li>
            <li> im giving this 4 stars because i know this will work on someones skin that is less tough then mine. i am use to doing peels and using maxi peel 4 which is impossible to find in the U.S but this does work. I would use this like 3 days in a row at night and then i would start to peel but it wasnt as deep of a peel as i wanted but i knew this would happen anyway because of the strength.  I would still recommend this for someone that has never used peels before.</li>
            <li> Works really well and this do peel your face. Mine was starting to peel after 3 or 5 days. It got rid of blemishes on my face. I am blemish free now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American with light brown skin color and after two weeks of using this everyday. My skin got a little pinkish and started to peel just a little bit. I&#x27;m going to limit how many times I use it in a week then see how its going. One positive is it does keep acne at bay. Which is why I gave 3 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne and melasma for 2 years and in two weeks this product has improve my skin&#x27;s appearance so much. I still get acne because it&#x27;s hormonal but no more whitehead or blackheads and I have to take into consideration that I&#x27;ve only have used the product for 2 weeks. The dark spots on my face were very dark and now they&#x27;re very light in color. MY skin tone is fair. I call it a miracle solution because in two weeks the results were a miracle. I&#x27;&#x27;l keep using it for a month to see what happens. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin blemish free and helps smooth out my skin. Acne marks started fading within three days of usage.</li>
            <li> Solution 2 was great this should be awsome</li>
    </ol>
