            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>The bristles are flexible so it is kind to hair and scalp.  </li>

            <li>And, the pattern is cute.</li>
            <li>After her shower she had to run in to show us all how magical it is.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought two more for two of my children who have tangled hair.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a magic brush.</li>
            <li>, WE WILL KEEP HER LONG BEAUTIFUL HAIR!</li>
            <li>Best brush for deknotting my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair as easily as it does for her.</li>
            <li>We all have fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>We all love it and the colors and patterns are so pretty and cute.</li>
            <li>This brush really is like magic!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of these brushes though.</li>
            <li>This one is by far best far curly hair.</li>
            <li>Tangles come free.  </li>
            <li>Fun design, too!</li>
            <li>I like it a lot and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Works great for wet hair.  </li>
            <li>i love its performance absolutely.</li>
            <li>Cute new colors!</li>
            <li>This brush works great on wet hair!!  </li>
            <li>It also works good on dry hair too.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>The only bright spot for this purchase was the seller, who was very responsive and super helpful when the package was lost in the mail.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>It really helps with knotty hair and works great on wet hair too.</li>
            <li>If you have not ever tried The &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush, you might find that this particular brush is a fine product; however, if you could use this brush and its real counterpart side-by-side, I think you&#x27;d notice a huge difference in ease and effectiveness of brushing and in the amount of ripping and breakage.</li>
            <li>My daughter has shoulder length curls and it goes right through them.</li>
            <li>Goes right through my girls ratty hair.</li>
            <li>I bought a Wet Brush on the strong recommendation of a friend, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without it.</li>
            <li>Super fast.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses it!</li>
            <li>Not any better than a regular brush with flexible teeth that I can get in the store.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush so my youngest daughter could have her own Wet Brush, as her sisters do.  </li>
            <li>The logo is styled to look like the logo of a much better brush, The &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush; in fact, I think that logo is how you can distinguish a true wet brush from a knockoff.</li>
            <li>They think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;, better than just a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>Its also a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair and we had tried many different ones.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>It goes through my hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>My daughters loved them and I would highly recommend them to other families.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very tangly after a shower, and this brush does work better than a regular brush!</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this brush on wet hair and it goes right through.  </li>
            <li>The product went to our old address and they were very easy to work with in getting it shipped back out to the correct address.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this brush is designed better than a regular brush for wet hair but not quite as good as all the 5 star reviews it has received.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY hair brush that can easily untangle my daughter&#x27;s curly hair in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This brush works great on it - wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I have 4 different hair types in my home ranging from fine to course and this brush did nothing for either texture.</li>
            <li>This brush runs right through wet hair so easily.</li>
            <li>Design is nice, but this is large that a child has trouble using..</li>
            <li>The knots come out their hair SO fast now, and it does not hurt them.</li>
            <li>Only thing is I&#x27;m wondering if it is PVC free.  </li>
            <li>Has really improved my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I wanted them to love it and not have to struggle with wet hair</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Its gentle on your hair and won&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>My friend told me about this brush and recommended it because I have very curly hair that&#x27;s always tangled.</li>
            <li>If you have thin hair, this product would be great for you.  </li>
            <li>Thank you wet brush :)</li>
            <li>The brush works better than a wide tooth comb and does not snag or pull the hair.</li>
            <li>Our family has multiple &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brushes, the real ones, that we bought in a salon, and we love them; when this one came in the mail, I was excited to use it because it had a cuter pattern than the other brushes.</li>
            <li>We have 2 other &amp;#34;wet brushes&amp;#34; and love them.</li>
            <li>We love the wet brush!</li>
            <li>My girls, however, who have long, fine hair, noticed a difference immediately.</li>
            <li>have really long, fine hair that gets tangled all the time.</li>
            <li>No more tears when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair with this amazing brush.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my fine hair even when it is wet.</li>
            <li>No fuss in pulling and detangling with my new brush!</li>
            <li>I have mid back baby fine straight hair and brush it no problem!</li>
            <li>It goes through wet hair easily.</li>
            <li>This works great for my daughters half straight half curly tangled mess:)</li>
            <li>Could be made a little better for the $.</li>
            <li>It looks like a normal brush.  </li>
            <li>No more ttangles for the whole family :)</li>
            <li>Worked great in my daughters thick wavy hair even dry.</li>
            <li>It actually does work better than any other brush we&#x27;ve had for gently removing tangles.  </li>
            <li>Ohhh my......these brushes are great for girls that sometimes have a hard time brushing their hair due to tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>And we even bought a second Wet brush!&lt;br /&gt;No more battles or tears with a 5 year old and tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>Because I have thick long hair it takes a few times through to get the job done but works great!</li>
            <li>The wet brush is fantastic and I have since bought several as gifts for others.</li>
            <li>so well she isn&#x27;t complaining as much about having her hair brushed!</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair and a sensitive head.</li>
            <li>Where a real The&amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush detangles effortlessly, the flimsy bristles of this brush simply tear at the hair.</li>
            <li>Do you fight with your daughter 6yr old daughter when brushing her hair because it hurts, pulls, etc?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly sensitive head</li>
            <li>I have one daughter with naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My 18 month old daughter used to cry every time I had to comb her hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone sensitive to odors does not buy this brush, but buy the metallic instead.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately our dog also loved it when she chewed it up.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull or snag and only one or two strands on the brush after detangling an entire whole head!  </li>
            <li>My girls have long hair, and this has saved us SO much time and heartache.</li>
            <li>I use the Wet brush to brush out my hair first</li>
            <li>Especially, children that may struggle with certain &amp;#34;sensory disorder&amp;#34; challenges and do not like their hair brushed.</li>
            <li>This has been the only brush that makes our mornings crying free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like other brushes that don&#x27;t claim to detangle.  </li>
            <li>After seeing other detangling brushes with bad reviews, I chose this based on the excellent reviews it received.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter HATES having her hair brushed after bath, it gets all tangly.</li>
            <li>yea WET Brush, high five to you!</li>
            <li>/&gt; Not a wet teary eye from either</li>
            <li>But BUYER BEWARE, because this is not a REAL Wet Brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for my 10 yr old daughter who has long medium-textured, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>But it feels wonderful on my scalp...and works wonders with the tangles in my thick kinky hair when wet or dry...and my daughter&#x27;s thick long extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair that gets tangled just by looking at it.</li>

            <li> If you have not ever tried The &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush, you might find that this particular brush is a fine product; however, if you could use this brush and its real counterpart side-by-side, I think you&#x27;d notice a huge difference in ease and effectiveness of brushing and in the amount of ripping and breakage.</li>
            <li> My daughter has shoulder length curls and it goes right through them.</li>
            <li> Goes right through my girls ratty hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a Wet Brush on the strong recommendation of a friend, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without it.</li>
            <li> Super fast.  </li>
            <li> My whole family uses it!</li>
            <li> Not any better than a regular brush with flexible teeth that I can get in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush so my youngest daughter could have her own Wet Brush, as her sisters do.  </li>
            <li> The logo is styled to look like the logo of a much better brush, The &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush; in fact, I think that logo is how you can distinguish a true wet brush from a knockoff.</li>
            <li> They think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;, better than just a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> Its also a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and we had tried many different ones.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> It goes through my hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> My daughters loved them and I would highly recommend them to other families.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very tangly after a shower, and this brush does work better than a regular brush!</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this brush on wet hair and it goes right through.  </li>
            <li> The product went to our old address and they were very easy to work with in getting it shipped back out to the correct address.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this brush is designed better than a regular brush for wet hair but not quite as good as all the 5 star reviews it has received.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hair brush that can easily untangle my daughter&#x27;s curly hair in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on it - wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have 4 different hair types in my home ranging from fine to course and this brush did nothing for either texture.</li>
            <li> This brush runs right through wet hair so easily.</li>
            <li> Design is nice, but this is large that a child has trouble using..</li>
            <li> The knots come out their hair SO fast now, and it does not hurt them.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I&#x27;m wondering if it is PVC free.  </li>
            <li> Has really improved my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted them to love it and not have to struggle with wet hair</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Its gentle on your hair and won&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this brush and recommended it because I have very curly hair that&#x27;s always tangled.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, this product would be great for you.  </li>
            <li> Thank you wet brush :)</li>
            <li> The brush works better than a wide tooth comb and does not snag or pull the hair.</li>
            <li> Our family has multiple &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brushes, the real ones, that we bought in a salon, and we love them; when this one came in the mail, I was excited to use it because it had a cuter pattern than the other brushes.</li>
            <li> We have 2 other &amp;#34;wet brushes&amp;#34; and love them.</li>
            <li> We love the wet brush!</li>
            <li> My girls, however, who have long, fine hair, noticed a difference immediately.</li>
            <li> have really long, fine hair that gets tangled all the time.</li>
            <li> No more tears when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair with this amazing brush.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my fine hair even when it is wet.</li>
            <li> No fuss in pulling and detangling with my new brush!</li>
            <li> I have mid back baby fine straight hair and brush it no problem!</li>
            <li> It goes through wet hair easily.</li>
            <li> This works great for my daughters half straight half curly tangled mess:)</li>
            <li> Could be made a little better for the $.</li>
            <li> It looks like a normal brush.  </li>
            <li> No more ttangles for the whole family :)</li>
            <li> Worked great in my daughters thick wavy hair even dry.</li>
            <li> It actually does work better than any other brush we&#x27;ve had for gently removing tangles.  </li>
            <li> Ohhh my......these brushes are great for girls that sometimes have a hard time brushing their hair due to tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> And we even bought a second Wet brush!&lt;br /&gt;No more battles or tears with a 5 year old and tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> Because I have thick long hair it takes a few times through to get the job done but works great!</li>
            <li> The wet brush is fantastic and I have since bought several as gifts for others.</li>
            <li> so well she isn&#x27;t complaining as much about having her hair brushed!</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and a sensitive head.</li>
            <li> Where a real The&amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush detangles effortlessly, the flimsy bristles of this brush simply tear at the hair.</li>
            <li> Do you fight with your daughter 6yr old daughter when brushing her hair because it hurts, pulls, etc?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly sensitive head</li>
            <li> I have one daughter with naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My 18 month old daughter used to cry every time I had to comb her hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone sensitive to odors does not buy this brush, but buy the metallic instead.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately our dog also loved it when she chewed it up.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull or snag and only one or two strands on the brush after detangling an entire whole head!  </li>
            <li> My girls have long hair, and this has saved us SO much time and heartache.</li>
            <li> I use the Wet brush to brush out my hair first</li>
            <li> Especially, children that may struggle with certain &amp;#34;sensory disorder&amp;#34; challenges and do not like their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> This has been the only brush that makes our mornings crying free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like other brushes that don&#x27;t claim to detangle.  </li>
            <li> After seeing other detangling brushes with bad reviews, I chose this based on the excellent reviews it received.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter HATES having her hair brushed after bath, it gets all tangly.</li>
            <li> yea WET Brush, high five to you!</li>
            <li> /&gt; Not a wet teary eye from either</li>
            <li> But BUYER BEWARE, because this is not a REAL Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my 10 yr old daughter who has long medium-textured, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> But it feels wonderful on my scalp...and works wonders with the tangles in my thick kinky hair when wet or dry...and my daughter&#x27;s thick long extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair that gets tangled just by looking at it.</li>
            <li> It took about half the time as a normal brush and didnt hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Wet Brushes I bought previously do not have an odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing, because the pattern is so pretty and fun.</li>
            <li> Long hair, short hair, baby hair, leg hair, back hair</li>
            <li> Plus the fun pattern makes it stand out and therefor hard to loose.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried because the brush feels a little scratchy against my palm.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has hair past her bottom, and it&#x27;s thick but fine.</li>
            <li> so I usually brush through it a few times with the wet brush to get out the main knots, then get my normal brush out to finish it.</li>
            <li> EVERY MORNING WHEN I BRUSH HER LONG HAIR.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull her long hair after shower.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and brushing after shower or pool is a task.</li>
            <li> But her hair is straight and not as thick.</li>
            <li> This one has different bristles than the other 2 (which were purchased from my hair salon) and it does not get the tangles out like the others do.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair like my other brush.</li>
            <li> The brush can be used on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> They say that there is something special about the bristles, but I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old has spent years crying and fighting me when it comes to brushing her hair, but now thanks to the wet brush, crying is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> Wet or dry.....</li>
            <li> but all whining has stopped when both wet and dry brushing my girls hair.</li>
            <li> Passes through tangles in wet hair or dry.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this was a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Look for a brush that says &amp;#34;The &#x27;Wet&#x27; Brush on the handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughters who always struggle when it comes time to brush or comb out their wet hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I think this brush along with a wide comb works well.  </li>
            <li> used to have to dedicate 15 mins after the shower to brushing my knots out from my hair getting wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be like any other brush..</li>
            <li> It is hard to contain my excitement for a brush that keeps two girls from screaming when having their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle for a $9 brush.</li>
            <li> I lay down, bird&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that brushes wet hair out this well!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thin hair that tends to get very tangled.</li>
            <li> I leave less hair in the brush.  </li>
            <li> And now, it takes me less than 5</li>
            <li> WE WERE THINKING ABOUT GETTING HER HAIR CUT, BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION FOR THAT UNRULY TANGLED MESS OF HAIR</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and long hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick long hair &amp; this brush just slides through the tangles!</li>
            <li> but I know some little girls who do and guess who&#x27;s getting this brush for Christmas?</li>
            <li> Thank you wet brush!!!</li>
            <li> i have ordered metalic green and metallic</li>
            <li> BUT I still use my round brush to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, just a few strands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She has very thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush, no more crying when combing her hair.</li>
            <li> My little one has very curly crazy hair!</li>
            <li> No more tears when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, difficult hair and this brush is a miracle.</li>
            <li> It hardly even feels like it&#x27;s going through my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is so thick and</li>
            <li> It folds as I try to brush my daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li> She is not yanking out an insane amount of hair anymore and hair length has grown so quickly (not losing it as fast as it is growing anymore).</li>
            <li> The brushes I bought for the kids are solid colors and are not peeling at all, but my patterned one is peeling badly.</li>
            <li> Not good for very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but this has worked wonders on her thick hair!</li>
            <li> and my hair isn&#x27;t broken from a struggle with the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave to person with thin hair</li>
            <li> It is easier and less painful to brush my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> We used to hate hair brushing time due to snarls.</li>
            <li> My daughter was disappointed when she got the wrong brush in the mail.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to brush-</li>
            <li> But the colors are so dull...kind of faded.little disappointed.</li>
            <li> We went from, &amp;#34;I hate brushing my hair&amp;#34;, &amp;</li>
            <li> She has always hated to brush her hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this brush, it didn&#x27;t work as advertised at all.  </li>
            <li> #34;I want too cut my hair off&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;This is the worst ever&amp;#34;, to &amp;</li>
            <li> I intended to make this a gift, but it had a horrible odor like rubbery gasoline.  </li>

            <li> I cannot believe I did not buy this years ago! My girls have long hair, and this has saved us SO much time and heartache. The knots come out their hair SO fast now, and it does not hurt them. I bought a second one to keep in their swim bag. A+. Every parent needs to buy this brush.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s okay.  Not any better than a regular brush with flexible teeth that I can get in the store.</li>
            <li> Very good brush, goes right through the hair:)</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brush. My daughter has shoulder length curls and it goes right through them. I have mid back baby fine straight hair and brush it no problem! LOVE IT. I showed my stylist and she even went out and bought some after seeing how well it worked in our hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and a sensitive head. This has been the only brush that makes our mornings crying free. I would recommend it to every mom with a daughter.</li>
            <li> It looks like a normal brush.  They say that there is something special about the bristles, but I was skeptical.  Then I tried it.  I leave less hair in the brush.  Tangles come free.  My waves look great.  My daughter&#x27;s curls look better than ever.  I bought one for each female in my family!</li>
            <li> I love it.  Works great on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I only wish they had sent the pattern I ordered!</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter HATES having her hair brushed after bath, it gets all tangly. This brush runs right through wet hair so easily.</li>
            <li> great hair brush for all lengths of hair</li>
            <li> I have never found anything that brushes wet hair out this well!! I use it on my kids and myself. We all love it and the colors and patterns are so pretty and cute. Would recommend for all ages any type of hair!</li>
            <li> Every brush in the house was thrown out when this angel of mercy brush arrived!!!  And we even bought a second Wet brush!&lt;br /&gt;No more battles or tears with a 5 year old and tangled hair.  The brush&#x27;s pins are flexible and bend.  Wet or dry it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> It folds as I try to brush my daughters thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush so my youngest daughter could have her own Wet Brush, as her sisters do.  But BUYER BEWARE, because this is not a REAL Wet Brush. The logo is styled to look like the logo of a much better brush, The &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush; in fact, I think that logo is how you can distinguish a true wet brush from a knockoff. Our family has multiple &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brushes, the real ones, that we bought in a salon, and we love them; when this one came in the mail, I was excited to use it because it had a cuter pattern than the other brushes.

Where a real The&amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush detangles effortlessly, the flimsy bristles of this brush simply tear at the hair. If you are purchasing this brush expecting to receive the brush you&#x27;ve doubtless heard someone else rave about, this is not it. Look for a brush that says &amp;#34;The &#x27;Wet&#x27; Brush on the handle. You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried because the brush feels a little scratchy against my palm.

Doesn&#x27;t pull or snag and only one or two strands on the brush after detangling an entire whole head!  I am ordering more!!!</li>
            <li> i love its performance absolutely. This is my 3 rd comb of this type(earlier i have ordered metalic green and metallic pink).&lt;br /&gt;I simply ordered this one to have a spare in my car.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting bright colors as shown in the picture. But the colors are so dull...kind of faded.little disappointed. But solves my purpose.</li>
            <li> what a great idea!  Cute colors too.  Only thing is I&#x27;m wondering if it is PVC free.  I hope so!</li>
            <li> My daughter love it. It doesn&#x27;t pull her long hair after shower.</li>
            <li> Do you fight with your daughter 6yr old daughter when brushing her hair because it hurts, pulls, etc?  We went from, &amp;#34;I hate brushing my hair&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;I want too cut my hair off&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;This is the worst ever&amp;#34;, to &amp;#34;Daddy?, I love brushing my hair now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck yea WET Brush, high five to you!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair at all.</li>
            <li> This brush works wonders! It really helps with knotty hair and works great on wet hair too. I&#x27;m not saying my kids never complain when I brush their hair, but since buying this brush the complaining has definitely been minimized.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! Love them for my daughters hair!</li>
            <li> Great brush for tangles</li>
            <li> Love it!  No more tears when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Wet or dry.....she doesn&#x27;t cry.  Unfortunately our dog also loved it when she chewed it up.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Has really improved my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She is not yanking out an insane amount of hair anymore and hair length has grown so quickly (not losing it as fast as it is growing anymore).</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. It hardly even feels like it&#x27;s going through my hair. I don&#x27;t have a particularly sensitive head but I know some little girls who do and guess who&#x27;s getting this brush for Christmas? I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but it does!</li>
            <li> Love it....does everything it is suppose to do BUT I still use my round brush to style my hair.  I use the Wet brush to brush out my hair first</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this brush on wet hair and it goes right through.  The bristles are flexible so it is kind to hair and scalp.  Fun design, too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughters who always struggle when it comes time to brush or comb out their wet hair after shampooing. They think it&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;, better than just a regular brush.  They still don&#x27;t like combing or brushing their hair out. I wanted them to love it and not have to struggle with wet hair but that didn&#x27;t happen. I think this brush along with a wide comb works well.  The brush can be used on dry hair as well. Overall, I think this brush is designed better than a regular brush for wet hair but not quite as good as all the 5 star reviews it has received.</li>
            <li> We keep this brush in the shower for my daughters rat nest hair.  She has always hated to brush her hair but this has worked wonders on her thick hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my 10 yr old daughter who has long medium-textured, wavy hair.  It actually does work better than any other brush we&#x27;ve had for gently removing tangles.  She is very happy with it, and I consider it a great purchase.</li>
            <li> We have 2 other &amp;#34;wet brushes&amp;#34; and love them. This one has different bristles than the other 2 (which were purchased from my hair salon) and it does not get the tangles out like the others do. It pulls my girls hair. I am thinking it may not be an authentic &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34;!  I would send it back but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle for a $9 brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on wet hair!!  I have one daughter with naturally curly hair so I had some doubts but could not be happier!  Was also very happy with the company we ordered from.  The product went to our old address and they were very easy to work with in getting it shipped back out to the correct address.</li>
            <li> No fuss in pulling and detangling with my new brush! Love it</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  It goes through wet hair easily.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old daughter used to cry every time I had to comb her hair. It woks like magic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;just&amp;#34; a brush, but what a brush!  Used side-by-side with my &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; brush, this one is the hands-down winner for getting my waist-length hair detangled pronto.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase, lots of options on Amazon re:  brush color, they all work!</li>
            <li> I received a different print than the one pictured. I&#x27;m hoping the seller will switch it out. It was probably an honest mistake.  My daughter was disappointed when she got the wrong brush in the mail. I am a huge fan of these brushes though. If I had received the correct print I would have given 5 stars. Hopefully I can edit my review after the error is corrected.</li>
            <li> After seeing other detangling brushes with bad reviews, I chose this based on the excellent reviews it received. My daughter has hair past her bottom, and it&#x27;s thick but fine. Very difficult to brush- however, this is by far the best detangling brush we have used. The whole family uses it now. We all have fine hair that tangles easily. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I intended to make this a gift, but it had a horrible odor like rubbery gasoline.  The &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34; Wet Brushes I bought previously do not have an odor.  I recommend anyone sensitive to odors does not buy this brush, but buy the metallic instead.  I returned this brush.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this was a little smaller. Design is nice, but this is large that a child has trouble using.. But Mommy / Grammie love it. No ouchies.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Its gentle on your hair and won&#x27;t pull. It also works good on dry hair too. Its also a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> We have a pile of brushes that my daughter has for her tangled hair. None of them perform like this one. And, the pattern is cute.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my fine hair even when it is wet.</li>
            <li> Super fast.  Goes right through my girls ratty hair.</li>
            <li> We love the wet brush! Cute new colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this brush, it didn&#x27;t work as advertised at all.  It&#x27;s exactly like other brushes that don&#x27;t claim to detangle.  The only bright spot for this purchase was the seller, who was very responsive and super helpful when the package was lost in the mail.  A+ seller.</li>
            <li> The wet brush is fantastic and I have since bought several as gifts for others. Plus the fun pattern makes it stand out and therefor hard to loose.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift for the very tender headed member of our family.  She has very thick, long hair.  After her shower she had to run in to show us all how magical it is.</li>
            <li> My hair is very tangly after a shower, and this brush does work better than a regular brush! It is easier and less painful to brush my hair after a shower. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Best brush!! My daughter has curly hair and we had tried many different ones. This one is by far best far curly hair.</li>
            <li> This brush, brushes hair.  Long hair, short hair, baby hair, leg hair, back hair - you name it!  No more ttangles for the whole family :) Thank you wet brush!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be like any other brush..but thought id try it out. I have long hair and brushing after shower or pool is a task. When i used the brush for the first time i was very pleased! It took about half the time as a normal brush and didnt hurt at all. Plus it makes me very happy to know that i am not pulling through my hair.</li>
            <li> My little one has very curly crazy hair! I have extremely thick and long hair!&lt;br /&gt; Not a wet teary eye from either if us when using this brush! No owie mommy from her! Because I have thick long hair it takes a few times through to get the job done but works great! Recommend!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Works wonderfully! My daughter has thick long hair &amp; this brush just slides through the tangles!</li>
            <li> Worked great in my daughters thick wavy hair even dry. Could be made a little better for the $.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hair brush that can easily untangle my daughter&#x27;s curly hair in under 5 minutes. Great brush!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush, the colors on the brush are muted from the pic. But this brush is awesome. I have brushes I like but this is great for hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Brush works like dream. Don&#x27;t know how or why it does but all whining has stopped when both wet and dry brushing my girls hair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I have long, difficult hair and this brush is a miracle.</li>
            <li> This brush is so awesome! My daughter will finally Let me brush her hair!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without it.</li>
            <li> Best hair brush in the world. We used to hate hair brushing time due to snarls. This brush glides thru snarls like butter. Holds up well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work...was just another brush. I have 4 different hair types in my home ranging from fine to course and this brush did nothing for either texture. I gave it to my kids to brush their dolls hair.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use with a child.</li>
            <li> OMG THE SOLUTION TO MY MORNING FRUSTRATIONS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really long, fine hair that gets tangled all the time. I lay down, bird&#x27;s nest. I sneeze, bird&#x27;s nest. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to dedicate 15 mins after the shower to brushing my knots out from my hair getting wet in the shower. And now, it takes me less than 5 and my hair isn&#x27;t broken from a struggle with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST. INVENTION. EVER.</li>
            <li> I love it. Feels so good on my head.</li>
            <li> Best brush for deknotting my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a Wet Brush on the strong recommendation of a friend, and I LOVE it. I bought two more for two of my children who have tangled hair. I would give the brush itself five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this design is peeling off the brush. The brushes I bought for the kids are solid colors and are not peeling at all, but my patterned one is peeling badly. It&#x27;s disappointing, because the pattern is so pretty and fun.</li>
            <li> I have the thickest hair my sister got one for Christmas, i have to purchase one now! cant stop using hers i cant believe how great it really works reccommend to everyone! love it</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about this brush and I only wish I heard about it sooner. My daughter has very thin hair that tends to get very tangled. Ever since getting this brush we no longer have any tears during daily brushing time.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH! Makes tangles painless.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this brush and recommended it because I have very curly hair that&#x27;s always tangled. I like it a lot and am not disappointed. It definitely doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair like my other brush. It doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair as easily as it does for her. But her hair is straight and not as thick. Overall I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> Works great for wet hair.  Does everything it says it will.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. I have fine, thin hair that gets tangled just by looking at it. These have been a life saver and I don&#x27;t know why I just found them. I will never use a regular brush again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick hair. This brush works great on it - wet or dry. Great on mine too.</li>
            <li> The wet brush does brush your hair without pulling it, so as far as that goes I would rate this as 5 stars. But I gave it 3 stars because it won&#x27;t brush all the way through my hair.  If you have thin hair, this product would be great for you.  I have long thick hair so I usually brush through it a few times with the wet brush to get out the main knots, then get my normal brush out to finish it.</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing!  perfect for everyone in the family. no tangles and no tears!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush! This is the best hair brush I have ever had! I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> This brush really is like magic! I heard about it from a friend and figured I might as well try it. It goes through my hair like a hot knife through butter. It was amazing. No pulling, tangling, catching, knotting. Would reccomend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Yep, it works. Passes through tangles in wet hair or dry. I was really surprised. Does any hair come out? Yes, just a few strands.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the price which seems to include the cost of \\&quot;free\\&quot; shipping.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!!!! My 7 year old has spent years crying and fighting me when it comes to brushing her hair, but now thanks to the wet brush, crying is a thing of the past. Thank you wet brush :)</li>
            <li> A brush that actually works on my daughter&#x27;s knots!!!  Thank you Lord!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots and lots of brushes. This is a magic brush. It is hard to contain my excitement for a brush that keeps two girls from screaming when having their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for Afro hair. The brush works better than a wide tooth comb and does not snag or pull the hair.</li>
            <li> No pain when brushing tangled hair, Our kids love it!</li>
            <li> This works great for my daughters half straight half curly tangled mess:)</li>
            <li> Ohhh my......these brushes are great for girls that sometimes have a hard time brushing their hair due to tangled hair.  My daughters loved them and I would highly recommend them to other families.  Especially, children that may struggle with certain &amp;#34;sensory disorder&amp;#34; challenges and do not like their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Not good for very thick hair.  Gave to person with thin hair and it works nicely</li>
            <li> perfect for my daughters curly matted hair!  best solution yet!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush, no more crying when combing her hair.</li>
