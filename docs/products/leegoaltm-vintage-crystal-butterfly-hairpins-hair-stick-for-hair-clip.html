            <li> Cute, a little heavy but works well  with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here, pictures don&#x27;t do justice.  </li>
            <li> Not worth sending back....</li>
            <li> This is large and heavy and I am not sure it will be used.</li>
            <li> i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> Not too big, or too heavy, I can pull my hair back in a half pony tail &amp; clip it</li>
            <li> It is a little bit heavy though, and also bigger than I imagined thus only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My only problem is it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>

            <li> little heavy not good for bangs or short hair .</li>
            <li> , I think it will be a little too heavy.</li>
            <li> Looks vintage and girly, it is a little heavy, but I use it for accents to a messy updo and buns.</li>
            <li> &amp; it isn&#x27;t too heavy &amp; stays in place.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s REALLY heavy!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty!</li>
            <li> it was very heavy.</li>
            <li> VERY heavy.</li>
            <li> It is a disappointment, due to the price  and some health problems it is not worth the effort</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s thick.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy!</li>
            <li> and it was very dull to look at.</li>

            <li> Beautiful. Well made. Doesn&#x27;t hold thicknl hair very well. Needs extra support from bobby pins.</li>
            <li> This hair piece is very elegant and weel made, it is NOT something that will break easily. This hair clip is great for casual or formal occasions. I have received many compliments on this piece:)</li>
            <li> This is very beautiful!  I have long hair a little past my waist and it&#x27;s thick.  This clip holds my hair fine and I don&#x27;t have to use bobbie pins.  It came sooner then expected.  I am so glad that I ordered it. I put my hair in a ponytail, then twist it into a bun.  Then I use this clip to hold the ends. I put the bow on the side of the bun.  It looks really cute and it stays in my hair.  I am so glad that I ordered it.  I highly recommend buying this clip.</li>
            <li> Finishes off an updo beautifully. Took a long time to get here, pictures don&#x27;t do justice.  Not to heavy, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! The colors were actually a little brighter than expected, but I really like it and have gotten many compliments!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty clip.  The colors of the stones are more of a red and green mix.  It will be lovely for Christmas.  I wish it had more blue stones, which is what the online photo looked like to me, but they are more green stones.  It is real pretty and good quality, stays in my fine hair nicely.  When I put my hair up in a bun or ponytail, it sits nicely and looks great in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really lovely; this is much larger and more substantial than I expected!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Granddaughter, although she has waist length hair it was very heavy. She didn&#x27;t seem to like it very well, the extra weight made her head hurt and it was very dull to look at. It is a disappointment, due to the price  and some health problems it is not worth the effort it would take to send back.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CGKC6LI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
            <li> My favorite accessory, and for the price, OMG!</li>
            <li> This product has been a great addition to my hair accessories! I get compliments allllll the time wondering where I got it from! It is cute vintage hair accessory!!!!!!</li>
            <li> really very pretty.  looks vintage.  VERY heavy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but heavy.</li>
            <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
            <li> I love it. Its beautiful and perfect. Thank you.</li>
            <li> took forever to receive, but am incredibly impressed with the size and quality! Looks vintage and girly, it is a little heavy, but I use it for accents to a messy updo and buns. It holds very strong so far.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.  All the colorful stones make it easy to match out fits.</li>
            <li> Cute, a little heavy but works well  with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, was missing a stone, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> Very heavy! Nice material. Very nicely made. Arrived early.</li>
            <li> Looks great.  Made well.  Stays put in my hair. I get lots of compliments on it.  I tell everyone where I got it!</li>
            <li> Pretty, but  I expected it to be larger</li>
            <li> this clip is lovely, an excellent touch for the hair. My daughter and I both use it, she has a lot of hair so she can wear it otherwise for girls with short hair, I think it will be a little too heavy.</li>
            <li> This clip looks really cute, but it can&#x27;t hold into the hair, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> love it! little heavy not good for bangs or short hair .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite hair clips.  The color of the metal looks great with my hair.</li>
