            <li>First of all, this gloss smells great!  </li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now one of my favorite lip products!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews, I decided to try this gloss.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way the gloss feels (it&#x27;s not sticky- kind of like petroleum jelly).</li>
            <li>I love love love this lip gloss!!</li>
            <li>Wow, this is great stuff!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny, goes on easily, smells and tastes nice and</li>
            <li>I lOve it.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite gloss/lip color go to.  </li>
            <li>And I love the way they feel on my lips.</li>
            <li>but thats ok</li>
            <li>I love lipg gloss and lip stick and was hoping this would be an inexpensive lip gloss that would add color.  </li>
            <li>It is way more money</li>
            <li>Love love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love that after the gloss comes off, the color stays stained on your lips.</li>
            <li>For some reason the color came out more reddish on my lips</li>
            <li>When it comes to affordable makeup brands, NYX is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>but when I opened up the bag was all sticky and I lost most of the gloss.</li>
            <li>I love this gloss.</li>
            <li>I love these stuff.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, I love this lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I have used NYX products and love their brand.</li>
            <li>I liked the color it goes on originally</li>
            <li>Loved it because when the gloss disappears it leaves a beautiful pink color on your lips</li>
            <li>It gives a really great red shade to your lips, it&#x27;s honestly the perfect shade of red.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent and leaves lips very soft.</li>
            <li>This gloss turns a great, very natural shade of pink/red which stays even after the gloss fades.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin and loved the way it looked when i put it on, but after it finished &amp;#34;developing&amp;#34; it was very bright pink, so i don&#x27;t use it all that much</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and the color is beautiful, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought this product because it sounds interesting.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best gloss I&#x27;ve ever used, and this one with the nice stain is just a huge plus, especially for summer.</li>
            <li>It goes great over any lipstick and is always a different shade.</li>
            <li>Afterall, it&#x27;s cheap, and I don&#x27;t always want to wear a lipstick.</li>
            <li>Bonny bell is better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it, nice feelings on the lips, not wet or too slippery.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that even if your gloss wears off during the day, the pink stain stays on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a sweet, almost bubble gum-ish taste and smell.</li>
            <li>One even felt like it was partially full as oppose to the others.  </li>
            <li>Again, I should have paid attention and its not a bad lip gloss</li>
            <li>but after awhile it changes to a bright pink which I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of.</li>
            <li>Even after wiping it off, the taste and smell of it linger, as it is super sticky chemical</li>
            <li>It dries too quickly and than feels pasty.</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t sticky at all and it has just enough color to make it look natural, but beautiful.</li>
            <li>just wish that the tubes were bigger with more in them!</li>
            <li>I had the blue gloss and loved it because of the incredible shine (even though the blue never changed colors for me), and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The color is great, but I think it was a little sticky.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s still available when I&#x27;m ready to purchase another one.</li>
            <li>Fun and flirty.</li>
            <li>the  pale rose shade, it changes into, is lovely.</li>
            <li>It turns out to be such a perfect pink!</li>
            <li>I normally get nauseated when lip products have a sent and taste, but this was very mild and was very pleasant.</li>
            <li>but over time ended up bright hot pink.</li>
            <li>The great pink color is very natural looking</li>
            <li>I wore it out with my friends not expecting anything more than a typical gloss, but as the night went on it turned my lips a beautiful shade of pink that lasted for HOURS!</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the pink/reddish color is not that pretty.</li>
            <li>This is this first view I have ever done</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss, even after the gloss runs out it leaves your lips stained just enough.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty.  </li>
            <li>a nice rosy pink.  </li>
            <li>, Exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept buying it over the years and just recently ran out and purchased more.</li>
            <li>When I first applied the lip gloss</li>
            <li>It is priced very reasonably, so I don&#x27;t feel like I have really lost out on anything.</li>
            <li>I love it and it smells better than other similar products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I was on a mission to find a certain shade, but nothing seemed to work well with my pinkish skin undertones.</li>
            <li>This one too has the amazing high gloss as my other one</li>
            <li>Great product and very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Just a nice rosy pink that looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s hard for me to find a good shade of lip gloss.</li>
            <li>It is very SHINY.</li>
            <li>Its arrival was fast and just as promised in the description.</li>
            <li>i really like this product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a 3.5 star.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really pay attention.</li>
            <li>It goes on a nice, thin, and a clear pink and continues to change to the perfect shade of pink for your lips</li>
            <li>I was also happily surprised that, even after the gloss wore off, the beautiful shade stayed behind.</li>
            <li>First feels like clear gloss, but in a minute tints your lips couple shades pinker.</li>
            <li>This gave me a little Pink but also a great SHINE.</li>
            <li>This is my new lipcolor!</li>
            <li>I received the 3 tubes of NYX Mood Lip Gloss, Romantic Love, 0.31 Fluid Ounce and NONE of them had a protective wrapping or seal.  </li>
            <li>It turns a nice pink on your lips the way lipstick would look, but it doesn&#x27;t feel gross like lipstick.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more as soon as I am down to I tube!</li>
            <li>It is very runny and a liquified clear gel.</li>
            <li>it was a light pink color</li>
            <li>a very natural and healthy looking shade that goes with everyhing and your dont&#x27; look heavily made up.</li>
            <li>They always have something new to try.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle pinkish/rose color.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s always to dark, sticky, or even to light.</li>
            <li>I like that it goes on clear then</li>
            <li>I would go so far as to say this acts as a lip stain and gloss in one.</li>
            <li>it brings out the natural colour in my lips</li>
            <li>Imagine my dismay when, after trying it on, I found this gloss over to be completely unwearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fun and moisturizing and redish pink on my lips.</li>
            <li>The pink is a subtle shade that&#x27;s not too bright and looks like your lips are naturally a bit pinkish.</li>
            <li>was clear then changed to a pretty pink</li>
            <li>hot pink-</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t buy lip gloss because I don&#x27;t like that stickiness, but this one is so much different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super expensive and it makes your lips super soft, so it&#x27;s kind of like an all in one product: balm, gloss, and stain.  </li>
            <li>The actual product was smaller than I expected (not sure if the actual size was listed in the description), but otherwise is a very nice lip gloss.</li>
            <li>The product we placed in a big box with other products and the cap was not tight enough so most of the lip gloss was spilled over the bags and boxes of the other products.</li>
            <li>And the color really does last quite a long time even after the gloss has worn away.</li>
            <li>I got this lip gloss, thinking it might add a subtle hint of pink to my lips, and that would be okay.</li>
            <li>the EXACT same shade that Fran Wilson&#x27;s moodmaker green lipstick changes to.</li>
            <li>It has a very moist and glossy look, so just use a little.</li>

            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really a 3.5 star.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really pay attention.</li>
            <li> It goes on a nice, thin, and a clear pink and continues to change to the perfect shade of pink for your lips</li>
            <li> I was also happily surprised that, even after the gloss wore off, the beautiful shade stayed behind.</li>
            <li> First feels like clear gloss, but in a minute tints your lips couple shades pinker.</li>
            <li> This gave me a little Pink but also a great SHINE.</li>
            <li> This is my new lipcolor!</li>
            <li> I received the 3 tubes of NYX Mood Lip Gloss, Romantic Love, 0.31 Fluid Ounce and NONE of them had a protective wrapping or seal.  </li>
            <li> It turns a nice pink on your lips the way lipstick would look, but it doesn&#x27;t feel gross like lipstick.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more as soon as I am down to I tube!</li>
            <li> It is very runny and a liquified clear gel.</li>
            <li> it was a light pink color</li>
            <li> a very natural and healthy looking shade that goes with everyhing and your dont&#x27; look heavily made up.</li>
            <li> They always have something new to try.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle pinkish/rose color.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s always to dark, sticky, or even to light.</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on clear then</li>
            <li> I would go so far as to say this acts as a lip stain and gloss in one.</li>
            <li> it brings out the natural colour in my lips</li>
            <li> Imagine my dismay when, after trying it on, I found this gloss over to be completely unwearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fun and moisturizing and redish pink on my lips.</li>
            <li> The pink is a subtle shade that&#x27;s not too bright and looks like your lips are naturally a bit pinkish.</li>
            <li> was clear then changed to a pretty pink</li>
            <li> hot pink-</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t buy lip gloss because I don&#x27;t like that stickiness, but this one is so much different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super expensive and it makes your lips super soft, so it&#x27;s kind of like an all in one product: balm, gloss, and stain.  </li>
            <li> The actual product was smaller than I expected (not sure if the actual size was listed in the description), but otherwise is a very nice lip gloss.</li>
            <li> The product we placed in a big box with other products and the cap was not tight enough so most of the lip gloss was spilled over the bags and boxes of the other products.</li>
            <li> And the color really does last quite a long time even after the gloss has worn away.</li>
            <li> I got this lip gloss, thinking it might add a subtle hint of pink to my lips, and that would be okay.</li>
            <li> the EXACT same shade that Fran Wilson&#x27;s moodmaker green lipstick changes to.</li>
            <li> It has a very moist and glossy look, so just use a little.</li>
            <li> It taints everything you eat or drink, much like in the way eating something immediately after brushing your teeth would, only with the harsh taste of chemicals (it tastes like Lysol smells!).</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the texture is thinner than I&#x27;d prefer, and it doesn&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; for long.  </li>
            <li> I love the nyx brand, and figured this might be a less expensive option than Dior&#x27;s color changing &amp;#34;addict&amp;#34; line.  </li>
            <li> The lip gloss didnt stay very long.  </li>
            <li> The gloss comes out of the tube clear and then turns pink after a few minutes on your lips.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not very glossy for very long.</li>
            <li> the packaging was a little big for it</li>
            <li> Really no color, no stain.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be too pink for me.</li>
            <li> it goes on clear as stated but turns into the prettiest lip color, seriously.</li>
            <li> it goes on clear but then changes into a subtle candy apple red/pink shade.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss just like any other colored lip gloss, except that the color does not appear</li>
            <li> it is the sickly sweet artificial smell</li>
            <li> The other day I came across this lip gloss while pilfering through the makeup section at Target.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything other than that.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was less &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;, that is why it did not get five stars.</li>
            <li> I like that the color changes slightly</li>
            <li> I didnt see the color left behind like some of the other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> it has (like a few other lip glosses I&#x27;ve used in the past)</li>
            <li> color unevenly turns pink/red.</li>
            <li> and i had to try it out because i hate putting layers of lip stick on plus gloss just to get a pretty pink.</li>
            <li> not only tastes like someone mixed Fruity Pebbles with toxic waste, but this horrible taste COATS YOUR ENTIRE MOUTH, and stays there.</li>
            <li> NOT SATISFIED</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> There was hardly any color to this at all.</li>
            <li> Just plain lipgloss to me!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i find myself thinking twice about using this gloss because of the heavy and funky chemically taste and smell of this lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Not a nice experience!</li>
            <li> and it gets worse if you drink something with the gloss on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real sucker for anything that changes colour, so I couldn&#x27;t pass this up.</li>
            <li> I throw it over a pink base to amp it up for night too.</li>
            <li> as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> cause your beverage will have the funky weird taste as well.  </li>
            <li> but I felt this disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> because i hate reapplying every hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky nor does it have a nasty taste.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> sheer with a pop!  love this product!  just wish that the tubes were bigger with more in them!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss just like any other colored lip gloss, except that the color does not appear evenly.&lt;br /&gt;The color unevenly turns pink/red. Also, the pink/reddish color is not that pretty. It&#x27;s almost identical to regular pink/red colored lip glosses. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target for $4.99. It is very runny and a liquified clear gel. It glides on and sometimes can get out of the lines. Smells Yummy.  It is like a tinted lipgloss. It is very SHINY. It is fun and moisturizing and redish pink on my lips. I lOve it.</li>
            <li> Tints your lips, stays for a while. First feels like clear gloss, but in a minute tints your lips couple shades pinker. I love it, nice feelings on the lips, not wet or too slippery.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite gloss/lip color go to.  I get compliments daily,  and I have yet to find a guy (whether my husband or any of our friends) that don&#x27;t stare at my lips and ask what lipstick I am wearing since my lips are always glossy and have great color.  I will happily stock up on this product at the Amazon price...  It is AMAZING in every way!</li>
            <li> Aficionado...addict...whatever!  I love the nyx brand, and figured this might be a less expensive option than Dior&#x27;s color changing &amp;#34;addict&amp;#34; line.  This gives a nice pop of color, without being clown-makeup bright.  After the gloss wears off, it acts as a stain, and the color lasts. I gave it 4 stars because the texture is thinner than I&#x27;d prefer, and it doesn&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; for long.  It also has a sweet, almost bubble gum-ish taste and smell.</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on clear then turns to the perfect shade of color. :)</li>
            <li> These glosses are the best. And I love the way they feel on my lips. I can&#x27;t help but re-order them. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> i got this lip gloss and i had to try it out because i hate putting layers of lip stick on plus gloss just to get a pretty pink. i put it on it was clear then changed to a pretty pink it lasted for a good part of the day which is a plus because i hate reapplying every hour. the packaging was a little big for it but thats ok</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the color is beautiful, very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real sucker for anything that changes colour, so I couldn&#x27;t pass this up. The gloss comes out of the tube clear and then turns pink after a few minutes on your lips. The pink is a subtle shade that&#x27;s not too bright and looks like your lips are naturally a bit pinkish. The great thing is that even if your gloss wears off during the day, the pink stain stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the sickly sweet artificial smell it has (like a few other lip glosses I&#x27;ve used in the past) but it&#x27;s not a big deal to me so I&#x27;m still giving this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product and very hard to find in stores. Long-lasting and great color.</li>
            <li> I love lipg gloss and lip stick and was hoping this would be an inexpensive lip gloss that would add color.  I purchased mood lip gloss and senual mood lip gloss.  I was disappoined in both.  Really no color, no stain.  The lip gloss didnt stay very long.  I will have to stay with Too Faced mood lip gloss that changes colors annd is a lip stain.  It is way more money but it works.  This is this first view I have ever done but I felt this disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> this lipgloss is awesome! it goes on clear as stated but turns into the prettiest lip color, seriously. This is my new lipcolor! who needs lipstick if you got this!? not me!</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss, even after the gloss runs out it leaves your lips stained just enough. This is definitely something I will always have to have in my purse</li>
            <li> Love love love love this stuff. It goes on a nice, thin, and a clear pink and continues to change to the perfect shade of pink for your lips and I love that after the gloss comes off, the color stays stained on your lips. Making it look like a natural pink. It&#x27;s the best of both worlds. Lip gloss and a stain!</li>
            <li> I had the blue gloss and loved it because of the incredible shine (even though the blue never changed colors for me), and it lasts a long time. This made me want to try this one as reviewers said this one did leave a color on  your lips. I LOVE THIS ONE! The great pink color is very natural looking and it stays on, so even if you wear the gloss off the color is still there. Just a nice rosy pink that looks very natural. This one too has the amazing high gloss as my other one, I get compliments every time I wear it. It is by far the best gloss I&#x27;ve ever used, and this one with the nice stain is just a huge plus, especially for summer.</li>
            <li> The product we placed in a big box with other products and the cap was not tight enough so most of the lip gloss was spilled over the bags and boxes of the other products. Not a nice experience!</li>
            <li> Loved it because when the gloss disappears it leaves a beautiful pink color on your lips</li>
            <li> Nice subtle pinkish/rose color. Fun and flirty. Has a great scent and leaves lips very soft. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s hard for me to find a good shade of lip gloss. Itâ€™s always to dark, sticky, or even to light. This matched my lips perfectly and provided great moisture. I normally get nauseated when lip products have a sent and taste, but this was very mild and was very pleasant. I would very much recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful please select the â€˜yesâ€™ button below.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lip gloss!! I bought 8 tubes of it! Will be buying more as soon as I am down to I tube!</li>
            <li> this is the next step up darker than but it&#x27;s still pretty.  I could not find it locally and wanted to try it after seeing it use on a TV show.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful, tastes great, and turns your lips the perfect shade of pink! I buy this every chance I get, and probably own about 6 tubes now lol!</li>
            <li> I had no problems purchasing this product. Its arrival was fast and just as promised in the description. The actual product was smaller than I expected (not sure if the actual size was listed in the description), but otherwise is a very nice lip gloss. I love the color!</li>
            <li> While I had it every bit of 2 days after delivery. I loved it. I do not wear makeup. This gave me a little Pink but also a great SHINE.</li>
            <li> This gloss turns a great, very natural shade of pink/red which stays even after the gloss fades. I love it and it smells better than other similar products I&#x27;ve used before. I think this one will last quite a while, but I would definitely buy another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> The other day I came across this lip gloss while pilfering through the makeup section at Target. I was on a mission to find a certain shade, but nothing seemed to work well with my pinkish skin undertones. I got this lip gloss, thinking it might add a subtle hint of pink to my lips, and that would be okay. I was truly delighted when it turned into this beautiful reddish/pink color that suited my complexion perfectly! I was also happily surprised that, even after the gloss wore off, the beautiful shade stayed behind. I&#x27;m now in love with this product, and I&#x27;m recommending it everyone!</li>
            <li> For some reason the color came out more reddish on my lips</li>
            <li> When it comes to affordable makeup brands, NYX is my favorite. They always have something new to try. I seen this gloss while browsing Amazon. The color is great, but I think it was a little sticky. I just wish it was less &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;, that is why it did not get five stars.</li>
            <li> It has a very moist and glossy look, so just use a little. Keeps lips moist and the color looks great. I don&#x27;t have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> First of all, this gloss smells great!  I love the color it turns my lips: a nice rosy pink.  It&#x27;s not super expensive and it makes your lips super soft, so it&#x27;s kind of like an all in one product: balm, gloss, and stain.  Great choice!  I wear it every day.</li>
            <li> i really like this product and i like the way it stains your lips, Exactly what i was looking for but when I opened up the bag was all sticky and I lost most of the gloss.</li>
            <li> This gloss is great to have on hand. Great for daytime/natural look. I throw it over a pink base to amp it up for night too.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss! I wore it out with my friends not expecting anything more than a typical gloss, but as the night went on it turned my lips a beautiful shade of pink that lasted for HOURS! I would go so far as to say this acts as a lip stain and gloss in one. It&#x27;s now one of my favorite lip products! It&#x27;s inexpensive and just as good (or better!) as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Its okay, not the best I&#x27;ve seen but I like the way it feels on my lips. The color, though is not something I would have thought would have been a shade for me. Otherwise its a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this gloss. It goes great over any lipstick and is always a different shade. It&#x27;s not sticky nor does it have a nasty taste.</li>
            <li> it brings out the natural colour in my lips</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t sticky at all and it has just enough color to make it look natural, but beautiful. I love this!</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews, I decided to try this gloss. Afterall, it&#x27;s cheap, and I don&#x27;t always want to wear a lipstick. Imagine my dismay when, after trying it on, I found this gloss over to be completely unwearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It not only tastes like someone mixed Fruity Pebbles with toxic waste, but this horrible taste COATS YOUR ENTIRE MOUTH, and stays there. It taints everything you eat or drink, much like in the way eating something immediately after brushing your teeth would, only with the harsh taste of chemicals (it tastes like Lysol smells!). Even after wiping it off, the taste and smell of it linger, as it is super sticky chemical sludge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is an unnatural looking hot pink- the EXACT same shade that Fran Wilson&#x27;s moodmaker green lipstick changes to. This purchase was a total dud, and even at $4, a total ripoff! Don&#x27;t bother with this loser gloss, oh my god! Blecch!</li>
            <li> I received the 3 tubes of NYX Mood Lip Gloss, Romantic Love, 0.31 Fluid Ounce and NONE of them had a protective wrapping or seal.  All of the products looked as if they had been opened and used as the product was around the seal and opening of each tube.  One even felt like it was partially full as oppose to the others.  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Gross, sticky, i think its been used. :/</li>
            <li> I love these stuff. I&#x27;ve kept buying it over the years and just recently ran out and purchased more. It gives a really great red shade to your lips, it&#x27;s honestly the perfect shade of red.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, I love this lip gloss. it goes on clear but then changes into a subtle candy apple red/pink shade. a very natural and healthy looking shade that goes with everyhing and your dont&#x27; look heavily made up. Unfortunately, i find myself thinking twice about using this gloss because of the heavy and funky chemically taste and smell of this lip gloss. and it gets worse if you drink something with the gloss on cause your beverage will have the funky weird taste as well.  I wish they can change the formulation and take care of this problem. it&#x27;s really a 3.5 star.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way the gloss feels (it&#x27;s not sticky- kind of like petroleum jelly). I found it to be too pink for me. It did work great for an 80s dress up day I had though. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything other than that. It is priced very reasonably, so I don&#x27;t feel like I have really lost out on anything.</li>
            <li> There was hardly any color to this at all. I didnt see the color left behind like some of the other reviewers said. Just plain lipgloss to me!!</li>
            <li> Overall it was alright. I have very light skin and loved the way it looked when i put it on, but after it finished &amp;#34;developing&amp;#34; it was very bright pink, so i don&#x27;t use it all that much</li>
            <li> I read in the comments that this lip gloss changes colors while on your lips but I didn&#x27;t really pay attention. I liked the color it goes on originally but after awhile it changes to a bright pink which I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of. Again, I should have paid attention and its not a bad lip gloss</li>
            <li> It turns a nice pink on your lips the way lipstick would look, but it doesn&#x27;t feel gross like lipstick.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the lip gloss it was a light pink color but over time ended up bright hot pink. Gross.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great stuff!  It&#x27;s shiny, goes on easily, smells and tastes nice and the  pale rose shade, it changes into, is lovely. Hope it&#x27;s still available when I&#x27;m ready to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I like that the color changes slightly but it&#x27;s not very glossy for very long. It dries too quickly and than feels pasty. Bonny bell is better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this product because it sounds interesting. I have used NYX products and love their brand. The first day I used it, I fell in love. It turns out to be such a perfect pink! It&#x27;s really a great summer color. Plus, the lip gloss isn&#x27;t sticky. Normally, I don&#x27;t buy lip gloss because I don&#x27;t like that stickiness, but this one is so much different. And the color really does last quite a long time even after the gloss has worn away. Overall, I give this product 5 stars because it does have everything I ask for in a lip gloss.</li>
