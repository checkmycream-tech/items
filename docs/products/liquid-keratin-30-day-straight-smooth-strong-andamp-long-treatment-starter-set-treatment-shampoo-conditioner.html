    <ol>
            <li>Not too impressed with the product.</li>
            <li>That in itself make me happy!</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved this!</li>
            <li>and her hair still looks good!</li>
            <li>but I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>this point your hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the 30 day spray in that my salon uses.</li>
            <li>But it added amazing body and softness to my hair, plus made it so silky that detangling after washing was a</li>
            <li>and THEN my hair felt amazing, like I</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really liked this product and it worked well.</li>
            <li>, my husband remarked on it smelling nice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried it with my own products and</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and looked good until I washed my hair</li>
            <li>and I have to leave the strong smelly stuff in my hair for three days before I can wash it!</li>
            <li>I am hoping it will be better after the summer frizz season passes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a personal choice, cancer risk and looking great vs looking good.  </li>
            <li>The bottles included in this for those three items are about 5-10 uses for someone with shoulder length or greater</li>
            <li>This works better than a relaxer, straightening comb, blow out, etc.</li>
            <li>I love this product,  for the price</li>
            <li>The more you do the Keratin treatments,</li>
            <li>I love the way this product manages my hair....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to love my curls however</li>
            <li>Smelled ok to me.</li>
            <li>Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results</li>

            <li>It seemed easy to I bought it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair reacts easily to any moisture in the air</li>
            <li>and it turned my beautiful blonde hair orange.</li>
            <li>(I forgot this step and it turned out fine</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I had hoped for and I am generally pleased with how much more managable my stubbornly curly hair is.</li>
            <li>have a new freedom and LOVE that I can manage myself in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>My face was huge and my eyes swollen shut.  </li>
            <li>hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try.</li>
            <li>hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair smooth</li>
            <li>Nice product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They really should&#x27;ve either made the bottle with a rubber gripping or just made this a cream you could easily apply with a brush instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done the 30-Day treatment another 2 times and each time my curls get looser, more touchable and really luscious!</li>
            <li>but I did not notice a stench in fact the smell was pleasent almost what one would expect clean to smell like</li>
            <li>After the second treatment, I loved the way my hair looked and felt and was SOLD on Keratin</li>
            <li>There are many others on the market that are better and have specific instructions.</li>
            <li>The first two days, my hair seemed smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Likely I will try some other products to see which works best.</li>
            <li>my hair is naturally curly, but it makes it straight, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It worked Good the first time and slightly loosened my curls.</li>
            <li>Instead it STRIPPED the color out of my long, beautiful black hair and gave me a faded brownish-orange huge.</li>
            <li>I recommend the perm for fine hair and sensitive scalp&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The 60 day last longer, it&#x27;s easier, smells better, I can wash it out sooner</li>
            <li>Since I refuse to torture my hair (and frankly if I had a hot iron why would I need this product)</li>
            <li>I have short hair and was able to get 3 uses out of it.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t be straight!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>definitely give it a try, and if you think its a bit pricey, you get more than one use out of the treatment</li>
            <li>READ THE DIRECTIONS and make sure your flat iron is really hot.</li>
            <li>I have been spraying a little on my hair after each wash and that is better but not like the silky smooth salon treatments.  </li>
            <li>This treatment requires a few too many steps for me and doesn&#x27;t straighten or smooth as well as the cheaper brands I can buy at Sally&#x27;s or Walmart.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to my first Keratin treatment by this brand</li>
            <li>A very long process to go through to not have your hair more straight/healthy afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I am enjoying my more relaxed and managable curls as well as the straight look when I blow dry.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this on her normally very frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly and very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>You wear it straight for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>this point your hair is straight but is poufy and feels sticky.</li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;6-</li>
            <li>I have tried it with the whole kit</li>
            <li>, I do like how my hair looks when I blow it straight.</li>
            <li>and I was able to wear my hair out those first few days with no problem...</li>
            <li>just make sure you leave it in for the 30 mins and that you flat iron all your hair and that your iron gets hot enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to style and it lays down better.  </li>
            <li>find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also darkened my high lites.</li>
            <li>it just smells stronger than the 60 day version, it is a clear spray instead of a creme that I can really work through my hair</li>
            <li>My hair smells like a wet dog, is stringy and far from smooth or straight</li>
            <li>(I have a lot of body in my hair so it can tend to look 80s big if I don&#x27;t use the right products)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strong, very frizzy and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It was easy to follow instructions but half way through spraying on the keratin the pump broke</li>
            <li>It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li>It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have used on her hair that she can actually go outside and get sweaty, play basketball, run around, ride bikes, etc.</li>
            <li>, you hair will be flat and may look like it&#x27;s been a few days since you washed it, but it will feel nice and soft and there&#x27;s no reason to cover your pillow with a towel while you sleep.</li>
            <li>First let me say state the obvious, that this treatment is NOT a hair dye, it adds protein, Keratin, to hair to make it soft.</li>
            <li>, however, it turned my beautiful, blonde, expensive highlights ORANGE.</li>
            <li>My best advice is to not buy this product, there is a reason it is way less expensive than a salon Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair really soft and reduced frizz.</li>
            <li>I paid $60 or this product that caused me much pain, frustration, loss of work, medical bills, etc.  </li>
            <li>I used to use perms until my hair was so damaged, I grew it out natural.</li>
            <li>It did NOT irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>So far I like the texture of my hair</li>
            <li>Oh, and now takes me only 20 minutes to do the straight look instead of 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get at least one more application out of the kit (my hair is a chin-length bob), so for $40</li>
            <li>I have used different brands in the past and I have gotten better quality results from cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>So... long story short not buying it again there are cheaper solutions with less steps and much more uses out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if I complete two treatments in short time-</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and am going to do it a third time this weekend,</li>
            <li>process took me a whole afternoon, but I did other things while my hair bonding and air-drying.</li>
            <li>Whereas the 30-Day treatment can be left in your hair for days and feels silky and fabulous; the 60-Day treatment feels thick like a cream and makes the hair sticky.</li>
            <li>You can over-flat iron your hair at too high a temp and loose your curls!</li>
            <li>OK, so I am a Mixed Chick with really tight curly hair with a few wiry grays.</li>
            <li>She likes to wear her hair straight and with all the other products and methods we&#x27;ve tried after she goes outside or plays basketball</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did mildly improve my hair when I used the shampoo and wash out conditioner, but the difference was very small.</li>

            <li> This product made my hair really soft and reduced frizz. The only downfall is that you can&#x27; wash your hair for 2 days and it smells kind of bad. Otherwise, I really liked this product and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I like it...it just smells stronger than the 60 day version, it is a clear spray instead of a creme that I can really work through my hair and I have to leave the strong smelly stuff in my hair for three days before I can wash it! The 60 day last longer, it&#x27;s easier, smells better, I can wash it out sooner and I just prefer it to this one.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this on her normally very frizzy hair.  The product requires a flat iron to activate it.  She doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; look, but after one washing, the hair is back to wavy and with much less frizz.  She does it about once every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Nice product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I initially used the various Japanese straightening products and then the Keratin salon treatments.  Due to the carcinogen warnings, I decided to try this.  It was easy to use and looked good until I washed my hair then it only helped a little with the frizz.  My hair is not curly, just frizzy. I have been spraying a little on my hair after each wash and that is better but not like the silky smooth salon treatments.  I am hoping it will be better after the summer frizz season passes.  If you are used to the carcinogenic salon treatments you will be a bit disappointed with this.  If you are not willing to be exposed to carcinogens this product does help with hair care. It&#x27;s a personal choice, cancer risk and looking great vs looking good.  I am planning to try the 60 day treatment but have had some difficulty with the web site and when I called in my order they lost it.  Likely I will try some other products to see which works best.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this! I have wavy/curly and very frizzy hair. Mine lasted about two months!</li>
            <li> Before choosing this product, I read all the instructions.  It seemed easy to I bought it. On the second pump, it broke and I had to transfer it to a different pump bottle. The first two days, my hair seemed smooth and silky.  On the morning of the day of washing, I woke up to find hives all over my entire body.  My face was huge and my eyes swollen shut.  I had to go to the emergency doctor.  I was on 3 different meds for one week.&lt;br /&gt;After this happened, I decided to do research.  I found that every single product out there on the market has specific instructions that say not to allow the product on the scalp.  Easier said than done. However, they all say this on the box.  Not Liquid Keratin.  No where on their product does it tell you that.&lt;br /&gt;After confirmation from my hairdresser, I realized that was the reason I reacted like that. I wrote to Liquid Keratin 3 times and THEY NEVER EVER BOTHERED TO RESPOND.  They simply do not care. I paid $60 or this product that caused me much pain, frustration, loss of work, medical bills, etc.  LIQUID KERATIN company just ignores all complaints.  Do not use this product.  There are many others on the market that are better and have specific instructions. ( I have not checked recently if they changed their instructions, but there were none at the time I purchased it.)&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this \\&quot;straightener\\&quot; only lasted 9 days.  Definitely not worth the pain, suffering and aggravation, not to mention cost. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I have used different brands in the past and I have gotten better quality results from cheaper brands. This treatment requires a few too many steps for me and doesn&#x27;t straighten or smooth as well as the cheaper brands I can buy at Sally&#x27;s or Walmart. Hair was still frizzy and not smooth. After washing the product out and conditioning hair was still rough and hard to untangle. Not too impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I have never heat treated my hair, had this product stated that you had to use a heat iron and blow dryer to use the treatment I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted a cent on it. Since I refuse to torture my hair (and frankly if I had a hot iron why would I need this product) I instead opted to use only the shampoo and wash out conditioner and the leave in conditioner. The bottles included in this for those three items are about 5-10 uses for someone with shoulder length or greater hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did mildly improve my hair when I used the shampoo and wash out conditioner, but the difference was very small. The leave in conditioner helped alot but within about 8 hours my hair was back to frizz central. So... long story short not buying it again there are cheaper solutions with less steps and much more uses out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will state that I have seen alot of mention of a stench but I did not notice a stench in fact the smell was pleasent almost what one would expect clean to smell like, my husband remarked on it smelling nice.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair like sandpaper!</li>
            <li> This product worked miracles on my daughters hair! This is the first product that I have used on her hair that she can actually go outside and get sweaty, play basketball, run around, ride bikes, etc. and her hair still looks good! This works better than a relaxer, straightening comb, blow out, etc. She likes to wear her hair straight and with all the other products and methods we&#x27;ve tried after she goes outside or plays basketball her hair looks rough again. With this product after she&#x27;s done being a sporty girl her hair still looks like she just left the salon! Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product,  for the price just wish it came in larger bottles.  I will order again though</li>
            <li> My hair came out in clumps after using the shampoo in this kit.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the 30 day spray in that my salon uses. Easy to use. I have short hair and was able to get 3 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> If you have tide curls and you only want your curls get loose, this is the product to use. It won&#x27;t be straight! but I am happy with the results. I am going to do my second treatment soon. Like it!</li>
            <li> AWFUL!! Where do I start? First let me say state the obvious, that this treatment is NOT a hair dye, it adds protein, Keratin, to hair to make it soft. AT LEAST IT IS SUPPOSE TO...Instead it STRIPPED the color out of my long, beautiful black hair and gave me a faded brownish-orange huge.OMG It is horrific looking!! It is going to cost me a couple of hundred dollars at the salon just to fix the damage. My best advice is to not buy this product, there is a reason it is way less expensive than a salon Keratin treatment. Spend the money and go to a salon for a Keratin treatment instead. After reading the other amazon reviews of it causing blond hair to turn orange and having this experience, this product should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> OK, so I am a Mixed Chick with really tight curly hair with a few wiry grays. It&#x27;s not strong, very frizzy and breaks easily. I used to use perms until my hair was so damaged, I grew it out natural. But combing out my hair after washing it was a nightmare! And my curls would shrink up from mid-back to above my shoulders - Not a great look. Fast forward to my first Keratin treatment by this brand, the 30-Day treatment. It worked Good the first time and slightly loosened my curls. But it added amazing body and softness to my hair, plus made it so silky that detangling after washing was a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the 30-Day treatment another 2 times and each time my curls get looser, more touchable and really luscious! But, the process is lengthy and I have to work up the energy to do it. So, this time I purchased the **60-Day** treatment hoping it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 60-Day treatment works just as well but the process is different. Also, the feel of the Keratin is different. Whereas the 30-Day treatment can be left in your hair for days and feels silky and fabulous; the 60-Day treatment feels thick like a cream and makes the hair sticky. After flat-ironing my hair, it looked like Klingon hair and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it. But the process calls for washing out the Keratin after flat-ironing it and THEN my hair felt amazing, like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 30-DAY AND 60-DAY TREATMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;30-Day process is&lt;br /&gt;1- Pre-wash to strip the oils and products out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;2- Apply Keratin and comb through. Keratin is a silky liquid you spray. It did NOT irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;3- Blow Dry (works just as well if you air-dry naturally)&lt;br /&gt;4- Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results&lt;br /&gt;At this point your hair looks and feels great. You wear it straight for 2-3 days. If it frizzes up, re-flat iron it. This is bonding the keratin to your hair. Then...&lt;br /&gt;5- Wash out keratin and condition hair. Style and wear as you like.&lt;br /&gt;The process (steps 1-4) takes about 2 hours. I find the 30-Day treatment lasts about 6-8 weeks. After the second treatment, I loved the way my hair looked and felt and was SOLD on Keratin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60-Day process is&lt;br /&gt;1- Pre-wash to strip the oils and products out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;2- Blow-dry to damp-dry. (I forgot this step and it turned out fine anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;3- Apply Keratin and comb through. Keratin is a sticky cream you pump, rub in your hands and spread on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;** This Keratin feels stronger and stung my face a little, but with no lasting harm.&lt;br /&gt;4- Blow Dry (works just as well if you air-dry naturally)&lt;br /&gt;5- Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results&lt;br /&gt;At this point your hair is straight but is poufy and feels sticky. But, you are going to wash it out after like 15 minutes anyway so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;6- Wash out keratin and condition hair. Style and wear as you like. I ended up re-flat-ironing my hair after it air-dried.&lt;br /&gt;The process took me a whole afternoon, but I did other things while my hair bonding and air-drying. I don&#x27;t know how long this treatment will last because I just did it. But, my curls are loose, silky, long and I can run my fingers through them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO REMEMBER&lt;br /&gt;- The more you do the Keratin treatments, the silkier and looser your curls will become.&lt;br /&gt;- You can over-flat iron your hair at too high a temp and loose your curls! I did this in some spots, so be careful not to use the flat-iron to \\&quot;bump\\&quot; your hair under at the ends or twist the flat-iron as you move down the hair. Lesson learned for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTH KERATIN TREATMENTS WILL WORK WITH OTHER SHAMPOOS AND CONDITIONERS. NO NEED TO BUY THE KIT!!&lt;br /&gt;Both Keratin treatments work with other pre-shampoos, after-shampoos and conditioners. I have tried it with the whole kit and I&#x27;ve tried it with my own products and both techniques work equally well. Here are the guidelines: The pre-shampoo is to strip all product build-up and oils from your hair. It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo. After the Keratin treatment, you DO NOT USE THIS TYPE OF SHAMPOO EVER AGAIN! You must use a shampoo that does not contain sulfates, i.e. sodium lauryl sulfate. This the the chemical that makes the shampoo suds up a lot. I use WEN conditioning cleanser and leave-in styling cream and it works equally well as the products in the Keratin Kit. If you use a shampoo with sulfates, it will strip the Keratin protein from your hair and undo the Keratin treatment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try. If the 60-Day treatment lasts A LOT longer, I&#x27;ll do it again even though the process takes longer and I don&#x27;t like the feel of the Keratin product. If it lasts about the same time as the 30-Day treatment, I prefer that product because it takes less time and I prefer the silky feel of the 30-Day Keratin product.rip all product build-up and oils from your hair.

            <li> The only thing I did not like was the smell. That is why I did not gave it 5 stars. I will recommend it because it works.</li>
            <li> Works well with ethnic hair! My hair is soft and hydrated. I recommend the perm for fine hair and sensitive scalp&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product manages my hair....my hair is naturally curly, but it makes it straight, healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I used this product today as instructed.So far I like the texture of my hair, however, it turned my beautiful, blonde, expensive highlights ORANGE. Any suggestions as how to get the orange out?</li>
            <li> I tried this product thinking it might help a little bit. My hair smells like a wet dog, is stringy and far from smooth or straight and it turned my beautiful blonde hair orange. I do not recommend. DO NOT buy this product. Maybe if you have darker hair, but it doesn&#x27;t smooth and it smells, horribly awful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work at all.  A very long process to go through to not have your hair more straight/healthy afterwards.  I&#x27;ve used several keratin treatments in the past and do have a high standard for what the results should be.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m only giving this product 2 stars, it&#x27;s not because it didn&#x27;t work or it did not deliver results. It did exactly what I had hoped for and I am generally pleased with how much more managable my stubbornly curly hair is. I&#x27;ve learned to love my curls however, I do like how my hair looks when I blow it straight. My hair reacts easily to any moisture in the air so I was looking for something that might help decrease that effect but I can&#x27;t say that this product fully delivered on that -- maybe there is nothing out there to totally eliminate frizz caused by humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I hated about using this product was the difficulty in applying the Keratin treatment itself. The bottle is&lt;br /&gt;a spray nozzle and it made it so hard to spray and take caution not to get this stuff in my eyes especially since everytime I sprayed my hair, the bottle would slip from my grip. Seriously..half way through the process I was going to give up and quit. They really should&#x27;ve either made the bottle with a rubber gripping or just made this a cream you could easily apply with a brush instead. Other than that, I am enjoying my more relaxed and managable curls as well as the straight look when I blow dry. Oh, and now takes me only 20 minutes to do the straight look instead of 2 hours. That in itself make me happy!</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian however have fought with my tight (!) curls all of my life. Teenaged years were horrible, the hint of humidity and moisture would make my hair grow like a Chia Pet. My curls were so tight, the would wrap around my pinky finger. PLUS the COST to attempt to look &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; without frizz was expensive. Frizz - tears- frizz- frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a new freedom and LOVE that I can manage myself in the privacy of my own home. Even if I complete two treatments in short time- it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> It was easy to follow instructions but half way through spraying on the keratin the pump broke and I had to apply it by hand myself.  It also darkened my high lites. Smelled ok to me. It did leave my hair smooth</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product. It was fairly simple to use. However, It did not make my hair as manageable, as I would have expected it to, based on the advertisement.</li>
            <li> Worked well aFter soaking the 30 day treatment the second time around.i re ordered it for a few moe treatments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I thought I would for people who have read all the other reviews on this product and may be hesitant to try it. I have naturally curly/frizzy hair. I followed the directions and my curl hasn&#x27;t changed but the frizz is practically gone, so if your looking for something to tame the frizz this should do the job. I was worried about the smell that people were talking about...It&#x27;s not that bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it&#x27;s not so bad that you can&#x27;t take it, its almost like an old lady perfume that you wouldn&#x27;t want to wear, but not at all a harsh chemical smell. I don&#x27;t know why people were saying their hair was so greasy for the 3 days you can&#x27;t wash it...again it&#x27;s not that bad, you hair will be flat and may look like it&#x27;s been a few days since you washed it, but it will feel nice and soft and there&#x27;s no reason to cover your pillow with a towel while you sleep. I have naturally oily hair and I was able to wear my hair out those first few days with no problem...definitely give it a try, and if you think its a bit pricey, you get more than one use out of the treatment, I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and am going to do it a third time this weekend, just make sure you leave it in for the 30 mins and that you flat iron all your hair and that your iron gets hot enough</li>
            <li> I just applied my third treatment (every 30 days since I bought the kit) and my hair looks shinier and healthier with each application.  It&#x27;s easier to style and it lays down better.  (I have a lot of body in my hair so it can tend to look 80s big if I don&#x27;t use the right products)  I&#x27;ll get at least one more application out of the kit (my hair is a chin-length bob), so for $40 it&#x27;s a steal compared to what they charge at the salon.  I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out after wearing it dramatically short for 6+ years and this product is the only thing that has kept me from running for the scissors.  READ THE DIRECTIONS and make sure your flat iron is really hot.</li>
            <li> No significant change in my hair-</li>
