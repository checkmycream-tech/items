            <li>Besides being the prettiest lady at the wedding, she was able to find the perfect color to accent her periwinkle dress.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Three colors were damaged But all in all it was a good buy.</li>

            <li>Nice product.  </li>

            <li>Received this product for a honest review</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sample item was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>it is super convenience and amazing!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this beautiful make-up kit ^^</li>
            <li>Also included is a mirror built into the top of the makeup case.</li>
            <li>and we both love</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful  deal for such a  set for the price.</li>
            <li>This would make a wonderful present for any girl or woman.</li>
            <li>Never seen so many colors on a makeup kit as this.</li>
            <li>There are many colors to choose from coral to fuchsia.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed every time I open the box</li>
            <li>she packed was this makeup kit and was able to easily get the job done.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ll be able to apply the makeup even without another mirror available.</li>
            <li>When you are finished you just close it up and it stays clean and safe until you need it again.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s fully expanded out, it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>But on a professional level it&#x27;s a good inexpensive give away......</li>
            <li>best part is how small and compact it is, it will disappear inside a suitcase.</li>
            <li>palette would be a nice gift for a young lady for her quincea&amp;ntilde;era or sweet</li>
            <li>When you need every color possible, including lots of bright bold shades, that can be seen by people in an audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also this entire pallet is shimmery, which isn&#x27;t very good if you want variety or professional (workplace) options.</li>
            <li>I suggest Amazon write a more accurate description of the product or as close to possible.</li>
            <li>and it is so much fun to experiment with colors that I wouldn&#x27;t try if they were full-size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the breakdown of the types included didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>My wife pieces the other kit more than this one simply because it&#x27;s more diverse.</li>
            <li>It is a nice little make-up gift...</li>
            <li>The whole set comes contained in a cube like kit that expands out so you can access each of the trays of makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but it was damaged when I got it.</li>
            <li>case is very compact.</li>
            <li>Its a great set, but it had one broken eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Other than that I do love all the choices of eye shadow I have now</li>
            <li>it is a nice small travel kit with a mirror.  </li>
            <li>New to the whole thing of make-up, I am a transgender in progress</li>
            <li>box opens and expands to reveal a mirror, three applicators, and 148 small pans of wet powders and glosses in a truly beautiful range of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also a large number of glosses, and some blushes and such.</li>
            <li>and you have your complete make up kit with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally she would have to take her big &amp;#34;Tackle Box&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As she started to pull out the first tray, others hidden beneath kept coming out.</li>

            <li> Three colors were damaged But all in all it was a good buy. Very unhappy with The packaging</li>
            <li> This is a great set for doing makeup with for school plays and school theater. When you need every color possible, including lots of bright bold shades, that can be seen by people in an audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want/need lots of eye color, this is your set. There&#x27;s a ton of shadows in every color of the rainbow included. Also a large number of glosses, and some blushes and such. The whole set comes contained in a cube like kit that expands out so you can access each of the trays of makeup. When it&#x27;s fully expanded out, it&#x27;s huge. Then folds back into itself and makes a compact storage kit. Also included is a mirror built into the top of the makeup case. So you&#x27;ll be able to apply the makeup even without another mirror available. Very nice set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> I like it but it was damaged when I got it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be all of the make up they advertised. i don&#x27;t see any blush or any cream eye liners and even if you combine colors it still doesn&#x27;t add up to the amount of product advertised. Also this entire pallet is shimmery, which isn&#x27;t very good if you want variety or professional (workplace) options. Very disappointed because the reviews were so good</li>
            <li> New to the whole thing of make-up, I am a transgender in progress and I thought it be best to learn how to apply make-up. The colors are beautiful and there are so many ^^. now i have only played with it a bit but I like what I&#x27;ve seen. Thanks for this beautiful make-up kit ^^</li>
            <li> This was horrible. Almost half of the makeup had fallen out of the compartments they were supposed to be in, and the box was covered in multi-colored powder from the makeup that had fallen out and broke apart. It did not come with all included pieces. Will not purchase anything like this again. Had to give 1 star just so I could comment, should be zero.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  A few of the colors were broken, peobably from shipping.  But still great.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It was a mother&#x27;s days gift I sent to my sister in law and we both love it is super convenience and amazing!</li>
            <li> Its all just eye shadow and lip gloss. There is no eyeliner or anything.. Other than that I do love all the choices of eye shadow I have now</li>
            <li> Mine is not the same in the picture and it was broke</li>
            <li> The box description is a little deceiving.  It says 148 colors But the breakdown of the types included didn&#x27;t seem right. All in all it is a nice small travel kit with a mirror.  My wife pieces the other kit more than this one simply because it&#x27;s more diverse. I received this item for a honest Review.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but it was damaged when I got it. 9 of the eyeshadows were ruined on both of them.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when I saw this elegant Makeup Kit Gift Set. It starts off being a square but opens into an array of beauty supplies that will amaze you.  You have  Eyeliners, Eye shadow , Lip Gloss, Brushes, well the list goes on. This is a wonderful  deal for such a  set for the price. Your choices are paramount and just looking at it you will feel the urge to experiment and see just how beautiful these products will help you to be.  When you are finished you just close it up and it stays clean and safe until you need it again. This would make a wonderful present for any girl or woman. It&#x27;s really a very nice product that you will use over and over again. I am happy to recommend it.  Received this product for a honest review</li>
            <li> Never seen so many colors on a makeup kit as this. My daughter and my wife are experimenting with different combinations. She has to do some make up from time to time on her ballet and jazz recitals. She learned how to do makeup on herself by using these inexpensive sets. It doesn&#x27;t matter if she makes a mistake, she just redo it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This case is very compact. Pull the wings and lift the mirror and you have your complete make up kit with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, it is a bit crumbly compared to more expensive well-known brand sets. It also doesn&#x27;t stay as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Its a great set, but it had one broken eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It is a nice little make-up gift...But the description is way off base...I suggest Amazon write a more accurate description of the product or as close to possible. Also no directions or detail information for each item...For a beginner MUA or one who plays in cosmetics...this is great in color choice...But on a professional level it&#x27;s a good inexpensive give away......</li>
            <li> This is a great travel makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I went to an out of town wedding and of course she needed to do put on her makeup. Normally she would have to take her big &amp;#34;Tackle Box&amp;#34; sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is like a “Clown Car” of makeup, you assume there are just a few colors inside.  As she started to pull out the first tray, others hidden beneath kept coming out. There are a total of five trays of eyeshadow and luminizers on each side. The middle section holds the mirror, lipstick, and brushes/applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she packed was this makeup kit and was able to easily get the job done. There are many colors to choose from coral to fuchsia. Besides being the prettiest lady at the wedding, she was able to find the perfect color to accent her periwinkle dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is how small and compact it is, it will disappear inside a suitcase.</li>
            <li> two of the purple eyeshadow popped out of its place and was all over the place. the makeup kit was so messy</li>
            <li> Sephora had a very similar palette a few years ago for their holiday blockbuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 x 5 x 4 in. box opens and expands to reveal a mirror, three applicators, and 148 small pans of wet powders and glosses in a truly beautiful range of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed every time I open the box and it is so much fun to experiment with colors that I wouldn&#x27;t try if they were full-size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette would be a nice gift for a young lady for her quincea&amp;ntilde;era or sweet sixteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DBROTH provided a palette for evaluation and review.</li>
