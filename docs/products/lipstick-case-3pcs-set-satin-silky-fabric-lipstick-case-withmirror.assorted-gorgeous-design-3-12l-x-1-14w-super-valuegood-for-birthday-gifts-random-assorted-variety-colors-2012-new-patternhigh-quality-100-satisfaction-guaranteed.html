            <li>Perfect fit for my lipstick</li>
            <li>Great case was able to give one as a gift and kept two for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>We were so glad to find them.  </li>
            <li>I like them better than the &amp;#34;gift with purchase&amp;#34; ones I used to get.</li>
            <li>Some used it for winter lip balm, most for lipstick.</li>
            <li>So cute I have cheap no brand lips sticks that I wanted to hide.</li>
            <li>Hope all can enjoy these too.  </li>
            <li>Great colors and they were made to last</li>
            <li>Each was unique in some way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it made her ordinary day into a happy one.</li>
            <li>Pretty &amp; cheap</li>
            <li>Price was great and had them in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Now I just store my lipstick inside one of these cases and when it&#x27;s time to touch up, I open the case, take out my lipstick and use the handy &amp; clean mirror that is attached right inside the case.</li>
            <li>For what they are - inexpensive, lipstick cases - they are colorful and well-constructed.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they are very well made and pretty too!</li>
            <li>This made it  hard to choose which to give to whom, but that was a great problem to have.</li>
            <li>These are pretty, but they have an odor.</li>
            <li>Everyone seemed to really like this gift.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to anyone trying to give to co-workers, as I did, or for stocking stuffers, etc.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;d have to clean the compact mirror off so that I could see myself.  </li>
            <li>I wanted more big sized &amp; only got 2 out of the 12 I bought.</li>
            <li>Nice cases but one case the mirror was broken inside.</li>
            <li>So typically I&#x27;d have to first find my lipstick and then find my compact, so that I could use the mirror on my compact.  </li>

            <li> Beautiful, gave the cases away as gifts.</li>
            <li> These are pretty, but they have an odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been someone who could put on lipstick without using a mirror.  So typically I&#x27;d have to first find my lipstick and then find my compact, so that I could use the mirror on my compact.  Finally I&#x27;d have to clean the compact mirror off so that I could see myself.  What a pain!  These cases make touch ups a breeze!  Now I just store my lipstick inside one of these cases and when it&#x27;s time to touch up, I open the case, take out my lipstick and use the handy &amp; clean mirror that is attached right inside the case. Plus, they are very well made and pretty too!</li>
            <li> So cute I have cheap no brand lips sticks that I wanted to hide. This is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these lipstick cases anywhere so of course I looked on Amazon and there they were.  The quality is very good and the price is fantastic the fabric is beautiful ..I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 sets of 12. Each was unique in some way. All were very nice looking. This made it  hard to choose which to give to whom, but that was a great problem to have. Everyone seemed to really like this gift. Some used it for winter lip balm, most for lipstick. I would really recommend this to anyone trying to give to co-workers, as I did, or for stocking stuffers, etc. I should have kept one for myself!</li>
