            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>versatile to wear on its own for mega bling or used for nail art.</li>
            <li>It does look best with a top coat, and it took two coats of top coats to be smooth but A+</li>
            <li>Love the sparkles over the nails.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect polish to use when you only have afew minutes.</li>
            <li>More coats and</li>
            <li>it looks even better.</li>
            <li>A polish with superb density of holo graphic glitter.  </li>
            <li>I love glitter, and this satisfies all my needs.</li>
            <li>The picture of it here, does nothing for it, it is so much prettier in person!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;China glaze normally makes great products but this is not one of them</li>
            <li>It is silvery icy sparkly and just downright awesome!!!!  </li>
            <li>One coat is almost enough for full coverage packed with silver and holo glitter that sparkles magnificently.</li>
            <li>I had to scoop it up quick!</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite, espicially because I love anything that sparkles.</li>
            <li>I even ordered a 2nd bottle for my nieces after they saw it and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>I finally found it (for a great price) on Amazon and new</li>
            <li>do reccomend putting a clear top coat over this glitter, as it keeps the &amp;#34;rainbow&amp;#34; of colors showing -</li>
            <li>I own over 200 different nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>So pretty, it sparkles, looks great alone or over other colors!</li>
            <li>One coat is just a little sparkle, good to go.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more in the future!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Pretty color, almost more grey than silver.</li>
            <li>This formula is a little on the thick side and dries fairly quickly, so smooth even application looks best.</li>
            <li>last long and received many compliments on how well they sparkled and the polish removed easily.</li>
            <li>Very glittery and wintery.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to take off, so I suggest straight acetone to take off polish.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a GLITTER that you can&#x27;t see your natural nail under!</li>
            <li>Much easier than store brand remover with only SOME acetone.</li>
            <li>Love this polish, has a very subtle sparkle, not too much.</li>
            <li>It is rough and a bit strange to apply, but the ending effect is quite pretty.</li>

            <li> Should definitely use over white/silver as it is not very opaque.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this China Glaze Glistening Snow for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only down side is taking it off.</li>
            <li> Keep some polish thinner on hand, as this polish can dry out a tad faster than other polishes when not used.</li>
            <li> If you like Fairy Dust by the same brand, and wish it could be a stand alone polish, then seriously consider getting this.</li>
            <li> when it dries as is, it looks a little too silver for my liking.</li>
            <li> they literally wasted no time shipping it to me.</li>
            <li> formula is little thick but can be thinned</li>
            <li> Looks really dull, like cement and thick.</li>
            <li> Do not add polish remover to polish in order to thin it.</li>
            <li> If you go into it knowing what to expect you will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s packed with amazing glitter. it really is beautiful and in the sun it glows like nothing.....almost like wearing diamonds on your nails formula is little thick but can be thinned</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted!!</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect polish to use when you only have afew minutes. One coat is just a little sparkle, good to go. More coats and it looks even better.</li>
            <li> Looks really dull, like cement and thick. I would not purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China glaze normally makes great products but this is not one of them</li>
            <li> Pretty color, almost more grey than silver. Should definitely use over white/silver as it is not very opaque. Formula is quite.. sandy. It is rough and a bit strange to apply, but the ending effect is quite pretty. If you go into it knowing what to expect you will not be disappointed. Very glittery and wintery.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, has a very subtle sparkle, not too much. This formula is a little on the thick side and dries fairly quickly, so smooth even application looks best.

            <li> GORGEOUS!!!!  Yep, I said it.  It is silvery icy sparkly and just downright awesome!!!!  It is beautiful to use for holiday manis but I like it during the winter months as well.  The best part is that it is also holographic so you get all the colors of the rainbow when the lights hit it.  If you don&#x27;t like sparkle then this is definitely not the polish for you!!!</li>
            <li> I am a 100% China glaze fan. I own over 200 different nail polish colors. I&#x27;ve never seen a GLITTER that you can&#x27;t see your natural nail under! It is my new favorite, espicially because I love anything that sparkles. Perfect for summer. It doesn&#x27;t look right on the toes though, brilliant on your hands!

            <li> This is the best silver glitter polish ever, look exactly like the bottle!!! Fast shipping! I recommend this polish it&#x27;s the best!</li>

            <li> This is Fairy Dust on steroids. Absolutely amazing. Heck yes. I love glitter, and this satisfies all my needs. hahaha It does look best with a top coat, and it took two coats of top coats to be smooth but A+</li>
