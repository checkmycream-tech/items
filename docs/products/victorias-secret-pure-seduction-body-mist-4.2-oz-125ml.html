    <ol>
            <li> Love this scent. I might just buy some more down the road from amazon. I bought it as a back up. i wish they had it in a travel size</li>
            <li> This reminds me of perfume that stays on for hours. It keeps me feeling refreshed and energized.  It is also a great gift.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it .... I will be buying more &amp; The price was great I just hope they have more later</li>
            <li> I love it! It came in great shape, nothing was missing out of it, and it smells so good to match my Victoria Secret&#x27;s Pure Seduction Body lotion!</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s cute. When I was younger it smelled better, but it&#x27;s not bad. Would recommend to spray after shower while wet. Air dry.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this for her she hasn&#x27;t stopped smelling herself. She loves it so much. Good good show.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for myself but even my 10 year old niece can wear it. Soft smell which stays for a nice period of time. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, It&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t complain. I was looking for something new, just because. To me it smells exactly like B&amp;BW&#x27;s Pink Sugarplum, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all. I&#x27;m happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of smell good stuff, and this takes the cake. It smells DIVINE. I actually found it was cheaper to order here than in the store, so get it while you can! It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My fault really...my favorite body spray and I was hoping to start buying it regular through amazon but I paid a lot for shipping even being a prime customer and with out me realizing because I didn&#x27;t know they came that small it ended up being a huge waist of money...</li>
            <li> I dont know what it is about this mist but it smells so good and everytime I put it on it lasts most of the day. Love it.</li>
            <li> smells better than I remembered. came as quickly as promised.</li>
