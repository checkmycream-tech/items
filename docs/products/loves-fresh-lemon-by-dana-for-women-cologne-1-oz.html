    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great gift for women of any age.</li>
            <li>I should have known from the reviews I read that said this wasn&#x27;t what we remembered, but I chose to believe the &#x27;good&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li>people would say i smelled like tea which i thought was nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching in drug and discount stores for years for this scent, and I was thrilled to find it here.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they would have let me know the \\&quot;perfume\\</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon again!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, light and clean.</li>
            <li>i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I would love to see spray cologne, powder,lotion,etc.</li>
            <li>I wish they had left the formula alone as it used to be wonderful.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let my mistake become yours, when ordering colognes, be sure to read how many ounces are in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It used to be her favorite.</li>
            <li>A gift, enjoyed by the recipient.</li>
            <li>Closest thing to the original Love&#x27;s that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what this is, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon\\&quot; cologne.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if it was still available, but the reviews indicate it&#x27;s changed a bit.</li>
            <li>just lots of cheap aldehydes.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve smelled Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon</li>
            <li>you want the original Chattem Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon they are sometimes for sale on ebay for about $40.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, I guess things are just best left in the old memory!  </li>
            <li>NOT THE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to wearing this wonderful fresh scent again, but once I put it on, I couldn&#x27;t scrub it off fast enough!</li>
            <li>There is nothing fresh or reminicent about it!</li>
            <li>you want real crisp lemon, try Avalon Organics lemon hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure they are aware of that fact, and continue to rip people off.</li>
            <li>This is not the original sold before.</li>
            <li>it made me feel so clean when i used it.  </li>
            <li>bought 3 bottles recently and am happy to say that they were fresh and</li>
            <li>Instead of the fresh, tingly fragrance of fresh lemons, it smelled more like rancid rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>The original Love&#x27;s fresh lemon and Love&#x27;s baby soft was produced by CHATTEM.  </li>
            <li>This fresh and appealing lemon-fresh scent was outrageously popular back in the day of bell-bottoms, tie-die tops and fringed bags.</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 3 because it did arrive well packed and in good condition.</li>
            <li>really miss the Love products~~</li>
            <li>many years ago i got the love&#x27;s fresh lemon mist in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles, hoping for that lovely, fresh lemon scent from high school.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway if you buy this, fine but its not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thats why these don&#x27;t seem the same as the original Love&#x27;s.   </li>
            <li>I loved this product back in the 1970&#x27;s and was surprised it was still around.</li>
            <li>At first when I found that Amazon carried Love&#x27;s Lemon Cologne I was thrilled to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it changed so very much</li>
            <li>I guess my first clue was that it didn&#x27;t come in a box, it wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way, and the bottle was worn out.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a bottle of Love&#x27;s Lemon.</li>
            <li>Looking at the picture when ordering, it appeared like a regular sized bottle of Love&#x27;s colognes.  </li>
            <li>Somehow I doubt that Love&#x27;s is still manufacturing this scent new anymore, which makes me wonder if FragranceNet just has some stockpile inventory of old perfume sitting there.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that it was the same as the fun scent that I wore in Jr. High School many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was a fan of the seventies version of Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon--and the new stuff just ain&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li>This was a real disapointment because I have been searching for a fragrance that has a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; lemon smell.    </li>
            <li>you only seem to see the Love Baby Soft in stores~~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would be nice if pictures were done in such a way as to show the actual size.   </li>
            <li>It is such a fresh fragrance!</li>
            <li>Smelled like someone used old Love&#x27;s baby soft mixed in lemon pledge and lots of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>i had not been able to get this product for several years and decided to look it up on the net.  </li>
            <li>I sure don&#x27;t know what they recieved to have given such glowing reviews, but, this product is in a &#x27;tiny&#x27; plastic bottle &amp; the contents smell as &#x27;old as the hills&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an instant lift to the spirits guaranteed to make you feel fresh and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its possible for a fragrance to be FUN</li>
            <li>Just like the old days!</li>
            <li>(but of course, who actually remembers the exact LfL scent).  </li>
            <li>Great Disappointment.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t wash it off my arms fast enough.  </li>
            <li>It really takes you back to summer in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>am relieved that this lemony essence from the early 1970&#x27;s is still around somewhere to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go that far</li>
            <li>The product I tried that reminded me of the Loves Fresh Lemon is actually Bath and Body Works&#x27; White Citrus body lotion.</li>
            <li>Not even close to the fragrance I knew and loved from the early 70s.&lt;br /&gt;Not even a vague smell of citrus.....</li>
            <li>I had high hopes because I have been searching for a lemon fragrance that was like one I used to wear way back in the day.  </li>
            <li>Many things change but at least the cologne is still the same.</li>
            <li>The only reason I marked this review with one star is because the page would not advance without it--in reality I give it zero stars!</li>
            <li>For some reason, you can only find Baby Soft in the stores.</li>
            <li>I found this site because I tried a product that took me back in time to the early 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Small bottle - still searching for a fresh summer perfume (like lemon &amp; oranges) and remembered this from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>But even then I would be skeptical to spend that money since the original was stopped production in the early 80s, so those are 20+ yrs old...</li>

            <li> --I&#x27;ll grudgingly admit that it is pleasant--but the magic of the original formula is alas not there.  </li>
            <li> The expiration dates are clear as can be on the bottom of the little plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon since the 70&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m afraid this stuff must have been sitting in a dusty warehouse since then.  </li>
            <li> it has been so long.</li>
            <li> If you are longing for this fragrance, long no more~~&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; was long expired.</li>
            <li> The only lemon here was the product itself; which I had to flush down the toilet, then rapidly exit the room to escape the odor.</li>
            <li> Now its like maybe a drift of lemon and the scent dissipates almost as soon as skin is dry from application.</li>
            <li> It smelled so strong until I am afraid to put it on my skin (a rash may form) or spray it on my clothes (may cause discoloration).    </li>
            <li> It smells like alcohol and not much like lemon.  </li>
            <li> This came in liquid form in a tiny little plastic bottle, but it still smells like lemons!</li>
            <li> I hope at least I can always come back here to stay supplied.</li>
            <li> It smells like sour lemonaide.</li>
            <li> What a let down.  </li>
            <li> Too bad that they are not using the original formula.</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing about half of the perfume out when I just couldn&#x27;t stand to wear it</li>
            <li> The amount of time it took them to charge my account and send it to me was quite a bit less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews, but this was such a waste of money, not to mention a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what compelled me to buy this stuff; probably that I adore lemon as a lotion/perfume scent and so wanted to check it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to check out their cologne, now, too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a regular size bottle and was disappointed that it turned out to be only a one-ounce size.  </li>
            <li> smelled spoiled to say the least.  </li>
            <li> The bottle I purchased was very small.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t awful, but it smelled noticeably old, slightly moldy.</li>
            <li> :(  I was so looking forward to this product, bringing back memories</li>
            <li> What a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I sent an email stating my disappointment and they emailed me a paid return shipping label, and I returned the product to them, however it has not been credited to my account.</li>
            <li> When I gave it to her, imagine my embarrassment when it smelled like stale alcohol!</li>
            <li> It smells like very stale alcohol with no lemon smell at all.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I just got a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I was sooooo disappointed when I received this cologne.  </li>
            <li> It was absolutely horrible...</li>
            <li> It smells awful!</li>
            <li> Even my kids think it smells horrible.  </li>

            <li> What a huge disappointment!  I was thrilled to find this and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.  I had hoped that it was the same as the fun scent that I wore in Jr. High School many years ago.  Not only was it not, I couldn&#x27;t wash it off my arms fast enough.  It was absolutely horrible...smelled spoiled to say the least.  Perhaps I just got a bad bottle.  I guess my first clue was that it didn&#x27;t come in a box, it wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way, and the bottle was worn out.  Oh well, I guess things are just best left in the old memory!  Save your money and do not buy this pseudo product.</li>
            <li> NOT THE ORIGINAL. Great Disappointment. Smelled like someone used old Love&#x27;s baby soft mixed in lemon pledge and lots of rubbing alcohol. Arrived in tiny tacky plastic bottles as well. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s  Citrus Verbena Summer Fragrance (the very yellow looking one). It&#x27;s seasonal, so get it when you can.   Closest thing to the original Love&#x27;s that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> Just like the old days!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  I think it was left from the 70&#x27;s. it didn&#x27;t have a lemon scent at all.  It stunk.  Smelled rancid.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon\\&quot; cologne. It smells awful! It smells like very stale alcohol with no lemon smell at all. I was looking forward to wearing this wonderful fresh scent again, but once I put it on, I couldn&#x27;t scrub it off fast enough! It came in what looks like a sample size bottle with no bag or box around it. It was just tossed into the mailing box. I&#x27;ll be sending it back or into the trash. What a rip-off.</li>
            <li> many years ago i got the love&#x27;s fresh lemon mist in a larger bottle. it made me feel so clean when i used it.  people would say i smelled like tea which i thought was nice. i had not been able to get this product for several years and decided to look it up on the net.  i am glad i did.</li>

I should have known from the reviews I read that said this wasn&#x27;t what we remembered, but I chose to believe the &#x27;good&#x27; reviews. I sure don&#x27;t know what they recieved to have given such glowing reviews, but, this product is in a &#x27;tiny&#x27; plastic bottle &amp; the contents smell as &#x27;old as the hills&#x27;. Yuck! There is nothing fresh or reminicent about it! I truly feel &#x27;ripped off&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes because I have been searching for a lemon fragrance that was like one I used to wear way back in the day.  This is not it!  It smells like alcohol and not much like lemon.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I had to smell this again it has been so long. Great fragrance, light and clean. I used to always smell like a lemon now I do about 40 years later.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles, hoping for that lovely, fresh lemon scent from high school. The two bottles I received expired in the fall of 1996! They were rancid. I just threw them out without emptying them in my sink. Didn&#x27;t want that smell hanging around. What a rip off. The expiration dates are clear as can be on the bottom of the little plastic bottles. I won&#x27;t order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon again! I have been looking for years to try and find it. It is such a fresh fragrance! This was the only fragrance I wore in my \\&quot;younger days\\&quot;. I just love it. For some reason, you can only find Baby Soft in the stores. I wish they would market Lemon again. I would love to see spray cologne, powder,lotion,etc. I hope at least I can always come back here to stay supplied. I have also told my family if they are looking to buy me a gift.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne as soon as I saw it was still around. It really takes you back to summer in the 70&#x27;s. Many things change but at least the cologne is still the same.</li>
            <li> Small bottle - still searching for a fresh summer perfume (like lemon &amp; oranges) and remembered this from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I loved this product back in the 1970&#x27;s and was surprised it was still around. It still smells the same but only lasts about 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> This fresh and appealing lemon-fresh scent was outrageously popular back in the day of bell-bottoms, tie-die tops and fringed bags. It&#x27;s an instant lift to the spirits guaranteed to make you feel fresh and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If its possible for a fragrance to be FUN, this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching in drug and discount stores for years for this scent, and I was thrilled to find it here. It&#x27;s a great gift for women of any age. It&#x27;s time to stock-up!</li>
            <li> They must have changed the formula since I last used it as a teen/twenty&#x27;s. I remember this as smelling like being in a heady lemon dream that would last for hours.Now its like maybe a drift of lemon and the scent dissipates almost as soon as skin is dry from application. I only gave it a 3 because it did arrive well packed and in good condition. It&#x27;s not anything like it used to be though, even in the bottle there is almost no smell. I wanted LEMON and I got almost citrus and a lot of carrier alcohol and water. I wish they had left the formula alone as it used to be wonderful.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a bottle of Love&#x27;s Lemon. It smelled so strong until I am afraid to put it on my skin (a rash may form) or spray it on my clothes (may cause discoloration).    It smells like sour lemonaide. This was a real disapointment because I have been searching for a fragrance that has a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; lemon smell.    Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to receive the spray bottle that I used as a much younger woman.  This came in liquid form in a tiny little plastic bottle, but it still smells like lemons!</li>
            <li> The original Love&#x27;s fresh lemon and Love&#x27;s baby soft was produced by CHATTEM.  This company MEM bought the name only, and I don&#x27;t think the chemical makeup is the same (but of course, who actually remembers the exact LfL scent).  Thats why these don&#x27;t seem the same as the original Love&#x27;s.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want the original Chattem Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon they are sometimes for sale on ebay for about $40.  But even then I would be skeptical to spend that money since the original was stopped production in the early 80s, so those are 20+ yrs old... can&#x27;t be the same? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway if you buy this, fine but its not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what compelled me to buy this stuff; probably that I adore lemon as a lotion/perfume scent and so wanted to check it out. But I wasn&#x27;t a fan. It wasn&#x27;t awful, but it smelled noticeably old, slightly moldy. Somehow I doubt that Love&#x27;s is still manufacturing this scent new anymore, which makes me wonder if FragranceNet just has some stockpile inventory of old perfume sitting there. I ended up throwing about half of the perfume out when I just couldn&#x27;t stand to wear it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want real crisp lemon, try Avalon Organics lemon hand and body lotion.</li>
            <li> If you are longing for this fragrance, long no more~~&lt;br /&gt;I am relieved that this lemony essence from the early 1970&#x27;s is still around somewhere to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 bottles recently and am happy to say that they were fresh and fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I really miss the Love products~~ you only seem to see the Love Baby Soft in stores~~&lt;br /&gt;I plan to write to the company who presently owns this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;they are, if you wish to contact them....&lt;br /&gt;New Dana Perfume Corporation&lt;BR&gt;6601 Lyons Road  Ste B4&lt;BR&gt;Coconut Creek Florida 33073-3605</li>
            <li> I found this site because I tried a product that took me back in time to the early 1970&#x27;s. I wanted to see if it was still available, but the reviews indicate it&#x27;s changed a bit. The product I tried that reminded me of the Loves Fresh Lemon is actually Bath and Body Works&#x27; White Citrus body lotion. I&#x27;m anxious to check out their cologne, now, too.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo disappointed when I received this cologne.  I hadn&#x27;t seen Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon since the 70&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m afraid this stuff must have been sitting in a dusty warehouse since then.  Instead of the fresh, tingly fragrance of fresh lemons, it smelled more like rancid rubbing alcohol.  What a let down.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not even close to the fragrance I knew and loved from the early 70s.&lt;br /&gt;Not even a vague smell of citrus.....just lots of cheap aldehydes.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of the seventies version of Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon--and the new stuff just ain&#x27;t the same.  A friend remarked that it smelled like lemon furniture polish.  I wouldn&#x27;t go that far--I&#x27;ll grudgingly admit that it is pleasant--but the magic of the original formula is alas not there.  And the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last--rub on a generous amount, and an hour later it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> The bottle I purchased was very small.  I was expecting a regular size bottle and was disappointed that it turned out to be only a one-ounce size.  It is my fault for not reading the size; I was in a hurry and only looked at the picture.  It would be nice if pictures were done in such a way as to show the actual size.   For example, they could have had a hand holding the bottle between the thumb and forefinger.  Looking at the picture when ordering, it appeared like a regular sized bottle of Love&#x27;s colognes.  Don&#x27;t let my mistake become yours, when ordering colognes, be sure to read how many ounces are in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so spoiled that it smells like a drugstores no-name $4.00 a quart mens &#x27;cologne&#x27;. The only lemon here was the product itself; which I had to flush down the toilet, then rapidly exit the room to escape the odor. It would have been nice if they would have let me know the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; was long expired. I&#x27;m quite sure they are aware of that fact, and continue to rip people off. I will never spend another dime with this company again.  The only reason I marked this review with one star is because the page would not advance without it--in reality I give it zero stars!</li>
            <li> At first when I found that Amazon carried Love&#x27;s Lemon Cologne I was thrilled to say the least.  Upon receiving the product after opening the cologne, I discovered that the fragrance was nothing like it used to be which I wore often.  I don&#x27;t know why it changed so very much but I will probably not ever wear it.      LaLoie in California</li>
            <li> Did not smell anything like what I use to buy. Didn&#x27;t even smell like lemons.:(  I was so looking forward to this product, bringing back memories</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mom for her birthday. It used to be her favorite. When I gave it to her, imagine my embarrassment when it smelled like stale alcohol! I&#x27;ll never buy perfume from this company again!!!! I sent an email stating my disappointment and they emailed me a paid return shipping label, and I returned the product to them, however it has not been credited to my account. It has been over two weeks that I have sent it to them. The amount of time it took them to charge my account and send it to me was quite a bit less than two weeks. I&#x27;m hoping I will get my money back but at this point who knows!</li>
            <li> This smells like disinfectant, not perfume. Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is not the original sold before. Too bad that they are not using the original formula.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t even smell like lemons.  It didn&#x27;t come with a box and there are no ingredients listed on the bottle.  I know it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve smelled Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon and my tastes may have changed but a lemon smells like a lemon and this doesn&#x27;t even come close.  My coworkers thought it smelled like a floor cleaner and it does!  Even my kids think it smells horrible.  Perhaps I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> A gift, enjoyed by the recipient.</li>
