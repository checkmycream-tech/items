            <li>in all, she is happy with it</li>

            <li>She also owns a Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer, Opal / Aqua by Philips.  </li>
            <li>I would like to say that Amazon was great and let me return this product after all.</li>
            <li>In between them, this product is great for maintenance--</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>great for those dillicate area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;small bag is great for travel</li>
            <li>but this one without a guard works great for a close shave and trim.</li>
            <li>This was a great improvement over the others that I have used.</li>
            <li>and it is great quality and has lasted years.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Keeps her well groomed and looking great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>My wife is happy with this one.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so cute!!</li>
            <li>Cute!!</li>
            <li>Love this puppy!!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SELLER, VERY GOOD MACHINE AND VERY USEFUL, MARK</li>
            <li>It trims neatly and closely, and can be very precise, so perfect if you like to shape the down-there area.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer ever, just wish the unit was a bit better in quality.</li>
            <li>this is not as good as the first one i bought !!!!!</li>
            <li>WORKS great, love the templates,  lol.</li>
            <li>all it is good for is for hurting people.</li>
            <li>You can do a good job with it as it is, and using the guides for the hair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get this item if you are looking for a good trimmer</li>
            <li>It is a good product regarding how well it works</li>
            <li>I used the eyebrow shaper on my partner and it did a good job shaping them for a guy.  </li>
            <li>met all my expectations, very powerful and works perfectly for bikini and even face.</li>
            <li>But I quickly realized that it was for making, ummmm...shaping your bushes into a wonderful topiary shape of your choice.  </li>
            <li>so I welcome any comments anyone might be able to offer as to my suggestions here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>, glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked great to create a uniform length for my bikini area, I did not want to go completely smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of flimsy but for the price</li>
            <li>Shape and features are nice.</li>
            <li>It gets a nice close shave,</li>
            <li>I really liked this trimmer.</li>
            <li>absolute best bikini styler i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The carry pouch is nice for storage.  </li>
            <li>The trimming combs were also nicely designed and did not scratch.</li>
            <li>The Silk Epil Bikini Styler  is really nice to have on hand.</li>
            <li>what it should, nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>It did a nice job of cleaning things up</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>So it worked nicely...</li>
            <li>LMAO.</li>
            <li>I tried my own batteries, everything- faulty product.</li>
            <li>This method is far from flawless but did work to allow a section of hair to remain while the rest was removed.</li>
            <li>Hair returns in about 3-4 weeks but very fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you want a great shave and are willing to deal with a cranky shaver for it.</li>
            <li>I bought another one just because it works great and is not expensive.</li>
            <li>It has a great safety head that, according to my wife, makes it comfortable and, most importantly, produces no anxiety.</li>
            <li>Which brings us to Amazing Warehouse Deals they were very quick to take care of the issue with 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>It requires one AAA battery to operate, which makes it more compact since there is no cord.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I requested this item for my lovely bride to use since, well, she&#x27;s a woman</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better than the Cleancut, though, which shattered when I dropped it in the sink, an 18&amp;#34; distance.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Does an okay job.</li>
            <li>However, this means that eventually you will run out of stickers and need to get more.  </li>
            <li>wife has been using it mostly to remove her eyebrows</li>
            <li>I like this much better then a number that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Arrived a day later than intended but, the product itself is the best one a have used.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find it at walmart any more, I tried others.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find I can still purchase this product even if I have to do it online.</li>
            <li>My wife found the Braun would pull hairs more than cut them.  </li>
            <li>Yes the Philips model costs more, but you get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been more than 30 days, so that is what I rated it 1 star.</li>
            <li>pulls rather than shaves, not what I am used to from the Silk Epil-Line (I love the Silk Epil 7)</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have as many assesories as this one does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think this works more as a trimmer than a razor</li>
            <li>helps me to shape them better than with just waxing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was notorious for not charging them in advance and that not being able to trim because I had forgotten to charge.</li>
            <li>It was a cute idea, but I wasn&#x27;t heartbroken that I wasn&#x27;t able to shave a flower downtown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So precise!</li>
            <li>The only razor that works is the Phillips bikini perfect!</li>
            <li>Crappy design, those blades should be better protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Top piece doesn&#x27;t seem to stay.</li>
            <li>I felt that this product was working well until the plastic cracked at the top where you connect the adapters.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this is an ok styler.  </li>
            <li>I regularly wax, but this is perfect for maintenance in between waxing appointments and it comes with perfect different heads to be used on the eyebrows and bikini line!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The length combs are easy to snap on and off and the trimmer heads are very easy to change out.  </li>
            <li>This is a very unique product for women who want to get a bit creative in the bedroom.  </li>
            <li>beautiful sunny summer, a new bathing suit, and a sailboat...</li>
            <li>feels really cheaply made, it would break if dropped onto the floor very easily.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the stickers, but other wise a great product.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the stickers, but other wise a great product.</li>
            <li>This item is safe, easy to hold and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also used this product /the precision head to cut/shape-up unwanted hair near the nape of my head/neck, worked great.</li>
            <li>Light trimming is ok, but any close shaving don&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li>But as this is intended to be a styling tool for more precise grooming</li>
            <li>Good shaver for those intimate areas, but</li>
            <li>and you can show your true team spirit by rocking a lightening bolt!  </li>
            <li>In any case, having a Brazilian is never an easy thing to do.  </li>
            <li>The guides made it easy.  </li>
            <li>dropped mine once, on a carpeted surface and it still worked, but it didn&#x27;t shave cleanly any more.</li>
            <li>It is compact and operates on AA batteries, so it is easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li>Manoeuvres easily over tricky areas.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to change the heads.</li>
            <li>Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li>It is perfect for trimming longer hair on the body down to a shorter length BEFORE using an epilator (to pluck/pull the hairs out).  </li>
            <li>I purchased this exact razor several years ago and it was the best razor I ever used.</li>
            <li>Its size makes it perfect for travel and it&#x27;s less noisy than one would expect.</li>
            <li>Is very cheap though, so, maybe is fair enough.</li>
            <li>Perfect little trimmer for eyebrows</li>
            <li>It also comes with guides that fit over the head so that you can cut to an even, predefined length.  </li>
            <li>Tends to stop working sometimes and doesn&#x27;t give as smooth a shave as it used to before.</li>
            <li>This is a relatively cheaply made battery operated \\&quot;electric razor\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The shave it gives is amazing, very close shave with no cuts or razor burn, and you can use it everywhere.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap, but, keep in mind that it was in fact cheap IMO.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made .</li>
            <li>It works great, it seems lightweight but sturdy enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for upper lip and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, for sure.  </li>
            <li>Face looks cleaner and hair free.</li>
            <li>The regular trimmer head with a guard works great.</li>
            <li>and I plan on  having one  always available.  </li>
            <li>Do not expect for it to remove all the hair for a smooth finish though.</li>
            <li>in all if you want to be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li>Does not feel flimsy or cheap either.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and doenst shave close.</li>
            <li>When I saw this tool I taught what a great idea fo a smaller version....</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and comes with a storage bag.</li>
            <li>It comes with a cloth pouch and extra trimming heads, so it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It is small and handy which she liked the most as this is being used as a replacement of a pair of tweezers she has always used, so even though it is a more \\&quot;complex\\&quot; device, it is convenient and easy to carry in her handbag.</li>
            <li>Very effective Epil  Styler for female mustache and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very powerful either.</li>
            <li>The battery is provided so set up and use is very quick and easy right out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good for trimming since the shaver head is smaller and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>Will still try others for comparisons but I&#x27;m not disappointed in this purchase either.  </li>
            <li>The stensles are fun!</li>
            <li>Making you buy a lot of AAA batteries which also makes it not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>I was kinda excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>However, this Braun BZ Trimmer is light duty and is more suitable for occasional light trimming and touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>The latter comes from an attachment that looks kind of like those in beard trimmer--a plastic comb-like guide clips onto the top so that hair longer than the guide is trimmed, while shorter ones remain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got three lengths to choose from, a nice carrying bag and stickers (more on that later).</li>
            <li>but it does not offer a super smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I think you could better use the shape stickers for a tanning bed to get a nice design on your hip or some such thing.    </li>
            <li>The shaver is safe to use even in the most sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;do not expect a clean no stubble shave with it</li>
            <li>There is no way to clean it out.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend, great gift for a young women too.  </li>
            <li>Great razor - it&#x27;s my second one as the first one</li>
            <li>As far as accessories go, this came fully equipped with a handy drawstring pouch, battery, cleaning brush, and</li>
            <li>As cute as the styling was (very slim and sleek)</li>
            <li>Very please and satisfied</li>
            <li>but it was inexpensive if I added it to the full sized Braun epilator.  </li>
            <li>Nice, easy to use and comes with various blades and guards to meet anyone&#x27;s grooming preferences.  </li>
            <li>It is really handy and it is easy to switch between the different combs.</li>
            <li>It would be great if Braun introduced a high-quality version of this product on par with their other shavers.</li>
            <li>The shaver worked fine when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>I think I would use this particular head to shape my brows before waxing them, to give me a better idea of where to apply the wax.  </li>
            <li>I got almost 3 months use out of it, though I knew last time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t going to work more than once or twice more.</li>
            <li>Received it fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>would say this trimmer performs adequately on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to hold, very light weight and does trim the personal hair reasonably well without discomfort.</li>
            <li>Anway, I wanted something a bit more gentle for the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The batteries are easy to install, the unit easy to use and maneuver, and it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the head is not very wide, making it easier to use.  </li>
            <li>fun ladyscaping with this super product.</li>
            <li>I have only used the smallest trimmer and it is pretty good for getting a shorter length</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and would be easy to tote around, but don&#x27;t expect a super high quality.</li>
            <li>Really great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>I really want to give this 5 stars because I love it so much that it&#x27;s worth dealing with it&#x27;s issues, but I&#x27;m not sure if others would feel the same, and It would be lovely to have it work perfectly.</li>
            <li>think this is a great little portable trimmer to carry around for when you need touch ups here and there.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer worked great for my eyebrows and bikini line...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a cheap sub for those times when you just cannot get a wax but really need a trim.</li>
            <li>If I had been in a position to laugh, I would have.</li>
            <li>this shaver/trimmer does nothing to help me change my mind to use the cheaper shaving/trimming self method of getting rid of the hair vs. waxing which costs more but leaves me smooth and without stubble - and what does grow back is not itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A tiny case for the shaver is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>This is just an OK styler, and I was surprised with its being a Braun.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I got my money&#x27;s worth for this before it stopped working, but I don&#x27;t feel cheated, either.</li>
            <li>I knew when I bought it that I was also paying for the guards and the styling head that I would rarely, if ever, use.    </li>
            <li>This product was worth the purchase</li>
            <li>&#x27;near buzz&#x27; length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after a bout of bumps and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any interest in the precision trimmer or the stencils, but as far as hair management goes, this is my favorite female-oriented trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The regular head worked very well for me but with the guards on the results weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;d be useful if I was in a hurry to do touch-ups before heading out in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li>It was fun while it lasted</li>
            <li>I bought this one and it is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m becoming an old fart, but I&#x27;m just not into the super cutesy \\&quot;template\\&quot; thing</li>
            <li>It works great on TRIMMING (not shaving) small areas quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I have had better luck with other brands of trimmers/shavers :)</li>
            <li>first off THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it goes through batteries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, it includes stickers to make such designs as hearts, stars, and more, and has two options for the trimmer itself: shave it clean, or leave about 3/4 inch length.</li>
            <li>my only thing against it is that you need to epilate the area more than twice to get it clean.</li>
            <li>Super quick, doesn&#x27;t catch your skin, trims hairs very close to skin.</li>
            <li>high precision head for fine areas</li>
            <li>This probably works better with straight hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter--the effect is still pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>this bikini styler turned out to be the right answer.  </li>
            <li>2 of them I had to throw away because they broke right after I started using them, and the company didn&#x27;t refund me.</li>
            <li>Worked great the first time, and then when I went to use it again it seemed like the battery was dead.  </li>
            <li>Great little gadget that every woman would have!</li>
            <li>I bought this last summer and it finally gave up on me, but instead of replacing it I found one I liked better for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>This gives a close shave and is pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li>I thought the small size would be great for this, but not with the ripping out.</li>
            <li>it comes with a cute little pouch to store everything in, and some creative sticker guides.</li>
            <li>This is more of a \\&quot;rough cut\\&quot; product and not designed for smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li>It is very gently on your skin</li>
            <li>Easy to use very useful although it is a little bit to light.</li>
            <li>it is good shaving little machine</li>
            <li>Good little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I guess the question is where has the ladle been and how many different trips does it make from one body part to another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works pretty well as an electric shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be an epilator at first since I associate the silk epil line with epilators, but it is not.</li>
            <li>Haha, thank goodness he doesn&#x27;t read these reviews!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had three of these now (one wore out after a year or more of constant use,</li>
            <li>I must say that our Panasonic trimmers similar to this are much better.</li>
            <li>I changed out the main head for the styling head and that still works fine, but there was a lot of snagging with the main head.</li>
            <li>The device is small and nice looking and even though it is not sturdy, it feels well made and light.</li>
            <li>we found that to be quite funny but who knows?</li>
            <li>It will get the basic removal of most of the hair but leaves a stubble that you will need to remove with a razor anyway.  </li>
            <li>It came with decals to make fun shapes, however they weren&#x27;t really practical to use.  </li>
            <li>Ok, without getting too personal . . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a buzzer to cut the hair on top of your head, but much smaller to use on your body.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was my first</li>
            <li>I LOVE the facial trimmer, but this WOULD NOT WORK</li>
            <li>More than I could give myself with a standard razor!  </li>
            <li>Cut up my wife&#x27;s skin on the first use.</li>
            <li>Noooooo, don&#x27;t get this haha!</li>
            <li>Batteries really don&#x27;t last more the 2 to 3 sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have another brand 5 in 1 wet dry trimmer that is awesome and does such a great job, leaving you silky smooth with hardly a snag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We can&#x27;t confirm on the bikini areas since she uses other kind of products for those areas, but for those interested, the box includes some templates with designs you can use with the device...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Being a healthcare professional, I understand the importance of keeping the nether regions neatly trimmed, clean, and sanitary.  </li>
            <li>a club cyclist/swimmer/runner, I sometimes \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; this shaver for trimming the nether regions; helps keep that area clean/sanitary/prevents saddle sores when riding on a bicycle saddle for more than 4 hours during long club rides or centuries.  </li>
            <li>The Philips does a much better better job cutting and you have more options on the length you want to trim your hair.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to pretty much have an unshaven \\&quot;area\\&quot; to use them.  </li>
            <li>It is excellent quality and has a long lasting battery (it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve had to charge</li>
            <li>so I am here to say I am not  sure how the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>:) Not really much to say, its pretty self explanatory.  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy little trimmer that comes with a carrying case, decals for styling the bikini area, length combs, a brush and an additional precision trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It does trim very wellm and there is no pulling , tearing, or scraping the skin as in som emodels.  </li>
            <li>and it does that job very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real keeper.</li>
            <li>The guards do not work well - for real trimming.</li>
            <li>Serviceable at best - like those ugly old comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room either.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than I expected</li>
            <li>I wish it had a shorter guard, but it cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t handle the real needs of women.</li>
            <li>This product worked better then expected.</li>
            <li>But, when they&#x27;re working, they work very well.</li>
            <li>I have used all sorts of bikini shavers, and this one is really nifty.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this razor feels very flimsy.</li>
            <li>The head on mine wobbles too much and doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy (maybe mine is defective).</li>
            <li>It feels too much like a toy rather than a real shaver.</li>
            <li>With disposable batteries it is so much easier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think she wants to use it again</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, and even then, I was severely displeased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>very please with this product.</li>
            <li>but I really wish there was another trimmer that got a closer shave like 3MM because using just the shaver by itself leaves it to stubbly and</li>
            <li>And is gentle with the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&gt;My gal found this trimmer useful for occasional light trimming and touch ups but still prefers her professional salon Bikini hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Being</li>
            <li>though I must admit that the Fusion Razors are harder to navigate into confined spaces (like ears), and unless you had a pretty large honker, I don&#x27;t imagine you could easily navigate the thing into your nasal passages.  </li>
            <li>It feels lightweight and cheap in the hand, and the blades have small teeth that are easily clogged.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s super small</li>
            <li>Definitely not something I&#x27;d want for everyday but might be nice for someone looking to surprise their partner on a special</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t as accurate as a regular razor and a steady hand.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it locally but they no longer sell it in stores.</li>
            <li>When I compare the two and know the other costs only $5-10 more, I think it is worth it to go ahead with the higher end</li>
            <li>would not really recommend this even though it&#x27;s pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you are sasquatch or something it would trim it down better but for the rest of us not so much.</li>
            <li>For running on a single AAA battery this is a strong shaver/styler.</li>
            <li>highly recommended...love this absolutely</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but found that in the end... it really wasn&#x27;t all that it was cracked up to</li>
            <li>OK, to be perfectly clear the unit which I received was a returned item, not new as I ordered</li>
            <li>It is nice that it is small.</li>
            <li>This little gadget is perfect for what it advertises, and it has some funny little features to dress up the ole&#x27; short and curlies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, they don&#x27;t sell the replacement heads individually.  </li>
            <li>I am not looking for an extremely close shave either, just a very neat and easy close trim.  </li>
            <li>The company rep even suggested that I just go out and buy a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>Tiny and compact but gets the job done in a quick, painless manner with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The main reason for my purchase of this product was the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Not only does the Philps come with a  much larger number and variety of interchangeable heads, the shave is much better.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric trimmer for quick bikini line touch-ups or basic grooming</li>
            <li>The shaver cuts and trims hair well, many different attachments for different lengths.</li>
            <li>I feel it is a little over priced and not worth more than at the most 10 dollars.</li>
            <li>It would be better just to get a nice, sharp pair of blunt edge scissors for probably less money that would actually have another use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this products highly.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find that Intuition razors do a fast and easy job without irritation, so outside of creating um topiary art using the templates, this \\&quot;bikini styler\\&quot; will probably sit in the drawer for \\&quot;oops I ran out of razors\\&quot; emergencies.  </li>
            <li>I will also say that I have tried many other small electric shavers and have never been satisfied with the shave from any of those like I have been with this one.</li>
            <li>It gets 3 stars instead of 5 because the plastic is a little flimsy - the plastic tread connecting the top and bottom pieces broke after on ya month or two.</li>
            <li>I love this little bikini styler.</li>
            <li>sure i will use the cutsy little decals it has with it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>I used a rash free moisturizing shave cream and proceeded carefully.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two shaving heads, a precision cutter for sensitive areas, including facial hair, eyebrows etc if you want to shave those areas, and a bikini cutter, which looks more like a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>More importantly no fear.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the head was nice because it was rounded instead of having blunt edges that sometimes scratch the delicate areas.</li>
            <li>but it is a poor design and cheaply made for it to break so easily.  </li>
            <li>I was very disappointed when it quit working because I liked it a great deal.</li>
            <li>This is just a cheap plastic shaving stick with mediocre heads that don&#x27;t attach very securely and one can&#x27;t rely on.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but is smaller and less powerful than I thought.  </li>
            <li>Thought it might be batteries, but new batteries didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I was shopping for a new razor and tried out a couple before I came across this one.  </li>
            <li>so it must be a new version of the product.</li>
            <li>but even after I replaced it with a new one it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>I put in a new battery</li>
            <li>I had one Braun FG 1100 Silk &amp;Eacute;pil Bikini Styler before, and when after 3 years of work it broke, I decided to buy a new one from Amazon..</li>
            <li>It is the best bikini razor to use in delicate and hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>The carry bag that comes with it, is cheaply made and isn&#x27;t big enough to carry all the attachments well.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s geared more towards women, because I had a different one that was black</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough to handle (not flimsy) and the blade is a nice size (about an inch across).  </li>
            <li>but if you want smooth hairless skin, you definitely need to stick to a regular razor.</li>
            <li>, the word I got back from my Mrs. on this little gadget is that it is ok, but she wouldn&#x27;t have bought one for herself and really doesn&#x27;t see it as something she can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>While it does it&#x27;s job initially pretty moderately, it has gotten noisier.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, a more traditional razor, be it one designed for ladies or one that was meant for me, could probably do just as well for the purposes of trimming the bikini</li>
            <li>and I usually expect a lot better from Braun.</li>
            <li>They are pretty big, and you&#x27;d have to have quite the surface area to use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  am on my second one now, as the first one I had  </li>
            <li>I lost the first one i bought ,,,, so this is the second one im buying ..</li>
            <li>This little styler does the job, efficiently and easily.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m far less likely to be concerned with trimming my own bikini area (and much more likely to be at least peripherally concerned with how neat and trimmed her&#x27;s is ;-) )  </li>
            <li>Works amazing, then wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;positives- battery operated, sleek, multiple lengths+ small head</li>
            <li>It was not super smooth</li>
            <li>This is cheaply made and typical of the made in China goods.</li>
            <li>Blade dulls quickly and there&#x27;s no replacing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to maneuver which is key when using around delicate bits and pieces!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit right into my purse for when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li>if this happens to someone with more coarse hair, I am not under the impression that it would last very long there either.</li>
            <li>It worked fine until then, but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>but I actually felt like it wasn&#x27;t as gentle as the cheap little drug store units.  </li>
            <li>It snagged and took time to clear off well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never woken up in the morning and thought, \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>In addition, it comes with templates for shapes such as hearts and stars if you want to really become decorative.  </li>
            <li>this is my second epolator, this product is good and worth the money, I was afraid that I was wasting my money.</li>
            <li>but when it comes to removing the hair completely it leaves the hair in a length of 1 mm.   </li>
            <li>I even use it in the shower (sort of trying to keep it out of the direct shower stream) and it still works fantastically after almost a year.</li>
            <li>precision head is very tiny but works very well.</li>
            <li>You could even use it for eyebrow shaping though I didn&#x27;t try it since I prefer having mine professionally waxed.</li>
            <li>I really like the cleaning brush and the different heads.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>far as the length guides....</li>
            <li>It is a neat idea but the actual product doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It is small and if you have smaller hands it fits in your palms quite easily!  </li>
            <li>it simply does not trim the hair short enough for a really clean shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very gentle and I only ended up with a couple nicks and bumps and such.</li>
            <li>I actually did purchase one of those items, at a price that seemed to be somewhere what this particular item is being listed for, but like some others have mentioned here</li>
            <li>The next time I went to use it, the main head wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It does not cut smooth down to the skin like a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>This means that whenever a blade dulls you have to throw out THE WHOLE RAZOR and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great on thin hairs like on your arm/hand which is where I tested it each time it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t working, but it really can&#x27;t cut thick hair.</li>
            <li>I went back to a normal razor for that part of my body.</li>
            <li>Perhaps one could use it with a guard to trim an unruly bush to a consistent length and then complete the job with an epilator (maybe one of Braun&#x27;s other silk epil products?) or a shaver with a foil or floating heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again though, I&#x27;m not a lady, so I really don&#x27;t have the personal experience and could be making a completely false assumption (or three or more of them...)</li>
            <li>I was a little disappponted because with the Braun Silk Epil brand I expected it to be a more sturdy quality unit.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was my battery, so I finally bought new batteries and, welp, you guessed it.  </li>
            <li>They make them (obviously since every new razor comes with one), but they will not sell replacement ones to customers.  </li>
            <li>this cuts hair short enough to be almost invisible, but leaves just enough stubble to avoid ingrown hairs, which is exactly what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li>Also had fun little stickers to help shape designs with your body hair....or pubes.</li>
            <li>I tried all of the different buzzers and attachments the first time I used it, and every single one of them made me bleed!</li>
            <li>I took off the guards and used the unit bare and it worked passably for trimming.</li>
            <li>This styler is very noisy and does not really do the job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the way the trimmer head is made it is very susceptible to getting the hair jammed in.</li>
            <li>The pieces are far too tiny to be messing with.</li>
            <li>This is ok (not great) for trimming those areas, but still lacks power.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations since my past experience with Braun products has been a positive one.</li>
            <li>I changed the battery to a new one &amp; still didn&#x27;t work, bought a second one and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>This comes with a little cleaning brush and a cute little pouch.</li>
            <li>But when using the precision head to clean up the bikini line, I got a few minor cuts( which is why I gave this product 4 not 5 stars).</li>
            <li>Best of all it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch or leave little, painful, nicks.</li>
            <li>There was also a nice surprise of adhesive templates, which if you are as silly as me might take you a second to figure out that it wasn&#x27;t to personalize the shaver,</li>
            <li>the second broke in my bag while travelling from poor packing), and have purchased others in-between thinking they might be better.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the first thing I noticed when I received it is that it seems very similar to a made-for-TV item that I&#x27;ve seen sold in the large-Mart type stores that was intended to be used for trimming nose hairs, ear hairs, eye brows and other similar things.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer reminds me of a higher powered nose hair trimmer (with attachments).  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that if you want to shave to bare in the bikini area that you cut the hair short before shaving.  </li>
            <li>As far as the larger, bikini head, it does the job it is intended to do, but even with the bare head it isn&#x27;t as super close as other trimmers I have used, in the past, that are marketed toward men.  </li>
            <li>It is not very strong neither gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>The battery operated motor feels weak and cheap.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the Philips trimmer wins in all other categories hands down.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is THE best women&#x27;s shaver out there.</li>
            <li> And the head is the perfect shape for a woman&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I used one and it isn&#x27;t very good and shaving the hair away from the sticker.  </li>
            <li> Ideal for touch-ups during traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Comes</li>
            <li> and I loved it!</li>
            <li> THE PRICE AND INCOME IS VERY GOOD, OK, EXCELLENT MACHINE HAIR REMOVAL</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> It is battery operated and is great to take with you while you are traveling.  </li>
            <li> , today&#x27;s a great day for a Brazilian.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Sounds like a win in my book.      </li>
            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> It is also great for cleaning up/trimming a child&#x27;s hair around the neckline.  </li>
            <li> This is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> in all, she is happy with it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with my styler.</li>
            <li> She also owns a Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer, Opal / Aqua by Philips.  </li>
            <li> I would like to say that Amazon was great and let me return this product after all.</li>
            <li> In between them, this product is great for maintenance--</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> great for those dillicate area&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;small bag is great for travel</li>
            <li> but this one without a guard works great for a close shave and trim.</li>
            <li> This was a great improvement over the others that I have used.</li>
            <li> and it is great quality and has lasted years.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Keeps her well groomed and looking great.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so cute!!</li>
            <li> Cute!!</li>
            <li> Love this puppy!!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SELLER, VERY GOOD MACHINE AND VERY USEFUL, MARK</li>
            <li> It trims neatly and closely, and can be very precise, so perfect if you like to shape the down-there area.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer ever, just wish the unit was a bit better in quality.</li>
            <li> this is not as good as the first one i bought !!!!!</li>
            <li> WORKS great, love the templates,  lol.</li>
            <li> all it is good for is for hurting people.</li>
            <li> You can do a good job with it as it is, and using the guides for the hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this item if you are looking for a good trimmer</li>
            <li> It is a good product regarding how well it works</li>
            <li> I used the eyebrow shaper on my partner and it did a good job shaping them for a guy.  </li>
            <li> met all my expectations, very powerful and works perfectly for bikini and even face.</li>
            <li> But I quickly realized that it was for making, ummmm...shaping your bushes into a wonderful topiary shape of your choice.  </li>
            <li> so I welcome any comments anyone might be able to offer as to my suggestions here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> , glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked great to create a uniform length for my bikini area, I did not want to go completely smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of flimsy but for the price</li>
            <li> Shape and features are nice.</li>
            <li> It gets a nice close shave,</li>
            <li> I really liked this trimmer.</li>
            <li> absolute best bikini styler i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The carry pouch is nice for storage.  </li>
            <li> The trimming combs were also nicely designed and did not scratch.</li>
            <li> The Silk Epil Bikini Styler  is really nice to have on hand.</li>
            <li> what it should, nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> It did a nice job of cleaning things up</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> So it worked nicely...</li>
            <li> LMAO.</li>
            <li> I tried my own batteries, everything- faulty product.</li>
            <li> This method is far from flawless but did work to allow a section of hair to remain while the rest was removed.</li>
            <li> Hair returns in about 3-4 weeks but very fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you want a great shave and are willing to deal with a cranky shaver for it.</li>
            <li> I bought another one just because it works great and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> It has a great safety head that, according to my wife, makes it comfortable and, most importantly, produces no anxiety.</li>
            <li> Which brings us to Amazing Warehouse Deals they were very quick to take care of the issue with 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> It requires one AAA battery to operate, which makes it more compact since there is no cord.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I requested this item for my lovely bride to use since, well, she&#x27;s a woman</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is better than the Cleancut, though, which shattered when I dropped it in the sink, an 18&amp;#34; distance.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job.</li>
            <li> However, this means that eventually you will run out of stickers and need to get more.  </li>
            <li> wife has been using it mostly to remove her eyebrows</li>
            <li> I like this much better then a number that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Arrived a day later than intended but, the product itself is the best one a have used.</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find it at walmart any more, I tried others.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find I can still purchase this product even if I have to do it online.</li>
            <li> My wife found the Braun would pull hairs more than cut them.  </li>
            <li> Yes the Philips model costs more, but you get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been more than 30 days, so that is what I rated it 1 star.</li>
            <li> pulls rather than shaves, not what I am used to from the Silk Epil-Line (I love the Silk Epil 7)</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have as many assesories as this one does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think this works more as a trimmer than a razor</li>
            <li> helps me to shape them better than with just waxing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was notorious for not charging them in advance and that not being able to trim because I had forgotten to charge.</li>
            <li> It was a cute idea, but I wasn&#x27;t heartbroken that I wasn&#x27;t able to shave a flower downtown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So precise!</li>
            <li> The only razor that works is the Phillips bikini perfect!</li>
            <li> Crappy design, those blades should be better protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Top piece doesn&#x27;t seem to stay.</li>
            <li> I felt that this product was working well until the plastic cracked at the top where you connect the adapters.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this is an ok styler.  </li>
            <li> I regularly wax, but this is perfect for maintenance in between waxing appointments and it comes with perfect different heads to be used on the eyebrows and bikini line!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The length combs are easy to snap on and off and the trimmer heads are very easy to change out.  </li>
            <li> This is a very unique product for women who want to get a bit creative in the bedroom.  </li>
            <li> beautiful sunny summer, a new bathing suit, and a sailboat...</li>
            <li> feels really cheaply made, it would break if dropped onto the floor very easily.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the stickers, but other wise a great product.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the stickers, but other wise a great product.</li>
            <li> This item is safe, easy to hold and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also used this product /the precision head to cut/shape-up unwanted hair near the nape of my head/neck, worked great.</li>
            <li> Light trimming is ok, but any close shaving don&#x27;t work all that well.</li>
            <li> But as this is intended to be a styling tool for more precise grooming</li>
            <li> Good shaver for those intimate areas, but</li>
            <li> and you can show your true team spirit by rocking a lightening bolt!  </li>
            <li> In any case, having a Brazilian is never an easy thing to do.  </li>
            <li> The guides made it easy.  </li>
            <li> dropped mine once, on a carpeted surface and it still worked, but it didn&#x27;t shave cleanly any more.</li>
            <li> It is compact and operates on AA batteries, so it is easy to carry around.  </li>
            <li> Manoeuvres easily over tricky areas.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to change the heads.</li>
            <li> Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li> It is perfect for trimming longer hair on the body down to a shorter length BEFORE using an epilator (to pluck/pull the hairs out).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this exact razor several years ago and it was the best razor I ever used.</li>
            <li> Its size makes it perfect for travel and it&#x27;s less noisy than one would expect.</li>
            <li> Is very cheap though, so, maybe is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Perfect little trimmer for eyebrows</li>
            <li> It also comes with guides that fit over the head so that you can cut to an even, predefined length.  </li>
            <li> Tends to stop working sometimes and doesn&#x27;t give as smooth a shave as it used to before.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively cheaply made battery operated \\&quot;electric razor\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The shave it gives is amazing, very close shave with no cuts or razor burn, and you can use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap, but, keep in mind that it was in fact cheap IMO.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made .</li>
            <li> It works great, it seems lightweight but sturdy enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for upper lip and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, for sure.  </li>
            <li> Face looks cleaner and hair free.</li>
            <li> The regular trimmer head with a guard works great.</li>
            <li> and I plan on  having one  always available.  </li>
            <li> Do not expect for it to remove all the hair for a smooth finish though.</li>
            <li> in all if you want to be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li> Does not feel flimsy or cheap either.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap and doenst shave close.</li>
            <li> When I saw this tool I taught what a great idea fo a smaller version....</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and comes with a storage bag.</li>
            <li> It comes with a cloth pouch and extra trimming heads, so it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It is small and handy which she liked the most as this is being used as a replacement of a pair of tweezers she has always used, so even though it is a more \\&quot;complex\\&quot; device, it is convenient and easy to carry in her handbag.</li>
            <li> Very effective Epil  Styler for female mustache and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very powerful either.</li>
            <li> The battery is provided so set up and use is very quick and easy right out of the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good for trimming since the shaver head is smaller and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Will still try others for comparisons but I&#x27;m not disappointed in this purchase either.  </li>
            <li> The stensles are fun!</li>
            <li> Making you buy a lot of AAA batteries which also makes it not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> I was kinda excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> However, this Braun BZ Trimmer is light duty and is more suitable for occasional light trimming and touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> The latter comes from an attachment that looks kind of like those in beard trimmer--a plastic comb-like guide clips onto the top so that hair longer than the guide is trimmed, while shorter ones remain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got three lengths to choose from, a nice carrying bag and stickers (more on that later).</li>
            <li> but it does not offer a super smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I think you could better use the shape stickers for a tanning bed to get a nice design on your hip or some such thing.    </li>
            <li> The shaver is safe to use even in the most sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;do not expect a clean no stubble shave with it</li>
            <li> There is no way to clean it out.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend, great gift for a young women too.  </li>
            <li> Great razor - it&#x27;s my second one as the first one</li>
            <li> As far as accessories go, this came fully equipped with a handy drawstring pouch, battery, cleaning brush, and</li>
            <li> As cute as the styling was (very slim and sleek)</li>
            <li> Very please and satisfied</li>
            <li> but it was inexpensive if I added it to the full sized Braun epilator.  </li>
            <li> Nice, easy to use and comes with various blades and guards to meet anyone&#x27;s grooming preferences.  </li>
            <li> It is really handy and it is easy to switch between the different combs.</li>
            <li> It would be great if Braun introduced a high-quality version of this product on par with their other shavers.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked fine when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> I think I would use this particular head to shape my brows before waxing them, to give me a better idea of where to apply the wax.  </li>
            <li> I got almost 3 months use out of it, though I knew last time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t going to work more than once or twice more.</li>
            <li> Received it fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> would say this trimmer performs adequately on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to hold, very light weight and does trim the personal hair reasonably well without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Anway, I wanted something a bit more gentle for the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The batteries are easy to install, the unit easy to use and maneuver, and it&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li> I liked that the head is not very wide, making it easier to use.  </li>
            <li> fun ladyscaping with this super product.</li>
            <li> I have only used the smallest trimmer and it is pretty good for getting a shorter length</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and would be easy to tote around, but don&#x27;t expect a super high quality.</li>
            <li> Really great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> I really want to give this 5 stars because I love it so much that it&#x27;s worth dealing with it&#x27;s issues, but I&#x27;m not sure if others would feel the same, and It would be lovely to have it work perfectly.</li>
            <li> think this is a great little portable trimmer to carry around for when you need touch ups here and there.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer worked great for my eyebrows and bikini line...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a cheap sub for those times when you just cannot get a wax but really need a trim.</li>
            <li> If I had been in a position to laugh, I would have.</li>
            <li> this shaver/trimmer does nothing to help me change my mind to use the cheaper shaving/trimming self method of getting rid of the hair vs. waxing which costs more but leaves me smooth and without stubble - and what does grow back is not itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tiny case for the shaver is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> This is just an OK styler, and I was surprised with its being a Braun.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got my money&#x27;s worth for this before it stopped working, but I don&#x27;t feel cheated, either.</li>
            <li> I knew when I bought it that I was also paying for the guards and the styling head that I would rarely, if ever, use.    </li>
            <li> This product was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> &#x27;near buzz&#x27; length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after a bout of bumps and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any interest in the precision trimmer or the stencils, but as far as hair management goes, this is my favorite female-oriented trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The regular head worked very well for me but with the guards on the results weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;d be useful if I was in a hurry to do touch-ups before heading out in my bathing suit.</li>
            <li> It was fun while it lasted</li>
            <li> I bought this one and it is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m becoming an old fart, but I&#x27;m just not into the super cutesy \\&quot;template\\&quot; thing</li>
            <li> It works great on TRIMMING (not shaving) small areas quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I have had better luck with other brands of trimmers/shavers :)</li>
            <li> first off THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it goes through batteries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, it includes stickers to make such designs as hearts, stars, and more, and has two options for the trimmer itself: shave it clean, or leave about 3/4 inch length.</li>
            <li> my only thing against it is that you need to epilate the area more than twice to get it clean.</li>
            <li> Super quick, doesn&#x27;t catch your skin, trims hairs very close to skin.</li>
            <li> high precision head for fine areas</li>
            <li> This probably works better with straight hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter--the effect is still pretty neat.  </li>
            <li> this bikini styler turned out to be the right answer.  </li>
            <li> 2 of them I had to throw away because they broke right after I started using them, and the company didn&#x27;t refund me.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first time, and then when I went to use it again it seemed like the battery was dead.  </li>
            <li> Great little gadget that every woman would have!</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and it finally gave up on me, but instead of replacing it I found one I liked better for what I needed.  </li>
            <li> This gives a close shave and is pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li> I thought the small size would be great for this, but not with the ripping out.</li>
            <li> it comes with a cute little pouch to store everything in, and some creative sticker guides.</li>
            <li> This is more of a \\&quot;rough cut\\&quot; product and not designed for smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li> It is very gently on your skin</li>
            <li> Easy to use very useful although it is a little bit to light.</li>
            <li> it is good shaving little machine</li>
            <li> Good little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I guess the question is where has the ladle been and how many different trips does it make from one body part to another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works pretty well as an electric shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an epilator at first since I associate the silk epil line with epilators, but it is not.</li>
            <li> Haha, thank goodness he doesn&#x27;t read these reviews!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these now (one wore out after a year or more of constant use,</li>
            <li> I must say that our Panasonic trimmers similar to this are much better.</li>
            <li> I changed out the main head for the styling head and that still works fine, but there was a lot of snagging with the main head.</li>
            <li> The device is small and nice looking and even though it is not sturdy, it feels well made and light.</li>
            <li> we found that to be quite funny but who knows?</li>
            <li> It will get the basic removal of most of the hair but leaves a stubble that you will need to remove with a razor anyway.  </li>
            <li> It came with decals to make fun shapes, however they weren&#x27;t really practical to use.  </li>
            <li> Ok, without getting too personal . . .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a buzzer to cut the hair on top of your head, but much smaller to use on your body.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was my first</li>
            <li> I LOVE the facial trimmer, but this WOULD NOT WORK</li>
            <li> More than I could give myself with a standard razor!  </li>
            <li> Cut up my wife&#x27;s skin on the first use.</li>
            <li> Noooooo, don&#x27;t get this haha!</li>
            <li> Batteries really don&#x27;t last more the 2 to 3 sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have another brand 5 in 1 wet dry trimmer that is awesome and does such a great job, leaving you silky smooth with hardly a snag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We can&#x27;t confirm on the bikini areas since she uses other kind of products for those areas, but for those interested, the box includes some templates with designs you can use with the device...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Being a healthcare professional, I understand the importance of keeping the nether regions neatly trimmed, clean, and sanitary.  </li>
            <li> a club cyclist/swimmer/runner, I sometimes \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; this shaver for trimming the nether regions; helps keep that area clean/sanitary/prevents saddle sores when riding on a bicycle saddle for more than 4 hours during long club rides or centuries.  </li>
            <li> The Philips does a much better better job cutting and you have more options on the length you want to trim your hair.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to pretty much have an unshaven \\&quot;area\\&quot; to use them.  </li>
            <li> It is excellent quality and has a long lasting battery (it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve had to charge</li>
            <li> so I am here to say I am not  sure how the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> :) Not really much to say, its pretty self explanatory.  </li>
            <li> I use it regularly and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer that comes with a carrying case, decals for styling the bikini area, length combs, a brush and an additional precision trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It does trim very wellm and there is no pulling , tearing, or scraping the skin as in som emodels.  </li>
            <li> and it does that job very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real keeper.</li>
            <li> The guards do not work well - for real trimming.</li>
            <li> Serviceable at best - like those ugly old comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room either.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than I expected</li>
            <li> I wish it had a shorter guard, but it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t handle the real needs of women.</li>
            <li> This product worked better then expected.</li>
            <li> But, when they&#x27;re working, they work very well.</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of bikini shavers, and this one is really nifty.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this razor feels very flimsy.</li>
            <li> The head on mine wobbles too much and doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy (maybe mine is defective).</li>
            <li> It feels too much like a toy rather than a real shaver.</li>
            <li> With disposable batteries it is so much easier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think she wants to use it again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, and even then, I was severely displeased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> very please with this product.</li>
            <li> but I really wish there was another trimmer that got a closer shave like 3MM because using just the shaver by itself leaves it to stubbly and</li>
            <li> And is gentle with the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&gt;My gal found this trimmer useful for occasional light trimming and touch ups but still prefers her professional salon Bikini hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Being</li>
            <li> though I must admit that the Fusion Razors are harder to navigate into confined spaces (like ears), and unless you had a pretty large honker, I don&#x27;t imagine you could easily navigate the thing into your nasal passages.  </li>
            <li> It feels lightweight and cheap in the hand, and the blades have small teeth that are easily clogged.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s super small</li>
            <li> Definitely not something I&#x27;d want for everyday but might be nice for someone looking to surprise their partner on a special</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t as accurate as a regular razor and a steady hand.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it locally but they no longer sell it in stores.</li>
            <li> When I compare the two and know the other costs only $5-10 more, I think it is worth it to go ahead with the higher end</li>
            <li> would not really recommend this even though it&#x27;s pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you are sasquatch or something it would trim it down better but for the rest of us not so much.</li>
            <li> For running on a single AAA battery this is a strong shaver/styler.</li>
            <li> highly recommended...love this absolutely</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but found that in the end... it really wasn&#x27;t all that it was cracked up to</li>
            <li> OK, to be perfectly clear the unit which I received was a returned item, not new as I ordered</li>
            <li> It is nice that it is small.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is perfect for what it advertises, and it has some funny little features to dress up the ole&#x27; short and curlies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, they don&#x27;t sell the replacement heads individually.  </li>
            <li> I am not looking for an extremely close shave either, just a very neat and easy close trim.  </li>
            <li> The company rep even suggested that I just go out and buy a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li> Tiny and compact but gets the job done in a quick, painless manner with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The main reason for my purchase of this product was the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not only does the Philps come with a  much larger number and variety of interchangeable heads, the shave is much better.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric trimmer for quick bikini line touch-ups or basic grooming</li>
            <li> The shaver cuts and trims hair well, many different attachments for different lengths.</li>
            <li> I feel it is a little over priced and not worth more than at the most 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> It would be better just to get a nice, sharp pair of blunt edge scissors for probably less money that would actually have another use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this products highly.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find that Intuition razors do a fast and easy job without irritation, so outside of creating um topiary art using the templates, this \\&quot;bikini styler\\&quot; will probably sit in the drawer for \\&quot;oops I ran out of razors\\&quot; emergencies.  </li>
            <li> I will also say that I have tried many other small electric shavers and have never been satisfied with the shave from any of those like I have been with this one.</li>
            <li> It gets 3 stars instead of 5 because the plastic is a little flimsy - the plastic tread connecting the top and bottom pieces broke after on ya month or two.</li>
            <li> I love this little bikini styler.</li>
            <li> sure i will use the cutsy little decals it has with it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> I used a rash free moisturizing shave cream and proceeded carefully.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two shaving heads, a precision cutter for sensitive areas, including facial hair, eyebrows etc if you want to shave those areas, and a bikini cutter, which looks more like a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> More importantly no fear.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the head was nice because it was rounded instead of having blunt edges that sometimes scratch the delicate areas.</li>
            <li> but it is a poor design and cheaply made for it to break so easily.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when it quit working because I liked it a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is just a cheap plastic shaving stick with mediocre heads that don&#x27;t attach very securely and one can&#x27;t rely on.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is smaller and less powerful than I thought.  </li>
            <li> Thought it might be batteries, but new batteries didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I was shopping for a new razor and tried out a couple before I came across this one.  </li>
            <li> so it must be a new version of the product.</li>
            <li> but even after I replaced it with a new one it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I put in a new battery</li>
            <li> I had one Braun FG 1100 Silk &amp;Eacute;pil Bikini Styler before, and when after 3 years of work it broke, I decided to buy a new one from Amazon..</li>
            <li> It is the best bikini razor to use in delicate and hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> The carry bag that comes with it, is cheaply made and isn&#x27;t big enough to carry all the attachments well.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s geared more towards women, because I had a different one that was black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to handle (not flimsy) and the blade is a nice size (about an inch across).  </li>
            <li> but if you want smooth hairless skin, you definitely need to stick to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> , the word I got back from my Mrs. on this little gadget is that it is ok, but she wouldn&#x27;t have bought one for herself and really doesn&#x27;t see it as something she can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> While it does it&#x27;s job initially pretty moderately, it has gotten noisier.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, a more traditional razor, be it one designed for ladies or one that was meant for me, could probably do just as well for the purposes of trimming the bikini</li>
            <li> and I usually expect a lot better from Braun.</li>
            <li> They are pretty big, and you&#x27;d have to have quite the surface area to use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  am on my second one now, as the first one I had  </li>
            <li> I lost the first one i bought ,,,, so this is the second one im buying ..</li>
            <li> This little styler does the job, efficiently and easily.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m far less likely to be concerned with trimming my own bikini area (and much more likely to be at least peripherally concerned with how neat and trimmed her&#x27;s is ;-) )  </li>
            <li> Works amazing, then wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;positives- battery operated, sleek, multiple lengths+ small head</li>
            <li> It was not super smooth</li>
            <li> This is cheaply made and typical of the made in China goods.</li>
            <li> Blade dulls quickly and there&#x27;s no replacing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to maneuver which is key when using around delicate bits and pieces!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit right into my purse for when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> if this happens to someone with more coarse hair, I am not under the impression that it would last very long there either.</li>
            <li> It worked fine until then, but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I actually felt like it wasn&#x27;t as gentle as the cheap little drug store units.  </li>
            <li> It snagged and took time to clear off well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never woken up in the morning and thought, \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> In addition, it comes with templates for shapes such as hearts and stars if you want to really become decorative.  </li>
            <li> this is my second epolator, this product is good and worth the money, I was afraid that I was wasting my money.</li>
            <li> but when it comes to removing the hair completely it leaves the hair in a length of 1 mm.   </li>
            <li> I even use it in the shower (sort of trying to keep it out of the direct shower stream) and it still works fantastically after almost a year.</li>
            <li> precision head is very tiny but works very well.</li>
            <li> You could even use it for eyebrow shaping though I didn&#x27;t try it since I prefer having mine professionally waxed.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning brush and the different heads.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> far as the length guides....</li>
            <li> It is a neat idea but the actual product doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It is small and if you have smaller hands it fits in your palms quite easily!  </li>
            <li> it simply does not trim the hair short enough for a really clean shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very gentle and I only ended up with a couple nicks and bumps and such.</li>
            <li> I actually did purchase one of those items, at a price that seemed to be somewhere what this particular item is being listed for, but like some others have mentioned here</li>
            <li> The next time I went to use it, the main head wouldn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It does not cut smooth down to the skin like a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> This means that whenever a blade dulls you have to throw out THE WHOLE RAZOR and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great on thin hairs like on your arm/hand which is where I tested it each time it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t working, but it really can&#x27;t cut thick hair.</li>
            <li> I went back to a normal razor for that part of my body.</li>
            <li> Perhaps one could use it with a guard to trim an unruly bush to a consistent length and then complete the job with an epilator (maybe one of Braun&#x27;s other silk epil products?) or a shaver with a foil or floating heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again though, I&#x27;m not a lady, so I really don&#x27;t have the personal experience and could be making a completely false assumption (or three or more of them...)</li>
            <li> I was a little disappponted because with the Braun Silk Epil brand I expected it to be a more sturdy quality unit.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was my battery, so I finally bought new batteries and, welp, you guessed it.  </li>
            <li> They make them (obviously since every new razor comes with one), but they will not sell replacement ones to customers.  </li>
            <li> this cuts hair short enough to be almost invisible, but leaves just enough stubble to avoid ingrown hairs, which is exactly what we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> Also had fun little stickers to help shape designs with your body hair....or pubes.</li>
            <li> I tried all of the different buzzers and attachments the first time I used it, and every single one of them made me bleed!</li>
            <li> I took off the guards and used the unit bare and it worked passably for trimming.</li>
            <li> This styler is very noisy and does not really do the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the way the trimmer head is made it is very susceptible to getting the hair jammed in.</li>
            <li> The pieces are far too tiny to be messing with.</li>
            <li> This is ok (not great) for trimming those areas, but still lacks power.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations since my past experience with Braun products has been a positive one.</li>
            <li> I changed the battery to a new one &amp; still didn&#x27;t work, bought a second one and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> This comes with a little cleaning brush and a cute little pouch.</li>
            <li> But when using the precision head to clean up the bikini line, I got a few minor cuts( which is why I gave this product 4 not 5 stars).</li>
            <li> Best of all it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch or leave little, painful, nicks.</li>
            <li> There was also a nice surprise of adhesive templates, which if you are as silly as me might take you a second to figure out that it wasn&#x27;t to personalize the shaver,</li>
            <li> the second broke in my bag while travelling from poor packing), and have purchased others in-between thinking they might be better.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the first thing I noticed when I received it is that it seems very similar to a made-for-TV item that I&#x27;ve seen sold in the large-Mart type stores that was intended to be used for trimming nose hairs, ear hairs, eye brows and other similar things.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer reminds me of a higher powered nose hair trimmer (with attachments).  </li>
            <li> I would suggest that if you want to shave to bare in the bikini area that you cut the hair short before shaving.  </li>
            <li> As far as the larger, bikini head, it does the job it is intended to do, but even with the bare head it isn&#x27;t as super close as other trimmers I have used, in the past, that are marketed toward men.  </li>
            <li> It is not very strong neither gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> The battery operated motor feels weak and cheap.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the Philips trimmer wins in all other categories hands down.  </li>
            <li> The others either broke too fast or just plain hurt.</li>
            <li> this is a decent little shaver.</li>
            <li> It does trim the hair a little too long and you do sometimes get bumps from it, but the real problem is that the blades are not replaceable.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts pretty long but I am not really happy with buying new battery every time it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> but you would only need to do that if the initial hair was quite long already.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my normal salon was not one featured in any of the news stories, it still made me a little nervous.  </li>
            <li> I find this ridiculous, but it might be right up some people&#x27;s alley so to speak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this is my 3rd one that I&#x27;ve bought...and not because I want 3, but because they keep breaking 😫 after not too long.</li>
            <li> (after having it for a long time) final stopped working</li>
            <li> Long lasting trimmer, I used it for a year now..</li>
            <li> Braun products tend to be high-end and last a long time, too, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> This razor comes with many different accessories and cutting edges.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It still works with tape to hold it together, but it shouldn&#x27;t have broken in the first place!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too long for me, but I should have measured beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I expected the same type quality from this trimmer, but it was not there.  </li>
            <li> (ordered a long time ago)</li>
            <li> I just signed in to see how long I&#x27;ve had this thing.  </li>
            <li> If you wanted 5/8\\&quot; long pubes, you could use scissors.</li>
            <li> And it only gets down to 2mm on the ones it actually cuts.  </li>
            <li> the pros for this product is: less pain in general( if you are used to epilate), and you can wash it after usage.</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient cordless trimmer/shaver due to its small size and use of 1 AAA battery.</li>
            <li> Also, it works for other parts (obviously), which is what I&#x27;m doing with it.</li>
            <li> You only drag them out when you need too!</li>
            <li> The attachable trim-length heads work extremely well and pick up hairs without having to keep going over the same spot (like with others i&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> My other broke recently</li>
            <li> However, the trim was haphazard at best, cutting some hairs and leaving others untouched.  </li>
            <li> It left me with bumps, cuts and red bikini area ... totally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It also operated on a single AAA battery.</li>
            <li> No matter what angle I came at my naughty bits, I was left with stubble.  </li>
            <li> cause the entire device to bog down and not trim at all.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problem with rash or irritation using this product, but I am fortunately not particularly prone to this anyway.  </li>
            <li> and she is using it for half of the device&#x27;s potential!</li>
            <li> Plus I saw it on clearance at Target like a week later for less than I paid on here.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointing they ruined an amazing item</li>
            <li> I like the concept of the tiny precision shaper for cleaning up my brows and while it does help clip my little hedgerows</li>
            <li> but 3 months was just a little too short</li>
            <li> The directions are non-specific and confusing, the battery life is very short, and It stopped working the third time i used it.</li>
            <li> A few days later, when it started being itchy, baby powder helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noisy</li>
            <li> For trimming purposes, I find the comb attachments to be quite useful for making it difficult to accidentally cut yourself.</li>
            <li> While the above review is still true, I&#x27;m disappointed that it is so fragile.</li>
            <li> The product stopped working a few weeks after purchase, second one that&#x27;s done that.</li>
            <li> Only problem is sometimes you have to adjust the battery because it wont turn on if you haven&#x27;t used it in a while, but the battery I assure you isn&#x27;t dead.</li>
            <li> After that I tried a few others and ended up coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> , so you gotta be careful when you use it .</li>
            <li> This is a shaver, not an electric tweezer, as I expected from Silk Epil.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, it is not much of a battery hog, I never had to change them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you need a 1970&#x27;s fur bikini to Edward Scissorhands a topiary with this thing, but it didn&#x27;t work with the minimal hair that I do have.  </li>
            <li> I used this a few times and its ultimately been sitting on my shelf.</li>
            <li> Not sure it will last very long.</li>
            <li> This is a trimmer with two precision heads- one that works well for helping to shape eyebrows and one that is a little bigger for trimming down the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this &#x27;shaver&#x27; doesn&#x27;t shave very close and the trimmer dulled very quickly to the point that it yanked hairs between the blades rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because I like it that it included a normal size head as well as a smaller one which I can use for trimming my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, my machine slowed down, made louder noises, and left stubble.</li>
            <li> but I have seen other electric shavers that are quieter.</li>
            <li> Sorry ;-)  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve got other problems downtown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they hold up longer than any other I have bought</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had that with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> No tugging and pulling like other shavers.</li>
            <li> The small razor they suggest for detailing worked as well as the larger one, which is to say that it didn&#x27;t work that well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not willing to go all mountain man in order for it to work.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I took it apart to clean it and was unable to put it back together, so I purchased a second one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Again, it is not ideal for a lot of thick hair (unless you have the patience to continually clean the trimmers of hair).</li>
            <li> This inferior piece of waste whines like an angry chipmunk, and frankly, I would have gotten better results using the aforementioned angry chipmunk.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it very much because I&#x27;ve also lasered the area, so the hair grows slow and thin.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it&#x27;s noisy.</li>
            <li> I took one for the team and can assure you it actually wasn&#x27;t painful to pull back off, which honestly surprised me.</li>
            <li> It comes with two interchangeable heads, 1 wide multi-purpose trimmer and 1 narrow eyebrow trimmer.</li>
            <li> I do believe someone with finer hair to groom might have even worse results, keep in mind your natural texture may affect how well this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim bikini hair all the way down</li>
            <li> It even comes with a templates so you can create shapes, but, as she says, she doesn&#x27;t create topiary down there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has begun to take multiple swipes to trim the same area it used to, which can only mean it has slowed down or isn&#x27;t staying sharpened, neither of which are useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and not convenient.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer lasted over 2 yrs before it broke.</li>
            <li> I got about a year out of it, using it once a week or less.</li>
            <li> This lasted less than 2 months and then it broke.  </li>
            <li> The reason is that this styler does not remove the tiny little hairs that make the armpits look bad, it is capable to trim longer hairs</li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d guess the problem is the odd little plastic hood attachment which seems guaranteed to miss lots of hairs.  </li>
            <li> far as using the precision head (a tiny little detail shaving head) on your bikini area--well, it works, but seems very tedious.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with some neat little attachments and a little bag to put them in.</li>
            <li> The noisiness was a little unnerving.  </li>
            <li> I think for the price this is a nifty little item for those who like a well manicured bush.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> It worked well, comes with a little carry case and two trimming guards.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my skin has little cuts all over when I don&#x27;t use the guard</li>
            <li> The unit feels about the quality of the little mini trimmers that you can buy at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> This product is no better than any other product for that area.</li>
            <li> Smaller and seems like a weak motor, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Also comes with little styling stickers.</li>
            <li> You can use this to go from a close shave to a little trim and anything in between.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because, I liked this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The stickers are stupid and I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone can use them to create a \\&quot;shape\\&quot; without some assistance since who could see to do so accurately.  </li>
            <li> They tug at the hairs -- it feels as though your hair is caught in a machine that is pulling them painfully but not actually cutting them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wasted money here.</li>
            <li> I like the narrow head on it.  </li>
            <li> Has a few attachments all with a purpose...eyebrows, trimming, etc.     </li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It behaved as if the batteries were almost dead, but when I checked the charge on the batteries, they were at 90%.</li>
            <li> Waste of your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as a close, non irritating shave for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I´ll never buy again a Braun product since this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> On top of that I repeatedly had hairs snagged in the blades (even though I followed instructions) and it was very painful.</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful, so it&#x27;s not going to cut through a lot of thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Takes forever to trim hair, constantly gets stuck with very little hair, poor performance all around.</li>
            <li> (not sure that it is not supposed to though).</li>
            <li> No more gel or razors</li>
            <li> The head is small, but not so small that it takes forever to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small appliance, doesn&#x27;t take up any room</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the stickers though....</li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed...</li>
            <li> Not sure that it would work well for women though.  </li>
            <li> The cutting blades are really tiny, so works well in close places (nose/ears); but I may have a defective unit as it runs the battery down with one use.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, junky, and just plain AWFUL.</li>
            <li> It was a very painful experience after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> could get two shaves before it went dull and started pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recxommend this.</li>
            <li> but so far she has not had any bad experiences with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, you won&#x27;t have to worry about a built in battery that loses its capability to hold charge over time.</li>
            <li> From delicate areas?  </li>
            <li> Terrible - it stopped working after 2 months of light use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite a clumsy person.</li>
            <li> least i have found it to be the case</li>
            <li> It does leave behind what looks to me like a few days stubble.  </li>
            <li> Used it approximately 4 times within 2 months and was dead by beginning of July.  </li>
            <li> It does this some even if you do go ultra slow.</li>
            <li> (Not sure how else to put it, ladies!</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I got a defective one since it bearly worked, the blade seemed dull, and it pulled painfully, so I even ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something wrong with the connection to the battery, I have to put the battery in at an odd angle to make it work.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just a bad product for what I wanted, but I would recommend a different shaver.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had done some reading about epilators and decided the bikini area was probably not a good place to start.  </li>
            <li> My other bikini razor feel like they are cutting me</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t cut myself!</li>
            <li> The bikini styler is a thin, battery powered shaver and trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made.  </li>
            <li> poor quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one appeared to be of a very poor quality, I am not satisfied with it at all......</li>
            <li> my wife uses this for bikini area shaving because using normal disposable razors leads to terrible amount of ingrown hairs and razor burn.</li>
            <li> with three \\&quot;Bikini Zone (BZ)\\&quot; attachments: one precision BZ cutting head, one 5mm, and one 8mm BZ trimming comb.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;By itself, without any attachments, the precision cutting head may be used to trim eyebrows, nose hairs, ear hairs, or other ungainly body</li>
            <li> The teeth on them look a little like a piranha mouth in a bad movie.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my pubic area for about 6 months using the phillips, but it breaks often &amp; is expensive to replace, so i decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stickers as guides were laughable.  </li>
            <li> I have an epilator from the silk epil line that is difficult to use for the bikini area since it&#x27;s bulky compared to this.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive, and I don&#x27;t use it often; so I&#x27;m not going to bother with returning it.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is mediocre quality</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about buying this.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of cutting myself trying to trim things up &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; with my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;Ultimate Man Groomer&amp;#34; (://www.amazon.com</li>
            <li> Waxes are EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> Nothing painful or scary.</li>
            <li> Something she was afraid of was that it may cause irritation (like my electric shaver sometimes does)</li>
            <li> It began ripping hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> I also used the small attachment to trim nose hairs and the result was an awful razor burn inside my nose</li>
            <li> Almost everything seemed like a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Quite inconvenient for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is crazy!  </li>
            <li> I told her that is a stupid and wasteful policy and when my razor can no longer cut I&#x27;ll replace it with one from a another company.</li>
            <li> Now it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> that was very painful and became infected.  </li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not the worst by any measure -</li>
            <li> The quality still was awful</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great purchase. Love it and will continue to use this. Not a fan of the stickers, but other wise a great product. Does what i says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Left me with red bumps. I&#x27;ve been shaving my pubic area for about 6 months using the phillips, but it breaks often &amp; is expensive to replace, so i decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t bother to return this thing so i just threw it in the trash!</li>
            <li> It is nice that it is small. But it kept catching the hair instead of cutting it and after I cleaned it it no longer worked. Too much money for the most painful shave I&#x27;ve had. I went back to a normal razor for that part of my body.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so cute!! It is small and if you have smaller hands it fits in your palms quite easily!  It does trim very wellm and there is no pulling , tearing, or scraping the skin as in som emodels.  It also comes with some neat little attachments and a little bag to put them in. It is battery operated and is great to take with you while you are traveling.  There is no waiting for it to charge up. Cute!!</li>
            <li> As summer approached this year, the stories in the news about salons and their equipment and the possible problems with waxing starting to bother me.  Yes, the wax all comes out of the same pot.  I guess the question is where has the ladle been and how many different trips does it make from one body part to another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my normal salon was not one featured in any of the news stories, it still made me a little nervous.  It&#x27;s all about the wax pot.  In any case, having a Brazilian is never an easy thing to do.  I&#x27;ve never woken up in the morning and thought, \\&quot;Wow, today&#x27;s a great day for a Brazilian.\\&quot;  Anyway, I had done some reading about epilators and decided the bikini area was probably not a good place to start.  The teeth on them look a little like a piranha mouth in a bad movie.  Almost everything seemed like a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A beautiful sunny summer, a new bathing suit, and a sailboat... this bikini styler turned out to be the right answer.  I used a rash free moisturizing shave cream and proceeded carefully.  The guides made it easy.  The noisiness was a little unnerving.  A few days later, when it started being itchy, baby powder helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stickers as guides were laughable.  I saw the commercials and I saw the stickers.  If I had been in a position to laugh, I would have.</li>
            <li> Well, my bikini area in now red, cut in several areas and has bumps.  As a shaver this flunks.  I chose this unit because it came with a trimmer as well.  However, the trim was haphazard at best, cutting some hairs and leaving others untouched.  I&#x27;d guess the problem is the odd little plastic hood attachment which seems guaranteed to miss lots of hairs.  And it only gets down to 2mm on the ones it actually cuts.  That&#x27;s too long for me, but I should have measured beforehand.  All in all, I&#x27;m going to have to buy something else.  Wasted money here.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well as an electric shaver/trimmer. I thought this would be an epilator at first since I associate the silk epil line with epilators, but it is not. It is good for trimming since the shaver head is smaller and easy to manipulate. I have an epilator from the silk epil line that is difficult to use for the bikini area since it&#x27;s bulky compared to this. It requires one AAA battery to operate, which makes it more compact since there is no cord. Also, you won&#x27;t have to worry about a built in battery that loses its capability to hold charge over time. It&#x27;s not very noisy but I have seen other electric shavers that are quieter. For trimming purposes, I find the comb attachments to be quite useful for making it difficult to accidentally cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The bikini styler is a thin, battery powered shaver and trimmer.  It comes with two shaving heads, a precision cutter for sensitive areas, including facial hair, eyebrows etc if you want to shave those areas, and a bikini cutter, which looks more like a regular razor.  It also comes with guides that fit over the head so that you can cut to an even, predefined length.  In addition, it comes with templates for shapes such as hearts and stars if you want to really become decorative.  I would suggest that if you want to shave to bare in the bikini area that you cut the hair short before shaving.  I think it is easier and quicker that way.  I did not have any problem with rash or irritation using this product, but I am fortunately not particularly prone to this anyway.  I think for the price this is a nifty little item for those who like a well manicured bush.</li>
            <li> This does not work well. Takes forever to trim hair, constantly gets stuck with very little hair, poor performance all around. Tried changing batteries but this wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
            <li> i am using this from one year..highly recommended...love this absolutely</li>
            <li> first off THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE. my wife uses this for bikini area shaving because using normal disposable razors leads to terrible amount of ingrown hairs and razor burn. this cuts hair short enough to be almost invisible, but leaves just enough stubble to avoid ingrown hairs, which is exactly what we were hoping for. and it does that job very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of flimsy but for the price it&#x27;s okay. I have had mine for about 6 months and I might have to replace it soon.</li>
            <li> I like the narrow head on it.  Great razor - it&#x27;s my second one as the first one finally wore out.</li>
            <li> While this Bikini Styler may have the Braun \\&quot;Silk Epil\\&quot; branding, it is a trimmer/razor, and not one of the epilators (the ones that rip the hair out)... This is a trimmer with two precision heads- one that works well for helping to shape eyebrows and one that is a little bigger for trimming down the bikini area.  I like the concept of the tiny precision shaper for cleaning up my brows and while it does help clip my little hedgerows it simply does not trim the hair short enough for a really clean shave.  It does leave behind what looks to me like a few days stubble.  I think I would use this particular head to shape my brows before waxing them, to give me a better idea of where to apply the wax.  As far as the larger, bikini head, it does the job it is intended to do, but even with the bare head it isn&#x27;t as super close as other trimmers I have used, in the past, that are marketed toward men.  I found that without the length guards on it, it was a bit abrasive to the bikini area.  Perhaps one could use it with a guard to trim an unruly bush to a consistent length and then complete the job with an epilator (maybe one of Braun&#x27;s other silk epil products?) or a shaver with a foil or floating heads.  Personally, I find that Intuition razors do a fast and easy job without irritation, so outside of creating um topiary art using the templates, this \\&quot;bikini styler\\&quot; will probably sit in the drawer for \\&quot;oops I ran out of razors\\&quot; emergencies.  As far as accessories go, this came fully equipped with a handy drawstring pouch, battery, cleaning brush, and yes, those templates.  The templates allow you to \\&quot;sculpt\\&quot; the shape of a star, kitty, heart, etc into your body hair. Maybe I&#x27;m becoming an old fart, but I&#x27;m just not into the super cutesy \\&quot;template\\&quot; thing, it&#x27;s overkill (in my opinion), just like the recent trend of vajazzling.  But hey, whatever floats your boat.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is perfect for what it advertises, and it has some funny little features to dress up the ole&#x27; short and curlies. (Not sure how else to put it, ladies! Sorry ;-)  Anyhow, it includes stickers to make such designs as hearts, stars, and more, and has two options for the trimmer itself: shave it clean, or leave about 3/4 inch length. The latter comes from an attachment that looks kind of like those in beard trimmer--a plastic comb-like guide clips onto the top so that hair longer than the guide is trimmed, while shorter ones remain. This probably works better with straight hair, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter--the effect is still pretty neat.  Also, it works for other parts (obviously), which is what I&#x27;m doing with it. Truth be told, my husband took it and is using it to shave those back of neck hairs for work. Haha, thank goodness he doesn&#x27;t read these reviews! He would probably make me erase this last part. ;-)</li>
            <li> Really great little shaver.  Has a few attachments all with a purpose...eyebrows, trimming, etc.     Tiny and compact but gets the job done in a quick, painless manner with no irritation.  Sounds like a win in my book.      :) Not really much to say, its pretty self explanatory.  You got hair?  You want to remove that hair?  From delicate areas?  Perfect.  Buy the Braun Silk Spil Bikini Styler and its DONE!</li>
            <li> It is very gently on your skin but I don&#x27;t feel it gives a close enough shave and the shaver itself feels really cheaply made, it would break if dropped onto the floor very easily. I feel it is a little over priced and not worth more than at the most 10 dollars. It is nice to hold, very light weight and does trim the personal hair reasonably well without discomfort.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is a lifesaver. It&#x27;s got three lengths to choose from, a nice carrying bag and stickers (more on that later). It doesn&#x27;t cut too short that you develop a rash, so that&#x27;s a BIG bonus. It didn&#x27;t cause that mortifying \\&quot;itch\\&quot;--as if you&#x27;ve got other problems downtown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with these bush-shaping stickers, so you can design your ladyparts into things like a keyhole, princess crown or heart. I find this ridiculous, but it might be right up some people&#x27;s alley so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with batteries and is quite intuitive, so you can just pull it out of the package and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun ladyscaping with this super product. It&#x27;s a real keeper.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. It only worked once and then nothing! I tried to change the batteries but still it did not work!</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient cordless trimmer/shaver due to its small size and use of 1 AAA battery. It comes with two interchangeable heads, 1 wide multi-purpose trimmer and 1 narrow eyebrow trimmer. There are also attachments for different lengths of trim/cut. In use it works well but it does not offer a super smooth shave. This is more of a \\&quot;rough cut\\&quot; product and not designed for smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li> One word for the shaving: No. For the trimming it is passable only. The guards do not work well - for real trimming. I guess if you are sasquatch or something it would trim it down better but for the rest of us not so much. I took off the guards and used the unit bare and it worked passably for trimming. Still left stubble (not sure that it is not supposed to though). It got the majority of hairs cut evenly -- and it didn&#x27;t cut the skin (a plus) but I had the same ol&#x27; itchy issues with the grow out. I just don&#x27;t have those with waxing and this shaver/trimmer does nothing to help me change my mind to use the cheaper shaving/trimming self method of getting rid of the hair vs. waxing which costs more but leaves me smooth and without stubble - and what does grow back is not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the worst by any measure - and it&#x27;s a cheap sub for those times when you just cannot get a wax but really need a trim. Serviceable at best - like those ugly old comfortable shoes. You only drag them out when you need too!</li>
            <li> Not as I expect. It is very sharp and not convenient.</li>
            <li> While it does it&#x27;s job initially pretty moderately, it has gotten noisier. Tends to stop working sometimes and doesn&#x27;t give as smooth a shave as it used to before. I had expected more from this product since it is Braun but alas.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Gets close to skin without any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Worked for 5 minutes then stopped. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I requested this item for my lovely bride to use since, well, she&#x27;s a woman and I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m far less likely to be concerned with trimming my own bikini area (and much more likely to be at least peripherally concerned with how neat and trimmed her&#x27;s is ;-) )  Anyway, the first thing I noticed when I received it is that it seems very similar to a made-for-TV item that I&#x27;ve seen sold in the large-Mart type stores that was intended to be used for trimming nose hairs, ear hairs, eye brows and other similar things.  I actually did purchase one of those items, at a price that seemed to be somewhere what this particular item is being listed for, but like some others have mentioned here, it seems that you get what you pay for.  This is a relatively cheaply made battery operated \\&quot;electric razor\\&quot;.  I could probably do just as well using a manual razor, or one of the Gillette Fusion Power razors (see for example: [[ASIN:B000BUW8WM Gillette Fusion Power Battery Powered Shaving System, 1 System]]) though I must admit that the Fusion Razors are harder to navigate into confined spaces (like ears), and unless you had a pretty large honker, I don&#x27;t imagine you could easily navigate the thing into your nasal passages.  On the other hand, a more traditional razor, be it one designed for ladies or one that was meant for me, could probably do just as well for the purposes of trimming the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again though, I&#x27;m not a lady, so I really don&#x27;t have the personal experience and could be making a completely false assumption (or three or more of them...) so I welcome any comments anyone might be able to offer as to my suggestions here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the word I got back from my Mrs. on this little gadget is that it is ok, but she wouldn&#x27;t have bought one for herself and really doesn&#x27;t see it as something she can&#x27;t live without.  That being the case I hesitate to give this one a \\&quot;buy it rating\\&quot;, and instead preach caution here as it seems the individual results and satisfaction with this device will vary.this device will vary.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for those intimate areas, but it is fragile and there is no replacement blade.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped mine once, on a carpeted surface and it still worked, but it didn&#x27;t shave cleanly any more. Must have dulled some part of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;It is better than the Cleancut, though, which shattered when I dropped it in the sink, an 18&amp;#34; distance. It exploded into 20 pieces and all the King&#x27;s men couldn&#x27;t put it together again.</li>
            <li> this is my second epolator, this product is good and worth the money, I was afraid that I was wasting my money. the pros for this product is: less pain in general( if you are used to epilate), and you can wash it after usage. my only thing against it is that you need to epilate the area more than twice to get it clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. met all my expectations, very powerful and works perfectly for bikini and even face. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> This little styler does the job, efficiently and easily.  Nothing painful or scary. The only complaint is that it&#x27;s noisy.</li>
            <li> Nice, easy to use and comes with various blades and guards to meet anyone&#x27;s grooming preferences.  Works like you would expect it to.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to maneuver which is key when using around delicate bits and pieces!  There was also a nice surprise of adhesive templates, which if you are as silly as me might take you a second to figure out that it wasn&#x27;t to personalize the shaver, lol.  No!  But I quickly realized that it was for making, ummmm...shaping your bushes into a wonderful topiary shape of your choice.  So, let&#x27;s say you are a Tampa Bay Lightening fan...well get this baby and you can show your true team spirit by rocking a lightening bolt!  Well, maybe not show it, but you get my drift.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer reminds me of a higher powered nose hair trimmer (with attachments).  It is compact and operates on AA batteries, so it is easy to carry around.  It works great on TRIMMING (not shaving) small areas quickly.  It is perfect for trimming longer hair on the body down to a shorter length BEFORE using an epilator (to pluck/pull the hairs out).  It is also great for cleaning up/trimming a child&#x27;s hair around the neckline.  It is not very powerful, so it&#x27;s not going to cut through a lot of thick hair.  I liked that the head is not very wide, making it easier to use.  Again, it is not ideal for a lot of thick hair (unless you have the patience to continually clean the trimmers of hair).</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase. Love it and will continue to use this. Not a fan of the stickers, but other wise a great product. Does what i says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Terrible - it stopped working after 2 months of light use. It worked fine until then, but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This item works as it should.No nicks, scrapes or cuts.  More importantly no fear.  The stickers are stupid and I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone can use them to create a \\&quot;shape\\&quot; without some assistance since who could see to do so accurately.  I think you could better use the shape stickers for a tanning bed to get a nice design on your hip or some such thing.    This item is safe, easy to hold and easy to use.  I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job. Shape and features are nice. The battery operated motor feels weak and cheap.</li>
            <li> Super quick, doesn&#x27;t catch your skin, trims hairs very close to skin. Love that it&#x27;s super small so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room either. The attachable trim-length heads work extremely well and pick up hairs without having to keep going over the same spot (like with others i&#x27;ve tried). Manoeuvres easily over tricky areas. I&#x27;ve had three of these now (one wore out after a year or more of constant use, the second broke in my bag while travelling from poor packing), and have purchased others in-between thinking they might be better. I keep coming back to this one though.  * I&#x27;ve edited my score on this product to 4 stars with the recent breakage of this trimmer. While the above review is still true, I&#x27;m disappointed that it is so fragile. See further remarks in the comments below.</li>
            <li> I AM WRITING TO INFORM YOU BECAUSE THE DEVICE DOES NOT WORK SINCE IT HAS BEEN DELIVERED, I TRIED TO USE IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique product for women who want to get a bit creative in the bedroom.  The shaver is safe to use even in the most sensitive parts.  The process is simple:  Apply the patch, shave around it and throw the patch(sticker) away.  However, this means that eventually you will run out of stickers and need to get more.  There are 10 different designs total.  A tiny case for the shaver is a nice touch.  It also operated on a single AAA battery.</li>
            <li> I received the product not functional at all.</li>
            <li> I really want to give this 5 stars because I love it so much that it&#x27;s worth dealing with it&#x27;s issues, but I&#x27;m not sure if others would feel the same, and It would be lovely to have it work perfectly. The shave it gives is amazing, very close shave with no cuts or razor burn, and you can use it everywhere. But this is my 3rd one that I&#x27;ve bought...and not because I want 3, but because they keep breaking 😫 after not too long. And the cover that goes over the battery can&#x27;t be kept on or it won&#x27;t work..and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened to all three. There&#x27;s something wrong with the connection to the battery, I have to put the battery in at an odd angle to make it work. I don&#x27;t know if that makes any sense but I&#x27;ll try and add a picture later. I would recommend this if you want a great shave and are willing to deal with a cranky shaver for it. I will also say that I have tried many other small electric shavers and have never been satisfied with the shave from any of those like I have been with this one.</li>
            <li> This is just an OK styler, and I was surprised with its being a Braun.  The cutting blades are really tiny, so works well in close places (nose/ears); but I may have a defective unit as it runs the battery down with one use.  It wasn&#x27;t expensive, and I don&#x27;t use it often; so I&#x27;m not going to bother with returning it.  I must say that our Panasonic trimmers similar to this are much better.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars is from the size of this product. It is really handy and it is easy to switch between the different combs. When trimming it does its job well but when it comes to removing the hair completely it leaves the hair in a length of 1 mm.   So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this shaver on my bikini area, where it gave a passable shave.  I still prefer waxing, as shaving causes irritation and itching as the hairs grow out.  I don&#x27;t seem to have these problems with waxing.  I also used the small attachment to trim nose hairs and the result was an awful razor burn inside my nose that was very painful and became infected.  I have another trimmer that I&#x27;ve used for my nose, and never had this problem.  Ouch!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is mediocre quality and I usually expect a lot better from Braun. But its low price and several attachments (guards and styling head) were a caution to me that I wasn&#x27;t buying a product I&#x27;d use for years to come. I got almost 3 months use out of it, though I knew last time I used it that it wasn&#x27;t going to work more than once or twice more. It behaved as if the batteries were almost dead, but when I checked the charge on the batteries, they were at 90%. I changed out the main head for the styling head and that still works fine, but there was a lot of snagging with the main head. The next time I went to use it, the main head wouldn&#x27;t work at all. I don&#x27;t think I got my money&#x27;s worth for this before it stopped working, but I don&#x27;t feel cheated, either. I knew when I bought it that I was also paying for the guards and the styling head that I would rarely, if ever, use.    It would be great if Braun introduced a high-quality version of this product on par with their other shavers. This is just a cheap plastic shaving stick with mediocre heads that don&#x27;t attach very securely and one can&#x27;t rely on.</li>
            <li> The product stopped working a few weeks after purchase, second one that&#x27;s done that.</li>
            <li> Thank you good price with high quality well that we will use</li>
            <li> Every women should have one of these, this is the best item I have ever bought. No more gel or razors</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use. It gets 3 stars instead of 5 because the plastic is a little flimsy - the plastic tread connecting the top and bottom pieces broke after on ya month or two. It still works with tape to hold it together, but it shouldn&#x27;t have broken in the first place!</li>
            <li> OK, to be perfectly clear the unit which I received was a returned item, not new as I ordered and I did return it too. Which brings us to Amazing Warehouse Deals they were very quick to take care of the issue with 100% satisfaction. Thank you Adam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the shaver. Since it was already used I went ahead and gave it a try. This POS bites and pulls hair! Because it was used? Don&#x27;t know but won&#x27;t get another.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Bikini Zone\\&quot; trimmer is intended for the ladies so I let my gal give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Portable, operates on one AAA battery (included). Ideal for touch-ups during traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Comes with three \\&quot;Bikini Zone (BZ)\\&quot; attachments: one precision BZ cutting head, one 5mm, and one 8mm BZ trimming comb.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;By itself, without any attachments, the precision cutting head may be used to trim eyebrows, nose hairs, ear hairs, or other ungainly body hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;My gal found this trimmer useful for occasional light trimming and touch ups but still prefers her professional salon Bikini hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Being a club cyclist/swimmer/runner, I sometimes \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; this shaver for trimming the nether regions; helps keep that area clean/sanitary/prevents saddle sores when riding on a bicycle saddle for more than 4 hours during long club rides or centuries.  Also helps when wearing Speedo swim jammers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Fairly anemic motor (powered by one 1.5V AAA battery) that lasted only for five touch ups. We now use AAA rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Flimsy plastic materials.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Not hefty enough to remove dense foliage.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;No trimmer can ever come close to a standard razor shaver or Bikini wax methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Being a healthcare professional, I understand the importance of keeping the nether regions neatly trimmed, clean, and sanitary.  However, this Braun BZ Trimmer is light duty and is more suitable for occasional light trimming and touch-ups.  Excellent for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer twice now, but for $20 it is just what I would expect.  It is powered by one AAA battery, so don&#x27;t expect the same amount of power as a plug in razor.  It worked well, comes with a little carry case and two trimming guards.  It feels cheap, but, keep in mind that it was in fact cheap IMO.  I used it with powder so I didn&#x27;t have any razor burn or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit after 10 months of use:  This thing is awesome!  I use it regularly and it is still going strong.  Definitely better than I expected, glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> After using it for a while these are the comments from the wife in regards to the Braun FG 1100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN THE BOX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high precision head for fine areas&lt;br /&gt;A bikini shaping head&lt;br /&gt;Two different sized trimming combs (5mm and 8mm) which allow for different hair lengths&lt;br /&gt;A pouch&lt;br /&gt;A cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife has been using it mostly to remove her eyebrows (it can be used to shape them as well) and is very happy with it. The device is small and nice looking and even though it is not sturdy, it feels well made and light. It is small and handy which she liked the most as this is being used as a replacement of a pair of tweezers she has always used, so even though it is a more \\&quot;complex\\&quot; device, it is convenient and easy to carry in her handbag. Something she was afraid of was that it may cause irritation (like my electric shaver sometimes does) but so far she has not had any bad experiences with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t confirm on the bikini areas since she uses other kind of products for those areas, but for those interested, the box includes some templates with designs you can use with the device... we found that to be quite funny but who knows? If they&#x27;re there probably someone does use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device works on a AAA battery also included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, she is happy with it and she is using it for half of the device&#x27;s potential!</li>
            <li> This styler is very noisy and does not really do the job.  It will get the basic removal of most of the hair but leaves a stubble that you will need to remove with a razor anyway.  So what it the purpose?  I suppose it gets the basic hair away for establishing a pattern but you would only need to do that if the initial hair was quite long already.  This means you would use it only a couple of times per year.  It would be better just to get a nice, sharp pair of blunt edge scissors for probably less money that would actually have another use.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked fine when I first got it.  It came with decals to make fun shapes, however they weren&#x27;t really practical to use.  The carry bag that comes with it, is cheaply made and isn&#x27;t big enough to carry all the attachments well.  I purchased it at the end of May.  Received it fairly quickly.  Used it approximately 4 times within 2 months and was dead by beginning of July.  Thought it might be batteries, but new batteries didn&#x27;t help.  Poorly made.  Waste of your money.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I like this much better then a number that I&#x27;ve tried. It gets a nice close shave, closer then any of these types that I&#x27;ve tried. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t seem to catch or leave little, painful, nicks. Nice and smooth. Only problem is sometimes you have to adjust the battery because it wont turn on if you haven&#x27;t used it in a while, but the battery I assure you isn&#x27;t dead. This is the second one I bought, the last one stopped working entirely. I believe it got dropped though so that may be the cause. After that I tried a few others and ended up coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I really liked this trimmer. It&#x27;s very thin and easy to use. I wish it had a shorter guard, but it cuts very well. It does not cut smooth down to the skin like a traditional razor. My previous trimmer lasted over 2 yrs before it broke.</li>
            <li> The main reason for my purchase of this product was the trimmer. The trimmer worked great to create a uniform length for my bikini area, I did not want to go completely smooth. But when using the precision head to clean up the bikini line, I got a few minor cuts( which is why I gave this product 4 not 5 stars). I also used this product /the precision head to cut/shape-up unwanted hair near the nape of my head/neck, worked great.After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about buying this. This product was worth the purchase and I&#x27;m happy with my styler.</li>
            <li> Arrived a day later than intended but, the product itself is the best one a have used. When I couldn&#x27;t find it at walmart any more, I tried others. The others either broke too fast or just plain hurt. I&#x27;m not saying that these don&#x27;t break, because they do. However, they hold up longer than any other I have bought and they are cheaper. I was glad to find I can still purchase this product even if I have to do it online.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was tired of cutting myself trying to trim things up &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; with my husband&#x27;s &amp;#34;Ultimate Man Groomer&amp;#34; (://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-BG2040-BodyGroom-Pro/dp/B0037HP9OA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1377469575&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;ultimate+man+groomer). Haha. What did I expect? Anway, I wanted something a bit more gentle for the most sensitive areas. This is ok (not great) for trimming those areas, but still lacks power. At least I don&#x27;t cut myself! For the bulk of things I still use the Man Groomer!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my wife.  She also owns a Philips Hp6378/10 Bikini Perfect Deluxe Trimmer, Opal / Aqua by Philips.  There is no comparison in the quality and shave that you get from using these two products.  The Braun Bikini Styler has one advantage over the Philips in that it uses regular batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your trimmer not being charged when you want to use it.  Aside from that, the Philips trimmer wins in all other categories hands down.  Not only does the Philps come with a  much larger number and variety of interchangeable heads, the shave is much better.  My wife found the Braun would pull hairs more than cut them.  The Philips does a much better better job cutting and you have more options on the length you want to trim your hair.  Yes the Philips model costs more, but you get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and fell apart after two weeks. Don&#x27;t bother with this product. It can&#x27;t handle the real needs of women.</li>
            <li> Great little gadget that every woman would have!</li>
            <li> I like a close trip so I don&#x27;t use the guards it comes with. I feel like my skin has little cuts all over when I don&#x27;t use the guard and I haven&#x27;t had that with other trimmers. But, it does give a close trim.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, then wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;positives- battery operated, sleek, multiple lengths+ small head&lt;br /&gt;negatives- if left in, battery runs out; short life; no &#x27;near buzz&#x27; length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after a bout of bumps and fell in love with it. Specifically the tiny attachment for eyebrows and such! I have had it for about two months. Unfortunately, it has begun to take multiple swipes to trim the same area it used to, which can only mean it has slowed down or isn&#x27;t staying sharpened, neither of which are useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I am not chewy by any means, so if this happens to someone with more coarse hair, I am not under the impression that it would last very long there either.</li>
            <li> Ok, without getting too personal . . . I was shopping for a new razor and tried out a couple before I came across this one.  It&#x27;s perfect for what I needed.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it goes through batteries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these shavers over a two year period and I loved it! Needed a replacement and the quality is NOT the same as it used to be. I thought maybe I got a defective one since it bearly worked, the blade seemed dull, and it pulled painfully, so I even ordered a second one. The quality still was awful so it must be a new version of the product. VERY disappointing they ruined an amazing item</li>
            <li> Literally the most useless product I have ever used. Do not use it on your bikini. If you have any hair, it will literally get a hair stuck in it and just stop working. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wish I had gotten one years ago. The head is small, but not so small that it takes forever to get the job done. I didnt nick myself at all and I&#x27;m quite a clumsy person. Only issue is that it isnt rechargeable, but the battery should last awhile anyway so I&#x27;m not too upset.</li>
            <li> This product worked better then expected. It is easy to use and easy to change the heads. would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> this thing was a piece of junk! my wife bought it for herself and it doesnt even do what its supposed to do. all it is good for is for hurting people.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made . It did not turn on at all</li>
            <li> Kept turning off. I thought it was the battery but even after I replaced it with a new one it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact razor several years ago and it was the best razor I ever used. Unfortunately I took it apart to clean it and was unable to put it back together, so I purchased a second one from Amazon. It worked wonderfully the first time I used it but the second time I used it, the razor did nothing but pull at my hair. Amazon will not let me return the product b/c it&#x27;s been more than 30 days, so that is what I rated it 1 star. I would recommend this product if you can find it in a store where you can return it if it quits working. I will be contacting Amazon to see if I can get an exchange. Update: I would like to say that Amazon was great and let me return this product after all. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SELLER, VERY GOOD MACHINE AND VERY USEFUL, MARK THE PRICE AND INCOME IS VERY GOOD, OK, EXCELLENT MACHINE HAIR REMOVAL</li>
            <li> pulls rather than shaves, not what I am used to from the Silk Epil-Line (I love the Silk Epil 7)</li>
            <li> This shaver is very basic, enough to remove hair, but not as short a blade, no smoth skin. It is not very strong neither gentle to the skin. Is very cheap though, so, maybe is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Waxes are EXPENSIVE. In between them, this product is great for maintenance-- I even use it in the shower (sort of trying to keep it out of the direct shower stream) and it still works fantastically after almost a year.</li>
            <li> it is good shaving little machine but it cause some injuries , so you gotta be careful when you use it .</li>
            <li> Easy to use very useful although it is a little bit to light. Probably it would be made from a heavier material it would be nicer, for me.</li>
            <li> Best bush manscaper I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years now, I&#x27;ve Gone through about four of them. 2 of them I had to throw away because they broke right after I started using them, and the company didn&#x27;t refund me. But, when they&#x27;re working, they work very well.</li>
            <li> Nice size cutting head not enough power.</li>
            <li> I love this little bikini styler. It comes with 2 different size combs for different areas on your body. I especially like the smaller one for eyebrows. This comes with a little cleaning brush and a cute little pouch. It&#x27;s small enough to fit right into my purse for when I&#x27;m traveling. I really like that it&#x27;s geared more towards women, because I had a different one that was black and it didn&#x27;t have as many assesories as this one does. I now need to buy another one for my daughter, because she has been taking it on me lol.</li>
            <li> This razor comes with many different accessories and cutting edges.  It works great, it seems lightweight but sturdy enough to get the job done.  It&#x27;s great for upper lip and bikini area.  No razor burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend, great gift for a young women too.  Give as a bridal shower gift with some slinky panties!</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked awesome for about a week, then it just stopped workin for no reason. I changed the battery to a new one &amp; still didn&#x27;t work, bought a second one and the same thing happened. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> The directions are non-specific and confusing, the battery life is very short, and It stopped working the third time i used it. Save your money!</li>
            <li> This is a shaver, not an electric tweezer, as I expected from Silk Epil.</li>
            <li> No tugging and pulling like other shavers. great for those dillicate area&#x27;s. different heads with guides to help the process.</li>
            <li> not the best I don&#x27;t know if it just wasn&#x27;t meant for course hair but it didn&#x27;t last 6 months.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is smaller and less powerful than I thought.  The smaller attachment doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> absolute best bikini styler i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Perfect little trimmer for eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;easy to switch between the two different size heads that it comes with&lt;br /&gt;small bag is great for travel&lt;br /&gt;i think this works more as a trimmer than a razor&lt;br /&gt;do not expect a clean no stubble shave with it&lt;br /&gt;at least i have found it to be the case&lt;br /&gt;have to still go and wax on my brows&lt;br /&gt;but it helps for when i do not have time to fully wax&lt;br /&gt;and helps me to shape them better than with just waxing&lt;br /&gt;not sure i will use the cutsy little decals it has with it</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of bikini shavers, and this one is really nifty.  I like the \\&quot;feel\\&quot; of this unit.  It&#x27;s heavy enough to handle (not flimsy) and the blade is a nice size (about an inch across).  You can do a good job with it as it is, and using the guides for the hair you want to leave (I have to say that the shorter guide leaves it VERY short, which gets sort of prickly, if you know what I mean).&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the precision head (a tiny little detail shaving head) on your bikini area--well, it works, but seems very tedious.  If you&#x27;re etching your initials or are creating an intricate design, the basic shaver and guides are enough.&lt;br /&gt;The stencils are \\&quot;interesting\\&quot;.  You&#x27;d have to pretty much have an unshaven \\&quot;area\\&quot; to use them.  They are pretty big, and you&#x27;d have to have quite the surface area to use them.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are easy to install, the unit easy to use and maneuver, and it&#x27;s not too loud.  It doesn&#x27;t vibrate or get away from you.  The carry pouch is nice for storage.  White satin pouch.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price, for sure.  Braun products tend to be high-end and last a long time, too, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this &#x27;shaver&#x27; doesn&#x27;t shave very close and the trimmer dulled very quickly to the point that it yanked hairs between the blades rather than cutting them. It works great on thin hairs like on your arm/hand which is where I tested it each time it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t working, but it really can&#x27;t cut thick hair. It was a very painful experience after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> It left me with bumps, cuts and red bikini area ... totally wasted my money. Don&#x27;t get this item if you are looking for a good trimmer</li>
            <li> Best trimmer ever, just wish the unit was a bit better in quality. Often times, I have to wiggle things around to get it to function. It&#x27;s great when it works, though!</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I originally purchased it locally but they no longer sell it in stores. It is the best bikini razor to use in delicate and hard to reach areas. My other bikini razor feel like they are cutting me but this one without a guard works great for a close shave and trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a buzzer to cut the hair on top of your head, but much smaller to use on your body. Don&#x27;t need shaving cream our worry about skin irritation. Also had fun little stickers to help shape designs with your body hair....or pubes.</li>
            <li> I have to say this razor feels very flimsy. The head on mine wobbles too much and doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy (maybe mine is defective). Light trimming is ok, but any close shaving don&#x27;t work all that well. It feels too much like a toy rather than a real shaver.</li>
            <li> Very effective Epil  Styler for female mustache and eyebrows. Hair returns in about 3-4 weeks but very fine. Face looks cleaner and hair free. Very low sensation and practically painfree. Haven&#x27;t used it on bikini area yet.</li>
            <li> I only had this about 3 months before it quit working. I was very disappointed when it quit working because I liked it a great deal. I have come to expect that these type of trimmers will only last about a year or so but 3 months was just a little too short and I will likely not purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very gentle and I only ended up with a couple nicks and bumps and such. This was a great improvement over the others that I have used. The shape of the head was nice because it was rounded instead of having blunt edges that sometimes scratch the delicate areas. The trimming combs were also nicely designed and did not scratch. I had no use for the shaping stencils/stickers. To me, it was a bonus that it was battery operated rather than rechargeable. I was notorious for not charging them in advance and that not being able to trim because I had forgotten to charge. With disposable batteries it is so much easier. Incidentally, it is not much of a battery hog, I never had to change them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the way the trimmer head is made it is very susceptible to getting the hair jammed in. There is no way to clean it out. When it quit working I did finally take the head apart to take a peek but it is definitely not meant to be taken apart. The pieces are far too tiny to be messing with. I did manage to get it put back together. It did work but it did not work well. It began ripping hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> The regular trimmer head with a guard works great. I don&#x27;t have any interest in the precision trimmer or the stencils, but as far as hair management goes, this is my favorite female-oriented trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The Silk Epil Bikini Styler  is really nice to have on hand. It&#x27;s a small appliance, doesn&#x27;t take up any room and  whether at home or  for travel it does what it should, nice close shave.  I  am on my second one now, as the first one I had  (after having it for a long time) final stopped working and I plan on  having one  always available.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> For running on a single AAA battery this is a strong shaver/styler. If you&#x27;re in the market for an electric trimmer for quick bikini line touch-ups or basic grooming this is a decent little shaver. But as this is intended to be a styling tool for more precise grooming I feel it&#x27;s lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision head is very tiny but works very well. You could even use it for eyebrow shaping though I didn&#x27;t try it since I prefer having mine professionally waxed. The regular head worked very well for me but with the guards on the results weren&#x27;t as good. I do believe someone with finer hair to groom might have even worse results, keep in mind your natural texture may affect how well this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are a handful of different shaped stickers (ie. heart, star, keyhole, cat-face) which can be placed over a desired area for use as a styling guide. I took one for the team and can assure you it actually wasn&#x27;t painful to pull back off, which honestly surprised me. This method is far from flawless but did work to allow a section of hair to remain while the rest was removed. Definitely not something I&#x27;d want for everyday but might be nice for someone looking to surprise their partner on a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole I can&#x27;t see myself using this for everyday grooming but it&#x27;d be useful if I was in a hurry to do touch-ups before heading out in my bathing suit. It just isn&#x27;t as accurate as a regular razor and a steady hand.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer that comes with a carrying case, decals for styling the bikini area, length combs, a brush and an additional precision trimmer.  The battery is provided so set up and use is very quick and easy right out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this trimmer performs adequately on the bikini area.  It was not super smooth but it definitely did the job.  The length combs are easy to snap on and off and the trimmer heads are very easy to change out.  The unit feels about the quality of the little mini trimmers that you can buy at the drug store.  I was a little disappponted because with the Braun Silk Epil brand I expected it to be a more sturdy quality unit.  For that reason, I wonder about its long-term durabilty.  I will update about reliability. I have a Braun Silk Epilator that I bought on here and it is great quality and has lasted years.  I expected the same type quality from this trimmer, but it was not there.  I have another brand 5 in 1 wet dry trimmer that is awesome and does such a great job, leaving you silky smooth with hardly a snag.  It is excellent quality and has a long lasting battery (it&#x27;s been so long since I&#x27;ve had to charge I can&#x27;t remember if it even uses batteries or an adapter to charge).  When I compare the two and know the other costs only $5-10 more, I think it is worth it to go ahead with the higher end unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the precision unit to trim around my eyebrows but I actually felt like it wasn&#x27;t as gentle as the cheap little drug store units.  It snagged and took time to clear off well.  My other broke recently so I will continue to use this one for that, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was my first choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great little portable trimmer to carry around for when you need touch ups here and there.  It&#x27;s lightweight and would be easy to tote around, but don&#x27;t expect a super high quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little gadget. It trims neatly and closely, and can be very precise, so perfect if you like to shape the down-there area. Its size makes it perfect for travel and it&#x27;s less noisy than one would expect.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer worked great for my eyebrows and bikini line... That is until it quit working! I got about a year out of it, using it once a week or less. If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer that will last awhile, this is not the answer!</li>
            <li> Good little trimmer.  Do not expect for it to remove all the hair for a smooth finish though. Will still try others for comparisons but I&#x27;m not disappointed in this purchase either.  I&#x27;m not sure about the stickers though....</li>
            <li> Buenas, la presente es porque a la fecha aun mi compra no ha llegado, y ni siquiera la puedo rastrear porque nunca tuvo tracking, por favor enviar tracking o acuse de haberlo entregado a mi buzon en miami.</li>
            <li> This product is no better than any other product for that area. There is no such thing as a close, non irritating shave for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> Worked great the first time, and then when I went to use it again it seemed like the battery was dead.  I put in a new battery and it still wouldn&#x27;t work...it only works sometimes and it seems to rip out my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the facial trimmer, but this WOULD NOT WORK - I tried all kinds of batteries, but nothing, simply would NOT work!!!  And I had set it aside and did not use it (ordered a long time ago) so it is NOT eligible for return!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I could give it NO STARS, I would!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but found that in the end... it really wasn&#x27;t all that it was cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t deliver a close shave, at all.  No matter what angle I came at my naughty bits, I was left with stubble.  Not cool.  Included with this product were fancy-shmancy stickers to act as a pattern to trace a design on your femininity and that was also a bust with me.  The small razor they suggest for detailing worked as well as the larger one, which is to say that it didn&#x27;t work that well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the stickers/detailing I don&#x27;t know if you need a 1970&#x27;s fur bikini to Edward Scissorhands a topiary with this thing, but it didn&#x27;t work with the minimal hair that I do have.  And I&#x27;m not willing to go all mountain man in order for it to work.  It was a cute idea, but I wasn&#x27;t heartbroken that I wasn&#x27;t able to shave a flower downtown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part of this product that did work was the trimmer.  It did a nice job of cleaning things up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you want to be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt this product isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherise Everhard, May 2013</li>
            <li> Seems perfect for the bikini line area. I really like the cleaning brush and the different heads. Does not feel flimsy or cheap either.</li>
            <li> Smaller and seems like a weak motor, but does the job. Not sure it will last very long.</li>
            <li> Broke after two months of once a week use. Wasn&#x27;t very powerful either. Seemed flimsy and didn&#x27;t shave well. Lame. Would never buy again and won&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and it finally gave up on me, but instead of replacing it I found one I liked better for what I needed.  As cute as the styling was (very slim and sleek) I found that the two heads could never do a close cut or even a medium cut. On top of that I repeatedly had hairs snagged in the blades (even though I followed instructions) and it was very painful. But I never had irritation afterwards, so I didn&#x27;t mind that aspect. Maybe it was just a bad product for what I wanted, but I would recommend a different shaver.</li>
            <li> The stensles are fun! Great product!</li>
            <li> Better than any trimmer I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Long lasting trimmer, I used it for a year now..I bought another one just because it works great and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> This gives a close shave and is pretty powerful.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This stopped working after 3 months.  It was probably used a total of 5-6 times. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I owned this product for 1 year before it stopped working. It was used not even once a month so I was pretty disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked I liked it but obviously I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best bikini trimmer.  Not only can you shave the bikini line,  but you can trim as well.</li>
            <li> Love this puppy!! So precise! Best bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I just signed in to see how long I&#x27;ve had this thing.  I bought it in April of 2012.  And it stopped working last month.  I thought maybe it was my battery, so I finally bought new batteries and, welp, you guessed it.  It is not the batteries.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because, I liked this shaver.  I didn&#x27;t use it very much because I&#x27;ve also lasered the area, so the hair grows slow and thin.  I am not looking for an extremely close shave either, just a very neat and easy close trim.  So it worked nicely... until, of course, it stopped working.  I considered buying another one, but I will likely use a different brand and see if I can get it to last longer than 20 months!</li>
            <li> When I got the shaver I put the battery in and nothing. Had to bend the sliver tab inside to get it to work. It feels cheap and doenst shave close. I never write reviews but I bought this based on  &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews.  I feel cheated on them so I am here to say I am not  sure how the reviews were good. I will try to return it.</li>
            <li> My wife got this product for her armpits and bikini line and she did not like it. The reason is that this styler does not remove the tiny little hairs that make the armpits look bad, it is capable to trim longer hairs but if you want smooth hairless skin, you definitely need to stick to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This bikini trimmer works well, but it only lasted 7 months for me.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because I like it that it included a normal size head as well as a smaller one which I can use for trimming my eyebrows.  It takes 1 AAA battery so that&#x27;s convenient.  The pattern stickers included in the kit didn&#x27;t work that well but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason. I will be looking for a different trimmer now that this one is no longer working.</li>
            <li> poor quality. It stop working all the time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money... Joke was on me! This pulls and makes you bleed! The only razor that works is the Phillips bikini perfect!</li>
            <li> This lasted less than 2 months and then it broke.  I definitely do not recommend this trimmer.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have had a braun silk epil for20 years (had 3) When I saw this tool I taught what a great idea fo a smaller version....but its a razor...not like my silk epil for the legs...</li>
            <li> I bought this, used it once, and threw it in the trash. It gave me numerous nicks and cuts in the bikini area. More than I could give myself with a standard razor!  Crappy design, those blades should be better protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the length guides....LMAO. If you wanted 5/8\\&quot; long pubes, you could use scissors. At least....I could.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the quality of this product. I had high expectations since my past experience with Braun products has been a positive one. This is cheaply made and typical of the made in China goods. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the best of these style of razors I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried probably 7 or so.</li>
            <li> WORKS great, love the templates,  lol.</li>
            <li> This product worked once before it stopped. I tested it on my husband&#x27;s face. When I went to use it, it no longer worked. I tried my own batteries, everything- faulty product.</li>
            <li> OUCH! Cut up my wife&#x27;s skin on the first use. I don&#x27;t think she wants to use it again &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Noooooo, don&#x27;t get this haha! I tried all of the different buzzers and attachments the first time I used it, and every single one of them made me bleed! They tug at the hairs -- it feels as though your hair is caught in a machine that is pulling them painfully but not actually cutting them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To its credit it comes with a cute little pouch to store everything in, and some creative sticker guides. But I have had better luck with other brands of trimmers/shavers :)</li>
            <li> The shaver cuts and trims hair well, many different attachments for different lengths. Easy to clean and comes with a storage bag. The downside is it is Not Rechargeable. Making you buy a lot of AAA batteries which also makes it not environmentally friendly. Other than that I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I only used it once since it stopped working by the second time i used it. I´ll never buy again a Braun product since this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, and even then, I was severely displeased with this trimmer. It feels lightweight and cheap in the hand, and the blades have small teeth that are easily clogged. It lacks any sort of power - meaning that close trims result in hairs that get caught and are yanked out instead, and longer trims cause the entire device to bog down and not trim at all. This inferior piece of waste whines like an angry chipmunk, and frankly, I would have gotten better results using the aforementioned angry chipmunk. Cheap, junky, and just plain AWFUL.</li>
            <li> very please with this product.I am very satisfied could not be any happier.I would recommend this products highly.Very please and satisfied</li>
            <li> Top piece doesn&#x27;t seem to stay. Have to shake item to get it to work sometimes. Something messed up with this item</li>
            <li> I felt that this product was working well until the plastic cracked at the top where you connect the adapters.  Now it is worthless.  Why don&#x27;t they use some sort of metal for the attachment areas to avoid this?  It is a good product regarding how well it works but it is a poor design and cheaply made for it to break so easily.  I would have given it 4 stars if it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Keeps her well groomed and looking great. Awesome option for him and her. Also comes with little styling stickers.</li>
            <li> Awful&lt;br /&gt;Only could get two shaves before it went dull and started pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recxommend this.</li>
            <li> The razor works well with bikini area but not that well for eyebrow. The battery lasts pretty long but I am not really happy with buying new battery every time it&#x27;s gone. Quite inconvenient for me!</li>
            <li> I lost the first one i bought ,,,, so this is the second one im buying .. hence i know the quality difference ... this is not as good as the first one i bought !!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this a few times and its ultimately been sitting on my shelf. It doesn&#x27;t trim bikini hair all the way down and if you don&#x27;t move at a snails pace it rips hair out and causes bleeding. It does this some even if you do go ultra slow. You would spend probably 30 minutes trying to shave all of it with this thing. I thought the small size would be great for this, but not with the ripping out.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is an ok styler.  It has three attachments: two trimming combs (5 and 8 MM) and an eyebrow shaper.  I have only used the smallest trimmer and it is pretty good for getting a shorter length but I really wish there was another trimmer that got a closer shave like 3MM because using just the shaver by itself leaves it to stubbly and the 5MM cuts it short but in a few days it&#x27;s already grown too much.  As for the stickers that come with it?  I was kinda excited to try them out. I used one and it isn&#x27;t very good and shaving the hair away from the sticker.  I pull off the sticker only to find an unidentifiable shape.  I used the eyebrow shaper on my partner and it did a good job shaping them for a guy.  Not sure that it would work well for women though.  Batteries really don&#x27;t last more the 2 to 3 sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not really recommend this even though it&#x27;s pretty cheap.  Plus I saw it on clearance at Target like a week later for less than I paid on here.</li>
            <li> I had one Braun FG 1100 Silk &amp;Eacute;pil Bikini Styler before, and when after 3 years of work it broke, I decided to buy a new one from Amazon.. Unfortunately this one appeared to be of a very poor quality, I am not satisfied with it at all......</li>
            <li> Eh. It is a neat idea but the actual product doesn&#x27;t do much. After a few uses, my machine slowed down, made louder noises, and left stubble. It was fun while it lasted but I threw it out and didn&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> I had another brand for years that finally stopped working. I bought this one and it is much better than my old one. It comes with a cloth pouch and extra trimming heads, so it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This works so well!  I wasn&#x27;t even going to order it but it was inexpensive if I added it to the full sized Braun epilator.  I regularly wax, but this is perfect for maintenance in between waxing appointments and it comes with perfect different heads to be used on the eyebrows and bikini line!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> The razor works acceptably.  It does trim the hair a little too long and you do sometimes get bumps from it, but the real problem is that the blades are not replaceable.  This means that whenever a blade dulls you have to throw out THE WHOLE RAZOR and buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is crazy!  I even called Braun to confirm.  It&#x27;s true, they don&#x27;t sell the replacement heads individually.  They make them (obviously since every new razor comes with one), but they will not sell replacement ones to customers.  The company rep even suggested that I just go out and buy a whole new razor.  I told her that is a stupid and wasteful policy and when my razor can no longer cut I&#x27;ll replace it with one from a another company.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with this one. With only one AAA battery (this means a lot of money saving, and avoid danger of a wire in a bathroom or bedroom), this device can make a work faster (and like) than a regular shave&#x27;s blades. And it has power enough to handle women&#x27;s intimal area hair. And is gentle with the skin. until now, any complaining</li>
            <li> Very painful. Blade dulls quickly and there&#x27;s no replacing it.</li>
            <li> It works when it will turn on.</li>
            <li> You can use this to go from a close shave to a little trim and anything in between. It has a great safety head that, according to my wife, makes it comfortable and, most importantly, produces no anxiety. She uses this all the time. It even comes with a templates so you can create shapes, but, as she says, she doesn&#x27;t create topiary down there.</li>
            <li> This is THE best women&#x27;s shaver out there. It doesn&#x27;t bite!! And the head is the perfect shape for a woman&#x27;s body.</li>
