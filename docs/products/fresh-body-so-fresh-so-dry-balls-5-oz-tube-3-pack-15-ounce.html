            <li>Price is great as well-</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, keeps me comfortable on hot,sticky days.</li>

            <li>Helps prevent &amp;#34;swamp nuts.&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li>The product is excellent, but the description calls out a 3oz size tube and the actual product was in 5oz tubes.</li>
            <li>A lot better than talc</li>
            <li>I would give it more than three stars</li>
            <li>My life is good with this product thanks!</li>
            <li>Great product, not quite as good as traditional powders such as Gold Bond, but great nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Some folks poke fun at me for using it (&amp;#34;manscaping solves that issue&amp;#34; they say), but I can &amp;#34;sense&amp;#34; their smell vs. mine:)</li>
            <li>Product is great but 3- 5oz packages in Blue and orange tube showed...</li>
            <li>My fiance uses this and I am RE-ordering him some after his original stock has run out because it TRULY works as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and just as advertised, no more swamp a$$</li>
            <li>Pretty good so far.......</li>
            <li>(my wife has been complaining about the fine layer of powder in the bathroom since we first started dating!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh yes, I forgot to mention that he has mild eczema</li>
            <li>Works well,  fresh smell,  and no moisture.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Fresh Body should take the time to correct the product image and description.</li>
            <li>Since using Fresh Balls, I have yet to have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>being a motorcycle rider, when you&#x27;re on a long ride in warm weather, even if you&#x27;re not moving you get swampy.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels dry.</li>
            <li>I live by this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended as we have yet to find a product that keeps things fresh down there for an extended period of time.</li>

            <li> Instead of 3- 3oz of grey tube as shown....</li>
            <li> just let it dry before u get dressed</li>
            <li> only complaint is it sometimes takes a while to dry (especially if it&#x27;s hot and/or humid out), which means you have an uncomfortable, &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Being a bigger guy, that area can get a little funky and I was prone to getting chaffed.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as well as expected</li>
            <li> but when he used it for the first time I actually had to shut MY mouth (imagine that, the woman wrong?!).</li>
            <li> Just a pasty mess.  </li>
            <li> feeling for a little while.  </li>
            <li> but I find that I have to keep the tube with me all day and reapply at least once.</li>
            <li> Trade off: it does not work as well as baby powder but at least my bathroom</li>
            <li> This led me to believe that I received the wrong product until I had to research a bit online to find out that this was not the case.</li>
            <li> (I mean, come on, &amp;#34;fresh balls&amp;#34; - IMPOSSIBLE!</li>
            <li> Smells like nasty sunscreen.  </li>

            <li> Great product, not quite as good as traditional powders such as Gold Bond, but great nonetheless.  It goes on like a lotion, but leaves a powdery residue once it dries.  Unlike traditional powders, it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere (my wife has been complaining about the fine layer of powder in the bathroom since we first started dating!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it sometimes takes a while to dry (especially if it&#x27;s hot and/or humid out), which means you have an uncomfortable, &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; feeling for a little while.  Regardless, I plan to keep a tube on-hand for the foreseeable future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot, it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Works well,  fresh smell,  and no moisture.</li>
            <li> My fiance uses this and I am RE-ordering him some after his original stock has run out because it TRULY works as it is supposed to. Ladies and gentleman, we both thought it was a joke (I mean, come on, &amp;#34;fresh balls&amp;#34; - IMPOSSIBLE! lol) but when he used it for the first time I actually had to shut MY mouth (imagine that, the woman wrong?!). Highly recommended as we have yet to find a product that keeps things fresh down there for an extended period of time. Oh yes, I forgot to mention that he has mild eczema and it has never given him an outbreak, so it&#x27;s easy on the skin too! Win, win!</li>
            <li> It works. Have used this for last 2 years and no breakdowns in skin</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps prevent &amp;#34;swamp nuts.&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> Great for sweaty areas: inner thighs, under breasts, etc.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! Without this I feel gross and like I&#x27;m going to smell through out the day but when I put this on I have great confidence through out the whole day!!!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent, but the description calls out a 3oz size tube and the actual product was in 5oz tubes.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all as advertised.  Just a pasty mess.  Smells like nasty sunscreen.  I will go back to my Shower 2 Shower thank you</li>
            <li> This product is great for men!  Some folks poke fun at me for using it (&amp;#34;manscaping solves that issue&amp;#34; they say), but I can &amp;#34;sense&amp;#34; their smell vs. mine:)</li>
            <li> A lot better than talc just let it dry before u get dressed or it gets on your clothes recommended</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, keeps me comfortable on hot,sticky days. Price is great as well- I paid $18 for 1 tube at a retail store. $28 for 3 here!</li>
            <li> Got them as gage gifes but it actually works!</li>
            <li> Packaging is different and you get 5 oz. tubes instead of 3 oz. tubes. This led me to believe that I received the wrong product until I had to research a bit online to find out that this was not the case. Perhaps Fresh Body should take the time to correct the product image and description. I would give it more than three stars but I find that I have to keep the tube with me all day and reapply at least once. It is probably not a fault of the product but I do wish it were a bit stronger to support a once a day application.</li>
            <li> Product is great but 3- 5oz packages in Blue and orange tube showed... Instead of 3- 3oz of grey tube as shown.... It seems to be the same stuff though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and just as advertised, no more swamp a$$</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I love the way it feels dry.</li>
            <li> Being a bigger guy, that area can get a little funky and I was prone to getting chaffed. Since using Fresh Balls, I have yet to have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;Also being a motorcycle rider, when you&#x27;re on a long ride in warm weather, even if you&#x27;re not moving you get swampy. Not with this.&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as well as expected</li>
            <li> This stuff works I have been useing it over a year and it&#x27;s a must have. My life is good with this product thanks!</li>
            <li> Trade off: it does not work as well as baby powder but at least my bathroom no looks like it is covered in dust.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.......Like it...</li>
            <li> I live by this stuff.  I don&#x27;t go a day without it!</li>
