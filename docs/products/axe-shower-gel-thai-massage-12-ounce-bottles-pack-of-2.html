            <li>The aroma is awesome and it cleans with gusto too.</li>
            <li>This thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to leave the house to get it which is great since I have 3 kids to chase after.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>I love this product,smells great!.</li>
            <li>So good feeling and very nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts all day and it smells sooooooooo good.</li>
            <li>Good scent, cleans well.  </li>
            <li>but once you use it and smell the full scent its not the best.</li>
            <li>the price is right though, and they smell awesome!</li>
            <li>I love to hug him after he uses this!</li>
            <li>my favorite since Boost!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, a family member bought it</li>
            <li>Was nice to find in a 2 pack.  </li>
            <li>However, this soap is very legal and very good and getting you clean and making you smell good.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much even someone as feminine and picky as me would use it for a shower gel even though it was designed for men it is great for either gender:)</li>
            <li>I love this scent...</li>
            <li>It gives more of a oil massage kinda of a feeling.  </li>
            <li>when i smelled this in the store i thought it smelled ok</li>
            <li>I love this product, it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product is nice if you are looking for something to sooth and calm your body.  </li>
            <li>Although I assume this smell wouldn&#x27;t be the most popular, think of it as smelling like Asian Bengay/Vicks</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good smell.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the Dove for Men Deep Clean which is more drying, which was what I&#x27;ve been using lately, so this one was a happy medium.</li>
            <li>The price is on par with stores in my area, but it gets delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>Aroma is nice but doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li>I love this scent from Axe, and Amazon is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li>My free time is limited and it was delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The shipping and Handling was extremely fast (ordered Wed night got it Fri. morning).</li>
            <li>and I really feel refreshed after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite body product my husband has ever used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I prefer Snake Peel; I feel it exfoliates better, and leaves your skin a little moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Specially in winter taking shower with that helps the skin moisture for long time.</li>
            <li>the thai massage has become my favorite axe shower gel, it cleans and is soothing and leaves a clean scent that isn&#x27;t heavy on fragrance like some of the other axe shower gels can be.</li>

            <li> the size is smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This one can leave your skin just a tad dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> the bottles might slip open a little and get a over your package.</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit on the weak side.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it seems to have disappeared from stores around me.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like it&#x27;d be illegal.  </li>
            <li> Not always a bad thing, just out of the norm for Axe products.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked at the scent.</li>
            <li> that said its certaintly not the worst thing you can buy.</li>

            <li> This is hands down my favorite body product my husband has ever used. The fragrance lasts all day and it smells sooooooooo good. I love to hug him after he uses this!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, a family member bought it and I was shocked at the scent. The captured the ocean and air and bottled it! I love it so much even someone as feminine and picky as me would use it for a shower gel even though it was designed for men it is great for either gender:)</li>
            <li> I love this scent...my favorite since Boost!  Unfortunately it seems to have disappeared from stores around me.  I e-mailed Axe and they said that it&#x27;s not discontinued, so hopefully Amazon will continue to stock it.</li>
            <li> Good scent, cleans well.  Was nice to find in a 2 pack.  I prefer Snake Peel; I feel it exfoliates better, and leaves your skin a little moisturized.  This one can leave your skin just a tad dry in the winter.  I like it better than the Dove for Men Deep Clean which is more drying, which was what I&#x27;ve been using lately, so this one was a happy medium.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this and it smells pretty good. I would buy it again. It&#x27;s about the same price as getting it in the store but I don&#x27;t have to leave the house to get it which is great since I have 3 kids to chase after. My free time is limited and it was delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> This product is nice if you are looking for something to sooth and calm your body.  It gives more of a oil massage kinda of a feeling.  Aroma is nice but doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li> the size is smaller than I expected. It says the OZ weight, but when you think bodywash, you think the big ones. the price is right though, and they smell awesome!</li>
            <li> The aroma is awesome and it cleans with gusto too. I will definitely reorder this iterm again and again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this scent from Axe, and Amazon is the only place I can find it. The price is on par with stores in my area, but it gets delivered right to my door. The shipping and Handling was extremely fast (ordered Wed night got it Fri. morning). I will buying these again.</li>

            <li> Me either.  It sounds like it&#x27;d be illegal.  Even in Thailand.  However, this soap is very legal and very good and getting you clean and making you smell good.  Order this in bulk because there&#x27;s no shame in being spotless.</li>
            <li> So good feeling and very nice fragrance.  Specially in winter taking shower with that helps the skin moisture for long time.</li>
            <li> Never thought I will ever write a review for male bodysoap. This thing is awesome. Smells great and I really feel refreshed after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> the thai massage has become my favorite axe shower gel, it cleans and is soothing and leaves a clean scent that isn&#x27;t heavy on fragrance like some of the other axe shower gels can be.</li>
            <li> I love this product,smells great!. But beware that sometimes(happened to me) the bottles might slip open a little and get a over your package.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good smell. However, it is a bit on the weak side. Not always a bad thing, just out of the norm for Axe products.</li>
            <li> Those from the east might recognize the smell of tiger balm (or Min Ya Kapak) in this Shower Gel. Although I assume this smell wouldn&#x27;t be the most popular, think of it as smelling like Asian Bengay/Vicks</li>
