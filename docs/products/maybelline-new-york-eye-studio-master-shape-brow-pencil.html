    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It was AWESOME.</li>
            <li>This is perfect.</li>
            <li>Otherwise great product!</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>and then Maybelline had the brilliant idea of updating an already great product to an inferior one.</li>
            <li>Great long-lasting blendable product.</li>
            <li>I did it and it works great.</li>
            <li>I loved how it blended in</li>
            <li>The pencil is good until you run out of the tip.</li>
            <li>Good luck sharpening plastic with a pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li>Starts out great, was so happy to find the perfect texture and color, only to find, once you&#x27;ve used it two or three times, that there is NO WAY to extend the tip OR to sharpen it!  </li>
            <li>Sharpens easily though and great value-</li>
            <li>but that I had amazing brows.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it would be nice if they made a sharpener specifically for it.  </li>
            <li>I tried this pencil and liked the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>it comes with that nice mascara wand at the end to help keep the hairs of your brows in place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda waxy and wipes off VERY easy.</li>
            <li>This is a great invention--soft perfect color that you can blend even more with the handy brush at the other end.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is the best brow pencil I have ever used - it gives natural, phenomenal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have very light hair, this product will not work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color, Wax, and brush</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a twist or anything to get more of the pencil part, its just plastic and the tip.</li>
            <li>Over the year, I have thrown away many pencils before I researched on line and found existing customers comments that it can be sharpened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t till I read here that you could sharpen it that I realized that was how you were supposed to get more from this pencil.  </li>
            <li>Well, more power to you.  </li>
            <li>I love this brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>it was ok until after it has reached that tip where I already need to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>Even if it could be easily and successfully sharpened it still rubs off right away.  </li>
            <li>Gives great natural looking definition.</li>
            <li>The color blends great and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Perfect brown for my light/medium brown hear and dark brown eyes.</li>
            <li>Supposedly one can sharpen the plastic and it will work fine.</li>
            <li>the pencil tip cannot be advanced (once you use what&#x27;s exposed)&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first looked at it it thought it would just turn to get more pencil like the Estée Lauder I have.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply and the other end is perfect to fix and make you eye brows look natural.</li>
            <li>I use a Revlon sharpener (the larger hole size) that works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>All the pegs were full of this product, so I assumed Maybelline had discontinued the Define A Brow, that this replaced it &amp; also that it would would work just as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have read good and not so good reviews about this item but still went through ordering it in trying to prove those who have given it bad reviews because it seems to be a good item.</li>
            <li>Brow Precise is also a very soft pencil, which makes it apply easily, but that also means the pencil is prone to breaking, and that it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li>The brush on the other end is great too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at my local store but wanted to review it here since so many are complaining about not being able to sharpen this pencil.  </li>
            <li>Overall Nice item.</li>
            <li>After buying this item after reading all of the reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, the light brown shade is more of a blonde and what you see in the picture is what you get, just the tip.</li>
            <li>I found the pen to be too soft and the pigmentation could be a lot better.</li>
            <li>I see some have had success sharpening it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s waxy and rubs right off.  </li>
            <li>Come to find out it actually sharpens very easily.</li>
            <li>B0013NBWAA Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder, Shade #10 Light Brown, 0.1 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Picked this up on a whim since I&#x27;ve never really found an eyebrow pencil I liked before.</li>
            <li>When I got to the \\&quot;tip-end\\&quot; of this brow pencil, I was pretty deflated to find it appeared as though there was no way to move it up and keep using it -</li>
            <li>First of all, I did like the color.  </li>
            <li>When i got to use it at first--</li>
            <li>It creates beautiful, natural looking brows which is why I&#x27;m coming back for a second one</li>
            <li>Brush on the other tip is nice though</li>
            <li>It is housed in a plastic casing that is supposed to be as easily sharpened as a traditional wood pencil.  </li>
            <li>Pure rubbish.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t work with either of my sharpeners.  </li>
            <li>I also found that this product does not look the most natural for me – it was pretty obvious</li>
            <li>I liked this color because it did look like it was just a little darker than the blond</li>
            <li>For $7 I think its way too much money for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>I really like how it glides.</li>
            <li>I use this by applying gently with the side of the pencil tip to tint the eyebrow hair, and then brush everything to soften and blend.</li>
            <li>The color itself is very neutral and stays put.  </li>
            <li>and it just takes off too much of the pencil inside coz</li>
            <li>I purchased the Brow Precise in the lightest shade, which is 250 Blonde.</li>
            <li>I made it work by applying this shade with a light hand and using the spoolie to blend out the color, but I definitely need a shade lighter.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows that need a lot of filling in, so I used a lot of product with each use.</li>
            <li>I am sad because it did make my brows look great, full and natural</li>
            <li>Has the IQ of the Maybelline company significantly declined recently?  </li>
            <li>The soft brown is the true color of my natural eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Alas, as much as I loved that spoolie being on the end, that doesn’t justify a repurchase in my book.</li>
            <li>The plastic that the pencil is incased in is very soft.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this the look is very natural.  </li>
            <li>The first sharpener, which had worked fine on regular pencils previously, is not gummed up with waxy eyebrow pencil and plastic and will no long per sharpen a regular pencil.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so many bad reviews, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>Plus it costs way too much for daily use.</li>
            <li>The packaging should direct the consumer to sharpen the end, plastic and all.</li>
            <li>I had an Estée Lauder soft blond pencil that I have had for years and years and can just refill</li>
            <li>I wore this off and on for about a month, and I’m nearly out of product already.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still kind of confused as to how I can continue using it.</li>
            <li>This particular pencil has just enough wax in it to stay put on your eyebrows .  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair, but even this blonde was too dark for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally today, I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer &amp; found just 2 Define A Brow pencils at Walgreens in the right color, so I bought them both &amp; figured I&#x27;d need to find some other brand to use, once I&#x27;d used them both up.</li>
            <li>but after a quick Google search, I discovered all I needed to do was sharpen it using the same sharpener I use for all my other pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>loved the color and brush end, But SO CONFUSING on how to exend tip after its wore down!</li>
            <li>rep, that the co. still makes the Define A Brow, so apparently WalMart decided not to carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have ordered an Estée Lauder pencil in soft brown and expect it to last me for years and years like the blond one has.  </li>
            <li>Ruining one and coming out less than useful after using the second one.  </li>
            <li>Tried it on a sturdier sharpener, metal, attached to the wall, and while it sharpens regular pencils fine, this pencil comes out thick and blunt and you end up wasting a lot of the pencil trying to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>Even my high quality, German-made stainless steel sharpener could not handle the hard plasic casing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, if you don&#x27;t have enormous, thick eyebrows, or don&#x27;t mind getting color all over, above and below your brows, which you have to clean off with a Q-Tip &amp; then reapply your foundation around your brows, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>

            <li> Otherwise, you spend a lot of time checking for fine print, and/or examining and re-examining the pencil itself, KNOWING that there&#x27;s a secret to extending life of the pencil in there somewhere!</li>
            <li> it is a little soft and Maybelline really needs to make it in black or a darker black brown.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality and the soft, subtle look this pencil gives.</li>
            <li> Remove the clear plastic cover, and sharpen in any small makeup pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> Needs to be sharpened, which I&#x27;ll admit was a little confusing at first.</li>
            <li> IMO, it is very, very poorly designed &amp; I don&#x27;t think there are many women who have brows thick and bushy enough to use this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using the traditional \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; eyebrow pencil by Maybelline, but decided I wanted something slightly darker.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m guessing that i&#x27;ll only get a few weeks out of this product.</li>
            <li> Darker than expected.</li>
            <li> and if you do--it will give you rough edges</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s aplastic pencil instead of wood, it&#x27;s impossible to get the lead to a fine point.</li>
            <li> My other eyeliners are 1.2oz</li>
            <li> Like other have said there are no instructions on how to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; the pencil.</li>
            <li> just sharpen it like you do your other pencils.</li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment AND waste of money.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product fails simply because you cannot sharpen it!  Even my high quality, German-made stainless steel sharpener could not handle the hard plasic casing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this design failure!</li>
            <li> Picked this up on a whim since I&#x27;ve never really found an eyebrow pencil I liked before. Great long-lasting blendable product. Sharpens like a regular eyebrow pencil even though it&#x27;s plastic. Would recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ll use. It works so well. Gives great natural looking definition. Needs to be sharpened, which I&#x27;ll admit was a little confusing at first. Sharpens easily though and great value- one pencil lasts me about 4 months with nearly daily use.</li>
            <li> Starts out great, was so happy to find the perfect texture and color, only to find, once you&#x27;ve used it two or three times, that there is NO WAY to extend the tip OR to sharpen it!  Tried to sharpen it with a pencil sharpener, which failed as the body of the pencil is not made of wood but PLASTIC!  Of course, there are NO instructions and their lame website is a complete waste of time.  DREADFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What HUGE disappointment AND waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this eyebrow pencil at Target for like $7. It was AWESOME. I loved how it blended in so well that you couldn&#x27;t see I was wearing anything but that I had amazing brows. The only thing I&#x27;m dissapointed about is of course what ever one else is saying, once you reach the end of the tip there is no way of moving the product up. I pulled the brush off at the end and its just a white plastic stump. I did however take others advice and actually sharpen the pencil even tho it is plastic. I have a CoverGirl basic pencil sharpener, to see if this \\&quot;sharpening\\&quot; would work I used the bigger side incase I broke it.  Come to find out it actually sharpens very easily. The plastic that the pencil is incased in is very soft. I will have to update this review in a few weeks to let everyone know where the product ends. It says its .02 oz. My other eyeliners are 1.2oz so i&#x27;m guessing that i&#x27;ll only get a few weeks out of this product. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in the design of this eyebrow pencil. Like other have said there are no instructions on how to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; the pencil. I&#x27;m assuming once people get to the end they end up throwing the pencil away because there is no explanation and not buying the product again. For $7 I think its way too much money for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> This thing is like a Gluestick for your eyebrows.  Seriously.  It glues your eyebrow hairs either to your skin so you have greasy-looking fake eyebrows, or to the hairs so you have gluey clumps.  What a piece of crap.  Run away.</li>
            <li> I really like how it glides.I had bought the brown and thought this would be a shade lighter but to me its the same shade.It was too dark for me.Overall Nice item.</li>
            <li> Why is it the best?&lt;br /&gt;1.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Lasts all day after you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Affordable!</li>
            <li> I am very sad that I ever found this product.  I am sad because it did make my brows look great, full and natural but it is nearly impossible to sharpen.  It is housed in a plastic casing that is supposed to be as easily sharpened as a traditional wood pencil.  I have broken an urban decay sharpener, an industrial strength pencil sharpener and everything in between.  The pencil did sharpen but not in an even manner and the plastic bits around the tip became craggy and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again.  At 7-8 dollars it is too expensive to only use it for a week or 2 before you have to buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> Love the color, Wax, and brush but the product does not last. Supposedly one can sharpen the plastic and it will work fine. Not for me. Plus it costs way too much for daily use.</li>
            <li> I wore this religiously: http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Define-A-Brow-Eyebrow-Pencil-Blonde/dp/B001KYVXP6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1350504563&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;maybelline+brow+pencil and then Maybelline had the brilliant idea of updating an already great product to an inferior one. Hard to apply, too waxy so hard to apply with any kind of detail, and when it does come on, it&#x27;s oily and bad looking (the previous iteration dried to am almost powder.) Don&#x27;t get me started on how I broke my pencil when I tried to advance the lead manually (like the previous) and I had to go ONLINE to find out that it&#x27;s a pencil that you have to sharpen. Because it&#x27;s aplastic pencil instead of wood, it&#x27;s impossible to get the lead to a fine point. Pure rubbish.</li>
            <li> After buying this item after reading all of the reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, the light brown shade is more of a blonde and what you see in the picture is what you get, just the tip. There isn&#x27;t a twist or anything to get more of the pencil part, its just plastic and the tip.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else it took me awhile to realize that this pencil needs to be sharpened.  It creates beautiful, natural looking brows which is why I&#x27;m coming back for a second one but it&#x27;s ridiculous to have to sharpen a plastic pencil.  I use a Revlon sharpener (the larger hole size) that works fairly well.  You would think that someone would have had the common sense to state on the packaging that this is not an automatic pencil and needs to be sharpened.  Oh, and it would be nice if they made a sharpener specifically for it.  Someone at Maybelline is definitely asleep at the switch.</li>
            <li> I just called Maybelline &amp; let them know how very, very unhappy I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Maybelline&#x27;s &amp;#34;Define A Brow&amp;#34; for years, which I lalways bought at WalMart (for about half the price of this worthless junk). I only purchased the &amp;#34;Master Shape&amp;#34; because there were no Define A Brow pencils on the pegs at WalMart. All the pegs were full of this product, so I assumed Maybelline had discontinued the Define A Brow, that this replaced it &amp; also that it would would work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does NOT. My eyebrows are not at all thin, but they&#x27;re not the size of caterpillars...which is about the only size brows this would be satisfactory for! Also, I don&#x27;t draw brows in, I use a pencil to fill in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally today, I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer &amp; found just 2 Define A Brow pencils at Walgreens in the right color, so I bought them both &amp; figured I&#x27;d need to find some other brand to use, once I&#x27;d used them both up.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did learn, when speaking with the Maybelline c.s. rep, that the co. still makes the Define A Brow, so apparently WalMart decided not to carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you don&#x27;t have enormous, thick eyebrows, or don&#x27;t mind getting color all over, above and below your brows, which you have to clean off with a Q-Tip &amp; then reapply your foundation around your brows, don&#x27;t buy this. IMO, it is very, very poorly designed &amp; I don&#x27;t think there are many women who have brows thick and bushy enough to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been so disgusted with any cosmetic product in my life &amp; I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup for over 40 years!</li>
            <li> This particular pencil has just enough wax in it to stay put on your eyebrows .  The color blends great and looks natural.</li>
            <li> This is a great invention--soft perfect color that you can blend even more with the handy brush at the other end.  I&#x27;m baffled why there&#x27;s any confusion about sharpening....it&#x27;s a pencil....just sharpen it like you do your other pencils. Remove the clear plastic cover, and sharpen in any small makeup pencil sharpener. This product has the benefit, too, of not giving your brows that awful \\&quot;drawn on\\&quot; look, while darkening them nicely.  I use this by applying gently with the side of the pencil tip to tint the eyebrow hair, and then brush everything to soften and blend. I had been using the traditional \\&quot;blonde\\&quot; eyebrow pencil by Maybelline, but decided I wanted something slightly darker.  This is perfect. I&#x27;m also intrigued by the idea of the Maybelline brow powder, which I ordered, as well. It gets plenty of 5-star reviews:[[ASIN:B0013NBWAA Maybelline New York Ultra-Brow Brow Powder, Shade #10 Light Brown, 0.1 Ounce]] I&#x27;ll review it when it arrives.</li>
            <li> I found the pen to be too soft and the pigmentation could be a lot better.</li>
            <li> Shame on you Mabeline!! loved the color and brush end, But SO CONFUSING on how to exend tip after its wore down! At least write something on the dam pencil that says its can be sharpened! The end looks plastic and does not look like it can be sharpened.</li>
            <li> The soft brown is the true color of my natural eyebrows.  Have tried many expensive pencils, liners ranging fr $19-$39 and this one is the only one that matches my eyebrows.  The only *drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;1) the pencil tip cannot be advanced (once you use what&#x27;s exposed)&lt;br /&gt;2) there is no information on the package on how to SHARPEN the pencil -- it&#x27;s plastic, so one would assume it must be thrown away. Over the year, I have thrown away many pencils before I researched on line and found existing customers comments that it can be sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline SHOULD place some statements on the packaging to educate their customers!  Otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> I tried this pencil and liked the ease of use.  Unfortunately the shade was too dark for me.  I will probably pass it on to a friend.</li>
            <li> The only reason for giving this pencil/brush 4 stars rather than 5 is the confusion over the sharpening issue. The packaging should direct the consumer to sharpen the end, plastic and all. Otherwise, you spend a lot of time checking for fine print, and/or examining and re-examining the pencil itself, KNOWING that there&#x27;s a secret to extending life of the pencil in there somewhere!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local store but wanted to review it here since so many are complaining about not being able to sharpen this pencil.  This product works well and CAN BE SHARPENED. Just use your regular eye pencil sharpener and sharpen.  I did it and it works great. This product works well but could be a little firmer, to me it is a little soft and Maybelline really needs to make it in black or a darker black brown.  But have no fear, even though this is in a plastic case, it can be sharpened.  The brush on the other end is great too.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was extremely disappointed. There is no way to \\&quot;sharpen\\&quot; it. I thought maybe it was a defect, so I exchanged it for another one....same problem. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and 2 were the same and the 3rd one was a completely different product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it! It&#x27;s kinda waxy and wipes off VERY easy. I&#x27;ve worn down the tip but I&#x27;m still kind of confused as to how I can continue using it. Its like a pencil but the casing is plastic. There&#x27;s no twist up function. I researched it online and discovered that its supposed to be sharpened with a makeup sharpener despite being plastic. Its just not a well thought out product. The only plus side is the brush attached to the end.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many bad reviews, I love this product. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and the other end is perfect to fix and make you eye brows look natural. I sharpened with an eye pencil sharpener (not a regular school sharpener) and I have had no problem with it. The color is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> When I got to the \\&quot;tip-end\\&quot; of this brow pencil, I was pretty deflated to find it appeared as though there was no way to move it up and keep using it - that is, until I realized you can sharpen it, and keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it doesn&#x27;t look like your traditional sharpen-able pencil, and nowhere on the packaging does it say that in order to keep using it, you need to sharpen it - but after a quick Google search, I discovered all I needed to do was sharpen it using the same sharpener I use for all my other pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is the best brow pencil I have ever used - it gives natural, phenomenal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps Maybelline should just mention the sharpening part on their packaging to avoid consumer confusion? Just a thought.</li>
            <li> Okay.  First of all, I did like the color.  I had an Estée Lauder soft blond pencil that I have had for years and years and can just refill but I wanted something just a little darker.  I liked this color because it did look like it was just a little darker than the blond and it was.  It went on okay but it&#x27;s waxy and rubs right off.  When I first looked at it it thought it would just turn to get more pencil like the Estée Lauder I have.  It wasn&#x27;t till I read here that you could sharpen it that I realized that was how you were supposed to get more from this pencil.  Well I tried it.  On 2 different pencil sharpeners.  The first sharpener, which had worked fine on regular pencils previously, is not gummed up with waxy eyebrow pencil and plastic and will no long per sharpen a regular pencil.  Tried it on a sturdier sharpener, metal, attached to the wall, and while it sharpens regular pencils fine, this pencil comes out thick and blunt and you end up wasting a lot of the pencil trying to sharpen it. I see some have had success sharpening it.  Well, more power to you.  It certainly didn&#x27;t work with either of my sharpeners.  Ruining one and coming out less than useful after using the second one.  I have ordered an Estée Lauder pencil in soft brown and expect it to last me for years and years like the blond one has.  This is nothing but a waste of money and a piece of garbage.  And I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t let you know you can sharpen it (which you can&#x27;t) on the packaging.  Has the IQ of the Maybelline company significantly declined recently?  Even if it could be easily and successfully sharpened it still rubs off right away.  So what&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> I love this brow pencil.  The color itself is very neutral and stays put.  Every time I use this the look is very natural.  It doesn&#x27;t need any brow gel to keep the color in place.  PLUS it comes with that nice mascara wand at the end to help keep the hairs of your brows in place.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Darker than expected.</li>
            <li> I have read good and not so good reviews about this item but still went through ordering it in trying to prove those who have given it bad reviews because it seems to be a good item.When i got to use it at first-- it was ok until after it has reached that tip where I already need to sharpen it. the pencil&#x27;s body is not the ususal in a sense that it&#x27;s made of plastic and it&#x27;s so hard to sharpen and if you do--it will give you rough edges and it just takes off too much of the pencil inside coz it keeps on breaking everytime you&#x27;re pulling it out of the sharpener. Brush on the other tip is nice though but i would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I initially only picked this eyebrow pencil because of its ranking on the EWG Skin Deep database and the Maybelline brand. I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality and the soft, subtle look this pencil gives. The pencil glides well and itsn&#x27;t overly heavy.</li>
            <li> The pencil is good until you run out of the tip. Good luck sharpening plastic with a pencil sharpener. I felt tricked buying this product and wanted others to know.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find locally.  Perfect brown for my light/medium brown hear and dark brown eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not like the plastic around pencil, hard to use my sharpener.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Brow Precise in the lightest shade, which is 250 Blonde. This product only comes in four shades, and I have to say I’m disappointed that this is the lightest shade. I have light brown hair, but even this blonde was too dark for me. I made it work by applying this shade with a light hand and using the spoolie to blend out the color, but I definitely need a shade lighter. If you have very light hair, this product will not work for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Brow Precise is also a very soft pencil, which makes it apply easily, but that also means the pencil is prone to breaking, and that it runs out very quickly. I wore this off and on for about a month, and I’m nearly out of product already. I need to sharpen it at least twice each time I use it as well. That being said, I think this is just the wrong product for me. I have very sparse eyebrows that need a lot of filling in, so I used a lot of product with each use. I also found that this product does not look the most natural for me – it was pretty obvious I penciled in my brows (not cute!). Alas, as much as I loved that spoolie being on the end, that doesn’t justify a repurchase in my book.</li>
