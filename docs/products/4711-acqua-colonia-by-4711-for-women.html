    <ol>
            <li> I DO NOT LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS AT ALL! IT SMELLS LIKE BUG SPRAY--A VERY BAAAAD BUG SPRAY!</li>
            <li> Smells uniquely clean. I like it!</li>
            <li> A very light clean citrus scent with ginger note.  It&#x27;s lighter than 4711.  There are no off or chemical notes.  I use it in hot weather during the day.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful and refreshing spray. I use it on my handkerchief,  bathroom,  and to counter cigarette smoke coming through windows.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t last long on you, but it&#x27;s a really fresh scent. It lasts longer on clothing.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and light - perfect for a hot day.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of this delightfully light scent and absolutely love it.  I like it even better than 4711 which previously was my favorite light splash.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance for every day is 4711, though it is not very long lasting.  Aqua Colonia Lemon Ginger is a nice, longer lasting alternative.  I also layer it with 4711.  It has the refreshment of lemon combined with the hint of spicy ginger.  Had my doubts when I ordered it, but am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> The exact product I wanted. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Elegant, distinctive and warm but never over powering. I tried it on a whim and I really like it. I don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling too strongly of cologne. It&#x27;s a nice change from florals. I am not bored of it at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim, while getting some original 4711, as I am a huge fan of the original and also love the scents of lemon and ginger. I rarely buy perfume without first testing the scent on my skin, so it was a bit of a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very light scent, almost like a body spray, perfect for daytime or hot weather. It is very sweet, almost sugary. I would liken it to a lemon drop candy coated in ginger powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the type of scent you could wear in an elevator without overpowering anyone. Quite nice, but not necessarily memorable. 4 stars.</li>
