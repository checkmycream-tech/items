            <li>This line of products would work best on people with fairly light to medium skin, I would think.</li>
            <li>Almay medium is good for tan skin...</li>

            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>I like this better for now, and has the spf which is good since I&#x27;ve had a basil skin procedure on my face!</li>

            <li>Kind of feels like my face isnt breathing as well.</li>
            <li>Its light with good coverage and it blends well with your skin color.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and don&#x27;t plan on changing.</li>
            <li>I would have to say Maybelline Dream nude airfoam is better.</li>
            <li>This is a great makeup starter or for someone who really doesn&#x27;t know what makeup tone they are.  </li>
            <li>I love Almay products.</li>

            <li>I hope works better.  </li>
            <li>I love this make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 70s and it&#x27;s nice to smooth out the color and brighten my skin.  </li>
            <li>this is the best bargain I have received in a long time, and if I could give it more than 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li>been using this makeup for several years now, perfect skin match, not greasy, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Very light, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Nothing looks as good as Almay Smart Shade Anti Aging.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is paraben free and has SPF 20 is just an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>makeup is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This foundation is light and does not feel like you have makeup on.</li>
            <li>This makeup is light and does seem to blend in with the heat of my body?</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I  live in a warm climate, so</li>
            <li>ok doesn&#x27;t really cover my acne scars unless you use it with the powder as well.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that it is &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; in terms of color matching.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cover all imperfections, but using concealer and mineral or other powder over it provides a great look that for me lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This great little anti aging makeup does just what it says it will.</li>
            <li>was fun while it lasted....</li>
            <li>It is as it has always been for me, just the right color and texture</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, blends easy, adjusts well to the shade of your skin, as long as you get the right shade range.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and breakout easily.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily looks natural and not made up.  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff is pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>It really looks pretty on carrie underwood.</li>
            <li>Love and have used a very long time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it cause I did not notice it being a smart shade</li>
            <li>Preferred the smart shade anti aging concealer.  </li>
            <li>It came in  a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>paid $9 at Walmart, this is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It is VERY drying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 72 and have been looking for a long time for a foundation suitable for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>First I was surprised at the white coloring but, using my foundation brush, it smoothed out very quickly and&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;became\\</li>
            <li>This product does a decent job of evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look older.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend gets pretty amazed at how it comes out white and the beads break when you are putting it on to match your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>old face!  </li>
            <li>So drying that it shows every tiny to every large wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>The thing with the airfoam,is you might need to pick up two shades,as the one i thought would match was a little light.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how it changed to my skin tone</li>
            <li>I really did not break out with it, but I only used it once and just gave it to my mom.  </li>
            <li>the chemo causes some skin problems which I cannot control and it has made me somewhat self conscious of it, this make up has helped that.  </li>
            <li>I was referred to this brand from the \\&quot;About\\&quot; website that offers reviews of just about everything.  </li>
            <li>I am a 47 year old latina (olive skin)</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I saw it come out of the tube</li>
            <li>This Almay Smart Shade Anti-Aging Makeup is very inexpensive in comparison to other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got home and tried it on over a primer.  </li>
            <li>Only because it feels better to apply because its so thin.</li>
            <li>But limited available shades means this one converts from a white cream to a pale beige, leaving a &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; cast to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have never had good results with foundation makeups, even very expensive ones.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have never had good results with foundation makeups, even very expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I loved the coverage, the feel, the texture</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, goes on smoothly but did not last.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to bad because otherwise it had nice coverage.</li>
            <li> That used to be a common problem and it was easily correctable with a little patience and a little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously tried to get custom matched foundations by such brands as MAC, Lancome, Prescriptives, Laura Mercier.  </li>
            <li> It certainly couldn&#x27;t be worse.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was just that the little beads of color that appear to be suspended in a lighter fluid had all settle to the bottom.  </li>
            <li> After years of searching and tons of money wasted, I finally found it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not I really a foundation person</li>
            <li> My skin looks paler with the foundation and powder than with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy this product because I have tried other cream make ups and have had skin irritation, etc</li>
            <li> I have spent almost two weeks trying to get the color to change to something approximating what it&#x27;s supposed to be, propping it up on end, trying to shake color down toward the opening of the tube.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time - or at least an earlier version of it, so when the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; makeup</li>
            <li> (4) had a slight \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it without being greasy or shiny, and (5) allowed blush and contour powder to go on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could be a little darker though, not quite a medium tone makeup.</li>
            <li> Its pale color is quite odd coming from the tube, but it does seem to darken on the skin.</li>
            <li> so it goes on a little heavy.</li>
            <li> My face is a little irritated with it on for a few minutes now,and i dont know if that will go away.</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have acne, but has uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tried the darkest shade and it was still way too pale.</li>
            <li> Mac made me break out and made my skin look terrible, this product really helps with sensitive skin and won&#x27;t give you breakouts.</li>
            <li> Medium-Light and Medium have a difference in appearance on the skin, as I have found in  the past.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Makeup forever or Clinique.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least a year now, switched from my Clinique that I used for over 30 years as my skin is now 50&#x27;s skin and the Clinique makeup was not looking &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; on my skin anymore - it looked make-upy.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it is thick</li>
            <li> heavy make-up would be unattractive and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This comes out of the tube as white cream and develops an almost invisible base color in minutes.  </li>
            <li> BUT it DOES NOT come in wide range of colors :(  </li>
            <li> Ill still wear the almay unless the irritation bothers me longer.</li>
            <li> or it was just the wrong color even though it looked like it should match.  </li>
            <li> Now, the bad side.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT THANKS</li>
            <li> This is a great base makeup. Goes on easy, blends easy, adjusts well to the shade of your skin, as long as you get the right shade range. Medium-Light and Medium have a difference in appearance on the skin, as I have found in  the past. I have been using this product for many years and don&#x27;t plan on changing. It just seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> This product does a decent job of evening out skin tone. Its pale color is quite odd coming from the tube, but it does seem to darken on the skin. This line of products would work best on people with fairly light to medium skin, I would think. My skin looks paler with the foundation and powder than with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> was fun while it lasted.... i dont wear this make up anymore</li>
            <li> i bought the almay to try.It really looks pretty on carrie underwood. I put it on and it is thick so it goes on a little heavy. My face is a little irritated with it on for a few minutes now,and i dont know if that will go away.Kind of feels like my face isnt breathing as well.I would have to say Maybelline Dream nude airfoam is better. Only because it feels better to apply because its so thin.The thing with the airfoam,is you might need to pick up two shades,as the one i thought would match was a little light. Almay medium is good for tan skin...Ill still wear the almay unless the irritation bothers me longer.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin looks and feels when I use this product</li>
            <li> I usually buy Makeup forever or Clinique.  I have really sensitive skin and breakout easily.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative so I decided to purchase this instead.  I have uneven skin tone so I thought this would be perfect.  I tried it and it works ok doesn&#x27;t really cover my acne scars unless you use it with the powder as well. I was really surprised how it changed to my skin tone it did not turn orange me (medium tone).  This is a great makeup starter or for someone who really doesn&#x27;t know what makeup tone they are.  I really did not break out with it, but I only used it once and just gave it to my mom.  She doesn&#x27;t have acne, but has uneven skin tone. It works great with her when used with the powder and some blush.  I&#x27;m used to a lot of coverage so I probably would not purchase this for myself again, but my mom will definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at least a year now, switched from my Clinique that I used for over 30 years as my skin is now 50&#x27;s skin and the Clinique makeup was not looking &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; on my skin anymore - it looked make-upy. I like this better for now, and has the spf which is good since I&#x27;ve had a basil skin procedure on my face!</li>
            <li> I have been using Almay for about 3 years.  I am very satisfied with your product.  It came in  a reasonable time.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy this product because I have tried other cream make ups and have had skin irritation, etc or it was just the wrong color even though it looked like it should match.  This one is working for me and I have a stage 4 cancer and the chemo causes some skin problems which I cannot control and it has made me somewhat self conscious of it, this make up has helped that.  I will continue to use this and will order it again.</li>
            <li> It is as it has always been for me, just the right color and texture so the make up doesn&#x27;t appear caked on leaving lines etc... very nice product and the price is very right!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is pretty neat.  My boyfriend gets pretty amazed at how it comes out white and the beads break when you are putting it on to match your skin tone.  Could be a little darker though, not quite a medium tone makeup.</li>
            <li> I finally found my foundation!  After years of searching and tons of money wasted, I finally found it.  I previously tried to get custom matched foundations by such brands as MAC, Lancome, Prescriptives, Laura Mercier.  Nothing looks as good as Almay Smart Shade Anti Aging.  The fact that it is paraben free and has SPF 20 is just an added bonus.  It looks great on my 50 yr. old face!  I am going to stock up...this is the best bargain I have received in a long time, and if I could give it more than 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this brand from the \\&quot;About\\&quot; website that offers reviews of just about everything.  I went to Kmart and bought the Light shade because I have very fair skin.  This Almay Smart Shade Anti-Aging Makeup is very inexpensive in comparison to other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got home and tried it on over a primer.  First I was surprised at the white coloring but, using my foundation brush, it smoothed out very quickly and&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;became\\&quot; my second skin (only lovelier).  I&#x27;m 72 and have been looking for a long time for a foundation suitable for mature skin.  Requirements were that it (1) not be cakey, (2) not accentuate wrinkles, (3) evened out skin tone so that there were no red or ruddy areas, (4) had a slight \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it without being greasy or shiny, and (5) allowed blush and contour powder to go on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makeup is just fantastic.  I&#x27;m unloading all my tinted moisturizers, baked foundations, liquid foundations, and powders -- and tidying up my vanity table by making this my daily foundation -- and making life easier.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it cause I did not notice it being a smart shade it was kinda off and the texture of it felt like I had a mask on. I would not recommend this</li>
            <li> Just got this makeup today.  Its goes on lighter and changes to my skin shade within minutes.  I will use the Medium for a while, then switch to the lighter shade as winter set in.  Goes on easily looks natural and not made up.  Just love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it did not match my skin color at all but I thought it was something else. I just did not like it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, goes on smoothly but did not last.  Preferred the smart shade anti aging concealer.  Would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love Almay products. This foundation is light and does not feel like you have makeup on. Is good for the skin too!</li>
            <li> i love this foundation!!!</li>
            <li> I switched from mac to this. Mac made me break out and made my skin look terrible, this product really helps with sensitive skin and won&#x27;t give you breakouts.</li>
            <li> been using this makeup for several years now, perfect skin match, not greasy, goes on smooth. paid $9 at Walmart, this is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while. I really dislike the heavy show-girl make-up look. This product is light weight but, not to worry; it does the job perfectly. It also feels good on the skin. I  live in a warm climate, so heavy make-up would be unattractive and uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve got my money on this one.</li>
            <li> Very light, goes on smooth. My face feels moisturized as well.  But limited available shades means this one converts from a white cream to a pale beige, leaving a &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; cast to my skin.  I have to use finishing powder to keep it from looking chalky.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed because I loved the coverage, the feel, the texture BUT it DOES NOT come in wide range of colors :(  I am a 47 year old latina (olive skin) I tried the darkest shade and it was still way too pale.</li>
            <li> The automatic shade formula takes the guess work out of trying to figure out what color will match your complexion. It blends into my skin and smooths out my freckles. This makeup is light and does seem to blend in with the heat of my body? It seems like magic to me. This great little anti aging makeup does just what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not I really a foundation person but this is this type of foundation is awesome.Its light with good coverage and it blends well with your skin color.</li>
            <li> This comes out of the tube as white cream and develops an almost invisible base color in minutes.  Not sure how it works.  It won&#x27;t cover all imperfections, but using concealer and mineral or other powder over it provides a great look that for me lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that it is &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; in terms of color matching.  It&#x27;s white in the tube, but after smoothing it on, it adapts to your skin color and even enhances it.  Now, the bad side.  It is VERY drying.  So drying that it shows every tiny to every large wrinkle.  It makes your skin look older.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time - or at least an earlier version of it, so when the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; makeup I bought a couple of weeks ago turned my face clown white, I thought it was just that the little beads of color that appear to be suspended in a lighter fluid had all settle to the bottom.  That used to be a common problem and it was easily correctable with a little patience and a little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this time.  I have spent almost two weeks trying to get the color to change to something approximating what it&#x27;s supposed to be, propping it up on end, trying to shake color down toward the opening of the tube.  No luck.  Still clown-face white.  What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it today with something from the drugstore I hope works better.  It certainly couldn&#x27;t be worse.</li>
            <li> This product produced an orange tint on my face. It&#x27;s to bad because otherwise it had nice coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this make-up. I have a light tan on my face so the color is perfect. This makeup is moisturizing without being too oily and has a medium coverage which I like. I do shake the makeup before squirting it out so it doesn&#x60;t come out streaky.</li>
            <li> Love and have used a very long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I was surprised when I saw it come out of the tube but it&#x27;s perfect on my face.  I have never had good results with foundation makeups, even very expensive ones.  I have always had breakouts and irritation.  Not with this, it&#x27;s perfect.  I&#x27;m in my 70s and it&#x27;s nice to smooth out the color and brighten my skin.  I have already recommended it to a good friend of mine so that she can try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years. It works well for me. Thecolor trly does conform to my complexion. A good buy.</li>
