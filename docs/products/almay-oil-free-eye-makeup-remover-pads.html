    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>This product is great at removing mascara at the end of the day and it does not burn or irritate.  </li>
            <li>I wear contacts and this is great for my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t cause flaky pieces.</li>
            <li>I use a fair amount of eye make-up and this does the job well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and loved this product before&#x27;.</li>
            <li>As the bottle mentions, it is not oily, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling great, very clean, not oily or still made-up feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried several eye makeup removers, and this product is one of the best values.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to get the oil free kind because otherwise your eyesight will be blurry.</li>
            <li>many makeup removers have coconut oil in them which causes infections in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover because it isn&#x27;t greasy or slimy like some others.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because it contains more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It smells so strongly of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have used this item for several years now and am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses daily, so this is a great product for me.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li>And what is with the 100% fragrance free line?</li>
            <li>My Clean &amp; Clear Soothing Eye Makeup Remover ran out and I needed more eye makeup remover,(2)</li>
            <li>Its viscosity is very water-like, so it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>When I do wear liquid eyeliner (non-waterproof) and/or kohl, it comes off very neatly and easily.</li>
            <li>This container is also larger that of than most comparable removers, so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite type for a long time, and the convenience of having it shipped is a small but awesome thing.</li>
            <li>It does not make me feel oily and it is a clean finish, but it does sting my eyes a whole lot.</li>
            <li>This is the only eye makeup remover that I love.</li>
            <li>It smells so so much like alcohol!  </li>
            <li>When i used it for the first time, I literally thought it was nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>When I first opened this bottle of eye makeup remover I got a whiff of it and thought \\&quot;yucch, could this be spoiled\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>I BINGED on the internet and saw that there are many people with the same symptoms after using.</li>
            <li>This can really ruin your eyes!</li>
            <li>because when you use it, its exactly how it feels like, you&#x60;re putting nail polish remover on your eyes, it really smells like nail polish</li>
            <li>I wear a moderate amount and it takes it off just fine.</li>
            <li>Removes all of my eye makeup gently with no smearing all over my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it says : \\&quot;gentle eye make up</li>
            <li>Even to this day i&#x27;m very paranoid that i am using nail polish remover on my eyes...</li>
            <li>product works great!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was FAST from these folks.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is something I will continue to buy over again.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t gentle.</li>
            <li>, you have to really rub it against your skin for it to remove your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I agree with many of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I think I am going to have to try a different brand since it does not seem to be as good as their previous formula.</li>
            <li>I had to read the label and make sure i did not wipe my eye down with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>It was decently priced at Target.</li>
            <li>Since I bought it I have checked reviews on various forums and most people had the same issues as me.</li>
            <li>I tried another remover recently (Neutrogena) and was more than ecstatic to go back to Almay.</li>
            <li>I ignored the negative reviews thinking &#x27;I know better!</li>
            <li>I suppose a silver lining is that it produces fumes so noxious, you could get high off of them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It say&#x27;s its good for sensitive skin, but it burned the skin around my eyes, and is still raw 24 hours later.</li>
            <li>When you need to fix something and reapply liner or shadow, the new makeup goes over/on with no problem.</li>
            <li>I am surprised they have not had legal action yet.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They probably were rated #1 based on their old formulation.</li>
            <li>How can an eye makeup remover that is supposed to be gentle cause such stinging.</li>
            <li>I have since switched back to my regular brands which are a bit more expensive but \\&quot;easy on the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really DONE trying new makeup removers, I&#x27;ll just stick to a slightly more expensive drugstore product that actually works...rather than rip out my eyelashes and cause puffy/watery eyes.</li>
            <li>oil free makeup remover liquid oil is not very good</li>
            <li>I generally purchased the ones in the container already moistened with the makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I could not even clear my eyes enough to read or watch tv in the evening.</li>
            <li>This product does not seem to remove as much makeup as my other pads.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of eye makeup, but previously the moistened pads removed the makeup very well.</li>

            <li> This stuff takes A REALLY long time of soaking your eyes in order to take off product..</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell bad; I&#x27;d say it has a very light flowery smell, even though it is supposed to be unscented.</li>
            <li> Watering, stinging, film on the eyes, glued shut in the morning, eyelids dry and irritated, and a total red eye gooey mess in the morning.</li>
            <li> It DOES, however, causes your eyes to burn and dry up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes/skin dry out.</li>
            <li> They were pretty thin though, so you had to use 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> I still wake up with partial raccoon eye.</li>
            <li> I never knew that \\&quot;nourishes and soothes skin with aloe, cucumber, and green tea\\&quot; translates to, \\&quot;wipe here and burn your eyes with what obviously smells like alcohol and wall</li>
            <li> It did not remove my eye makeup very well at all and even worse it stung my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Almay Oil-Free Makeup Remover for almost a year and have no real complaints.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does sting a bit if it gets in your eyes, but it&#x27;s only for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other eye makeup removers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A completely waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The product smells like alcohol and really stings the eyes bad.</li>
            <li> As with the other reviewers I found that not only did it smell bad</li>
            <li> This eye make up remover is SO terrible, I had to check the label 3 times to make sure I wasnt dumb and thinking it was eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> and my bottle is really hard to squeeze because it&#x27;s made of hard hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> I figured that it probably wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;spoiled\\&quot; and decided I would at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Not good for the price</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad because it is definitely affordable and unfortunately, all the Almay eye remover that I have seen lately says oil-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers hate this one (PS, 14/17</li>
            <li> This was the worse experience with an eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve had to date.  </li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed once I could badly open my eyes after using it.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> double checked to see if there wasn&#x27;t any alcohol in that horrible product because of the smell and the sensation on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Scary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awful makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t remove anything and leaves you with crying</li>
            <li> but stinging one&#x27;s eyes is very wrong.</li>
            <li> Three reasons why I purchased this bottle: (1)</li>
            <li> probably on sale because this is a HORRIBLE product that they cannot sell.  </li>
            <li> Terrible</li>
            <li> This product is simply horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has been my favorite type for a long time, and the convenience of having it shipped is a small but awesome thing. It leaves skin feeling great, very clean, not oily or still made-up feeling. I use a fair amount of eye make-up and this does the job well.</li>
            <li> ask and I came cleansing oil free makeup remover liquid oil is not very good</li>
            <li> I have used this item for several years now and am really happy with it. I wear contact lenses daily, so this is a great product for me. I just wish I could find it at one of my local retail stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye makeup removers, and this product is one of the best values. I have sensitive skin and I have never had an issue using this product. This container is also larger that of than most comparable removers, so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> 100% fragrance fee? NO! NONONONONO! It smells like nail polish and acrylic paint. It also doesn&#x27;t even work for eyeliner. All it does is wipe away eye shadow. AND its sticky. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This eye make up remover is SO terrible, I had to check the label 3 times to make sure I wasnt dumb and thinking it was eye makeup remover when its not. All this will remove is possibly eye shadow. Forget liner or mascara, thats not even water proof. So here i am with olive oil on my eyes because this product wouldnt get it off. save the time, money and frustration and skip this one.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye makeup remover that I love. Removes all of my eye makeup gently with no smearing all over my face. And yes it takes off my mascara, eyeliner and everything. I think it&#x27;s great! I only use cotton balls for application.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are still inflamed several hours after I used this product. It stung my eyes and would not remove the mascara from my lashes. I am sorry I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s oil free so there isn&#x27;t any smearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it says : \\&quot;gentle eye make up remover.\\&quot; but I think they meant \\&quot;nail polish remover\\&quot; because when you use it, its exactly how it feels like, you&#x60;re putting nail polish remover on your eyes, it really smells like nail polish and I was very disappointed once I could badly open my eyes after using it. My eyes were burning I had to wash my face. There&#x60;s no oil but there&#x60;s a lot of alcohol on it. And also doesn&#x60;t work. A completely waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a coupon...probably on sale because this is a HORRIBLE product that they cannot sell.  This stuff takes A REALLY long time of soaking your eyes in order to take off product.. It smells so so much like alcohol!  In fact, I think it might just be rubbing alcohol..  It burns and makes my eyes water.. and my bottle is really hard to squeeze because it&#x27;s made of hard hard plastic.  I&#x27;m really DONE trying new makeup removers, I&#x27;ll just stick to a slightly more expensive drugstore product that actually works...rather than rip out my eyelashes and cause puffy/watery eyes.</li>
            <li> Some people on here say that it doesn&#x27;t work but maybe they are wearing a ton of makeup. I wear a moderate amount and it takes it off just fine. You&#x27;ve got to get the oil free kind because otherwise your eyesight will be blurry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take all of the make-up off my eyes, even if I use like 2-3 cotton balls. I still wake up with partial raccoon eye.</li>
            <li> I ignored the negative reviews thinking &#x27;I know better! I&#x27;ve used and loved this product before&#x27;. Don&#x27;t be me. It appears that they have changed the formula from something that would get rid of my eye makeup to something that would get rid of my eyesight. I suppose a silver lining is that it produces fumes so noxious, you could get high off of them.</li>
            <li> Purchased because I wanted to try a new remover other than my usual, and it was very decently priced at Target. When i used it for the first time, I literally thought it was nail polish remover. It smells so strongly of alcohol. I had to read the label and make sure i did not wipe my eye down with nail polish remover. Even to this day i&#x27;m very paranoid that i am using nail polish remover on my eyes...&lt;br /&gt;As for removing, it does work well. It does not make me feel oily and it is a clean finish, but it does sting my eyes a whole lot. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other eye makeup removers.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this.</li>
            <li> This product is great at removing mascara at the end of the day and it does not burn or irritate.  It also has no oily residue with which to contend.  I bought several bottles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wipe off waterproof make-up AND it stings like nobody&#x27;s business when you wipe your lids with it. Want red, teary eyes? Then Almay is for you. There&#x27;s no way that this is the \\&quot;#1 recommended brand\\&quot;. I would rather throw this bottle away and go back to the Target Up-and-Up waterproof make-up remover. DON&#x27;T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND STAY AWAY FROM ALMAY&#x27;S MAKE-UP REMOVER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awful makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t remove anything and leaves you with crying eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I double checked to see if there wasn&#x27;t any alcohol in that horrible product because of the smell and the sensation on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Does not remove mascara well at all.  Burns my eyes. Terrible</li>
            <li> Still have eye makeup on my face after use and you have to scrub your face to get it to work.  Not good for the price</li>
            <li> I think Almay has discontinued this item.  darn.&lt;br /&gt;So many makeup removers have coconut oil in them which causes infections in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was FAST from these folks.</li>
            <li> Three reasons why I purchased this bottle: (1) My Clean &amp; Clear Soothing Eye Makeup Remover ran out and I needed more eye makeup remover,(2) The bottle said \\&quot;#1 Brand in America, and (3) It was decently priced at Target.I only need one reason never to buy this again: IT SUCKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the product does not seem to leave any greasy residue around the eyes so I give it credit for stating that. It DOES, however, causes your eyes to burn and dry up. And what is with the 100% fragrance free line? I never knew that \\&quot;nourishes and soothes skin with aloe, cucumber, and green tea\\&quot; translates to, \\&quot;wipe here and burn your eyes with what obviously smells like alcohol and wall paint.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product twice and will probably use the remaining liquid as lighter fluid for summer BBQs! STAY AWAY PEOPLE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR EYES.</li>
            <li> I have used Almay makeup remover pads for years. I generally purchased the ones in the container already moistened with the makeup remover. I do not recall it ever saying oil-free. I ran out and thought I would buy this bottle and just use it with some of cotton pads I had already purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think after using this product, Almay may have created a different formulation. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of eye makeup, but previously the moistened pads removed the makeup very well. They were pretty thin though, so you had to use 2 or 3. This product does not seem to remove as much makeup as my other pads. The smell is definitely medicinal, but I never had any eye irritation when using it. As the bottle mentions, it is not oily, so that&#x27;s good. Waterproof mascara seemed more difficult to remove with this product. I think I am going to have to try a different brand since it does not seem to be as good as their previous formula. That&#x27;s too bad because it is definitely affordable and unfortunately, all the Almay eye remover that I have seen lately says oil-free. They probably were rated #1 based on their old formulation.</li>
            <li> I used this product just twice and had to throw it away. A complete waste of money. It did not remove my eye makeup very well at all and even worse it stung my eyes. Being ineffective is one thing but stinging one&#x27;s eyes is very wrong. Since I bought it I have checked reviews on various forums and most people had the same issues as me. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover because it isn&#x27;t greasy or slimy like some others. I wear contacts and this is great for my eyes because it doesn&#x27;t cause flaky pieces. It works very well and is something I will continue to buy over again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at a health food store (not on Amazon), but I feel it warrants a review.  I agree with many of the other reviewers.  This was the worse experience with an eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve had to date.  I was excited to try it because it contains more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.  However it has a cloudy, greasy film that coats the eye upon application and results in irritation.  It does remove eye makeup, but not without some effort.</li>
            <li> If you want to sting your eyes, buy this! And it doesn&#x27;t remove mascara well. Who awarded them with the no. 1 makeup remover? Yukkkk! I just trashed it. Everytime I use it, I have to run to the shower to wash my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this bottle of eye makeup remover I got a whiff of it and thought \\&quot;yucch, could this be spoiled\\&quot;? I figured that it probably wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;spoiled\\&quot; and decided I would at least give it a try. As with the other reviewers I found that not only did it smell bad it wasn&#x27;t gentle. I had to wash my eyes out with water several times to remove the sting. I have since switched back to my regular brands which are a bit more expensive but \\&quot;easy on the eyes\\&quot; (and don&#x27;t stink).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Almay Oil-Free Makeup Remover for almost a year and have no real complaints. I tried another remover recently (Neutrogena) and was more than ecstatic to go back to Almay. I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers hate this one (PS, 14/17 1-star reviews are not Amazon Verified Purchases where as 1/1 4-star and 5/6 5-star reviews ARE, as of my review). Yes, it does sting a bit if it gets in your eyes, but it&#x27;s only for a few seconds. It definitely doesn&#x27;t smell bad; I&#x27;d say it has a very light flowery smell, even though it is supposed to be unscented. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes/skin dry out. Its viscosity is very water-like, so it&#x27;s easy to use. When you need to fix something and reapply liner or shadow, the new makeup goes over/on with no problem. I usually only wear non-waterproof mascara, and this remover works fantastically to remove every bit of it. When I do wear liquid eyeliner (non-waterproof) and/or kohl, it comes off very neatly and easily. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is simply horrible. It doesn&#x27;t remove eyeliner or waterproof mascara. It say&#x27;s its good for sensitive skin, but it burned the skin around my eyes, and is still raw 24 hours later. Will not be using again.</li>
            <li> This product was TERRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled like alcohol as soon as you open the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Also, you have to really rub it against your skin for it to remove your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend the neutrogena one. It&#x27;s like a couple bucks more expensive but it actually works.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; almay promise on their products. This remover STINGS, then your eyes will get a film over them even after you rinse them out. I could not even clear my eyes enough to read or watch tv in the evening. Woke up with my eyes glued shut practically. Saw the eye doc and she said it was conjunctivitis. I did not relate it to the almay yet. I thought it was seasonal allergies or viral infection. Eyes cleared up, used the product again and same thing. Watering, stinging, film on the eyes, glued shut in the morning, eyelids dry and irritated, and a total red eye gooey mess in the morning. I BINGED on the internet and saw that there are many people with the same symptoms after using. The product smells like alcohol and really stings the eyes bad. How can an eye makeup remover that is supposed to be gentle cause such stinging. I am surprised they have not had legal action yet. This can really ruin your eyes! Scary.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye makeup remover. It is not greasy and removes my eye makeup well. I would not try to use it with waterproof mascara.</li>
