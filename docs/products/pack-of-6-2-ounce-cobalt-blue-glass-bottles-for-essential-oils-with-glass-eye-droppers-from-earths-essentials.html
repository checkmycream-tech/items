            <li>I almost bought a different brand with good reviews, but all those reviews warned that the eyedropper does not.. um.. &amp;#34;inhale&amp;#34; completely (only about 1/4 of the way.&amp;#34; This brand of bottles have a great suction, so I&#x27;m glad I stuck with Earth&#x27;s Essentials.</li>

            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I like the size because I don&#x27;t need to mix large quantities of a particular blend at once.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The glass bottle is fine.  I received a different eye dropper than in the photo, which seems to be the standard for the supplier I chose.</li>
            <li> Love the cobalt blue color of these sturdy bottles. I bought these for myself and to give as gifts with carrier oils and essential oils. They worked out perfect.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and arrived promptly. Thank you</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly...very convenient - and NOT PLASTIC - YAY!</li>
            <li> Love them.  Exactly like promised.  High quality.  I am planning to order these again because I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I bought these dropper bottles to dispense a herbal oil under my tongue. It works great and now I won&#x27;t have to guess how much I&#x27;m taking in.</li>
            <li> Item works well. Glass bottle and glass dropper. Would buy again in the future if I need to.</li>
            <li> Bottles are fine. No breakage on arrival. I did NOT receive the funnel, which makes it difficult to fill.</li>
            <li> The bottles are an excellent value.</li>
            <li> These are quite large but are great for making large amount of essential oil mixtures, i.e. Lavender and Olive Oil for my 3yr old son.</li>

            <li> The bottles were perfect for my perpose.  They arrived in good shape and were packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;The glass is nice and thick so they are not so fragile as other I have had.</li>
            <li> Beautiful blue and love that the dropper is glass too. I use these for all kinda of oils. It&#x27;s great for distributing a few drops of yummy toasted sesame oil instead of dribbling too much from the jar. I shared them with friends who are equally pleased. They arrived quickly and we&#x27;re carefully packed too.</li>
            <li> Good quality of glass.  The droppers work very well. All-in-all, I love using them for my oils.</li>
            <li> These are great. I made my own sinus drops in these beautiful little bottles.</li>

Clean, small, everything arrived intact. Releases droplets when held without me having to squeeze the bulb. Not sure if this is a bad thing, but I appreciate it when only a drop of something (like tea tree oil) is required. Bottles feel lighter and more fragile than I expected, but solid once they are filled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also went with this because they made sure to state their bulbs are non rubber, which apparently melt from essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using my oils almost every day now, and the whole process is much cleaner and more streamlined because of these bottles.</li>
            <li> Great bottles - will buy again when I need some</li>
            <li> So pretty. Yes the bulb is weak and doesn&#x27;t pull much. That seems to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> Great quality bottles. I mix my EO in these with carrier oils</li>
            <li> These 2 ounce cobalt blue glass bottles with eye droppers arrived very well packaged and cushioned in bubble wrap.  The eye droppers are perfect for controlling the amount dispensed.  Prevents waste of product.  I use them for combinations of essential and carrier oils.  I like the size because I don&#x27;t need to mix large quantities of a particular blend at once.  Everything stays fresh.  I prefer this blue color over the amber colors offered in similar bottles.  Would like to find other dark colors such as purple, evergreen, and dark wine.  Then, I could group my concoctions by category / purpose:  face, body, scalp, hair, etc.</li>
            <li> Glass dropper and bottle. The dropper does not reach the bottom of bottle nor does it have a measuring guide. Cap does provide a seal. Dark blue protects from light but opaque enough to see level of contents.</li>
            <li> Great bottles. Perfect for essential oils.</li>
            <li> The bottles are perfect for my oils. I received this order in less than a week. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> arrived on time but two were broken</li>
            <li> I just received my cobalt blue glass bottles. They came faster than anticipated. They&#x27;re a deep cobalt blue and very good quality. They&#x27;re exactly what I need for my essential oils and I love that the eye dropper is glass too. I would recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> Bottles are exactly as described and as they appear in photos.</li>
            <li> Perfect for get the correct number of drops of oils from the bottle.  Have transferred some of my carrier oils so that I don&#x27;t end up with more thanks I want.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Good bottle and they do what you expect them to do</li>
