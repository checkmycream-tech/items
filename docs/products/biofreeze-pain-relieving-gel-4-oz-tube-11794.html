            <li>It&#x27;s the best.  </li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>The roll on is great, but the tube allows thicker application with increased benefit.</li>
            <li>I like this product it dose a great job of relieving my joint pains before and after my workout.</li>
            <li>Price is great</li>
            <li>It is great for sore muscles after exercising or muscle sprains .</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it very effective.</li>
            <li>I deal with chronic pain from a car accident over 15 years ago, and biofr4eeze is amazing!</li>
            <li>My daughter a nurse told me about biofreeze and alot of people talked about it, and said it was good.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>MERCHANT DELIVERED AS PROMISED, WELL PLEASED.</li>
            <li>I love biofreeze, and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and am able to sleep.</li>
            <li>so i had to get more.</li>
            <li>love this product, but purchased disposable gloves to apply so my fingers don&#x27;t get the product on them.  </li>
            <li>It works better than than my prescription lidocaine ointment and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I love Biofreeze,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to head some off like that.  </li>
            <li>And it is more costly</li>
            <li>its awesome natural and REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>mostly pain free.</li>
            <li>The product itself is excellent and all that I expected.</li>
            <li>But being a gel it can be slippery when warmed on the hand and slipoff easily before getting a chance to apply it to another surface on the body, i.e the shoulder .</li>
            <li>I am happy with this purchase, but next time will probably order the roll on just because it&#x27;s easier to put on.</li>
            <li>My order was processed and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>And Biofreeze, I have found ,is as effective as the other creams, but not any more so.</li>
            <li>but Tiger Balm is also worth a try.</li>
            <li>i love this gel been using it for years, since my first knee replacement, just had my right knee done and was running low</li>
            <li>Through all of that, BioFreeze gives me pretty decent and quick relief.</li>
            <li>BioFreeze works quite well, but I personally prefer Tiger Balm a bit better.</li>
            <li>it was better that the pain creams you can get from but most retailers, but I&#x27;m not sure I would spend my money on another tube .</li>
            <li>Overall BioFreeze is a good product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with any chronic pain or for temporary soreness or sprains-</li>
            <li>IT IS GREAT FOR SORE TIRED MUSCLES OR TO USE ALONG WITH AN ULTRASOUND UNIT.  </li>
            <li>and it really relieved it.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>Biofreeze works fine on minor aches and pains for me associated with aging.</li>
            <li>The gel tends to squirt out a little more than I really want at a time.</li>
            <li>I find that Tiger Balm lasts slightly longer than BioFreeze (on my body and in the jar), however BioFreeze rubs in more and leaves less of a greasy texture, though you need more of it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products for my cranky aging (over 65 and arthritic) body that I try to keep moving as much as I can - this is my fall back.  </li>
            <li>First tried this product when I was going to physical therapy 3 days a week.  </li>
            <li>This gel is magic for helping sore joints and muscles, but the roll on is easier to use than this gel, by a small margin.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;t take the pain away completely, but it makes the pain easier to put up with</li>
            <li>They both smell poorly, but they both work really nicely.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell and the constant reapplying, the deep and lasting pain relief is really good.</li>
            <li>The biggest negative I have at all is the strong, menthol smell.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this product.  It works great.  My order was processed and shipped quickly and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED BIOFREEZE IN THE PAST.  IT IS GREAT FOR SORE TIRED MUSCLES OR TO USE ALONG WITH AN ULTRASOUND UNIT.  MERCHANT DELIVERED AS PROMISED, WELL PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I deal with chronic pain from a car accident over 15 years ago, and biofr4eeze is amazing! It helps me get through my day mostly pain free. Sore muscles relax, and you can get on with your day.</li>
            <li> I love biofreeze, and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail. I was shocked to see that it had been opened and used when I got it even though it was listed as new.</li>
            <li> My previous review was submitted by accident thinking it was for another order. This shipper was excellent. Did a wonderful prompt job of getting this product out to me. The product itself is excellent and all that I expected. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is an excellent pain reliever.  I had bad sciatica and back pain and it really relieved it.  I put it on at night and am able to sleep.</li>
            <li> First tried this product when I was going to physical therapy 3 days a week.  I am still using it to this day, almost 2 years later.</li>
            <li> If you have sore muscles, this is the product for you.  Very soothing. Goes on in a gel formula, and&lt;br /&gt;heats up to work on your pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to releive pail in my back and knee.  My daughter a nurse told me about biofreeze and alot of people talked about it, and said it was good.  So I ordered a tube and put it to work.  I have a very bad back and need to have an operation on it, but it did help the pain.  It does&#x27;t take the pain away completely, but it makes the pain easier to put up with</li>
            <li> i love this gel been using it for years, since my first knee replacement, just had my right knee done and was running low so i had to get more. great product</li>
            <li> My doctor recommend this but I didn&#x27;t find it very effective.</li>
            <li> love this product, but purchased disposable gloves to apply so my fingers don&#x27;t get the product on them.  I want my muscles to get the benefit, not my fingers.  The roll on is great, but the tube allows thicker application with increased benefit.</li>
            <li> I suffer some sever back pain. I attend physical therapy, chiropractors, and pain management. I get trigger point injections, I use electrical stimulation, acupuncture, and an infinite amount of pills, creams, and patches. Through all of that, BioFreeze gives me pretty decent and quick relief. The biggest negative I have at all is the strong, menthol smell. Also, compared to other pain relieving gels, it requires quite a bit of product to cover surface area. If you can get past the smell and the constant reapplying, the deep and lasting pain relief is really good. It works better than than my prescription lidocaine ointment and lasts longer. The only product I can compare BioFreeze to is Tiger Balm. BioFreeze works quite well, but I personally prefer Tiger Balm a bit better. They both smell poorly, but they both work really nicely. I find that Tiger Balm lasts slightly longer than BioFreeze (on my body and in the jar), however BioFreeze rubs in more and leaves less of a greasy texture, though you need more of it. Overall BioFreeze is a good product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with any chronic pain or for temporary soreness or sprains- but Tiger Balm is also worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love Biofreeze, my sports dr got me hooked on it years ago. i always share with friends. works on all muscles and even hands that are sore.</li>
            <li> This gel is magic for helping sore joints and muscles, but the roll on is easier to use than this gel, by a small margin. I am happy with this purchase, but next time will probably order the roll on just because it&#x27;s easier to put on. The gel tends to squirt out a little more than I really want at a time.</li>
            <li> I like this product it dose a great job of relieving my joint pains before and after my workout. Not too smelly.</li>
            <li> I have used Biofreeze Pain relieving Gel for a grab and run instant pain relief for years.  I have tried many other products for my cranky aging (over 65 and arthritic) body that I try to keep moving as much as I can - this is my fall back.  It&#x27;s the best.  I don&#x27;t like taking pills unless I have to.  I also dab a bit of it on my temples and the back of my neck when I feel one of my migraines coming on.  I&#x27;ve been able to head some off like that.  I bought a bunch of it this time so I won&#x27;t run out!  I get mine on line from Amazon.com so it&#x27;s here in a flash when I order it and always in stock.  Price is great and I hate shopping anyway!  If I can&#x27;t do it on line I usually try and con someone else into doing it for me.</li>
            <li> It actually relieved my pain for brief periods of time . it was better that the pain creams you can get from but most retailers, but I&#x27;m not sure I would spend my money on another tube . It is great for sore muscles after exercising or muscle sprains . I ordered it for fibromyalgia and its simply too expensive for daily use..</li>
            <li> Biofreeze works fine on minor aches and pains for me associated with aging. I am 74. But being a gel it can be slippery when warmed on the hand and slipoff easily before getting a chance to apply it to another surface on the body, i.e the shoulder . Other creams do not do this. And Biofreeze, I have found ,is as effective as the other creams, but not any more so. And it is more costly so I am staying with the creams.</li>
