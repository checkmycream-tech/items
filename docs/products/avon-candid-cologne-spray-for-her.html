            <li>Lacks that &amp;#34;catch-you-in-the-throat&amp;#34; quality of many scents.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to purchase it through Avon</li>
            <li>As many women can identify a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; that their mothers or grandmothers always wore and immediately experience a Flashback to the comfort and embrace of a time gone by...</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it, it brings back all those wonderful memories!  </li>
            <li>so thank you, Amazon, for making it available to me again!</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for any years.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume from Avon love it</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments from wearing this.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume; I&#x27;ve been wearing it since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>It is a very light, woody, sweet fragrence, that I will miss, but am happy Amazon has it available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Yes thanks all is good</li>
            <li>I have used Avon Candid cologne spray ever since it was first introduced by Avon.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to buy and was shipped quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t fine the cologne at Avon anymore</li>
            <li>I received my package 2 days after my order was confirmed.</li>
            <li>It is light but not too ethereal.</li>
            <li>Strong and sultry at first but lightens to an inviting scent that is not insulting to the senses.  </li>
            <li>And fast!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clean floral</li>
            <li>I ALSO GET COMPLIMENTS FROM EVERY ONE DAILY ABOUT THE CLEAN FRESH  PLEASANT AROMA I HAVE ON.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a sweet floral scent.</li>
            <li>NO BAD AFFECTS FOR ME</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been asked at te super market what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE USED CANDID COLOGNE SPRAY FOR EVER, AND NO OTHER COLOGNES PERIOD.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent  of Avon Candid Cologne spray so much that I wanted to order extra&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This particular scent is light and fresh smelling.it doesn&#x27;t over power your senses.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super super fast..</li>
            <li>A decent scent that I bought for my mom who wanted a light fragrance for summer.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and delivery was faster than I had imagined.</li>
            <li>Smelled pretty good, but the scent did not last very long.</li>
            <li>so I am very upset over this.  </li>
            <li>absolutely order again when I run out....</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Its light and lasts long.</li>
            <li>It is the only cologne I can wear that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache and the fragrance is light and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Candid for decades, like others, and when I figured out Avon was discontinuing it, first I got angry, then I stocked up at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this Cologne, light but a little floral, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to me when my son was born (now 37 years old).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle yet sexy.</li>
            <li>.....now I will have to scavenger for it, and I know that unless Avon brings it back I will have to find a new scent....</li>
            <li>It appears Avon is bringing it back, at least for awhile, but the Amazon price is much better.</li>
            <li>Avon once again proves to be a solid choice at a price that doesn&#x27;t leave your wallet empty</li>

            <li> the fragrance is so good</li>
            <li> Started using this scent around 1970, I believe. Has always been my fav...always will. It is light but not too ethereal. Lacks that &amp;#34;catch-you-in-the-throat&amp;#34; quality of many scents.</li>
            <li> Took a gamble getting this cologne.  Did not care for it at all.  Donated it in hopes someone might like it.</li>

            <li> Avon has stopped selling this and it&#x27;s the only perfume that doesn&#x27;t agrivate family allergies so I had to have it. Great price even compared to the avon prices. If you like this and can&#x27;t find it get it here. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>

Avon has discontinue this cologne and I had to find it on line, Even though I am still on the &amp;#34;upper side of the grass&amp;#34; my children and grandchildren already mention when the come into the house, that it &#x27;smells like  grama&amp;#34;.....now I will have to scavenger for it, and I know that unless Avon brings it back I will have to find a new scent....It is a very light, woody, sweet fragrence, that I will miss, but am happy Amazon has it available at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love Candid. I&#x27;ve been wearing for years and it&#x27;s the only scent I&#x27;ve ever worn and gotten compliments on.
