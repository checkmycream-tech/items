            <li> I was ordering this for mom who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of options for something like this where she lives. I ordered the item in black from Amazon. It was a lot bigger than I thought, too big, and the handle was scuffed. It seemed decently made but returned because it was too big and it was scuffed.</li>
            <li> Holds all the toiletries I need - good quality</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new case. It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected And very well made. Love it !!!</li>
            <li> This bag is bigger than you&#x27;d expect, and the quality it very outstanding. Very well worth the price. You can tell this bag will last for many years. Obviously built for traveling (a luggage piece) but it&#x27;s so attractive it&#x27;s great for a beauty case! I got this as a gift for my 11 year old niece right before she was going to leave for the airport on a vacation. I was surprised SHE loved it so much she took it with her! Obviously great for all ages!</li>
            <li> I got this in black. It is a perfect size.  Like the old train cases were.  I can fit lots of items like makeup and shampoo, brush and comb, meds, etc.  I like that it is hard not a soft case. Keeps upright and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Inside pocket - one of the snaps doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I order this case omg is nice biger good I loved professional :)</li>
            <li> Small, but made well.</li>
            <li> I love it for around my home, but I can&#x27;t take it on a trip. Not a plane unless you use it as a carry on. It does not fold up. But I love it at home or travel in the car. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> VERY cute bag.  Its perfect for travel or those small trips... totally recommend</li>
            <li> I really liked this when I saw it online, but when I actually got it, I LOVE IT!! It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it would be and I can fit all my stuff inside! I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Case is cumbersome and edges began fraying almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This  cosmetic bag is a nice size. Perfect for all  my makeup .The case came in navy blue. I wish the inside was a dark color instead of beige .</li>
            <li> A good buy for the price, looks very nice. Like the inside design with the elastic straps to hold bottles upright. Zippers are a little tight but will probably loosen with use. Not crazy about the rings for the lock in the front since I never lock mine and the small little padlock that was included did not lock at all. Otherwise I am quite satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It looks so classy. It&#x27;s very roomy.&lt;br /&gt;I do not leave home without it !</li>
            <li> Well  made and a bargain.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  It looks great..has lots of storage..  But now I&#x27;m waiting to use it!</li>
            <li> I was delighted by how good this case looked when it arrived. It&#x27;s much better made than I expected and looks very stylish. I think I&#x27;ll be getting many good years of use for this case.</li>

            <li> Great make up travel case.  Just the type I was trying to find to replace a case I had used for years.</li>
            <li> I use it to hold my grooming clippers (both large for full body clipping and the smaller trimmer for feet and face), blades, scissors, oil for the clipper, cool down spray for the blades, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even store my nail care stuff in there too. The dremmel tool, all the different and extra sanding drums, charger for it, styptic powder, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now can have all my stuff for my four furkids (other people call them dogs) stored in one place. No more having to hunt for each thing and wondering where all the items were put.</li>
            <li> Love that idea just 2 inch to big looks nice hope it last</li>
            <li> Love this! The only thing I dont like is that the mirror is too small.</li>
