            <li>I just love ,my elecriic tooth brush and my teeth</li>
            <li>have never felt better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>and they feel like they&#x27;re doing more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this for more than a year with no damage caused to the handle unit.    </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a sonic care for many years.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product before the cost is better than what I could pay for this product in the store.</li>
            <li>Love it because it forces me to brush correctly.  </li>
            <li>Love my sonicare.</li>
            <li>We love &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived 3 days after order and we are completely pleased.</li>
            <li>They are much better than the WalMart and Target home brands.  </li>
            <li>believe that higher-end Sonicare models do a better job in being watertight in the brushheads, but the Essence models have to be cleaned with care.</li>
            <li>Would be better if each replacement head had changeable color codes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the sonic e series toothbrush for many years now</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Most stores want 22.00-28.00 dollars for 1 head.</li>
            <li>Love my sonic and love amazon....</li>
            <li>I love my phillips sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare tooth brush for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>I wish more products would be packaged in this way.</li>
            <li>They are WAY better than the Equate knock-offs from Walmart.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t seal the lower gap, because they need to be able to spin there for you to screw the heads on and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sonicare since the inception - I love it.  </li>
            <li>The price is much better here than - &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>So, that&#x27;s the part I love.</li>
            <li>We have enjoyed all of our experience with the sonicare line of products.</li>
            <li>We have used the Sonicare HX7002/30 for many years recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am okay with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>i wood recommend this product and purchase some more.</li>
            <li>Love it being delivered on autoship.  </li>
            <li>Been using the brush heads for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>Go for the free S&amp;H if you can find it!</li>
            <li>They should make better gaskets to seal the water out.</li>
            <li>You will love how your teeth feel after using these to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Newer one is better.  </li>
            <li>Still, these things are much better then manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>This seller had just what I needed at a good price, plus the shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li>With gas prices on the rise, I so appreciate Amazon&#x27;s flawless performance in providing a service directly to my home that I can depend on for this particular item as well as others for a fair, and do-able price.  </li>
            <li>This brush head makes my teeth feel very clean, resulting in my brushing more than twice a day</li>
            <li>They stimilate the gums and give your teeth a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>as expected - perfect for smiley white teeth :D</li>
            <li>Here at Amazon, you get a good deal and really fast service!</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, there is a surprising difference in the way the heads made for the Sonicare vibrate at a seemingly higher frequency than the knock-off versions.</li>
            <li>The brushheads also seem to go out of shape much more easily.</li>
            <li>I am glad to get the brush refills easily</li>
            <li>Great service, exactly as advertised, quick delivery , cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li>So excited that this is such a great bargain !!</li>
            <li>The replacement brush&#x27;s are ok, but they don&#x27;t fit like the originals that came with the Sonicare Brush.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find them at such a good price.</li>
            <li>this was a better price than available at the stores.  </li>
            <li>I have perfectly and work as expected.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and good replacements, so</li>
            <li>always trust Amazon.com to send me the real thing, at a good price, in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>good price and fast service</li>
            <li>AS GOOD AS THE REAL ONES</li>
            <li>I think I like the frustration-free packaging, and it is more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>They came in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>a brown box is easy to get open.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to purchase the Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li>It was easy to order this product instead of going out to wsste my gas to get it.</li>
            <li>The Subcribe and Save option makes it easy to remember when to replace the heads -</li>
            <li>This product makes it so easy to keep brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>I echo many of the others in saying that Sonicare products are superior to manual brushing in nearly every aspect.</li>
            <li>The silicone will not stick well and will easily turn on the neck, but it still keeps the water out.</li>
            <li>Philips should provide an easy way to identify these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Have had our e-series toothbrushes for about five years and like how easy it is to find replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I brush with a manual toothbrush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean as it does with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it easy to find them.</li>
            <li>Recommend them strongly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend getting the Sonic Seals, and the UV Sanitizer if you purchase these.</li>
            <li>I tried it once and felt the power is really strong, whick viberated my head like an earthquake.</li>
            <li>I have had it repaired and its still going strong.  </li>
            <li>All in all these are really good replacement heads and a decent price at that.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, perfect fit, one in use, other as a backup.</li>
            <li>The Phillips electric tooth brush is very convenient, very effective and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>In short I don&#x27;t mind paying \\&quot;more than I think I should pay\\&quot; for healthy teeth and superior oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>It is OEM quality, perfectly replaces my previous brush heads.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised,  Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The screw on heads are easy to replace and stay secure through the life of the brush.</li>
            <li>I fine this product helpful with my teeth.</li>

            <li>works fine.</li>

            <li>If I have to replacement every three months, that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>They seem to work fine, no problems.  </li>
            <li>Each head comes wrapped in a sealed plastic bag &amp; securely held in a strong cardboard box.</li>
            <li>Buying on line at Amazon is easy and much more economical than driving to the shopping centersl</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes fit my Elite perfectly, and cost a lot less than buying in the store.</li>
            <li>I have used other power brushes this one makes your teeth feel smooth and clean from the best cleaning you have ever had!!!</li>
            <li>fantastic product, &amp; for the seller I like to say thank you for your prompt delivery &amp; for carrying such a great product will be bk for replacements soon.</li>
            <li>+ at Costco on the huge multi-pack.</li>
            <li>They fit my Sonicare toothbrush and the price can&#x27;t be beat on the multi-packs.</li>
            <li>Fit with no issues.  </li>
            <li>They were shipped free in a jiffy.</li>
            <li>They fit.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to use,</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit like a charm.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price I paid for these replacements is a great savings compared to prices in the local stores.</li>
            <li>I consider this to be a great bargain and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it is genuine or not</li>
            <li>It fits in the unit I already have, and it is free from defects.</li>
            <li>Works great in multiple models of phillip sonicare products.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a great price, especially if you do Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t go cheap on this one.</li>
            <li>Order filled correctly.  </li>
            <li>I also like to get the frustration free packaging</li>
            <li>It is worth paying a bit more for the originals.  </li>
            <li>The compact brush heads are great for reaching every surface, even the very back.</li>
            <li>Brushes no longer available.  </li>
            <li>They fit the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Heads fit the Sonicare</li>
            <li>I like the hassle free packaging, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any of the replacement heads I&#x27;ve received</li>
            <li>I use ivory soap body wash to brush my teeth, I have never had whiter plaque free teeth ever..</li>
            <li>these fit well and work well.</li>
            <li>The Frustration Free packaging is also a nice option - so much easier to get at the product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Good price on set, although I may be able to find one with three brush heads for around the same price, with a coupon, elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>These heads have a different look, but fit just fine and do a great job getting the teeth and gums clean</li>
            <li>They are perfect as replacement heads for the crappy heads that originally came with your electronic brush but have much to be desired from a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes as expected and work perfectly for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Quality product, I recently tried out some non name brand heads and it was easy to see how these toothbrush heads stand superior.</li>
            <li>I love you Amazon.com and thanks!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>They work just like the original ones.</li>
            <li>It looks legit but would wish it would came with the original box.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit softer than the original</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t needed to replace them yet because I am still using the original.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find them at this price.</li>
            <li>I think it is unreasonable and unsanitary that this item be re-sold without its original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I now know why you picture the two replacement toothbrushes without being in their original package</li>
            <li>the original toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They are replacement brushes they work just as the original one.</li>
            <li>They seem to clean just as well.</li>
            <li>The Seals, especially will keep things a lot more tidy and save on maintenance.</li>
            <li>Good price on this replacement, especially if you can wait on the free shipping.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>and I like how clean theses brushes clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thinking about how important a clean bright smile is to your health and the person standing in front of you, it only seemed right to spend more on this tool.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for providing the genuine replacements at a nice price in an easy to open box.</li>
            <li>so I knew I had purchased the right product!  </li>
            <li>they will not work right!</li>
            <li>The purchase was great as expected.  </li>
            <li>When you have a sonic tooth brush, you should replace your brushes about every 6 months and finding someplace to buy them at a good price is key.</li>
            <li>And these refillable heads are fairly priced, especially by using the Subscribe &amp; Save program.  </li>
            <li>This was such a good buy, that I ordered 2 sets.  </li>
            <li>There I was able to find an off-brand at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the Oral-B. Let it cool and</li>
            <li>So much so that I thought I would not be able to use it.    </li>
            <li>I can confirm this is true.  </li>
            <li>then it is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Standard tooth brush replacement heads that are well priced and arrived with good attention to packaging so that the heads were undamaged and worked when installed.</li>
            <li>(they still work the same for a while longer; about the time you&#x27;ll find them at a good sale price from Amazon.com (POP)</li>
            <li>It is quiet to use and feels good on the gums.  </li>
            <li>We bought the brushes from Amazon last year and was pleased to know that we could so easily get the replacement heads!</li>
            <li>It is more energetic, and it does not get as moldy where the water does not dry.  </li>
            <li>The brushes were the right size and fit my unit.  </li>
            <li>They fit right on and stay good long after we choose to replace them.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was also quick.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the brush not only cleans my teeth, but makes sure my gums stay in shape as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly as per the shipping estimate.</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t need to replace it as quickly as we did.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Got the product quickly and it saved about 30% from buying them&lt;br /&gt;at</li>
            <li>My past experiences with Sonicare toothbrushes and replacement brushes have all been very good</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and genuine Philips replacement heads.</li>
            <li>We enjoy our experience with amazon.com because they deliver exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>this product, this was my very first purchase of a electric toothbrush Sonicare and boy</li>
            <li>I have an old Sonicare and these replacement brushes are more sleek than the original.</li>
            <li>Large threads make it easy to change and remove for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I always have a new head to assure I am getting a healthy brushing.  </li>
            <li>Have long been a user of Sonicare toothbrushes and have been more than satisfied with performance.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it is clearly not the most elegant system.</li>
            <li>This type is not used as much as newere models, but it works great and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li>For a review on that, it doesnt exactly what you would want- replace your brush head!</li>
            <li>the packaging is clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>To clarify, those are the real deal and work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around cheap and fast way to get replacements, and sign up for the renewal... its cheaper and reminds you to replace your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These fit on my sonicare, which of course is the whole point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that we don&#x27;t have to break the bank to maintain basic oral health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare still works nicely after several years, and I needed replacement heads.</li>
            <li>if you own a e-series buy a couple extra heads.  </li>
            <li>It is just what I ordered and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to come back to these \\&quot;real\\&quot; replacements.</li>
            <li>but it seems worth it.  </li>
            <li>also it is fun</li>
            <li>I needed to replace mine, and getting two in the package was well worth it.</li>
            <li>reduces gum inflammation, well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a whole lot better in cleaning and is much stronger.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare has been worth its weight in gold for me.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>It is over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on.</li>
            <li>Have two more young grandchildren and these</li>
            <li>Worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>And I trust them far more than those non-Sonicare brands who might seem to be a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>Considering you only need to replace the head about 1x a month, seems better  to spend a few more dollars to maximize the benefits of the toothbrush and get the best results possible.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>My Advance tooth brush is an older one and these brush heads work fine with it.</li>
            <li>After checking other local stores, this was the best deal for us for replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads arrived quickly and were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These heads are easy to remove and easy to put on-- twist off and twist back on.</li>
            <li>If you do it right, one tooth at a time</li>
            <li>The Amazon service, through UPS, was right on time and in the right place.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right size for my mouth.</li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging is easy to open.</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes work great and sometimes with the subscribe and save offers, amazon offers a better price than other retailers.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to find this product so easily and avoid paying the ridiculous prices in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li>it is great to get these on a subscription, no more trying to remember when i changed the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>However, with this price you can absolutely afford to change them out more frequently.</li>
            <li>(there is a portable case for using away from home and nice cap to keep brush covered that allows air flow to keep it dry that is included).</li>
            <li>I keep an old brush and use it as a facial tool feels good on my face and under my eyes and eye brows...</li>
            <li>To my surprise, these brush heads fit a very old Sonicare model, from about 1995</li>
            <li>I use these daily and trust they are doing a fine job of keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>The old style was just fine.  </li>
            <li>I received my supposedly \\&quot;new\\&quot; sonicare replacement toothbrushes that were not in the original packaging and had been put in new packaging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any other electric toothbrush, but I&#x27;m pleased with my Sonicare Essence!</li>
            <li>- they usually last 3 months or more...</li>
            <li>We used to buy the replacement heads locally but found Amazon has the best prices even comparing them to the occasional sale locally.</li>
            <li>and much more convenient than buying at the big retailers . . .  </li>
            <li>Replace at regular intervals to get the most out of them.  </li>
            <li>seems to wear off pretty soon after you get it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>will buy some more, actually i signed up for amazon fulfillment.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are smooth and fit perfectly into the base.</li>
            <li>They have never failed me.</li>
            <li>They were insanely loud and felt cheap.</li>
            <li>This was also my first time using the scheduled delivery service, which at least for the first delivery worked great.  </li>
            <li>The heads last a long time, 6-8 months, and when you change them its a great feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper (and much easier to find) on Amazon, plus you can do the 6 month subscription plan and forget about it!  </li>
            <li>Would definately recommend this vendor and product to all interested.</li>
            <li>The brushes work well, but they do not last more than 3 months.  </li>
            <li>so I signed up for auto ship when I was sure they were the proper heads.</li>
            <li>exactly like the one that came from the factory.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I like being able to find low cost replacement heads for my brush.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads were exactly what we needed for peak efficiency.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these replacement heads when I bought my Sonicare unit and it is a better deal than I could find locally.</li>
            <li>No problems at all, fit like the old ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like, 2 Sonicare replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Seem to be the same ones I used to be able to get at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I love my electric toothbrush and miss it when I am traveling and have to use a traditional brush.</li>
            <li>You almost have to buy this when you first buy your electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>they last so long which is great</li>
            <li>So you end up spending more on regular toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I always keep coming back to Amazon for more.</li>
            <li>Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
            <li>I usually go a few months before replacing them, and even then the bristles are in pretty good</li>
            <li>If I wait the full 3 months and then swap to a new one, I can immediately tell a difference.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of these brushes are good and stiff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and must say that this electric toothbrush is far superior than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Yes it is expensive but the quality is superb compare to the department store brand and as long as it helps me keep my tooth healthy</li>
            <li>The shape of this brush conforms with teeth and seems to get between the teeth better than a flat brush.</li>
            <li>I found that through Amazon I could purchase this item saving approximately 1/2 the best price I had found thus far.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and shipping was fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and received exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>They are expensive but they work great and they are far better than the generics.  </li>
            <li>What a difference the new one makes in just the first brushing!  </li>
            <li>Yes the brush heads are expensive and yes they could be sold for less, but I think it is important to reward companies that put out creative and effective products for better health.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to open as promised!</li>
            <li>The packaging was also easy to open without the plastic blisterpack.  </li>
            <li>It cleans VERY well and seems pretty gentle, although it feels like you have a wasp in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>That issue is easily remedied by pushing the brush neck back in, but still, that never happened with the ones we bought in the store.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush, and these replacement heads are really inexpensive over the long haul.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all folks, and I don&#x27;t appreciate being required to write a certain number of words.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order these again when needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is certainly a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I ret&#x27;d them the next day and ordered Philips brand thru Amazon and they work like they&#x27;re supposed to, maybe even better than new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will mention that you MUST be diligent in keeping the heads and handle as dry as possible after cleaning, or they develop mildew and mold inside the brush head - which isn&#x27;t good for anyone to have in his or her mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work fine, unlike non-Philips products that are meant to replace them but are not quite the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering these same replacement brush heads for about 5 years and all of them have worked perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>Better go get me some sensodyne though because it was a little intense the first brush!</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and the vendor sent it as represented and very timely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it makes replacing your brush head.</li>
            <li>these are the real deal . .</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really realize just how worn out a head is until you replace.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made converts of the whole family.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, thanks Philips.</li>
            <li>I have compared prices on the toothbtrush refills and even with a coupon they were much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I needed some replacements a while back and bought some cheap ones that were compatible at tar-zhay.</li>
            <li>Much quieter</li>
            <li>Overall the brush itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This has been a very satisfactory product.  </li>
            <li>They come straight from Sonicare in the frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy them online.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t anything to review on this product since you all should already know about it.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel much cleaner after using the sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I have these on Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much</li>
            <li>The cost was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Very noisy and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>He loves it and feel it really works.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>But these are the ones that fit the one I have, and my only objection is the price.</li>
            <li>they were shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>These are the real ones and they work.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I replace my heads every 5 months or so, and I really like these.</li>
            <li>but, much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They were priced reasonably and were delivered in two days.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 sets and received them fast.</li>
            <li>work very well -- just as well as the heads supplied</li>
            <li>Buy the real thing and you will be so much happier.</li>
            <li>Well packaged with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Regularly replacing the brush head is necessary for effective stain removal with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Get some new ones but don&#x27;t get the easy open package, it is anything but.</li>
            <li>Simply put,these brush heads are very sturdy, and effectively clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>it is similar to the original one.</li>
            <li>I have been a Sonicare user for years, and when I recently replaced my brush, I was excited to see that I could get compact heads for the elite series.  </li>
            <li>Much better deal than other retailers I have seen.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes are performing to expectations as equal to the original items they were replacing.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and you will have clean, white teeth.</li>
            <li>They definitely get my teeth dentist clean.</li>
            <li>Not only do they very effectively clean one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li>I had not replaced the brush head for a long time, I can&#x27;t remeber how long, and when I saw them on Amazon at such a great price I purchased them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fun, but it&#x27;s necessary, and keeping the price down is the best part of this equation.</li>
            <li>It is firm but gentle on your teeth and gums and really delivers a fresh clean feeling after you have finished brushing.</li>
            <li>It was like getting a whole new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciated being able to select a cardboard box for packaging rather than plastic (waste).</li>
            <li>Cut off the tip of a decent toothbrush, like an Oral-B pro, and insert the heated tang into the tip of</li>
            <li>viola, you have a decent electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quieter, last longer and do an overall better job.  </li>
            <li>As advertised and at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare line of toothbrushes came highly recommended from my hygienist.</li>
            <li>However, the downside has always been the high cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the toothbrush and the seller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The sonicare system works well, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sonicare for everyone who cares about their teeth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>We do like the brushing action of the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes - ours are several years old and still going strong</li>
            <li>After researching, I saw that the sonic/vibrating brushes seemed to work just a little better.  </li>
            <li>We bought this one because it was reasonably priced and wow, does it work.  </li>
            <li>It does take a bit of skill, as you can&#x27;t brush your teeth in the normal fashion.  </li>
            <li>the money you actually saving more money in the long run.</li>
            <li>MAKE sure you take the brush off few times</li>
            <li>Charger designed for standing brush upright, so after brushing, if replaced onto charger, liquid will roll down brush head, inside the toothbrush, and very quickly you get mold.</li>
            <li>I have seen other electric tooth brushes but none that due the job this one does, not only does it work great</li>
            <li>Brought a new replacement toothbrush and ordered addtional brush heads for use.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new Oral B.</li>
            <li>The newly re-designed brush heads allow build up of gunk inside the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>...Just as I like &#x27;em!  I bought these replacement heads for my newly purchased Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The product arrived just as scheduled, and when I tried the new brush head out</li>
            <li>/&gt;(These heads have the &amp;#34;disappearing ink&amp;#34; bristles that gradually lose their color and supposedly tell you when it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Not that I mind because I always have a new head when I want one, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to cancel these orders.</li>
            <li>The magnetic connection seems to be less durable than before and the ability to deliver a strong charge seems to decline over time.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re thinking of getting a new Sonicare, you may want to first consider simply buying a new brush head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve solved this problem more or less by brushing my teeth in the morning when I want to change the brush head, then opening it up and washing the inside with very hot water, then soaking it upside down in a couple of inches of hydrogen peroxide in a cup.  </li>
            <li>I would have to pay more than double at Walmart or other retailers.</li>
            <li>It can be easily unscrewed and cleaned, but that is a little bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li>hope its the original not an imitation brand.</li>
            <li>pop off the old head and pop on the new head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new replacement head works just as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>These brushes (frustration free) don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones that i buy in the store, but the price makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this version of Philips toothbrushes are outdated.</li>
            <li>It was such a relief, because I love my Sonicare, and those old-style replacement heads were becoming difficult to find; and when I did find them, they were outlandishly</li>
            <li>I bought this set for my son along with a whole new Sonicare at the same time.</li>
            <li>This more or less takes care of the gross factor.      </li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth very well, and gives me a near dentist clean feeling (that slick teeth feeling)</li>
            <li>I am also wondering if these are authentic Philips Sonicare brand, they seem to work a little different in the unit as far as battery life, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought the Sonicare just recently and so far it works very well.</li>
            <li>Remember the old saying, replace your toothbrush every 3 months..</li>
            <li>They really are the 21st century toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>, MUCH rather pay the $10/head now than pay the hundreds (or thousands) later for dental work!</li>
            <li>They are direct replacements.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy the real thing and give up on the generic ones.</li>
            <li>they are used as replacements on my toothbrush, so far I got no complaints, whatsoever.</li>
            <li>my old Phillips Advance model toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely look for this seller again on Amazon when I am ready to reorder.</li>
            <li>Our brush unit is about 3 years old and the brushes just don&#x27;t fit as comfortabley as the originals and the fist few replacements.  </li>
            <li>I can get them clean, but others have expressed they have trouble cleaning them.  </li>
            <li>These are the same exact brush heads you can purchase at your local drug store for $36 for a pack of two.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that they try to keep the head consistent among different models; but you still need to pay attention to the different series when you purchase the heads.     </li>
            <li>(Frustration Free Packaging)]]After brushing my teeth for decades with a standard toothbrush, cleaner teeth came with less work.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the one I received is defective or was damaged by Amazon while preparing their \\&quot;Frustration free packaging\\&quot;</li>
            <li>In the past I had purchased some replacement heads because they were cheap</li>
            <li>how long it really takes for the color to go away, as I change my brush head by the calendar instead.)</li>
            <li>exactly what i had expected.  </li>
            <li>A little searching let me here to the right item and a good price...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>The new bristles add such a needed boost to my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>for some reason the knock-offs do not have as much &#x27;power&#x27;, especially when trying to brush the back side of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Small heads are good for small people</li>
            <li>When an electric toothbrush was recommended to me, I was skeptical at first because of the huge cost compared with my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not reviewing the replacement heads themselves because there is really no other choice for this model of Sonicare</li>
            <li>Not much other than the fact that they work like the originals.</li>
            <li>I have used the new brush head for about three weeks now, and it seems to be wearing out much faster than my previous ones.</li>
            <li>I use it for past several years and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Main difference is the overall size of the bristles, which is smaller.  </li>
            <li>I recommend electric toothbrushes in general.</li>
            <li>You can purchase these at any general store</li>
            <li>When they get old the brush part gets frayed and out of shape and also the mechanical parts just get worn and do not operate the brush properly.</li>
            <li>I was worried about ordering replacement heads, as my sonicare is several years old.  </li>
            <li>Philips offers different types of brush heads</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but worth the savings in dental problems.</li>
            <li>Wrote a review, somehow many don&#x27;t make it as done so write this to show I am annoyed and get it off the undone</li>
            <li>does it do everything it says it does, my dentists bill went down due to less visits to the dentist office due to great checkups ever since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I bought these at the same time I purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush, so I haven&#x27;t actually used these replacement heads yet.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted and it wound up costing less than Wal-Mart&#x27;s off-brand.</li>
            <li>While I enjoy my Sonicare toothbrush, it is no fun trying to hunt down the cheapest brushes every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>only negative comment would be that they seem to wear faster than&lt;br /&gt;the original head.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews here, I decided to splurge and give the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; another try and can now say I will never go back to the off-brands.</li>
            <li>These new ones do not seem as rugid to me as the original ones, and they are expensive at nearly $11.00 each, especially if replacing one every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li>I bought this after a relative recommended it and like others the first time I used it I was a little horrified because using it tickled my nose</li>
            <li>If I didnt&#x27; already own this sonicare, I&#x27;d get the new ones with the smaller and much less expensive heads.  </li>
            <li>any rate, after reading someone else&#x27;s review that made the claim that this replacement head would fit the older base, I decided to give them a try and found that the reviewer was right.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I had fallen in the habit of buying the less expensive replacement heads, thinking there couldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>They do not work exactly like new, but they work fine for my \\&quot;outdated\\&quot; base unit.</li>

            <li> Why pay more at the store?  </li>
            <li> If you have to pay shipping on this though, you may be better off just going to the drug store for things like this.</li>

            <li> I love this program.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m overall very happy with the Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> We certainly love using Sonicare</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using them for years, and love them.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Overall they are good quality head and great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips Sonic Care toothbrush</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased there are still replacement brushes</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure when I purchased it, but my dentist recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Nothing could have gone any better.  </li>
            <li> I just love ,my elecriic tooth brush and my teeth</li>
            <li> have never felt better.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> and they feel like they&#x27;re doing more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this for more than a year with no damage caused to the handle unit.    </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a sonic care for many years.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product before the cost is better than what I could pay for this product in the store.</li>
            <li> Love it because it forces me to brush correctly.  </li>
            <li> Love my sonicare.</li>
            <li> We love &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived 3 days after order and we are completely pleased.</li>
            <li> They are much better than the WalMart and Target home brands.  </li>
            <li> believe that higher-end Sonicare models do a better job in being watertight in the brushheads, but the Essence models have to be cleaned with care.</li>
            <li> Would be better if each replacement head had changeable color codes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sonic e series toothbrush for many years now</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Most stores want 22.00-28.00 dollars for 1 head.</li>
            <li> Love my sonic and love amazon....</li>
            <li> I love my phillips sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare tooth brush for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> I wish more products would be packaged in this way.</li>
            <li> They are WAY better than the Equate knock-offs from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t seal the lower gap, because they need to be able to spin there for you to screw the heads on and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sonicare since the inception - I love it.  </li>
            <li> The price is much better here than - &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> the price was truly better on line than in the store.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Wife and I love our Sonicare, and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices for the replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> So, that&#x27;s the part I love.</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed all of our experience with the sonicare line of products.</li>
            <li> We have used the Sonicare HX7002/30 for many years recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am okay with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> i wood recommend this product and purchase some more.</li>
            <li> Love it being delivered on autoship.  </li>
            <li> Been using the brush heads for years and love them.  </li>
            <li> Go for the free S&amp;H if you can find it!</li>
            <li> They should make better gaskets to seal the water out.</li>
            <li> You will love how your teeth feel after using these to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Newer one is better.  </li>
            <li> Still, these things are much better then manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> This seller had just what I needed at a good price, plus the shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> With gas prices on the rise, I so appreciate Amazon&#x27;s flawless performance in providing a service directly to my home that I can depend on for this particular item as well as others for a fair, and do-able price.  </li>
            <li> This brush head makes my teeth feel very clean, resulting in my brushing more than twice a day</li>
            <li> They stimilate the gums and give your teeth a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> as expected - perfect for smiley white teeth :D</li>
            <li> Here at Amazon, you get a good deal and really fast service!</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, there is a surprising difference in the way the heads made for the Sonicare vibrate at a seemingly higher frequency than the knock-off versions.</li>
            <li> The brushheads also seem to go out of shape much more easily.</li>
            <li> I am glad to get the brush refills easily</li>
            <li> Great service, exactly as advertised, quick delivery , cheaper than Walmart.</li>
            <li> So excited that this is such a great bargain !!</li>
            <li> The replacement brush&#x27;s are ok, but they don&#x27;t fit like the originals that came with the Sonicare Brush.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find them at such a good price.</li>
            <li> this was a better price than available at the stores.  </li>
            <li> I have perfectly and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and good replacements, so</li>
            <li> always trust Amazon.com to send me the real thing, at a good price, in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> good price and fast service</li>
            <li> AS GOOD AS THE REAL ONES</li>
            <li> I think I like the frustration-free packaging, and it is more environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> They came in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> a brown box is easy to get open.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase the Sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li> It was easy to order this product instead of going out to wsste my gas to get it.</li>
            <li> The Subcribe and Save option makes it easy to remember when to replace the heads -</li>
            <li> This product makes it so easy to keep brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> I echo many of the others in saying that Sonicare products are superior to manual brushing in nearly every aspect.</li>
            <li> The silicone will not stick well and will easily turn on the neck, but it still keeps the water out.</li>
            <li> Philips should provide an easy way to identify these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Have had our e-series toothbrushes for about five years and like how easy it is to find replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I brush with a manual toothbrush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean as it does with a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes it easy to find them.</li>
            <li> Recommend them strongly.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend getting the Sonic Seals, and the UV Sanitizer if you purchase these.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and felt the power is really strong, whick viberated my head like an earthquake.</li>
            <li> I have had it repaired and its still going strong.  </li>
            <li> All in all these are really good replacement heads and a decent price at that.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, perfect fit, one in use, other as a backup.</li>
            <li> The Phillips electric tooth brush is very convenient, very effective and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> In short I don&#x27;t mind paying \\&quot;more than I think I should pay\\&quot; for healthy teeth and superior oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> It is OEM quality, perfectly replaces my previous brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised,  Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The screw on heads are easy to replace and stay secure through the life of the brush.</li>
            <li> I fine this product helpful with my teeth.</li>
            <li> The brush heads work fine.  </li>
            <li> works fine.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes function fine.</li>
            <li> If I have to replacement every three months, that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> They seem to work fine, no problems.  </li>
            <li> Each head comes wrapped in a sealed plastic bag &amp; securely held in a strong cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Buying on line at Amazon is easy and much more economical than driving to the shopping centersl</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes fit my Elite perfectly, and cost a lot less than buying in the store.</li>
            <li> I have used other power brushes this one makes your teeth feel smooth and clean from the best cleaning you have ever had!!!</li>
            <li> fantastic product, &amp; for the seller I like to say thank you for your prompt delivery &amp; for carrying such a great product will be bk for replacements soon.</li>
            <li> + at Costco on the huge multi-pack.</li>
            <li> They fit my Sonicare toothbrush and the price can&#x27;t be beat on the multi-packs.</li>
            <li> Fit with no issues.  </li>
            <li> They were shipped free in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> They fit.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to use,</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit like a charm.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price I paid for these replacements is a great savings compared to prices in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I consider this to be a great bargain and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is genuine or not</li>
            <li> It fits in the unit I already have, and it is free from defects.</li>
            <li> Works great in multiple models of phillip sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has a great price, especially if you do Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t go cheap on this one.</li>
            <li> Order filled correctly.  </li>
            <li> I also like to get the frustration free packaging</li>
            <li> It is worth paying a bit more for the originals.  </li>
            <li> The compact brush heads are great for reaching every surface, even the very back.</li>
            <li> Brushes no longer available.  </li>
            <li> They fit the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Heads fit the Sonicare</li>
            <li> I like the hassle free packaging, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any of the replacement heads I&#x27;ve received</li>
            <li> I use ivory soap body wash to brush my teeth, I have never had whiter plaque free teeth ever..</li>
            <li> these fit well and work well.</li>
            <li> The Frustration Free packaging is also a nice option - so much easier to get at the product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Good price on set, although I may be able to find one with three brush heads for around the same price, with a coupon, elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> These heads have a different look, but fit just fine and do a great job getting the teeth and gums clean</li>
            <li> They are perfect as replacement heads for the crappy heads that originally came with your electronic brush but have much to be desired from a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes as expected and work perfectly for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Quality product, I recently tried out some non name brand heads and it was easy to see how these toothbrush heads stand superior.</li>
            <li> I love you Amazon.com and thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> They work just like the original ones.</li>
            <li> It looks legit but would wish it would came with the original box.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit softer than the original</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t needed to replace them yet because I am still using the original.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find them at this price.</li>
            <li> I think it is unreasonable and unsanitary that this item be re-sold without its original packaging.  </li>
            <li> I now know why you picture the two replacement toothbrushes without being in their original package</li>
            <li> the original toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They are replacement brushes they work just as the original one.</li>
            <li> They seem to clean just as well.</li>
            <li> The Seals, especially will keep things a lot more tidy and save on maintenance.</li>
            <li> Good price on this replacement, especially if you can wait on the free shipping.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> and I like how clean theses brushes clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thinking about how important a clean bright smile is to your health and the person standing in front of you, it only seemed right to spend more on this tool.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon, for providing the genuine replacements at a nice price in an easy to open box.</li>
            <li> so I knew I had purchased the right product!  </li>
            <li> they will not work right!</li>
            <li> The purchase was great as expected.  </li>
            <li> When you have a sonic tooth brush, you should replace your brushes about every 6 months and finding someplace to buy them at a good price is key.</li>
            <li> And these refillable heads are fairly priced, especially by using the Subscribe &amp; Save program.  </li>
            <li> This was such a good buy, that I ordered 2 sets.  </li>
            <li> There I was able to find an off-brand at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the Oral-B. Let it cool and</li>
            <li> So much so that I thought I would not be able to use it.    </li>
            <li> I can confirm this is true.  </li>
            <li> then it is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Standard tooth brush replacement heads that are well priced and arrived with good attention to packaging so that the heads were undamaged and worked when installed.</li>
            <li> (they still work the same for a while longer; about the time you&#x27;ll find them at a good sale price from Amazon.com (POP)</li>
            <li> It is quiet to use and feels good on the gums.  </li>
            <li> We bought the brushes from Amazon last year and was pleased to know that we could so easily get the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> It is more energetic, and it does not get as moldy where the water does not dry.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were the right size and fit my unit.  </li>
            <li> They fit right on and stay good long after we choose to replace them.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was also quick.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the brush not only cleans my teeth, but makes sure my gums stay in shape as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly as per the shipping estimate.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t need to replace it as quickly as we did.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Got the product quickly and it saved about 30% from buying them&lt;br /&gt;at</li>
            <li> My past experiences with Sonicare toothbrushes and replacement brushes have all been very good</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and genuine Philips replacement heads.</li>
            <li> We enjoy our experience with amazon.com because they deliver exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> this product, this was my very first purchase of a electric toothbrush Sonicare and boy</li>
            <li> I have an old Sonicare and these replacement brushes are more sleek than the original.</li>
            <li> Large threads make it easy to change and remove for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I always have a new head to assure I am getting a healthy brushing.  </li>
            <li> Have long been a user of Sonicare toothbrushes and have been more than satisfied with performance.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it is clearly not the most elegant system.</li>
            <li> This type is not used as much as newere models, but it works great and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li> For a review on that, it doesnt exactly what you would want- replace your brush head!</li>
            <li> the packaging is clean and crisp.</li>
            <li> To clarify, those are the real deal and work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around cheap and fast way to get replacements, and sign up for the renewal... its cheaper and reminds you to replace your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These fit on my sonicare, which of course is the whole point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that we don&#x27;t have to break the bank to maintain basic oral health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare still works nicely after several years, and I needed replacement heads.</li>
            <li> if you own a e-series buy a couple extra heads.  </li>
            <li> It is just what I ordered and it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s nice to come back to these \\&quot;real\\&quot; replacements.</li>
            <li> but it seems worth it.  </li>
            <li> also it is fun</li>
            <li> I needed to replace mine, and getting two in the package was well worth it.</li>
            <li> reduces gum inflammation, well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a whole lot better in cleaning and is much stronger.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare has been worth its weight in gold for me.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> It is over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on.</li>
            <li> Have two more young grandchildren and these</li>
            <li> Worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> And I trust them far more than those non-Sonicare brands who might seem to be a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> Considering you only need to replace the head about 1x a month, seems better  to spend a few more dollars to maximize the benefits of the toothbrush and get the best results possible.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> My Advance tooth brush is an older one and these brush heads work fine with it.</li>
            <li> After checking other local stores, this was the best deal for us for replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads arrived quickly and were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These heads are easy to remove and easy to put on-- twist off and twist back on.</li>
            <li> If you do it right, one tooth at a time</li>
            <li> The Amazon service, through UPS, was right on time and in the right place.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right size for my mouth.</li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging is easy to open.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes work great and sometimes with the subscribe and save offers, amazon offers a better price than other retailers.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to be able to find this product so easily and avoid paying the ridiculous prices in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> it is great to get these on a subscription, no more trying to remember when i changed the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> However, with this price you can absolutely afford to change them out more frequently.</li>
            <li> (there is a portable case for using away from home and nice cap to keep brush covered that allows air flow to keep it dry that is included).</li>
            <li> I keep an old brush and use it as a facial tool feels good on my face and under my eyes and eye brows...</li>
            <li> To my surprise, these brush heads fit a very old Sonicare model, from about 1995</li>
            <li> I use these daily and trust they are doing a fine job of keeping my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> The old style was just fine.  </li>
            <li> I received my supposedly \\&quot;new\\&quot; sonicare replacement toothbrushes that were not in the original packaging and had been put in new packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other electric toothbrush, but I&#x27;m pleased with my Sonicare Essence!</li>
            <li> - they usually last 3 months or more...</li>
            <li> We used to buy the replacement heads locally but found Amazon has the best prices even comparing them to the occasional sale locally.</li>
            <li> and much more convenient than buying at the big retailers . . .  </li>
            <li> Replace at regular intervals to get the most out of them.  </li>
            <li> seems to wear off pretty soon after you get it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will buy some more, actually i signed up for amazon fulfillment.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are smooth and fit perfectly into the base.</li>
            <li> They have never failed me.</li>
            <li> They were insanely loud and felt cheap.</li>
            <li> This was also my first time using the scheduled delivery service, which at least for the first delivery worked great.  </li>
            <li> The heads last a long time, 6-8 months, and when you change them its a great feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper (and much easier to find) on Amazon, plus you can do the 6 month subscription plan and forget about it!  </li>
            <li> Would definately recommend this vendor and product to all interested.</li>
            <li> The brushes work well, but they do not last more than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> so I signed up for auto ship when I was sure they were the proper heads.</li>
            <li> exactly like the one that came from the factory.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like being able to find low cost replacement heads for my brush.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were exactly what we needed for peak efficiency.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads when I bought my Sonicare unit and it is a better deal than I could find locally.</li>
            <li> No problems at all, fit like the old ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like, 2 Sonicare replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Seem to be the same ones I used to be able to get at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush and miss it when I am traveling and have to use a traditional brush.</li>
            <li> You almost have to buy this when you first buy your electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> they last so long which is great</li>
            <li> So you end up spending more on regular toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I always keep coming back to Amazon for more.</li>
            <li> Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
            <li> I usually go a few months before replacing them, and even then the bristles are in pretty good</li>
            <li> If I wait the full 3 months and then swap to a new one, I can immediately tell a difference.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of these brushes are good and stiff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and must say that this electric toothbrush is far superior than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive but the quality is superb compare to the department store brand and as long as it helps me keep my tooth healthy</li>
            <li> The shape of this brush conforms with teeth and seems to get between the teeth better than a flat brush.</li>
            <li> I found that through Amazon I could purchase this item saving approximately 1/2 the best price I had found thus far.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and shipping was fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast and received exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> They are expensive but they work great and they are far better than the generics.  </li>
            <li> What a difference the new one makes in just the first brushing!  </li>
            <li> Yes the brush heads are expensive and yes they could be sold for less, but I think it is important to reward companies that put out creative and effective products for better health.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to open as promised!</li>
            <li> The packaging was also easy to open without the plastic blisterpack.  </li>
            <li> It cleans VERY well and seems pretty gentle, although it feels like you have a wasp in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> That issue is easily remedied by pushing the brush neck back in, but still, that never happened with the ones we bought in the store.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, and these replacement heads are really inexpensive over the long haul.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all folks, and I don&#x27;t appreciate being required to write a certain number of words.</li>
            <li> I will certainly order these again when needed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is certainly a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I ret&#x27;d them the next day and ordered Philips brand thru Amazon and they work like they&#x27;re supposed to, maybe even better than new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I will mention that you MUST be diligent in keeping the heads and handle as dry as possible after cleaning, or they develop mildew and mold inside the brush head - which isn&#x27;t good for anyone to have in his or her mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work fine, unlike non-Philips products that are meant to replace them but are not quite the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering these same replacement brush heads for about 5 years and all of them have worked perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> Better go get me some sensodyne though because it was a little intense the first brush!</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and the vendor sent it as represented and very timely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it makes replacing your brush head.</li>
            <li> these are the real deal . .</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really realize just how worn out a head is until you replace.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made converts of the whole family.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, thanks Philips.</li>
            <li> I have compared prices on the toothbtrush refills and even with a coupon they were much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I needed some replacements a while back and bought some cheap ones that were compatible at tar-zhay.</li>
            <li> Much quieter</li>
            <li> Overall the brush itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This has been a very satisfactory product.  </li>
            <li> They come straight from Sonicare in the frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy them online.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t anything to review on this product since you all should already know about it.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel much cleaner after using the sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, I have these on Subscribe and Save</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much</li>
            <li> The cost was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> He loves it and feel it really works.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> But these are the ones that fit the one I have, and my only objection is the price.</li>
            <li> they were shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> These are the real ones and they work.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I replace my heads every 5 months or so, and I really like these.</li>
            <li> but, much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They were priced reasonably and were delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets and received them fast.</li>
            <li> work very well -- just as well as the heads supplied</li>
            <li> Buy the real thing and you will be so much happier.</li>
            <li> Well packaged with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Regularly replacing the brush head is necessary for effective stain removal with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Get some new ones but don&#x27;t get the easy open package, it is anything but.</li>
            <li> Simply put,these brush heads are very sturdy, and effectively clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> it is similar to the original one.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for years, and when I recently replaced my brush, I was excited to see that I could get compact heads for the elite series.  </li>
            <li> Much better deal than other retailers I have seen.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are performing to expectations as equal to the original items they were replacing.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will have clean, white teeth.</li>
            <li> They definitely get my teeth dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Not only do they very effectively clean one&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> I had not replaced the brush head for a long time, I can&#x27;t remeber how long, and when I saw them on Amazon at such a great price I purchased them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fun, but it&#x27;s necessary, and keeping the price down is the best part of this equation.</li>
            <li> It is firm but gentle on your teeth and gums and really delivers a fresh clean feeling after you have finished brushing.</li>
            <li> It was like getting a whole new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciated being able to select a cardboard box for packaging rather than plastic (waste).</li>
            <li> Cut off the tip of a decent toothbrush, like an Oral-B pro, and insert the heated tang into the tip of</li>
            <li> viola, you have a decent electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quieter, last longer and do an overall better job.  </li>
            <li> As advertised and at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare line of toothbrushes came highly recommended from my hygienist.</li>
            <li> However, the downside has always been the high cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the toothbrush and the seller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The sonicare system works well, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sonicare for everyone who cares about their teeth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> We do like the brushing action of the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes - ours are several years old and still going strong</li>
            <li> After researching, I saw that the sonic/vibrating brushes seemed to work just a little better.  </li>
            <li> We bought this one because it was reasonably priced and wow, does it work.  </li>
            <li> It does take a bit of skill, as you can&#x27;t brush your teeth in the normal fashion.  </li>
            <li> the money you actually saving more money in the long run.</li>
            <li> MAKE sure you take the brush off few times</li>
            <li> Charger designed for standing brush upright, so after brushing, if replaced onto charger, liquid will roll down brush head, inside the toothbrush, and very quickly you get mold.</li>
            <li> I have seen other electric tooth brushes but none that due the job this one does, not only does it work great</li>
            <li> Brought a new replacement toothbrush and ordered addtional brush heads for use.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new Oral B.</li>
            <li> The newly re-designed brush heads allow build up of gunk inside the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> ...Just as I like &#x27;em!  I bought these replacement heads for my newly purchased Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The product arrived just as scheduled, and when I tried the new brush head out</li>
            <li> /&gt;(These heads have the &amp;#34;disappearing ink&amp;#34; bristles that gradually lose their color and supposedly tell you when it&#x27;s time for a new brush head.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Not that I mind because I always have a new head when I want one, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to cancel these orders.</li>
            <li> The magnetic connection seems to be less durable than before and the ability to deliver a strong charge seems to decline over time.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re thinking of getting a new Sonicare, you may want to first consider simply buying a new brush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve solved this problem more or less by brushing my teeth in the morning when I want to change the brush head, then opening it up and washing the inside with very hot water, then soaking it upside down in a couple of inches of hydrogen peroxide in a cup.  </li>
            <li> I would have to pay more than double at Walmart or other retailers.</li>
            <li> It can be easily unscrewed and cleaned, but that is a little bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> hope its the original not an imitation brand.</li>
            <li> pop off the old head and pop on the new head.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new replacement head works just as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> These brushes (frustration free) don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones that i buy in the store, but the price makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this version of Philips toothbrushes are outdated.</li>
            <li> It was such a relief, because I love my Sonicare, and those old-style replacement heads were becoming difficult to find; and when I did find them, they were outlandishly</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my son along with a whole new Sonicare at the same time.</li>
            <li> This more or less takes care of the gross factor.      </li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth very well, and gives me a near dentist clean feeling (that slick teeth feeling)</li>
            <li> I am also wondering if these are authentic Philips Sonicare brand, they seem to work a little different in the unit as far as battery life, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare just recently and so far it works very well.</li>
            <li> Remember the old saying, replace your toothbrush every 3 months..</li>
            <li> They really are the 21st century toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> , MUCH rather pay the $10/head now than pay the hundreds (or thousands) later for dental work!</li>
            <li> They are direct replacements.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy the real thing and give up on the generic ones.</li>
            <li> they are used as replacements on my toothbrush, so far I got no complaints, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> my old Phillips Advance model toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely look for this seller again on Amazon when I am ready to reorder.</li>
            <li> Our brush unit is about 3 years old and the brushes just don&#x27;t fit as comfortabley as the originals and the fist few replacements.  </li>
            <li> I can get them clean, but others have expressed they have trouble cleaning them.  </li>
            <li> These are the same exact brush heads you can purchase at your local drug store for $36 for a pack of two.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that they try to keep the head consistent among different models; but you still need to pay attention to the different series when you purchase the heads.     </li>
            <li> (Frustration Free Packaging)]]After brushing my teeth for decades with a standard toothbrush, cleaner teeth came with less work.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the one I received is defective or was damaged by Amazon while preparing their \\&quot;Frustration free packaging\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In the past I had purchased some replacement heads because they were cheap</li>
            <li> how long it really takes for the color to go away, as I change my brush head by the calendar instead.)</li>
            <li> exactly what i had expected.  </li>
            <li> A little searching let me here to the right item and a good price...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The new bristles add such a needed boost to my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> for some reason the knock-offs do not have as much &#x27;power&#x27;, especially when trying to brush the back side of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Small heads are good for small people</li>
            <li> When an electric toothbrush was recommended to me, I was skeptical at first because of the huge cost compared with my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not reviewing the replacement heads themselves because there is really no other choice for this model of Sonicare</li>
            <li> Not much other than the fact that they work like the originals.</li>
            <li> I have used the new brush head for about three weeks now, and it seems to be wearing out much faster than my previous ones.</li>
            <li> I use it for past several years and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Main difference is the overall size of the bristles, which is smaller.  </li>
            <li> I recommend electric toothbrushes in general.</li>
            <li> You can purchase these at any general store</li>
            <li> When they get old the brush part gets frayed and out of shape and also the mechanical parts just get worn and do not operate the brush properly.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering replacement heads, as my sonicare is several years old.  </li>
            <li> Philips offers different types of brush heads</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but worth the savings in dental problems.</li>
            <li> Wrote a review, somehow many don&#x27;t make it as done so write this to show I am annoyed and get it off the undone</li>
            <li> does it do everything it says it does, my dentists bill went down due to less visits to the dentist office due to great checkups ever since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these at the same time I purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush, so I haven&#x27;t actually used these replacement heads yet.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted and it wound up costing less than Wal-Mart&#x27;s off-brand.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy my Sonicare toothbrush, it is no fun trying to hunt down the cheapest brushes every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> only negative comment would be that they seem to wear faster than&lt;br /&gt;the original head.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews here, I decided to splurge and give the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; another try and can now say I will never go back to the off-brands.</li>
            <li> These new ones do not seem as rugid to me as the original ones, and they are expensive at nearly $11.00 each, especially if replacing one every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a relative recommended it and like others the first time I used it I was a little horrified because using it tickled my nose</li>
            <li> If I didnt&#x27; already own this sonicare, I&#x27;d get the new ones with the smaller and much less expensive heads.  </li>
            <li> any rate, after reading someone else&#x27;s review that made the claim that this replacement head would fit the older base, I decided to give them a try and found that the reviewer was right.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I had fallen in the habit of buying the less expensive replacement heads, thinking there couldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> They do not work exactly like new, but they work fine for my \\&quot;outdated\\&quot; base unit.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish Philips would make is a selection of brush head softness I find that when they are brand new they can be a little too stiff for about the first 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Off brand replacement heads are usually very noisy and the bristles stiff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the bristles as soft as the other E-series replacement heads purchased by me.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are pretty expensive and these 2 pack is reasonably prices.</li>
            <li> I have just started using the second brush head and don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this set of replacements heads for my Sonicare from Amazon a \\&quot;few times\\&quot;(which translates to a couple of years)now,and have never been disappointed, or never had any problems receiving the merchandise shipped in anything other than perfect working order.  </li>
            <li> and they last a long time - about six months</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are a bit pricy, but last a long time</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re looking at doing the generics I would recommend against them as these are far less noisy.</li>
            <li> Sam&#x27;s club has generics that are far less costly and work well.</li>
            <li> WEAK, NOT REAL THEY SHAKE AND VIBRATE AND DONT CLEAN</li>
            <li> Brushing now takes less work, which is a good thing because working so hard to brush your teeth is unnecessary these days.</li>
            <li> but I prefer this one; The bristles are firm without being rough on gums and teeth, yet soft enough not to bother gums, inner cheek or tongue.</li>
            <li> As expensive as these brush heads get, especially when you have two sets of brushes to replace, finding these original ones at Amazon for the price that they are, I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.</li>
            <li> These are the legit ones, sometimes it can be hard to find the real ones</li>
            <li> Be careful about having it on when it&#x27;s outside your mouth - it will spray everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I always wait too long to replace these heads.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to reorder for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Its virtues are that it fits on the handle,&lt;br /&gt;and lasts for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth thoroughly and the brush heads have a long life.</li>
            <li> We are on our 2nd Sonicare unit in about 8 years now and our Dental checkups since beginning to use it have been much easier on the cleanings and less stressful due to having less cavities.  </li>
            <li> They were little smaller size than the initial tooth brush but did the job regardless.  </li>
            <li> In my local Rite Aid these brushes are going for more than $35.00, I was soooooooo shocked.  </li>
            <li> I even take them off and leave them to air dry when not being used and still get the mold.</li>
            <li> my son just finished his second round of braces and kept hearing the same thing at his dental checkups -</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers - it&#x27;s a small price to pay to avoid high dental bills.</li>
            <li> They are large enough to work well and yet small enough to get behind the last molars well too.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is small and soft which I like.</li>
            <li> These brushes are on the small and soft side, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Also only one of the two replacement brushes actually had E-series printed on it which demonstrates that it was not authentic.</li>
            <li> this is not the first time I have encountered extra costs and this makes the item expensive.</li>
            <li> so I could get them on a regular basis and save a little more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with the generic version of these brushes</li>
            <li> I had bought an off-brand to try to save money, but the buzzing sound drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even ship until the expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> The product replaced a broken one so be gentle when brushing</li>
            <li> But I was missing an entire brush head....</li>
            <li> Not much to say about them, buy if you need them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t they know that toothbrushes get wet??</li>
            <li> If you have braces and are having trouble keeping the plaque down I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only CON I can say is tha the acrylic cap tends to form MOLD inside it because of the excessive moisture.</li>
            <li> That said, the toothbrushes work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Like I did before with my other Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried generic replacement heads on my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush in the past but they don&#x27;t compare to the one made by Phillips.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t kid yourself you can try other products but in my opinion nothing compares to Sonic brushes .I</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and using them properly can save hundreds of dollars if not more in dental visits.</li>
            <li> I would not use anything other than sonicare products.</li>
            <li> The included plastic caps keep water and other materials from splashing onto the bristles.</li>
            <li> The quality was as desired although I expected a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price went up approximately five dollars more than the order my friend received for me in North Carolina.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had with it is that toothpaste drips down past the rubber gasket where the shaft meets the bulb, which causes gunk to build up inside the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Each one has a different color ring (hard to tell from the photo)</li>
            <li> everyone should have at least a couple extra brush heads on hand.  </li>
            <li> Definately not worth waiting a week to save $5.     </li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans but hate the cost of refills.</li>
            <li> and it gets longer down the road</li>
            <li> Water/toothpaste/drool get&#x27;s down around the shaft and runs into the head causing mold to grow inside them.</li>
            <li> I wish that these things could come down in price to like $7.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for a few years and have bought brush heads from other retailers and this has never happened.</li>
            <li> The head is small enough to get back behind molars,too.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tickle feeling while brushing</li>
            <li> i probably paid half what sonicare charge for these.</li>
            <li> I typically get about 3 months out of one before I need to replace.  </li>
            <li> My previous dentist, in Orange County, CA, said that if everyone used these, almost no one would have periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head is wearing out in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Also option for an odd number of replacement heads would be helpful.</li>
            <li> With Amazon you get 2 heads for less than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used off brand replacements for slightly less money</li>
            <li> Not a problem for me though, and costs considerably less...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use them until my main unit fails.  </li>
            <li> Wish they were a little less pricey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can buy a LOT of conventional toothbrushes for $30 !</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t form a tight seal with the plastic threading and just vibrated making a ton of noise and ineffective brushing.</li>
            <li> It lasts very long out of the charger (at least 3 weeks)</li>
            <li> i have less trouble with my teeth now.</li>
            <li> I put some silicone sealer around the little colored bands to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> No more water getting down inside an causing a moldy mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit disappointing because it takes longer and is more difficult than it used to be to remove plaque with it.</li>
            <li> Gunk does build up between the head and the base with this model, but the electric brush has a made a huge difference in my dentist trips.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a firm believer that it has improved the health of our teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Philips uses BIZARRE numbering system that doesn&#x27;t match up with base.  </li>
            <li> There is minimal waste - 2 small plastic bags &amp; a small cardboard box which can be recycled.</li>
            <li> A practical way to be &#x27;green&#x27; &amp; to decrease the load on the landfill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years.</li>
            <li> and that is something less to remember!</li>
            <li> Just like the original heads I got with the base.</li>
            <li> and then I change them to keep the brush stiff</li>
            <li> The only downside of this product is the price--I wish it were less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The are less expensive than those I find locally.</li>
            <li> a week water can get inside and slow down the brush.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of these products and noticed a dramatic difference in the two replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> I am going to get one for my son because the dentist told him he was using a too firm brushhead and brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> This series is sometimes difficult to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare works as well, but no better than the Braun Vitality.</li>
            <li> It usually seems like when I order Sonicare replacement bruses on-line that I end up with the small-sized brushes.  </li>
            <li> The indicator (although I always seem to use it was past its disappearance.)</li>
            <li> Thank God, they sell these 2 packs here, they are usually $25.00 per toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they softened it or if quality has just dropped.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to expect-</li>
            <li> Think of it as an small investment now</li>
            <li> My wife and I have each used a Sonicare brush for the past dozen years.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, they are expensive compared to a manual toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a cavity</li>
            <li> they are toothbrush heads, i am not sure there is anything else i can say about them.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER STORE WE WENT TO.</li>
            <li> For the cost they are hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you know that film that gets on your teeth it hard to get off not with this.</li>
            <li> I can review the brush heads, but they are really secondary.  </li>
            <li> For the longest time I was convinced that these replacement heads (\\&quot;E-series\\&quot;) would not fit my old Sonicare brush base, which I think dates from before 2007.</li>
            <li> They are not designed well as scum accumulates under the head.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact the new bristles are so hard that my dentist informed me that I was brushing my gums away:( The problem is that since the brush heads should be replaced every 3 months I ordered this item as a repeat order.</li>
            <li> I think (sorry no exact model number).</li>
            <li> No more overbrushing!  </li>
            <li> No more cavities!</li>
            <li> Anyway, these brush heads come to me and the packaging that they&#x27;re in is actually less annoying than the standard retail packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least 1/3 less expensive.</li>
            <li> I find these replacement heads are poorly made, I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> But, the replacement heads for these things are ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> but until then 10 dollars per head is not such a bad deal.</li>
            <li> (See photos I have posted which shows the old base and head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day when I tried them  I was immediately disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried the generic brand and was terribly disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> It always helps me get a \\&quot;star\\&quot; behind my name from my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was one that was defective but with every replacement head the brissles come out which is one very annoying and uncomfortable when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell from the markings on the brush base itself, and the packaging is long gone.</li>
            <li> These are awful, loud</li>
            <li> I had purchased the Wal-Mart Equate replacement for the same price, and they were horrible.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price for these expensive heads.</li>
            <li> Expensive replacements</li>
            <li> I FILED IT UNDER THE WRONG ITEM AND CAN&#x27;T DELETE IT.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Very poorly designed from this perspective.</li>
            <li> One other thing I read about is that the design causes some nasty building below the brushhead.  </li>
            <li> and they end up getting really really dirty if you don&#x27;t maintain them.</li>
            <li> NONE OF THAT HORRIBLE PLASTIC COATED RIDICULOUSLY SEALED PACKAGING THAT YOU HAVE TO HURT YOURSELF TO GET TO THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> REALLY badly.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the Hx700L/30 E-series toothbrush replacement heads from Amazon delivered to me  on November 26, 2011.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, but already have it.</li>
            <li> so if you are sharing a base, you can distinguish which brush head belongs to each person.</li>
            <li> They come without all that annoying plastic packaging, too.</li>
            <li> and i hate it</li>
            <li> But when buying replacement brushes, I just hate wrangling with those nasty plastic contaners.</li>
            <li> I hated them</li>
            <li> and they were AWFUL!</li>
            <li> and they are terrible!</li>
            <li> We bought some off brand replacement heads that made a horrible chatter when the brush was turned on.  </li>
            <li> The Equates are getting horrible reviews on the Wal Mart</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best advice i have ever listened to. Sonicare tooth brushs are the best for my teeth. i have less trouble with my teeth now. I have used these for many years and will continut to. Getting from Amazon is cheaper.</li>
            <li> If I give a 5-star rating, that should be enough for your review ........... and that&#x27;s the end of my comments  for now ......</li>
            <li> The replacement brush&#x27;s are ok, but they don&#x27;t fit like the originals that came with the Sonicare Brush.  Our brush unit is about 3 years old and the brushes just don&#x27;t fit as comfortabley as the originals and the fist few replacements.  They seem to clean just as well. So I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> The Phillips electric tooth brush is very convenient, very effective and well worth the money. It always helps me get a \\&quot;star\\&quot; behind my name from my dental hygienist. I wish these had been around 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> Simply put,these brush heads are very sturdy, and effectively clean the teeth. I&#x27;ve never tried any other electric toothbrush, but I&#x27;m pleased with my Sonicare Essence!</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads match my Sonicare toothbrush perfectly. Each one has a different color ring (hard to tell from the photo) so if you are sharing a base, you can distinguish which brush head belongs to each person. I am a big fan of Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare repacement brush works great, just like the ones you can purchase for more money in stores.  i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Fits my eSeries Sonicare and works well. I purchased the \\&quot;no hassle packaging\\&quot; option and saved a dollar or two.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the brush heads. They are very good quality and the delivery was prompt. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This replacement brush head works great in my Sonicare Advance electric tooth brush. My Advance tooth brush is an older one and these brush heads work fine with it. They are large enough to work well and yet small enough to get behind the last molars well too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price.  Why pay more at the store?  Buying on line at Amazon is easy and much more economical than driving to the shopping centersl</li>
            <li> I checked everywhere on the Web and in Bricks and Mortar and could not find a deal that even came close. I love you Amazon.com and thanks!</li>
            <li> When you have a sonic tooth brush, you should replace your brushes about every 6 months and finding someplace to buy them at a good price is key. A little searching let me here to the right item and a good price...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the Hx7002/30 Brush head. I recently bought the Hx5351 Toothbrush and a set of Hx7002/30 Brush head replacements. To my surprise, these brush heads fit a very old Sonicare model, from about 1995 I think (sorry no exact model number). So if you&#x27;re thinking of getting a new Sonicare, you may want to first consider simply buying a new brush head.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and genuine Philips replacement heads. This series is sometimes difficult to find in local stores. Off brand replacement heads are usually very noisy and the bristles stiff. Happy with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This is recommended by my dental hygienist. I&#x27;ve used them for years. Cleans very well and the vendor sent it as represented and very timely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of a difference it makes replacing your brush head. I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t replace mine for a year because it was visually OK. But now that I have with these guys, it makes a world of a difference. Better go get me some sensodyne though because it was a little intense the first brush!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was priced lower than in stores.  I have to replace these periodically so I would definitely re-order from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I buy some stuff like this on amazon because I have amazon prime and they&#x27;ll also send you replacement supplies like this on a specified schedule. This keeps me from forgetting to buy stuff. If you have to pay shipping on this though, you may be better off just going to the drug store for things like this. Anyway, these brush heads come to me and the packaging that they&#x27;re in is actually less annoying than the standard retail packaging.</li>
            <li> In my local Rite Aid these brushes are going for more than $35.00, I was soooooooo shocked.  This price on Amazon is outstanding and I&#x27;m grateful their on Prime too, no shipping and handling.  It&#x27;s nice that we don&#x27;t have to break the bank to maintain basic oral health.</li>
            <li> Brought a new replacement toothbrush and ordered addtional brush heads for use.  I could not beat the price of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes (frustration free) don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones that i buy in the store, but the price makes up for it.  I on my 2nd 2-pack in 4 months - they usually last 3 months or more...</li>
            <li> When I saw I could order Phillips replacement brush heads at a discount(with no shipping or taxes AND have them shipped automatically) it was a no brainer. While I enjoy my Sonicare toothbrush, it is no fun trying to hunt down the cheapest brushes every 3-4 months. I love this program.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and lasts for a long time. I would definitely recommend the Phillips Sonicare to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they&#x27;re great. I was very pleased to find them at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Great price on these Sonicare replacement heads. We are on our 2nd Sonicare unit in about 8 years now and our Dental checkups since beginning to use it have been much easier on the cleanings and less stressful due to having less cavities.  We used to buy the replacement heads locally but found Amazon has the best prices even comparing them to the occasional sale locally.</li>
            <li> After using the stock brush that came with my Sonicare, I know these are the same quality and I can use these for the 6 months that they are supposed to be used for. When I run out, I&#x27;m gonna buy these again!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE AND DELIVERY</li>
            <li> It is OEM quality, perfectly replaces my previous brush heads. The only CON I can say is tha the acrylic cap tends to form MOLD inside it because of the excessive moisture. I do not recommend using, throw it away and keep your brush inside an alcohol compartment.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.  They fit my Sonicare toothbrush and the price can&#x27;t be beat on the multi-packs.</li>
            <li> After 8 years of using our Oral B electric toothbrush, it broke.  After researching, I saw that the sonic/vibrating brushes seemed to work just a little better.  We bought this one because it was reasonably priced and wow, does it work.  Be careful about having it on when it&#x27;s outside your mouth - it will spray everywhere.  It tickles, but we&#x27;re used to it now.    I recommend buying the sonicare.  It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Fit with no issues.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare line of toothbrushes came highly recommended from my hygienist. It is firm but gentle on your teeth and gums and really delivers a fresh clean feeling after you have finished brushing. However, the downside has always been the high cost of the replacement heads. Amazon&#x27;s bulk package is the best deal you will find anywhere. These are the same exact brush heads you can purchase at your local drug store for $36 for a pack of two. They deliver a quality tooth brushing and will last up to six months. However, with this price you can absolutely afford to change them out more frequently. Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare works as well, but no better than the Braun Vitality. However, the Phillips head replacements cost, per year, what I pay for dentist&#x27;s cleaning. Definitely not not value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for 10 years now and have had no problems with my teeth. Follow the directions and you will have clean, white teeth. Be sure to replace often or else they will not do its intended job. Not cheap, but worth the savings in dental problems.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes fit my Elite perfectly, and cost a lot less than buying in the store. They come without all that annoying plastic packaging, too. I had bought an off-brand to try to save money, but the buzzing sound drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> They work great, as good as the original.&lt;br /&gt;I also signed up for the subscription, this will remind me to change them regularly.</li>
            <li> Yup . . . . these are the real deal . . .cheaper and much more convenient than buying at the big retailers . . .  recommended by my dentist . . .I still have all my teeth!</li>
            <li> my son just finished his second round of braces and kept hearing the same thing at his dental checkups - you&#x27;re not cleaning your teeth well enough. (no cavities though) His orthodontist finally recommended he try a Sonicare and his dentist lowered the level of criticism. We bought the brush in a 2 pack at a warehouse store so I gave the second one a try because my Braun Oral B was on its last legs. I wasn&#x27;t as happy with it - I couldn&#x27;t seem to remove a film from my teeth so I bought a new Oral B. My son now has a school Sonicare and a home one and we&#x27;re both happy. He recently had his brackets removed and shouldn&#x27;t burn through as many (expensive) brush heads. But it&#x27;s his only set of teeth so we&#x27;re all satisfied. If you use the Oral B and like it, I wouldn&#x27;t bother trying the Sonicare. If you have braces and are having trouble keeping the plaque down I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush but I do need to buy the plastic rubber cover to prevent water leaking into the system.    Stop working on July, still a good price For the price.</li>
            <li> Outstanding!  Best I have used in 65 years of brushing.  Wish I had purchased years ago. My wife agrees with me on this evaluation.</li>
            <li> Hope they&#x27;re good, CHRISTMAS gifts....so after Christmas I can write another review.   I did research and read reviews seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my Sonicare brush heads and at this price I would&#x27;t buy them anywhere else. Amazon Frustration-Free packaging is always great as well.</li>
            <li> It usually seems like when I order Sonicare replacement bruses on-line that I end up with the small-sized brushes.  These are the full-sized ones which I prefer.  Reasonable price and good replacements, so I am pleased.  RJB.</li>
            <li> In the stores they run about $20ish.  These are cheaper, so yay! Also it fits my model which is an Hx 7000. They were shipped free in a jiffy. I will continue to buy my replacements through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I always wait too long to replace these heads.  You don&#x27;t really realize just how worn out a head is until you replace.  What a difference the new one makes in just the first brushing!  Feels like you just came from the dentist.  Replace at regular intervals to get the most out of them.  It&#x27;s worth the expense.</li>
            <li> They came in very quickly.  They fit.  They work just like the original ones. I would use this service again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Remember the old saying, replace your toothbrush every 3 months.. well I find the sonicare brushes last a year between changes. These are good brushes and I immediately saw an improvement in the amount of tartar and plaque removed. Brushing is a joy once a gain.. however I wont go a year, I&#x27;ll do 9 month changes from now on.</li>
            <li> If you already have Philips Sonicare HX7002/30 e-Series, you will need to replace the heads at some point. These will keep your brush working.</li>
            <li> Have long been a user of Sonicare toothbrushes and have been more than satisfied with performance.  Comfortable to use, easy to clean. Recommend them strongly.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare and I love these replacement heads. Hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t stop carrying them. You just can&#x27;t find these in the store.</li>
            <li> No problems here. Works as advertised,  Comfortable and easy to use. I strongly recommend getting the Sonic Seals, and the UV Sanitizer if you purchase these. The Seals, especially will keep things a lot more tidy and save on maintenance.</li>
            <li> These things are just like they are imaged. I love the no hassle packaging... a brown box is easy to get open.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of these brushes are good and stiff. For the cost they are hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screw on heads are easy to replace and stay secure through the life of the brush. The indicator (although I always seem to use it was past its disappearance.) seems to wear off pretty soon after you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around cheap and fast way to get replacements, and sign up for the renewal... its cheaper and reminds you to replace your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is a toothbrush.  Used them for years with good results.  Lowest price I found was here at Amazon, like most things.</li>
            <li> Just as described; great product and good price. I also appreciated being able to select a cardboard box for packaging rather than plastic (waste).</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare just recently and so far it works very well. The brush itself is small and soft which I like. It does a great job of cleaning. There is a slight tickle feeling while brushing but you eventually get used to it. I think for the price it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for the Advance 4000. These heads have a different look, but fit just fine and do a great job getting the teeth and gums clean</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare....But when buying replacement brushes, I just hate wrangling with those nasty plastic contaners. This is perfect. No fuss packaging!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years, and so require periodic replacement heads.  Amazon had the best price and I received my order in just 2 days.  This product was recommended by my dentist and helps avoid receeding gums.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product a month and it stops after 30 seconds.  I restarted and it runs about 10 secs and stops.  After a couple times of that, it won&#x27;t run at all.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Thank God, they sell these 2 packs here, they are usually $25.00 per toothbrush head.  I love my Sonicare and will be buying my brush heads here from now on!  Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> I find these replacement heads are poorly made, I am not sure why. I thought at first it was one that was defective but with every replacement head the brissles come out which is one very annoying and uncomfortable when brushing my teeth. I will cancel any future orders.</li>
            <li> We love our sonicare.  And these refillable heads are fairly priced, especially by using the Subscribe &amp; Save program.  I always have a new head to assure I am getting a healthy brushing.  My dentist and I are thrilled with the improvement in my gums.  No more overbrushing!  No more cavities!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0046AAVR2 Philips Sonicare Hx7002/30 E-series Replacement Brush Head, White]]  I recommend electric toothbrushes in general. They really are the 21st century toothbrushes. You often do more harm than good with manual.  These replacement brushes as expected and work perfectly for the first couple of weeks. The magnetic connection seems to be less durable than before and the ability to deliver a strong charge seems to decline over time.The brushheads also seem to go out of shape much more easily. Not sure if they softened it or if quality has just dropped. I&#x27;ll still use them until my main unit fails.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes, but the replacement heads can be so expensive. Amazon has the cheapest price that I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting all of my replacement heads from Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  These are replacement heads.  I got them timely and intact.  They do the job.  This is an item you buy on price alone.  If this is the brush you need, buy this one if its the cheapest.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using a sonicare toothbrush for years. these heads are great replacement heads, and a good price on amazon. i recommend to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for taking care of your teeth.I fine this product helpful with my teeth.I recommend this item so I don&#x27;t need to buy it every so often.</li>
            <li> Subscribe &amp; Save is the way to go with the Sonicare replacement heads. It&#x27;s at least 1/3 less expensive. I&#x27;m not reviewing the replacement heads themselves because there is really no other choice for this model of Sonicare and I&#x27;m overall very happy with the Sonicare toothbrushes. They definitely get my teeth dentist clean.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, the correct replacement; had bought an off-brand replacement which didn&#x27;t work at all well.  that&#x27;s all folks, and I don&#x27;t appreciate being required to write a certain number of words.</li>
            <li> This was such a good buy, that I ordered 2 sets.  I was very pleased with the expediency in the order, as well as the quality of these items.  I will certainly order these again when needed.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush heads and nice to get a 2 pack so you don&#x27;t have to reorder for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program to get these every 6 months. Not only are they cheaper from amazon on this program, but I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy them now. Great program and great savings!</li>
            <li> will buy some more, actually i signed up for amazon fulfillment. i probably paid half what sonicare charge for these. happy camper here</li>
            <li> I Buy from amazon because of the price if I can get for about $10 a piece Im doing good freight included?</li>
            <li> The purchase was great as expected.  No complaints.  We certainly love using Sonicare and we continue to purchase these brushes.  We enjoy our experience with amazon.com because they deliver exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> If you are ordering the brush heads then chances are you already know how well the product works.  The brush heads arrived quickly and were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The philips electric tooth brush head set works well with Philips eSeries electric brusg bases. I use it for past several years and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> When I needed replacement brushes I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot so I went to Wal-Mart. There I was able to find an off-brand at a reasonable price. The next day when I tried them  I was immediately disappointed. The Sonicare made noise as if it were vibrating (the way it&#x27;s supposed to) but it wasn&#x27;t. I tried the second brush in the package and the same thing occurred. I wound up brushing manually, which defeats the purpose. I ret&#x27;d them the next day and ordered Philips brand thru Amazon and they work like they&#x27;re supposed to, maybe even better than new. I got exactly what I wanted and it wound up costing less than Wal-Mart&#x27;s off-brand.</li>
            <li> My Package arrived with only one brush head. The advertised unit is a two pack. The frustration free packaging is easy to open.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are BIG sonicare fans.  We&#x27;ve been using them for years, and love them.  They have made a big difference for our teeth.  It does take a bit of skill, as you can&#x27;t brush your teeth in the normal fashion.  If you do it right, one tooth at a time, they work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve signed up for Subscribe and Save, so these get shipped to us twice a year.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are smooth and fit perfectly into the base. I didn&#x27;t realize that I was using a replacement brush</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced my heads when I should so when I received these and started using them I realized what a great product this was coupled to my tooth brush. When they get old the brush part gets frayed and out of shape and also the mechanical parts just get worn and do not operate the brush properly. Get some new ones but don&#x27;t get the easy open package, it is anything but.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush.  These replacement heads fit like a charm.  The price was very reasonable and shipping was fast and packaged well.  I would definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Better than what I expected. Great Price. I would have to pay more than double at Walmart or other retailers. Arrived on time and perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase the Sonicare replacements. Sonicare came recommended by my dentist and I believe has saved my teeth. Toothbrushes are sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have used these Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for years. They have never failed me. I appreciate that they try to keep the head consistent among different models; but you still need to pay attention to the different series when you purchase the heads.     Overall they are good quality head and great toothbrushes. I would recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time. The quality was as desired although I expected a slightly lower price. I coud have gone to the local pharmacyand got the same item at the same price but the convenience was good. I was in no rush to get the item.</li>
            <li> If you have this toothbrush...this is the best place to get these replacement heads with no fuss (Amazon) packaging (you just have to select the option). It was easy to open as promised! And well priced (barring a Costco membership that is).</li>
            <li> We love these toothbrushes!  They make you feel like you just got out of the dentists office.  They stimilate the gums and give your teeth a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare still works nicely after several years, and I needed replacement heads. These new ones do not seem as rugid to me as the original ones, and they are expensive at nearly $11.00 each, especially if replacing one every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> these heads are to replace the worn out toothbrush head for the e-series sonic care toothbrush.  everyone should have at least a couple extra brush heads on hand.  you forget to replace it and it gets longer down the road and then youn have nothing but nubs left.  if you own a e-series buy a couple extra heads.  they be cheap and they work great.  pop off the old head and pop on the new head.  yes that simple</li>
            <li> I love my Phillips Sonic Care toothbrush and I was so pleased there are still replacement brushes available.&lt;br /&gt;My replacement brushes arrived within the stated time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I always trust Amazon.com to send me the real thing, at a good price, in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare brush for years.  I need replacement brushes and found what I needed at Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  Great dental check-ups.  No periodontal disease. I&#x27;ve made converts of the whole family.  We keep several replacement heads on hand.  Remember to change your brush head every three months - or sooner if the bristles look splayed. And if they do, lighten up!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Philips Sonicare Toothbrush.  I wasn&#x27;t too sure when I purchased it, but my dentist recommended it to me.  I love it! My daughter loves it too! The replacement toothbrushes are great.  This shipper was great. I highly recommend the toothbrush and the seller.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this set of replacements heads for my Sonicare from Amazon a \\&quot;few times\\&quot;(which translates to a couple of years)now,and have never been disappointed, or never had any problems receiving the merchandise shipped in anything other than perfect working order.  With gas prices on the rise, I so appreciate Amazon&#x27;s flawless performance in providing a service directly to my home that I can depend on for this particular item as well as others for a fair, and do-able price.  Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> There were no issues or surprises here.  The item shown is what we got.  Nothing could have gone any better.  Thanks Amazon, thanks Philips.</li>
            <li> These heads kinda suck. They are perfect as replacement heads for the crappy heads that originally came with your electronic brush but have much to be desired from a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these as bases for a Frankenstein brush that I make. You can pull the plastic tip off with pliers... this exposes a metal tang that the plastic was molded to. You can heat up this tang using a heat gun. Cut off the tip of a decent toothbrush, like an Oral-B pro, and insert the heated tang into the tip of the Oral-B. Let it cool and viola, you have a decent electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to last a lot longer as a Frankenstein, by the way.</li>
            <li> Amazon always surprises me with great prices.  I have compared prices on the toothbtrush refills and even with a coupon they were much cheaper.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this product is the price--I wish it were less expensive.  That said, the toothbrushes work extremely well.  Not only do they very effectively clean one&#x27;s teeth, they take the tedium out of toothbrushing.  I highly recommend this product and must say that this electric toothbrush is far superior than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just love ,my elecriic tooth brush and my teeth have never felt better. I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to go with my Philips Sonicare system and have not yet used it because the system came with one brush head which I have not changed yet. However, these replacement brush heads should work just as good as the original. Also, the price I paid for these replacements is a great savings compared to prices in the local stores. According to Philips Sonicare, a brush head should last about 3 months, so I have enough to last 9 months. I consider this to be a great bargain and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads work as good as the original one. I can&#x27;t tell if it is genuine or not but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is just what I ordered and it is worth the price. It was easy to order this product instead of going out to wsste my gas to get it.</li>
            <li> Great service, exactly as advertised, quick delivery , cheaper than Walmart. Easy to install, perfect fit, one in use, other as a backup. Change every six months, so I got a years supply.</li>
            <li> No problem at all with these.  The price is the best I found even compared to discount stores.  The order got lost so had to be re-sent but the customer service was great.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great, just like the original one that came with the toothbrush.  You can purchase these at any general store but I found the Amazon price to be the best.</li>
            <li> The newly re-designed brush heads allow build up of gunk inside the toothbrush.  The seals are not that great.  I can get them clean, but others have expressed they have trouble cleaning them.  My issue is that because of the buildup, mold develops inside the brush, and even after cleaning, the smell will not go away.  I threw out the rest and currently using a different brush until I find a replacement sonic brush.  The old style was just fine.  I don&#x27;t know why Philips had to change it and ruin a good product.</li>
            <li> I needed some replacements a while back and bought some cheap ones that were compatible at tar-zhay. They were insanely loud and felt cheap. So it&#x27;s nice to come back to these \\&quot;real\\&quot; replacements. Much quieter and they feel like they&#x27;re doing more (although that last part could be psychosomatic?)</li>
            <li> I can review the brush heads, but they are really secondary.  The brush heads work fine.  I typically get about 3 months out of one before I need to replace.  They don&#x27;t \\&quot;wear out\\&quot; per say in that time period (not like regular brushes which start splaying or losing bristles) but they do start not working as well.  If I wait the full 3 months and then swap to a new one, I can immediately tell a difference.    Overall the brush itself is fantastic.  It cleans my teeth very well, and gives me a near dentist clean feeling (that slick teeth feeling) every time I use it.  I bought this after a relative recommended it and like others the first time I used it I was a little horrified because using it tickled my nose REALLY badly.  So much so that I thought I would not be able to use it.    However, if this happens to you just keep using it.  After 2 or 3 days the feeling will go away and never return.      One other thing I read about is that the design causes some nasty building below the brushhead.  I can confirm this is true.  I&#x27;ve solved this problem more or less by brushing my teeth in the morning when I want to change the brush head, then opening it up and washing the inside with very hot water, then soaking it upside down in a couple of inches of hydrogen peroxide in a cup.  I&#x27;ve done this for more than a year with no damage caused to the handle unit.    This more or less takes care of the gross factor.      This was also my first time using the scheduled delivery service, which at least for the first delivery worked great.  I have them sending me 2 brush heads every 6 months, since that coincides perfectly with my schedule and I get them at a great price to boot!</li>
            <li> My dentists and hygienists have been recommending Philips Sonicare for years. My previous dentist, in Orange County, CA, said that if everyone used these, almost no one would have periodontal disease. I have had very good results, with brushing, flossing and using Listerine twice a day. The Amazon service, through UPS, was right on time and in the right place.</li>
            <li> I have received a counterfeit product.  One out of the two replacement brush heads were not of Philips Sonicare quality.  I am a long time user of these products and noticed a dramatic difference in the two replacement brushes.  Also only one of the two replacement brushes actually had E-series printed on it which demonstrates that it was not authentic. Hope this review help future buyers.  Thank you for your time.</li>
            <li> If you are buying these you already know what they are and how they work.  They are a good value and come in amazon frustration free packaging.  If you need them do yourself a favor and buy them on amazon rather than from Ebay were there is a good chance they were ripped off from a drugstore.</li>
            <li> We do like the brushing action of the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes - ours are several years old and still going strong (different heads of course!).  The Subcribe and Save option makes it easy to remember when to replace the heads - just have them delivered at the frequency you prefer to change toothbrush heads.  The Frustration Free packaging is also a nice option - so much easier to get at the product.</li>
            <li> as expected - perfect for smiley white teeth :D</li>
            <li> Quality product, I recently tried out some non name brand heads and it was easy to see how these toothbrush heads stand superior.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brushes since they are about $5-6 cheaper on amazon than at a store. However, it took a week for them to arrive. They didn&#x27;t even ship until the expected arrival date. Definately not worth waiting a week to save $5.     The brushes also come in a generic brown cardboard box, not the actual Sonicare package.</li>
            <li> I have used the new brush head for about three weeks now, and it seems to be wearing out much faster than my previous ones. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s made differently or what. It&#x27;s a bit disappointing because it takes longer and is more difficult than it used to be to remove plaque with it. I will continue using it and the product in the hope that this is just an anomaly.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering replacement heads, as my sonicare is several years old.  However they came in sealed packaging and work like a charm.  I am very pleased with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This item set out to be fairly good value until the postman arrived with it. I had to pay another £12+ to Royal Mail for delivery. As I had already paid p &amp; p &amp; duty, I didn&#x27;t expect anything else to pay. I will never order anything from U.S. again this is not the first time I have encountered extra costs and this makes the item expensive.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, and it was a great price compared to other stores. It arrived quickly actually a day ahead of the anticipated date! Definetly suggest!</li>
            <li> This has been a very satisfactory product.  It fits in the unit I already have, and it is free from defects.</li>
            <li> this is a great product at a great price, very fast delivery. Definitely would buy again. Works great in multiple models of phillip sonicare products.  Whats not to like, it is all bueno.</li>
            <li> We decided to do the subscribe and save on these. They come straight from Sonicare in the frustration-free packaging. You can choose how often you want the subscription to come, which is perfect for replacement toothbrush heads... Not to mention, it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy them online. No shipping or tax. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Sonicare for years and I&#x27;m a firm believer that it has improved the health of our teeth and gums. Recently we tried Target&#x27;s Up &amp; Up generic heads and they were AWFUL! They didn&#x27;t form a tight seal with the plastic threading and just vibrated making a ton of noise and ineffective brushing. Amazon has a great price, especially if you do Subscribe &amp; Save so don&#x27;t go cheap on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a sonic care for many years. Once you&#x27;re used to it, nothing else &#x27;ll do. The heads last a long time, 6-8 months, and when you change them its a great feeling. Here at Amazon, you get a good deal and really fast service!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and received exactly what I ordered.  I ordered this product before the cost is better than what I could pay for this product in the store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper (and much easier to find) on Amazon, plus you can do the 6 month subscription plan and forget about it!  There&#x27;s not much more to expect- it&#x27;s the actual Soniccare replacement brush.  For a review on that, it doesnt exactly what you would want- replace your brush head!</li>
            <li> Love it because it forces me to brush correctly.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> ...Just as I like &#x27;em!  I bought these replacement heads for my newly purchased Philips Sonicare Xtreme e3000 Power Toothbrush. They arrived within a week, and fit perfectly into the mechanical part of the brush.</li>
            <li> If you own a Sonicare, you know about this product. There really isn&#x27;t anything to review on this product since you all should already know about it. All I can say about it is this is the BEST PRICE anywhere for the 2 heads, and they come with the plastic covers like all the rest. I will continue to replace my heads via Amazon if the price continues to be this low.</li>
            <li> Besides having one of the lowest prices online that I could find, I also was able to receive my package before the intended arrival date! I am very happy with my new toothbrush as well! A+!</li>
            <li> As ordered. Ordered on Fri. received it on Mon. w/ Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in a sealed tamper-taped box. Just like the original heads I got with the base.</li>
            <li> I always check prices and this was the best buy. Always keep extra brush heads on hand. This is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Order filled correctly.  Product received as advertised.  Very satisfied customer.  Would definately recommend this vendor and product to all interested.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes work great and sometimes with the subscribe and save offers, amazon offers a better price than other retailers.  The brushes last about 3-6 months with regular use.  It is more expensive than a regular toothbrush but it seems worth it.  Your teeth feel much cleaner after using the sonicare toothbrushes.  The packaging was also easy to open without the plastic blisterpack.  Shipping was also quick.</li>
            <li> I was buying these relacement heads at Target but they cost about $17 each. I tried the generic brand and was terribly disappointed in them. Thanks to Amazon, I have these on Subscribe and Save and they get shipped to my home. Love the convenience!</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare. I was glad to be able to find this product so easily and avoid paying the ridiculous prices in brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the Hx700L/30 E-series toothbrush replacement heads from Amazon delivered to me  on November 26, 2011. I don&#x27;t find the bristles as soft as the other E-series replacement heads purchased by me. As a matter of fact the new bristles are so hard that my dentist informed me that I was brushing my gums away:( The problem is that since the brush heads should be replaced every 3 months I ordered this item as a repeat order. I don&#x27;t know why these brush heads are so different and what to expect from the next order. If the future brush heads bristles are of the same quality, please cancel my order.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, and these replacement heads are really inexpensive over the long haul. Think of it as an small investment now so you don&#x27;t end up paying thousands later for dental work. I&#x27;d much, MUCH rather pay the $10/head now than pay the hundreds (or thousands) later for dental work! I love the fact that the brush not only cleans my teeth, but makes sure my gums stay in shape as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have each used a Sonicare brush for the past dozen years.  We love &#x27;em.  After checking other local stores, this was the best deal for us for replacement brush heads.  The product arrived 3 days after order and we are completely pleased.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads stopped working in a week. I have just started using the second brush head and don&#x27;t know how long it will last. I have been using Sonicare for a few years and have bought brush heads from other retailers and this has never happened. I am not sure if the one I received is defective or was damaged by Amazon while preparing their \\&quot;Frustration free packaging\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive but the quality is superb compare to the department store brand and as long as it helps me keep my tooth healthy I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0046AAVR2 Philips Sonicare HX7002/30 e-Series Replacement Brush Heads, 2-Pack (Frustration Free Packaging)]]After brushing my teeth for decades with a standard toothbrush, cleaner teeth came with less work. When an electric toothbrush was recommended to me, I was skeptical at first because of the huge cost compared with my old toothbrush. Thinking about how important a clean bright smile is to your health and the person standing in front of you, it only seemed right to spend more on this tool. Brushing now takes less work, which is a good thing because working so hard to brush your teeth is unnecessary these days. And the timed operating cycle keeps you brushing for the best results. You know fatigue causes brushing time to be cut short, Philips Sonicare solves this issue. Go get a set and see the difference powerbrushing will make on your choppers.</li>
            <li> I WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.  FIRST, THE PRICE AT THE TIME WAS UNBELIEVABLE. NEXT THE PACKAGING WAS EXCELLENT. NONE OF THAT HORRIBLE PLASTIC COATED RIDICULOUSLY SEALED PACKAGING THAT YOU HAVE TO HURT YOURSELF TO GET TO THE PRODUCT. AND THE PRODUCT ITSELF WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND PERFORMED BEAUTIFULLY.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
            <li> After I bought my brush head replacements at the store I checked on Amazon, and I&#x27;m very glad I did. The cost was much cheaper. I also like to get the frustration free packaging and I just signed up for the subscription so I could get them on a regular basis and save a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads fit my Sonicare Essence perfectly. They are direct replacements. The only thing I wish Philips would make is a selection of brush head softness I find that when they are brand new they can be a little too stiff for about the first 1-2 weeks. After it gets used for about the first week or two, it is about perfect.</li>
            <li> i am using Sonicare for several years. It seems to be a decline in quality. The toothbrush head is wearing out in less than a month. Although, supposedly, it should last and be changed once in 3 months. Like I did before with my other Sonicare toothbrush. Disappointed, but already have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried generic replacement heads on my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush in the past but they don&#x27;t compare to the one made by Phillips.  They&#x27;re quieter, last longer and do an overall better job.  I will continue to buy the real thing and give up on the generic ones.</li>
            <li> The extra brushes were at a good price and the Sonicare tooth brush system was a great purchase - great price and performance!</li>
            <li> This product makes it so easy to keep brushing your teeth&lt;br /&gt;and also it is fun and you always know thjat you are brushing the correct time needed to do the job correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased store brand replacement brush heads and they sucked.  As expensive as these brush heads get, especially when you have two sets of brushes to replace, finding these original ones at Amazon for the price that they are, I couldn&#x27;t pass them up.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is really good.  I have some gum rescission that I am hoping will be halted or reversed.  I will see.  Have been using the brush for about 3 months now.  It cleans VERY well and seems pretty gentle, although it feels like you have a wasp in your mouth.  It lasts very long out of the charger (at least 3 weeks) so trips are possible without the induction charger (no wires attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the hardest things is finding the correct heads. Philips uses BIZARRE numbering system that doesn&#x27;t match up with base.  I had to check 2 sites to see if these were OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy a LOT of conventional toothbrushes for $30 !</li>
            <li> Good price on this replacement, especially if you can wait on the free shipping. I think I like the frustration-free packaging, and it is more environmentally friendly. I had purchased the Wal-Mart Equate replacement for the same price, and they were horrible. Very noisy and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have used other power brushes this one makes your teeth feel smooth and clean from the best cleaning you have ever had!!!</li>
            <li> The quality of the Philips Sonic brushes from Amazon are excellent.  They are much better than the WalMart and Target home brands.  It is worth paying a bit more for the originals.  The Philips product has longer lasting brushes and are quieter in use.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are excellent and I almost always find them cheapest on Amazon.  They arrived quickly as per the shipping estimate.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my hubby since his teeth always give him troubles. He loves it and feel it really works. But it take some time before he used to it (like about one week). I tried it once and felt the power is really strong, whick viberated my head like an earthquake.</li>
            <li> These are not factory seconds - these are quality! Will reorder this product for my Phillips Sonicare E series toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast. It looks legit but would wish it would came with the original box.&lt;br /&gt;I hope its the original not an imitation brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with the generic version of these brushes so I buy these Philips replacement heads.  Currently, they&#x27;re going for about 10 dollars per brush which seems like a lot, but they last 3 months per head.  I would like to see the price drop or find a generic head that works as well, but until then 10 dollars per head is not such a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I echo many of the others in saying that Sonicare products are superior to manual brushing in nearly every aspect. Imperical and anecdontal evidence both confirm that toothbrushes such as these get your teeth cleaner, massage your gums, and protect your mouth from gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will mention that you MUST be diligent in keeping the heads and handle as dry as possible after cleaning, or they develop mildew and mold inside the brush head - which isn&#x27;t good for anyone to have in his or her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that higher-end Sonicare models do a better job in being watertight in the brushheads, but the Essence models have to be cleaned with care.</li>
            <li> If I didnt&#x27; already own this sonicare, I&#x27;d get the new ones with the smaller and much less expensive heads.  But these are the ones that fit the one I have, and my only objection is the price.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my transaction and experience. A good product that met the description given. my package arrived in a timely manner, within the window that was given.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer for these replacement heads.  They do not work exactly like new, but they work fine for my \\&quot;outdated\\&quot; base unit.</li>
            <li> Would be better if each replacement head had changeable color codes. Also option for an odd number of replacement heads would be helpful.</li>
            <li> The brushes work well, but they do not last more than 3 months.  Unfortunately, the price went up approximately five dollars more than the order my friend received for me in North Carolina.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sonic e series toothbrush for many years now and I love it. The only complaint I had was the cost of the replacement heads. Most stores want 22.00-28.00 dollars for 1 head. With Amazon you get 2 heads for less than that. Love my sonic and love amazon....</li>
            <li> it is similar to the original one. works fine. no problem. will recommend this brush to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;buy this brush if you need one. solid build</li>
            <li> These are the heads I&#x27;ve been looking for all over the place and finally found them here at the lowest price. The bristles are just the right size for my mouth. the packaging is clean and crisp. I love my phillips sonic toothbrush.  they were shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> The proof of the value of the Phillips Sonic toothbrush is in the excellent reviews that we get from our dentist.  Love it!</li>
            <li> good price and fast service what else could one ask for</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare tooth brush for many years and love it. I had not replaced the brush head for a long time, I can&#x27;t remeber how long, and when I saw them on Amazon at such a great price I purchased them. The product arrived just as scheduled, and when I tried the new brush head out I could not believe what a difference it made in the cleaning of my teeth.</li>
            <li> In the past I had purchased some replacement heads because they were cheap and I got the short brushes. I hated them it was like brushing your hair after you had 6 inches cut off! I actually scuffed my gums because I was not use to using the short heads. Then I saw these on Amazon for a great price so I signed up for auto ship when I was sure they were the proper heads. They are wonderful! I think my teeth are even cleaner...highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> A great way to receive a great product. Each head comes wrapped in a sealed plastic bag &amp; securely held in a strong cardboard box. There is minimal waste - 2 small plastic bags &amp; a small cardboard box which can be recycled. A practical way to be &#x27;green&#x27; &amp; to decrease the load on the landfill. I wish more products would be packaged in this way.</li>
            <li> These are the real ones and they work. They are WAY better than the Equate knock-offs from Walmart. But on to why I give them only 3 stars. Water/toothpaste/drool get&#x27;s down around the shaft and runs into the head causing mold to grow inside them. I even take them off and leave them to air dry when not being used and still get the mold. I put some silicone sealer around the little colored bands to see if it helps. So far, so good. Just make sure you don&#x27;t seal the lower gap, because they need to be able to spin there for you to screw the heads on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The silicone trick works great. No more water getting down inside an causing a moldy mess. The silicone will not stick well and will easily turn on the neck, but it still keeps the water out. I&#x27;m happy I found a quick and easy fix.</li>
            <li> exactly what i had expected.  perfect replacement for my toothbrush.  exactly like the one that came from the factory.  next time though, i will probably buy from walmart.  just found identical product from an aftermarket brand, 2 of the replacement heads for $17.</li>
            <li> What can I say. Been a Sonicare devotee for years. Always searching for the best bargain on replacement bush heads and found them on Amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Items worked perfectly! I needed to replace mine, and getting two in the package was well worth it. Fast shipping. Everything worked well.</li>
            <li> The best brush heads on the market.Don&#x27;t kid yourself you can try other products but in my opinion nothing compares to Sonic brushes .I can&#x27;t complain about the price. You get what you pay for and using them properly can save hundreds of dollars if not more in dental visits.Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this version of Philips toothbrushes are outdated. Gunk does build up between the head and the base with this model, but the electric brush has a made a huge difference in my dentist trips. These brushes are on the small and soft side, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have always used a Sonicare toothbrush and Amazon is the best place to get replacement heads. Good quality and a good price.</li>
            <li> Great purchase and price!!</li>
            <li> They work fine, unlike non-Philips products that are meant to replace them but are not quite the same.  To clarify, those are the real deal and work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price for these expensive heads. They work well though.</li>
            <li> If my dentist and periodontist recommend it....then it is good enough for me.  My cleanings have never bee this easy since using Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Philips should provide an easy way to identify these brush heads.  My wife and I are sharing the same brush.  There is no way of telling the heads apart.  I ended-up marking them with a permanent marker ... but it is clearly not the most elegant system.</li>
            <li> I use my Sonicare every day.  It makes the dentist happy and these replacement heads make me happy.  It&#x27;s not fun, but it&#x27;s necessary, and keeping the price down is the best part of this equation. Amazon came through with good pricing, and of course quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I used these e series replacement head and they are great.  I replace my brush every six months as recommended by my Periodonist.</li>
            <li> Expensive replacements and they end up getting really really dirty if you don&#x27;t maintain them. I guess thats what you get for buying sonic brand items that cost a fortune for upkeep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sonicare since the inception - I love it.  These replacement heads are just what they say they are and they last a long time - about six months I think.  The price is much better here than - &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was a nice bargain,and they worked perfectly in my electric&lt;br /&gt;tooth brush holder.  I have tried the generic brands, however they&lt;br /&gt;really do not work well. There is a definite difference in the vibrations felt&lt;br /&gt;on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had my sonicare since 2006.  I have had it repaired and its still going strong.  I like being able to find low cost replacement heads for my brush.</li>
            <li> Standard tooth brush replacement heads that are well priced and arrived with good attention to packaging so that the heads were undamaged and worked when installed.</li>
            <li> they are used as replacements on my toothbrush, so far I got no complaints, whatsoever. got them on the subscribe and save plan.</li>
            <li> Yes the brush heads are expensive and yes they could be sold for less, but I think it is important to reward companies that put out creative and effective products for better health.  This might encourage more ingenuity!  And after all, they are not a volunteer organization, they are a business and want to make a profit.  Wouldn&#x27;t you?  In short I don&#x27;t mind paying \\&quot;more than I think I should pay\\&quot; for healthy teeth and superior oral hygiene.  Thank you Sonicare, 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Excellent product; excellent price. Best toothbrush I have ever used, with my impression confirmed by my dental hygienist. reduces gum inflammation, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used off brand replacements for slightly less money and they are terrible! Thank you, Amazon, for providing the genuine replacements at a nice price in an easy to open box.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive product that works great.</li>
            <li> These are the legit ones, sometimes it can be hard to find the real ones but these are it Works great!</li>
            <li> According to my dentist, my gums have been healthier since I started using the Sonicare toothbrush (even though my flossing habits haven&#x27;t changed). I&#x27;m not a dentist, but her comment is enough for me. Besides, my mouth feels cleaner using it than I could ever get it with manual brushing. Obviously, the brush heads are a part of this, and that&#x27;s why they earn a 5-star rating from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(These heads have the &amp;#34;disappearing ink&amp;#34; bristles that gradually lose their color and supposedly tell you when it&#x27;s time for a new brush head. I have no idea how long it really takes for the color to go away, as I change my brush head by the calendar instead.)</li>
            <li> I replace my heads every 5 months or so, and I really like these. The sonicare system works well, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I use these daily and trust they are doing a fine job of keeping my teeth clean.  thank you for prompt service.</li>
            <li> love...... love .....love... this product, this was my very first purchase of a electric toothbrush Sonicare and boy does it do everything it says it does, my dentists bill went down due to less visits to the dentist office due to great checkups ever since I started using this product. I have seen other electric tooth brushes but none that due the job this one does, not only does it work great but it feels great, had mine for quite some time now &amp; it is still working today, no battery&#x27;s needed just plug it in &amp; charge lasts for ever. I highly recommend Sonicare for everyone who cares about their teeth. fantastic product, &amp; for the seller I like to say thank you for your prompt delivery &amp; for carrying such a great product will be bk for replacements soon.</li>
            <li> I would not use anything other than sonicare products. No longer have any issues, only excellent checkups when I have to go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. IT WORKS GREAT ON OUR SONICARE.  IT WAS A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER STORE WE WENT TO.</li>
            <li> I have (and love) my old Phillips Advance model toothbrush.  Since they quit making heads for it several years ago, I have had to order replacements from eBay - at a premium price.  Now they have re-tooled the E-Series head to fit an Advance body and it works perfectly.  Main difference is the overall size of the bristles, which is smaller.  Not a problem for me though, and costs considerably less...</li>
            <li> Arrived within two days and fits perfectly.  The bristles are a bit softer than the original but they feel great.  this was a better price than available at the stores.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I searched several stores for this item. The prices I observed seemed way out of line. I found that through Amazon I could purchase this item saving approximately 1/2 the best price I had found thus far.</li>
            <li> I own a Philips Sonicare Essence HX5351 Power Toothbrush. These brush head replacements are great[[ASIN:B0046AAVR2 Philips Sonicare Hx7002/30 E-series Replacement Brush Head, White]] . Philips offers different types of brush heads but I prefer this one; The bristles are firm without being rough on gums and teeth, yet soft enough not to bother gums, inner cheek or tongue. There is a color strip indicator which lets you know when it&#x27;s about time to replace the brush head (they still work the same for a while longer; about the time you&#x27;ll find them at a good sale price from Amazon.com (POP) even though if you registered your toothbrush Philips also sends you a coupon in time). The shape of this brush conforms with teeth and seems to get between the teeth better than a flat brush. The head is small enough to get back behind molars,too. This brush head makes my teeth feel very clean, resulting in my brushing more than twice a day (there is a portable case for using away from home and nice cap to keep brush covered that allows air flow to keep it dry that is included).</li>
            <li> Good quality at a great price. These replacements are the same they sell at stores but, much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for years, and when I recently replaced my brush, I was excited to see that I could get compact heads for the elite series.  I was sold.  The compact brush heads are great for reaching every surface, even the very back.</li>
            <li> Works great as replacement heads. Also, if you&#x27;re looking at doing the generics I would recommend against them as these are far less noisy.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, these were not as good as the ones we buy in the store.  The magnetic strip came off of 1 of the 4 we ordered. On a second one, the neck separates from the wider body. That issue is easily remedied by pushing the brush neck back in, but still, that never happened with the ones we bought in the store.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrush heads.  If you already use this toothbrush I&#x27;m sure you know how good it is.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. The product replaced a broken one so be gentle when brushing and you won&#x27;t need to replace it as quickly as we did.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Fast shipping and works just fine. Much better deal than other retailers I have seen. I don&#x27;t recommend buying the non-name brand for the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> it is great to get these on a subscription, no more trying to remember when i changed the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is regarded by the dental profession as one of the most effective methods for cleaning the teeth and mainlining healthy gums.  These replacement heads were exactly what we needed for peak efficiency.  They were priced reasonably and were delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> It was like getting a whole new toothbrush.  The new bristles add such a needed boost to my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> We had a Walgreen&#x27;s store brand before this.  (Vibrating tooth brush.)  Brushes no longer available.  This is a whole lot better in cleaning and is much stronger.  And very easy to change brush heads - (share w. wife).&lt;br /&gt;  We both follow up using a waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;  Only problem is it just comes w. one brush head.  Had to order 2 extras - you just can&#x27;t order 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A REVIEW OF THE TOOTH BRUSH ITSELF - NOT THE BRUSH HEADS.  I FILED IT UNDER THE WRONG ITEM AND CAN&#x27;T DELETE IT.</li>
            <li> These fit on my sonicare, which of course is the whole point. I haven&#x27;t needed to replace them yet because I am still using the original.</li>
            <li> They were little smaller size than the initial tooth brush but did the job regardless.  I bought 2 sets and received them fast.</li>
            <li> The brushes were the right size and fit my unit.  The brushes last for me about 2 months and then I change them to keep the brush stiff</li>
            <li> We bought some off brand replacement heads that made a horrible chatter when the brush was turned on.  Had to go back to the sonicare heads. Wish they were a little less pricey.</li>
            <li> Great buy!  We bought the brushes from Amazon last year and was pleased to know that we could so easily get the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I bought these at the same time I purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush, so I haven&#x27;t actually used these replacement heads yet.  My past experiences with Sonicare toothbrushes and replacement brushes have all been very good so I expect these will also be great.</li>
            <li> All in all these are really good replacement heads and a decent price at that. Sonicare has been worth its weight in gold for me. I have deep grooves and can brush until the cows come home and end up still getting cavities. Since purchasing the Sonicare I have been doing so much better!</li>
            <li> Must have for replacement tips</li>
            <li> Lasted a year although Philips recommended to replace every 90days(marketing scam)</li>
            <li> Teeth - gotta brush &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads for my Sonicare toothbrush work as designed and arrived promptly.  The are less expensive than those I find locally.</li>
            <li> I bought these cause I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $50+ at Costco on the huge multi-pack. They clean my teeth like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have a disability that doesn&#x27;t allow me to shop in the stores often, so when I need a replacement head for my Sonicare, I don&#x27;t want to have to search for one.  Having them delivered to my door on a regular basis assures that I will always have the replacement when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare tooth brush for several years. Love the way it cleans but hate the cost of refills. I was excited to find them at this price.</li>
            <li> It works as it should.  I have had no problems.  They fit the toothbrush.  I will order from here again.</li>
            <li> Good price on set, although I may be able to find one with three brush heads for around the same price, with a coupon, elsewhere.  I am also wondering if these are authentic Philips Sonicare brand, they seem to work a little different in the unit as far as battery life, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads when I bought my Sonicare unit and it is a better deal than I could find locally.</li>
            <li> Love the replacement brushes for the Sonicare E-series. It is a great deal on the Sonicare replacement brushes. I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping local for these replacement heads and they seemed to be way too pricey, took a look on Amazon and two for the same price as one at my local stores.  Bam I ordered them and am totally satisfied. Thank you amazon !</li>
            <li> I received my supposedly \\&quot;new\\&quot; sonicare replacement toothbrushes that were not in the original packaging and had been put in new packaging.  Given that this is an item that goes in your mouth I think it is unreasonable and unsanitary that this item be re-sold without its original packaging.  I never would have ordered this item if I known that you repackaged a dental tooth brush.   I now know why you picture the two replacement toothbrushes without being in their original package</li>
            <li> This seller had just what I needed at a good price, plus the shipping was right on time. I will definitely look for this seller again on Amazon when I am ready to reorder. The only reason I didn&#x60;t  give the review 5 stars, is after all it is just a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good price. Good product. It fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> love my brush heads!  the price was truly better on line than in the store.&lt;br /&gt;the only negative comment would be that they seem to wear faster than&lt;br /&gt;the original head.</li>
            <li> See comments made earlier. These replacements brushes are as good as the original brushes and do a good job of getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Like everything that sonicare does, these are well crafted tips that last 6 months each. However, they are a bit bulky. I have since moved to flexcare which uses the slim tips.</li>
            <li> Its virtues are that it fits on the handle,&lt;br /&gt;and lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Its problem is that it leaks substantially&lt;br /&gt;with each use and requires the Sonic Seal.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush is excellent. I am glad to get the brush refills easily so I don&#x27;t have to buy a new Sonicare. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are inexpensive and work well.  I love my sonicare toothbrush.  I will continue to reorder twice a year</li>
            <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my son along with a whole new Sonicare at the same time. So excited that this is such a great bargain !!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Sonicare Replacement Brush Heads at Target and paid $28.00-$30.00 for 2 brush heads.  I bought a two pack for both of my kids for Christmas @$20.00 each from Amazon, great deal!</li>
            <li> As advertised and at a decent price.  Regularly replacing the brush head is necessary for effective stain removal with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> No problems at all, fit like the old ones.  Super good buy and I have them on a 6 mo. auto refill......</li>
            <li> I like the ease of replacing the heads.  Large threads make it easy to change and remove for cleaning. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Purchased original brushes online, now ready for new heads... very happy with these, just as great as the originals.  Frustration free packaging is great!  Very happy with these, will be ordering more for sure!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and always get a great check up.&lt;br /&gt;MY dentist thinks I am doing great.</li>
            <li> I have an old Sonicare and these replacement brushes are more sleek than the original. Easier to get everywhere in my mouth with this style brush. I love the results I get with Sonicare!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been brushing with Sonicare for over 20 years.  Love the brushes but love it even more saving money!  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t come in fancy packaging doesn&#x27;t bother me at all!  I&#x27;ll order this product again.</li>
            <li> Beware -- Wal Mart has begun selling a knock-off version of these under the Equate brand, for around $17.XX per pair.  They do not work as well as this OEM Philips version (I bought a pair of the knockoffs and threw them away)... for some reason the knock-offs do not have as much &#x27;power&#x27;, especially when trying to brush the back side of your teeth.  The Equates are getting horrible reviews on the Wal Mart site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it looks like, 2 Sonicare replacement heads.  Heads fit the Sonicare I have perfectly and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Seem to be the same ones I used to be able to get at the drug store.  Stay away from the generic ones from Wal-Mart, they didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I bought these extra replacement heads for my Philips&lt;br /&gt;electric toothbrushes, and am very pleased with them&lt;br /&gt;They work very well -- just as well as the heads supplied&lt;br /&gt;with the original toothbrushes.  They fit perfectly onto the&lt;br /&gt;original toothbrush.  They do an excellent job of keeping&lt;br /&gt;my teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very good -- great packaging and fast&lt;br /&gt;service.  No complaints from me at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High recommendation for this product and for the seller!</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes function fine.</li>
            <li> Wife and I love our Sonicare, and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s prices for the replacement brushes.  Yeah, they are expensive compared to a manual toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a cavity and I give a lot of the credit to the job these brushes do.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a replacement head? Not much other than the fact that they work like the originals. They do.</li>
            <li> I like the hassle free packaging, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any of the replacement heads I&#x27;ve received and I like how clean theses brushes clean my teeth. The only problem I have is I keep getting charged and I keep receiving replacement heads. Not that I mind because I always have a new head when I want one, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to cancel these orders.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. So, that&#x27;s the part I love. But, the replacement heads for these things are ridiculously overpriced. It reminds me of razor blade refills. You pay $8 for the razor and $20 for the blades. I wish that these things could come down in price to like $7. All they are is a bunch of plastic and some magnets. Probably costs them .80 cents to manufacture. Whatever..... just my rant. The package arrived on time and in good condition. The product was exactly as described and it works great in my Phillips Sonicare Elite toothbrush. What choice do you have? Buy it.</li>
            <li> I love my electric toothbrush and miss it when I am traveling and have to use a traditional brush. These heads are easy to remove and easy to put on-- twist off and twist back on. I like the fact they come in a two pack because it is always good to be one ahead. Dentists recommend changing your toothbrush once a month so a 2 pack would give you a 2 month supply.</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed all of our experience with the sonicare line of products. Have had our e-series toothbrushes for about five years and like how easy it is to find replacement brush heads. Have found the best prices to be at Costco.</li>
            <li> My dentist said the sonic toothbrushes are the best so I knew I had purchased the right product!  It is quiet to use and feels good on the gums.  I am on the auto ship so I know when to replace the head and that is something less to remember!</li>
            <li> We have used the Sonicare HX7002/30 for many years recommend it. It is a great toothbrush product. We replace the brushes quarterly</li>
            <li> You almost have to buy this when you first buy your electric toothbrush they last so long which is great you save a lot compare to regular toothbrush which seem to get worn out way way faster than these. So you end up spending more on regular toothbrushes so it&#x27;s totally worth the money you actually saving more money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying a knock off brand from the supermarket to save $. Do not do that. Buy the real thing and you will be so much happier. They work perfectly. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wrote a review, somehow many don&#x27;t make it as done so write this to show I am annoyed and get it off the undone list.&lt;br /&gt;See the ratings, that alone says it all.</li>
            <li> I always keep coming back to Amazon for more. I have used soniccare for a couple of years and have been very satisfied. The replacement brushes are pretty expensive and these 2 pack is reasonably prices. It was shipped and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Over priced. Sam&#x27;s club has generics that are far less costly and work well.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was convinced that these replacement heads (\\&quot;E-series\\&quot;) would not fit my old Sonicare brush base, which I think dates from before 2007. It is the kind where the brush head is perfectly veritical (no angle). From the Sonicare pictures I now think maybe it is one of the \\&quot;Advance\\&quot; series - I can&#x27;t tell from the markings on the brush base itself, and the packaging is long gone. (See photos I have posted which shows the old base and head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, after reading someone else&#x27;s review that made the claim that this replacement head would fit the older base, I decided to give them a try and found that the reviewer was right. It was such a relief, because I love my Sonicare, and those old-style replacement heads were becoming difficult to find; and when I did find them, they were outlandishly priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new replacement head works just as well as the old one. If I have to replacement every three months, that&#x27;s fine. I agree with other reviewers - it&#x27;s a small price to pay to avoid high dental bills.</li>
            <li> Shopped around and this was the best price I could find for these namebrand toothbrush replacements for the Philips Sonicare e-series replacement brush. No complaints. Go ahead and order them.</li>
            <li> I am okay with the toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t know what else I can say except that it does the job..</li>
            <li> Great results from this toothbrush, and buying the replacement brushes on Amazon makes sense as the price is very good!</li>
            <li> It was a replacement for my Philips Sonicare heads.  They are not designed well as scum accumulates under the head.  I have read that this happens with others.  I wrote to Philips and they said to take the head off when not in use.  They did not admit to a faulty design.  When the gadget breaks, I will replace it with a different brand.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Cleans teeth thoroughly and the brush heads have a long life. Small heads are good for small people</li>
            <li> this is a very good product and a very reasonable price. i wood recommend this product and purchase some more.</li>
            <li> great replacement brushes and an outstanding price.  Love it being delivered on autoship.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  Your dentist will tell you how good this product is</li>
            <li> The two brush heads were in a well sealed box so they did not get damaged.  They were wrapped in plastic also.  They seem to work fine, no problems.  Sonicare is supposed to be really good for getting rid of plaque.</li>
            <li> This type is not used as much as newere models, but it works great and has been for a long time.</li>
            <li> Been using the brush heads for years and love them.  But I was missing an entire brush head....what up with that?</li>
            <li> Love my elite tooth brush! MAKE sure you take the brush off few times a week water can get inside and slow down the brush. I keep an old brush and use it as a facial tool feels good on my face and under my eyes and eye brows... I use ivory soap body wash to brush my teeth, I have never had whiter plaque free teeth ever.. google Dr Judd and great teeth for life with soap!!</li>
            <li> Not sealed well. Charger designed for standing brush upright, so after brushing, if replaced onto charger, liquid will roll down brush head, inside the toothbrush, and very quickly you get mold. Very poorly designed from this perspective. I&#x27;ve since stopped using these.</li>
            <li> They are replacement brushes they work just as the original one. Not much to say about them, buy if you need them</li>
            <li> These are awful, loud</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering these same replacement brush heads for about 5 years and all of them have worked perfectly fine.  No complaints except that the price goes up - but what hasn&#x27;t??? Go for the free S&amp;H if you can find it!</li>
            <li> do not buy knock-off heads...they will not work right! these work so great, and the price is great on here too!</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes are performing to expectations as equal to the original items they were replacing.  Pricing at amazom was better than I could find at Kohls, and on-line shopping was so convenient!</li>
            <li> Simple replacement heads for the Sonicare system. Works the same as the originals. The only issue I&#x27;ve had with it is that toothpaste drips down past the rubber gasket where the shaft meets the bulb, which causes gunk to build up inside the toothbrush. It can be easily unscrewed and cleaned, but that is a little bit of a hassle. They should make better gaskets to seal the water out. Don&#x27;t they know that toothbrushes get wet??</li>
            <li> My Sonicare was stolen from my luggage on an airline flight and I&#x27;ve ordered another. No matter how many times I brush with a manual toothbrush, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean as it does with a Sonicare. It is over-priced IMO, but some things are worth splurging on.</li>
            <li> I bought these covers over a year ago and could not get it on my toothbrush because of arthritis .  Amazon suggested I keep them.  Gave to my grandchildren and they had them on the toothbrush in a snap.  Have two more young grandchildren and these will be perfect to keep their electric toothbrush clean.  Of course they will put it on themselves!!</li>
            <li> These are name brand toothbrush heads.  They work great.  They are expensive but they work great and they are far better than the generics.  Worth the price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  I am going to get one for my son because the dentist told him he was using a too firm brushhead and brushing too hard.  This brush will definitely solve that problem.  Well packaged with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this toothbrush, these replacement heads are a must have. This is a great price for the heads.</li>
            <li> ... and replacements. Recommended by my dentist, and I&#x27;ve seen noticeable results. The replacement heads are a bit pricy, but last a long time and I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare products will help you with your oral hygiene. They make your teeth very, very clean! You will love how your teeth feel after using these to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Pricey - I&#x27;m happy to go to the newer model</li>
            <li> these fit well and work well. they are toothbrush heads, i am not sure there is anything else i can say about them.</li>
            <li> I switched to the newer brush.  Newer one is better.  It is more energetic, and it does not get as moldy where the water does not dry.  Still, these things are much better then manual brushing.</li>
            <li> Got the product quickly and it saved about 30% from buying them&lt;br /&gt;at the local store. They work perfectly. Word of advice, get the&lt;br /&gt;phillips ones, there is another one out there thats a replica and its&lt;br /&gt;cheaper but it is an inferior product. These should be replace every&lt;br /&gt;6 months</li>
            <li> I have been brushing my teeth for 52 yrs by hand I bought one of these I love it I am now 54. you know that film that gets on your teeth it hard to get off not with this. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the perfect replacement brush head for Sonicare, and I bought it along with my HX5351. And I trust them far more than those non-Sonicare brands who might seem to be a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> dentist and others recommend that i use the sonic care as to not put so mush power to my gums. this helps because it i get too aggressive the plastic chatters against my teeth and i hate it</li>
            <li> WEAK, NOT REAL THEY SHAKE AND VIBRATE AND DONT CLEAN AS GOOD AS THE REAL ONES</li>
            <li> Like many others, I had fallen in the habit of buying the less expensive replacement heads, thinking there couldn&#x27;t be that much of a difference. After reading other reviews here, I decided to splurge and give the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; another try and can now say I will never go back to the off-brands. As others have mentioned, there is a surprising difference in the way the heads made for the Sonicare vibrate at a seemingly higher frequency than the knock-off versions. Considering you only need to replace the head about 1x a month, seems better  to spend a few more dollars to maximize the benefits of the toothbrush and get the best results possible. Here&#x27;s hoping it pays off in savings at the dentist!</li>
            <li> Great brush, my wife and I have had exellent check-ups since using this brush. Would recommend it highly. bit expenise but well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  It brushes my teeth.  My dentist is happy.  My breath smells great.  Was a good price</li>
            <li> Started using the Sonicare brush about a year ago. Repalcement heads are pricey but love&lt;br /&gt;the brush. Always looking for a deal on additional heads.  Amazon makes it easy to find them.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads coming in a two pack is perfect for my boyfriend and I.  They fit right on and stay good long after we choose to replace them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brush heads for years with no problems. They attach securely to the brush handle, and function perfectly. The included plastic caps keep water and other materials from splashing onto the bristles. I usually go a few months before replacing them, and even then the bristles are in pretty good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to a friend.</li>
