            <li>I love changing these!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be damned if Philips can come up with a better head for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li>LOVE the toothbrush itself though!</li>
            <li>But I love them!</li>
            <li>go ahead and make the purchase, you will be glad you did!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I am very happy to notice that I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I will get more!</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes!  </li>
            <li>And what is even better, I could use my accumulated points to pay for them!  </li>
            <li>They were a better price on Amazon than in the store!</li>
            <li>Love our Sonic toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as advertised and provides the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the heads we needed and work perfectly for our bases.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>The brush is great and Amazon is always easy to deal with</li>
            <li>She was very excited!  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li>and we then again realize why they are so wonderful is largely because we have refreshed the heads again.  </li>
            <li>They work beautifully, and I can tell you after years of usging sonic, and great check ups at dentist, I highly recommend, sonic over manual burshing.  </li>
            <li>These heads fit our SoniCare toothbrushes, and do a great job of brushing.</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are an amazing value-</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Initially happy that these were correct fit for my Sonicare, unlike the generics I bought with a Groupon.</li>
            <li>Got these through Amazon and my wife is happy the jackhammer sound is gone again.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is an amazing brand.</li>
            <li>This does an amazing job at removing plaque, and massaging gums.</li>
            <li>These heads are amazing at brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li>Fit great on my handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item came in a very timely manor and was in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li>My hygenist is thrilled with my teeth and my gums these days.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to have found a good price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Nice brushes at a nice price.</li>
            <li>It will be nice to not have to remember when it&#x27;s time to re-order.</li>
            <li>Nice not to have to wait in line in some discount store forever.</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are good for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>Amazon is great to have them at such a great price!</li>
            <li>It does a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>They may be some kind of knockoff.</li>
            <li>Since we have started using it we have experienced a much cleaner feel and have been receiving great comments from out dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>But to be effective the brush heads have to be changed of course.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to find these heads at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare and always looking for a good price in the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they aren&#x27;t good for your teeth either.</li>
            <li>Its performance and reliability are downright astounding.</li>
            <li>at times  be hazardous.  </li>
            <li>Finding a place I can trust as to name products, good prices,  good quality and honest salesmanship is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted the service was excellent thanks</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and this was a good price ad</li>
            <li>I liked the minimalist packaging the company used.</li>
            <li>, good quality replacemnt head, cover for head is redesigned and stays on better now.</li>
            <li>Kind of a reminder of the way things once were and should be today.</li>
            <li>the Sonicare is so effective,</li>
            <li>and that was so nice.  </li>
            <li>So have a nice day.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own a Sonicare Toothbrush system, you should.</li>
            <li>this is a great way to automatically receive head replacements when you need them, at a good discount, and right to your door.  </li>
            <li>They are original manufactures brushes and work great.</li>
            <li>These work great and fit perfectly and are new and packaged as they should be.</li>
            <li>Fits the older Sonicares perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are great and the price was pretty good..</li>
            <li>Although this is an older brand of toothbrush, the replacement brushes worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great for keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes are excellent and come highly recommended by dentists.  </li>
            <li>High quality - best price.  </li>
            <li>We have used Sonicare for many years and are very satisfied with the type of cleaning it provides for our teeth.</li>
            <li>They clean teeth!!  </li>
            <li>These sonic toothbrushes work best when they are new.  </li>
            <li>This new style brush fits and works perfectly in my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>These new heads work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>but I just recently went to a continuing education seminar on homecare devices and found my beloved Sonicare was not the one that did the best job according to the research.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to make this purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com is a very easy way to shop on line.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be very easy to use and care for my teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li>The way these brushes clean is impeccable.</li>
            <li>Good price and quick service!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing with an older Sonicare for many years, and just had an excellent dental check up after two years.  </li>
            <li>My family and my dentist are happy with the results that Sonicare Elite system provides and since every replacement heads lasts 6 months, it is well worth the $9.50.</li>
            <li>good fit as a replacement head</li>
            <li>Amazon had by far the best price.  </li>
            <li>and I believe that this is the best product for complete teeth cleaning out there.</li>
            <li>Better than the Oral B tooth brush, which I also own.</li>
            <li>Perfect for removing old varnish from furniture or the enamel from your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively</li>
            <li>Phillips make them great and well worth it.</li>
            <li>They are good to fit my Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>IT IS THE MOST AMAZING TOOTH BRUSH EVER.</li>
            <li>Having the toothpaste right in the brush is great as well.  </li>
            <li>They came very quickly and were immediately put into use!</li>
            <li>The heads easily snapped on!</li>
            <li>I was greatly relieved to find that these brush heads fit the Advance just fine.  </li>
            <li>The replacement head was as good as the original.</li>
            <li>This is a good replacement for the original model.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads were as good as the original.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean it and the brush was still good</li>
            <li>These are good brush heads (for a good toothbrush), but it seems Sonicare is asking a bit too much money for them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good tooth brush and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to replace those sonicare brushes so that you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The sonic action is the greatest in the Oral B top of the line model and that is what helps reduce tartar and staining.  </li>
            <li>basically made a fair amount of noise but didn&#x27;t clean my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my healthy smile.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush (which is super reliable and great for my teeth and gums) but don&#x27;t love spending a lot on periodic replacement heads...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine!</li>
            <li>These pillows are very comfortable, I would or will them buy again.</li>
            <li>for  easy  and effective  way of removing  plaque ...</li>
            <li>Thank you for making it so easy for me to keep my teeth so very clean!</li>
            <li>We get new replacement heads in every six months (how often you are supposed to replace the toothbrush head anyways) and are always thrilled to swap out and keep using our great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love this new tooth brush!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Philips certainly has a great sonic toothbrush but hasn&#x27;t bothered to make the price of their brush head replacements cost-effective.  </li>
            <li>I am certain there is a great reason to brush your teeth for 2 minutes, so I still use it.</li>
            <li>A new brush head feels so good!       </li>
            <li>Very good value--better pricing than direct from Phillips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes a huge difference when brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li>Have this product  for years,  love it.</li>
            <li>Should have bought these with the toothbrush, but glad Amazon reminded me that they had them when I needed them.</li>
            <li>I found just what I needed to keep my Philips Sonicare Tooth brush in tip top shape.  </li>
            <li>I have to buy them every 3 months or so and wish I could get a better price.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the toothbrush then and have had one since then.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using them for many years now and he has had zero cavities.</li>
            <li>They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better.</li>
            <li>Since using this product my teeth and gums are way better off.</li>
            <li>Now after purchasing the sonic care brush when I go to the dentist they always say to me that it looks like you have been brushing better and flossing.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I could find even in the local store.  </li>
            <li>I love Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>We love the Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush heads.  </li>
            <li>One more</li>
            <li>This was a no brainer, I love the toothbrush, the replacements in the store are $30</li>
            <li>I am satisfied, but would be astonished if I hadn&#x27;t been satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I bought a second one for my mother!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The way it is designed is perfect for oral health….teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Also there appears to be more power and</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist has seen my gums improve and my teeth in better condition.</li>
            <li>I love Phillips sonicare.  </li>
            <li>And with the Amazon subcription discount makes this an even better deal.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have had a Sonicare for years and have tried many of the knock-off substitutes for these brush heads.</li>
            <li>This one fits, but is a much better brush.  </li>
            <li>Keep your body healthy, use this brush today.  </li>
            <li>I could not ask for a better transaction.</li>
            <li>In addition, there are too many corners and moving parts that bacterias and thrive in.</li>
            <li>do I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over three years, and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satsified with my purchase, have no complaints and would gladly buy from them again.</li>
            <li>I have braces and, as a result, have to replace my brush heads more often.</li>
            <li>so glad to get these via delivery</li>
            <li>It cleans better</li>
            <li>We are satisfied with all aspects of this system.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>and i dont have to worry about buying more for a year.</li>
            <li>We are repeat buyers of this product and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a great deal in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>--you will love it.</li>
            <li>Want to save more, then use Amazon credit card.</li>
            <li>If this product was priced more appropriately, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums and mouth are getting the best care possible with the sonicare system.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with its performance using the replacemant brush head.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the OEM ones like these.</li>
            <li>Sure makes the teeth feel</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not laying out a grand for the procedure.  </li>
            <li>and I love how my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>Love my brush and glad to have nice,fresh,stiff bristles again.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for 2 Sonicare Elite replacement heads!  </li>
            <li>I just wonder with so many people using this product, how many of them ended up in the ER?</li>
            <li>My husband and I love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Also, with free delivery!  </li>
            <li>But the alternative is manual toothbrushes and more cavities.  </li>
            <li>Much better than retail.</li>
            <li>but at  a much better price</li>
            <li>and the design is much better.</li>
            <li>Her dentist is pleased with her reduced plaque.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Elite for a couple of years and am totally satisfied with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Have been using the sonicare for 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I listened to my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare tooth brush so of course I need to purchase replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and Sonicare did not fare as well as the top of the line Oral B</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s why the Sonicare is the most frugal product I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare delete brush.</li>
            <li>You can wipe some of it off, but for the most part you just have to pretend that you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sonicare system for about 12 years now and absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li>will be asking for a refund for sure.</li>
            <li>Plus the shipping was free!</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with this product, which I received as a gift.</li>
            <li>We love our Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>We have had ours for more than 6 years.</li>
            <li>Have bought this item many times.</li>
            <li>This year I purchased two for my grown children and they love it.  </li>
            <li>Genuine Sonicare heads as promised!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Does well for keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more \\&quot;painful\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>I now realize.  :)</li>
            <li>But I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare Elite for over a year now and love how it makes my teeth feel...</li>
            <li>Thank you for great and fast service.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love these heads.  </li>
            <li>need I say more?  </li>
            <li>Cleans teeth much better than a regualr tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare Elite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over 10 years, and love the way it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>It works not any better than replacement I can get at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>glad i did.</li>
            <li>Love using he sonic care tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they made the e-Series compatible with mine</li>
            <li>But the actual Philips replacement heads shown here are excellent and love the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise they get the job done and and remove most visible plaque after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;5/5, would brush again</li>
            <li>I KNEW SOMEONE MUST HAVE A BETTER</li>
            <li>The e-Series is, of course, an updated - better - version from my original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We like the slip on version much better.  </li>
            <li>These immediately made much more noise than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in OEM packaging from stores.</li>
            <li>I love the way they feel.</li>
            <li>Love my teeth and love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>If you buy a pair of these replacement brushes make sure you try both as soon as you get them.</li>
            <li>Glad I switched to this type of electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love that.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for coupons or discounts for this product, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find any.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I need to replace more often.</li>
            <li>and that is why I have ordered this item which cost more in the department stores located where I shop.</li>
            <li>I love the sonic and I could not find the replacement head in any store</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for over 10 years and it sure has made a difference during my annual dentist cleaning visits.</li>
            <li>And the flaired design at the top of the screw-on cap seems to keep crud from seeping into the battery/handle recess.</li>
            <li>We really love these toothbrushes and like using them.  </li>
            <li>I really love my Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>I mostly like the oral B prodocts but</li>
            <li>Love the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I compared these heads to the OEM version and these are many differences: plastic quality, bristle quality/cut, and labeling.</li>
            <li>If the Stills company reads this I would love a replacement.  </li>
            <li>the more I use them.  </li>
            <li>It is much better to buy these than the knock offs.</li>
            <li>I would love to see Amazon offer the compact heads as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to Amazon more and more because of the reliability of product information and ease of purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for about five years and generally love it.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>Many people have mentioned it... and our dentist and hygienist...</li>
            <li>Love these ...</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I like being able to buy them cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li>So much better priced here.  </li>
            <li>These work better, but I don&#x27;t know why or how.  </li>
            <li>I can make it work but must make sure the magnets are in the correct position every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Patients with the Sonicare did much better, but don&#x27;t take my word for it.  </li>
            <li>I wish they came with more replacement brush heads to reduce the price per brush head.</li>
            <li>Love these sonicare series brushes.</li>
            <li>They use to make them a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Better than the knock off clones.</li>
            <li>and I am sure the company knows this</li>
            <li>My hygienist says my teeth and gums look so healthy.</li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare, and love these replacement heads for when the bristles go.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>*Do not* buy the off brand replacement heads, unless you like to be able to hear your spouse/s.o/partner brush their teeth all the way in the farthest bathroom downstairs whilst they&#x27;re upstairs.</li>
            <li>Recommended by dental hygienist many years ago so have used it/them for years.</li>
            <li>use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
            <li>i love my sonicare.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shiopping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more and get what I need.</li>
            <li>there are better out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can judge for yourself when you need a new&lt;br /&gt;brush</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Even BB&amp;B are more money with a coupon.</li>
            <li>but if you want to replace them more often be prepared to shell out close to $30.00 each time.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare e-series brush and heads.  </li>
            <li>This is about 20 cents more than a buying manual toothbrushes every (recommended) 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>We have had our sonicare toothbrushes for about 4 years now and, since newer models are sold in stores, I have not been able to find brush head replacements in stores.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you know your  sonicare toothbrush series or name before ordering.  </li>
            <li>To keep the brush working in top form, you have to replace the brush heads every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and the way my teeth feel after brushing![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery, matches up to model, saves me from hunting for the correct brush-head in stores.</li>
            <li>Love these brush heads...</li>
            <li>They are made of a thinner plastic and make a lot more noise.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more at Target and the Target brushes are working much better.</li>
            <li>With even the slightest amount of pressure (i.e. touching the bristles to your teeth)</li>
            <li>but you can also buy these in packs of 6 or more for more cost savings.</li>
            <li>As many others have already said, what I received appear to be either non-OEM brush heads, or were defective in some way.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love my Sonicare and have had one for many years.</li>
            <li>Bristles look like they have seen better days.</li>
            <li>, okay</li>
            <li>Always better than a manual</li>
            <li>Ok but overpriced brush refills.  </li>
            <li>I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for many years now.</li>
            <li>I made sure to buy those listed for sale by Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I have used sonicare for many years</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare, and I love these heads for 3 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re labeled as coming from Sonicare, and I believe they&#x27;re authentic.</li>
            <li>love the Sonicare system though.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>and these are so much better at cleaning my teeth-much faster and much more thorough.  </li>
            <li>Then there was yet more blister pack packaging inside.</li>
            <li>I have had my toothbrush for about 10 years and used many replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I also told her they probably dont make the type that she had any more.</li>
            <li>i get these at the drug store, i love em, they work well for ages.</li>
            <li>I ordered another set that came in actual Philips packaging and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>We ordered these, and they&#x27;re not the authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love these -</li>
            <li>That is very nice - quite unlike certain replacement parts for razors.</li>
            <li>works fine, came on time, gives me a good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Wow - seriously good customer service!  </li>
            <li>as promised fits right and works just like the original brush head and all that at a great price too</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of keeping the teeth clean and clearing any plaque build up.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare toothbrush has given me great results, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>love feeling my teeth are amazingly  clean after using this tooth brush!</li>
            <li>They have helped me greatly and I will continue to use them until I must buy a new Sonicare foe sure.</li>
            <li>Get teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 years since a checkup and the dentist said my teeth where very clean considering the time without a cleaning.</li>
            <li>By leaving the scrubbing motions to the device, I&#x27;m able to spend more attention to aiming accurately and evenly, to avoid overscrubbing, to avoid falling asleep from boredom, and it does a better job than I could.  </li>
            <li>I got a pretty good deal with this order.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Sonicare for decades since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing fun again!!</li>
            <li>Brand new in package, great price and received with in days.</li>
            <li>It feels great to start brushing again with a new head on your Sonicare and</li>
            <li>so glad I could easily get replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure which replacement brush I needed,but found it easily with the description and pictures.  </li>
            <li>Haave been using the Sonicare products since their introduction several years ago, and this one continues the trend of great value products, while being extremely effective.</li>
            <li>I am most satisfied to have the Philips brand available through Amazon and I will continue to order my replacements on an as needed basis.</li>
            <li>My friend finally convinced me that the Sonicare product is superior, and then I read a review on Amazon from a hygenist who said that she went to a continuing education seminar and learned that Oral B was found to be superior...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better way to protect your teeth and more importantly your gums.</li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt this clean, even after the dentist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li>So basically it doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>These heads are great - vibrate as expected and do a super great job of cleaning my teeth and stimulating my gums.</li>
            <li>I love what this toothbrush does, but these replacement brushes were even better than the original ones I purchased.</li>
            <li>If you want a great toothbrush that really gets your teeth clean, then this Sonicare Elite is for you.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best method I know to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and the price was very reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li>The basic electrical part of the brush has held up very good.</li>
            <li>very good the item was sent internationally</li>
            <li>Sonicare units are easy to clean, and it is very easy to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li>New brushes feel really great on your gums and keep them clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Many newer models were available on the store shelves...</li>
            <li>they fit more than one</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these replacement heads for my OLD Sonic Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>What I expected from Sonicare, an excellent replacement part.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, they arrived on time in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with my purchase and it arrived when expected.</li>
            <li>The price, which is lower than those available at my nearest drug store,  is also something I am pleased about.</li>
            <li>And dear god is it better than the cheap ones that emit that ear deafening banshee screech when you turn on your brush.</li>
            <li>Attached to old body and they worked great.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would fit, but a CSR at Phillips told me they would.  </li>
            <li>A great replacement for the old one.</li>
            <li>These brushes were too loud and vibrated through too great a field.  </li>
            <li>Sure they fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>great for the price and replace for old brush head.  </li>
            <li>It was much better and a tighter fit.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and price good.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a good price.  </li>
            <li>These Philips brush heads vibrate better, perhaps because they fit more securely on the handle.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were a good price (cheaper than anywhere else I checked) and the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit upset that I go through these brushes so fast, but they do a good job with cleaning.</li>
            <li>Good price, QWik ship, thanks....</li>
            <li>I was concerned I would have to buy a whole new unit because of the age of my Sonicare, but these are the perfect replacement head.</li>
            <li>Great price and got it super fast with my prime membership.</li>
            <li>I will purchase the full head from now on!</li>
            <li>These replacement parts work as well or better than what came originally with the unit.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s A LOT more compact than the original brush.</li>
            <li>and I like this newer style brush better than the original.</li>
            <li>I love which they don&#x27;t make original brush heads</li>
            <li>Great product that fit my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Amazon.com makes it so easy to replace my toothbrush heads on schedule.  </li>
            <li>We have found it to be an integral part of keeping our teeth and gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Its great to be able to just open a package instead  of getting out the hedge clippers!</li>
            <li>Easy to use adn efficirnt in cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Even though Philips says it can be done quite easily, is isn&#x27;t so.   </li>
            <li>These heads easily run about $35 in retail stores.</li>
            <li>Easy way to get replacement brushes for Sonicare, keeps it working at  &lt;</li>
            <li>Easy purchase.</li>
            <li>so well, I purchased one for each of my sons because, after all the years of emphasizing the importance of a clean, healthy mouth, how could I NOT have bought them?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it has helped clean my teeth and help get rid of my tarter.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare for about ten years, and it&#x27;s an excellent toothbrush that is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes shopping for these types of items incredibly easy.</li>
            <li>There seems to be an issue with how easy they are to attach and remove.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have used Phillips tooth brushes for years now and they always perform well and are easy to keep charged.</li>
            <li>I LIKE HOW EASY IT IS TO USE</li>
            <li>Easy to install and remove.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are so easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>, continue doing.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad for this amazing product, they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li>how easy can it get.  </li>
            <li>No rattling and strong brushing.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that I was purchasing the incorrect replacement brushes, I think the clue is to make sure you get the correct series, they were reasonably priced, arrived in a timely manner and nicely packaged</li>
            <li>We have had these toothbrushes for about 8 years now and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>but I would strongly suggest upgrading to a newer model that uses the brush heads that are just the stick part.</li>
            <li>Any one who use a Sonicare tooth brush-which my dentist recommended-will be pleased with this replacement and the price is right!</li>
            <li>Price was good, and shipping was pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the fast arrival.</li>
            <li>The problem after the first shipment the price rose almost two dollars.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save has sent me this kind of brush head.</li>
            <li>Also so happy they included the clear cover for the brush head as I had lost the original.  </li>
            <li>A full size brush provides much better cleaning than a compact.  </li>
            <li>Buy replacement heads from a more reputable dealer or risk getting brushheads that will not make a good enough connection with the magnet.</li>
            <li>They screw on and off very easily and are of the right firmness.</li>
            <li>Efficient &amp; light weight way to clean my teeth, absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a great product because it&#x27;s simply a replacement for the original brush, but the brush design could have been better.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this electric toothbrush through Amazon.com thanks to the many reviews by those who own it.</li>
            <li>However, these new brush heads aren&#x27;t as good as the ones I&#x27;ve used all along.</li>
            <li>The Elite Sonicare Brush heads work fine with the Advance Sonicare Electric Toothbrush that I have.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare toothbrush is a fine product that I have used every day for a decade.</li>
            <li>and you are fine.</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it easy to keep my household stocked with toothbrushes without worrying that the product will not be available.</li>
            <li>no paperwork,  otherwise fine</li>
            <li>Replacement head worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to replace the heads on my Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>They work fine.  </li>
            <li>We have used the Sonicare for a year and a half, this is the best price we&#x27;ve found on the replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes fit easily into the Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But now I find it works just fine</li>
            <li>All seemed fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine ...</li>
            <li>I thank you for making this process so easy and available.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes work fine.</li>
            <li>The brush head replacement started out fine</li>
            <li>They work fine in our brush.</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine - it&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li>One of the heads worked fine; one was defective and did not vibrate when attached to the brush head.</li>
            <li>Work fine.</li>
            <li>However, the two heads we ordered work just fine.</li>
            <li>Packaging is not for retail display, which is fine.  </li>
            <li>I am glad these newer brushes fit on the older Sonicare that I own.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping--arrived as presented---will use again!</li>
            <li>These replacement heads arrived quickly and were priced much more favorably than any retail store in our town.</li>
            <li>#34;better deals.&amp;#34; Super product for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Beside the Phillips Sonicare tooth brush being superior to most other brands, the brushes are the key to having wonderful teeth.  </li>
            <li>A very good product, the same item that I buy in stores, the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Good bye old fashioned manuel toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>I really like this teeth cleaning system, and Amazon is an easy and cost effective way to get replacements.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads fit and work fine.</li>
            <li>I showed her that it fit on the holder, so it will be fine.</li>
            <li>These heads work pretty well and are very strong.  </li>
            <li>Perfect but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>They arrived in good condition in the time promised, nothing special to say, if you need replacement heads and don&#x27;t like spending your weekends hunting them down at a good price, the internet&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li>I have been using these Sonicare brushes for years and they have made a huge improvement in the health of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my dentist visits.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge difference, 1 brush a year versus 4 brushes a year.  </li>
            <li>YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW FANTASTIC THIS ITEM IS.</li>
            <li>34;BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Beware of Sonicare&#x27;s Buy 2 Get 1 Free Brush Head Offer.  </li>
            <li>companies- if you tout how easy it is to clean your electric toothbrush people will sit up and listen.  </li>
            <li>Once you have used any type of advanced cleaning system, you never want to brush your teeth with a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>some heads don&#x27;t fit some models etc</li>
            <li>So bought Phillips/the heads fit all models.</li>
            <li>(Important for a guy.)     </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>I have read where some of these replacment brushes are cheap knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Sonicare and they confirmed that this product is a knock off.  </li>
            <li>and they were cheap</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and it has greatly improved my dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>They fit my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Am on third set of replacement heads for this one and am quite happy with performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great and last a while!</li>
            <li>These brushes fit the Sonic Advance handle and are a substantial improvement over the Advance replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a sonicare for several years and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>With free shipping, and no tax from Amazon it was a no brainer.</li>
            <li>At my next visit, the gums looked great.  </li>
            <li>The important thing is to not just rely on a manual toothbrush all the time.</li>
            <li>These were great before they became backward compatible with the earlier model bodies.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they fit the elite unit but they are not the ones I ordered.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>Electronic toothbrushes use the the Gilette model: sell the shavers for cheap, get them on the razor blades.</li>
            <li>Order something else to get over $25 and qulify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Research if it fit your model before order.</li>
            <li>These arrived and are so easy to install and get to working on keeping my teeth so so clean.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean your teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li>Really feels nice on gums, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the genuine philips replacement brush.</li>
            <li>I bought another brush before which was supposed to fit into my philips sonicare tooth brush, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My sister just has to get use to the vibrating sensation &amp; Inky her cat who looks for that sound.</li>
            <li>My family has been using the Sonicare toothbrush for several years and are quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare toothbrush has made such a great difference in my dental care.</li>
            <li>Healthy gums equal a great, all-natural smile.</li>
            <li>The cheap stuff didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was free and received shipment promptly.</li>
            <li>Item was as described and fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason my elite is about 20% more powerful with the replacement brush head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s curved head and speed have made my hygienist sing my praises for teeth that are plague free.</li>
            <li>Not  Didn&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried store-brand heads that fit the Sonicare, but they didn&#x27;t function as well.</li>
            <li>cleaner and smooth</li>
            <li>Frankly, they were added to another purchase to qualify for free shipment.</li>
            <li>I got the two replacement heads for my Essence toothbrush --- about $23 from Amazon (Dec 08) with Subscribe and Save, free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if they are genuine as advertised.</li>
            <li>so I was happy when I found actual Sonicare replacements on Amazon</li>
            <li>Always buy brand name, these fit and held up well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these were genuine sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li>On a genuine product the word &amp;#34;e-Series&amp;#34; is engraved on the shaft.</li>
            <li>These are the name brand ones and fit well.</li>
            <li>however these heads are great and last longer even at 2-3 times a day of usage than the box says.  </li>
            <li>One was perfect, one did not fit well and lead to water leakage and corrosion.</li>
            <li>for.&lt;br /&gt;These fit.</li>
            <li>detailed find teeth</li>
            <li>fit.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fit like they used to.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s available for the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are well worth the money, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a B&amp;M store with a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li>They work; they fit the advertised model of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have bought genuine replacements and knock-offs and store brands.</li>
            <li>Worked great and got my sonicare and teeth back into shape!</li>
            <li>They fit.  </li>
            <li>The HX7002/62 e-Series happen to be the heads that fit my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It filled the need for replacement brush heads for the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes for my wifes&#x27; Sonicare toothbrush and they fit and work well.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit my Sonic care</li>
            <li>At a drug store, I bought a two-pack of the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; version of these that were supposed to fit my Sonicare model.  </li>
            <li>Such a good deal for authentic brush head replacement parts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally (inci \\&quot;dental\\&quot; ly?), Amazon&#x27;s price on these heads is excellent -- much cheaper than my local pharmacies.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the national name brand and is far cheaper.  </li>
            <li>, this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun [Oral B] brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth.</li>
            <li>These \\&quot;old school\\&quot; replacement units ARE good quality-</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare, but these brushes really need to be designed better.</li>
            <li>These are much easier to keep clean and seem to do a better job of cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement, bristles a little stiffer than original, works</li>
            <li>Love the brush but the replacements don&#x27;t seem to fit quite right as they make a lot of noise and don&#x27;t have the movement of the originals.</li>
            <li>my mouth has never felt better than it does right now.</li>
            <li>Slipped right into position with no problem and will order more when needed.</li>
            <li>better than getting it at the store and receives it right away.</li>
            <li>This newer design is not as easy to clean as the original version</li>
            <li>It works, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same amount of vibration as the original brush, oh well the noise helps me wake up in the morning lol.</li>
            <li>These do not give the strong vibration of the full price heads.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!</li>
            <li>I REALLY quite like these!!!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush keeps my mouth clean and is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My dentist believes that not only did the Elite model improve my oral care but that the decrease for the need for filings was the best (I agree since I don&#x27;t particularly care to have my face drilled on too often).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the head for my now older Sonicare electric tooth brush that doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one brushing anymore.  </li>
            <li>These are the original, not some cheap copy that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads fit the original base/battery</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Elite 7500 electric toothbrush is rated highly in reviews because it&#x27;s comfortable to use, and is effective at removing plaque.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the reordering system and the price offered for being on the system is much better than I can buy them in a local store, plus I don&#x27;t have to go and get them!!</li>
            <li>Ordering and receiving this product was easy and quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After dental cleaning you can pick up a dental head as opposed to a free toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the most reasonable, price location to purchase!</li>
            <li>They are very easy to change and they work very well on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>i believe it is money well spent now that i have healthy gums and a dazzling smile!</li>
            <li>( doc said to floss more), and very very very seldom miss a brushing.  </li>
            <li>One thing very few people note about the Sonicare is that it not only cleans your teeth beautifully, it also keeps your gums in great shape, and that may be even more valuable.</li>
            <li>Pro: These toothbrush heads are a good size and they allow me to easily get to the back molars.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush and am glad the heads are still easy to find.</li>
            <li>but even better was the whole process and how easy it was.  </li>
            <li>However, now that I found then at this great price (less than 1/2 of most stores)</li>
            <li>I have had my original handsets for 5 years and continue to replace the brushes here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is an identical replacement for my original E5300 head.  </li>
            <li>HAS A UNIQUE &amp;#</li>
            <li>These brush heads are original replacements.</li>
            <li>The brushes in the pack are just like the original brush that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 Sonicare brush heads and sent the original UPC symbol to Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>They sent me a postcard stating that it did not receive the original UPC symbol or proof-of-purchase</li>
            <li>Always get the original manufacturer product for toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>They are just like the ones that came w/ the original set.  </li>
            <li>Always thought I had to buy original heads.    </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the Philips toothbrush, and my first one gave many years of service before it had to be replaced.</li>
            <li>This replacement head is not the original size.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER DOESN&#x27;T LIST FOR REPLACEMENT.</li>
            <li>and since my first head wore out quickly,Im pleased to have two.</li>
            <li>I changed my mind and thought it was on par with the original.</li>
            <li>We have had our original charger for years and order replacement brushes every three months as recommended.</li>
            <li>This product is just like the original brush.  </li>
            <li>They are what they say they are and come in the original branded packaging.</li>
            <li>the original</li>
            <li>Works as well as the original.  </li>
            <li>We have had our original Philips Sonicare Elite system for over 6 years.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase with Amazon.com and plan to shop more.</li>
            <li>The small head replacements would be great for kids!</li>
            <li>Original equipment quality replacement.</li>
            <li>These are original heads and function as intended.</li>
            <li>Mine was just the original series not the E-series.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re stiffer than the original (4-year-old) one), and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Original equipment but cheapest I found.</li>
            <li>The latest version Sonicare fixes all of that and is FIRST CLASS.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I made this change, the amount of tartar build up has been significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>Amazon, usually, has the best prices on products if you have the Prime Membership.</li>
            <li>How excited can you get over toothbrush heads??</li>
            <li>I love, love, love my Philips Sonicare HX7002/62 e-Series Standard Replacement Brush Heads!!</li>
            <li>We were so excited to find these, since I don&#x27;t think you can in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>so I ordered them thinking that they would not be like the original Sonicare product that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love Sonicare and have been an avid user for years.  </li>
            <li>Not the original.</li>
            <li>They come in a two pack so if you need to share, it is easy as they each have a different colored plastic insert to be able to tell them apart very easy.  </li>
            <li>right item, quick delivery, and a satisfied wife.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have new brush heads...</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how nice new brushes are,</li>
            <li>Believe me, within a couple of days, I could tell my mouth did not feel as clean</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so clean after use.  </li>
            <li>Have you ever tried to clean the sonicare?  </li>
            <li>I have used these brushes for years and find them well suited for clean teeth.  </li>
            <li>and my teeth are brighter and feel clean all the time.</li>
            <li>This also results in a lower quality outcome (teeth aren&#x27;t as clean).  </li>
            <li>Hygenist always raves about how clean my teeth are after I switched to these from Oral B.</li>
            <li>I wind up feeling like the teeth are almost as clean as when I go into the dentist for my six month cleaning.  </li>
            <li>clean and taken care of.</li>
            <li>Keep the heads clean</li>
            <li>Husband&#x27;s teeth are sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>CLEAN INSIDE OF TOOTHBRUSH WITH CLR</li>
            <li>These clean my teeth so well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy 6 at Costco because that&#x27;s just too many at one time since I&#x27;m the only one that uses this kind of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>they make your teeth and gums feel clean</li>
            <li>MY TEETH FEEL CLEAN AFTER EACH USE.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to rinse and keep clean.</li>
            <li>remember to keep it clean inside.</li>
            <li>As far as the seller is concerned, I have no complaints about the order -- the packaging was adequate for the product to arrive in perfect condition, the duration was within Amazon&#x27;s agreed upon time, and the price is the lowest I&#x27;ve found, both locally in stores and online.</li>
            <li>These are the real Sonicare heads, and they work just as well as the original head, and I love it.    </li>
            <li>Replacements are always needed, nothing special.</li>
            <li>The plastic vent cap is a great idea, it protects the brush heads and allows them to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare toothbrush, but find cleaning the brushheads a real chore if you remove the head and try to clean everything up once in a while.  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and are identical to the original version.  </li>
            <li>The whole thing went very smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>great.. just what i expected</li>
            <li>Great value and these are getting harder to find.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to find a product that really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>To be able to get them at a reduced price, and sign up for automatic delivery was a REAL bonus.  </li>
            <li>The simpler the machine, the easier it is to keep in good condition and this basic brush will take care of anyone.  </li>
            <li>last thing that really good</li>
            <li>I think the last time I changed my SonicCare toothbrush head was over a year ago..not a good replacement cycle.</li>
            <li>That can be good for getting to the back teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are good and last me about 6 - 8 months.  </li>
            <li>Good investment since you only have to replace every six months.  </li>
            <li>Signing up for subscription for this item is a good idea, especially with the discount.</li>
            <li>Nice that replacements still being made for my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you used a regular toothbrush (good quality), you&#x27;d probably pay about $3.50 for one you can use for 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>Used regularly it really helped me getting and mainting healthy gums and prevent tartar build up.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful to be able to obtain the replacement brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Returning to amazon for full refund.</li>
            <li>Use the routine after every meal or snack if possible, of course at work not so good.</li>
            <li>mark works, but sounds like a freight train at full speed.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush and being able to order the brush-head replacements</li>
            <li>They are not flimsy and work very well with my toothbrush for a fraction of the price I would find in  most stores.</li>
            <li>and I love it as much now as I did then---</li>
            <li>...you don&#x27;t really have many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ads are true:</li>
            <li>This brush head is a full size brush.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really beleive him plus Sonicare cost so much more than the brand I was using.  </li>
            <li>Nice, unexpected increase in cycle speed.</li>
            <li>It honestly makes me think they might be counterfeit, even though they are marked &amp;#34;sonicare&amp;#34; on the heads and the box.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember that happening on the full price heads.</li>
            <li>I hope I get a good report from the dental hygienist at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li>Real Sonicare brush heads are better than the non-Sonicare brands.</li>
            <li>Once she started using it, she said it was good enough, she just has to get used to it.</li>
            <li>Also, this price was not bad.</li>
            <li>Even though they may all have the same name brand box, be leary of prices that are too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I gave my old one away after many years of use, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>i liked the fact that had the easy open box</li>
            <li>Also, the price is right and free</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and they came in a very quick time frame.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I know that neither of these are normal, since the original brush heads worked fine, and the replacements I received in the \\&quot;frustration-free packaging\\&quot; version also seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it is different but it still fits perfectly and the smaller head seems to be far more effective than the one that came with it.    </li>
            <li>Great quality replacement heads that last a good long time and seem to clean very well.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, just like recieving exactly as listed!</li>
            <li>these brushes make my teeth fell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to know that this replacement brush head fit my older style sonicare, It actually works better then</li>
            <li>It does help me keep my smile clean.  </li>
            <li>the sonicare toothbrush is seriously one of thee best toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li>fresh from the dentist clean</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Got it quickly and all in tact.  </li>
            <li>A super product at any cost.</li>
            <li>best toothbrush ever you will not go back to a regular brush again.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the brush actually tell you to go more than two minutes for the top of the mollars.</li>
            <li>Waterpik quit making their 3000 model electric tooth brush three years ago that required $5 to buy 4 brushes and it did a fairly adequate job.</li>
            <li>the heads wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>But shipping was rather quick, since I needed to replace rather quickly.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]], or brush head, are simply the best tooth-care product.</li>
            <li>each 6 months have been a worthy investment for me.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly and so glad to find one since older brush.</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li>Great Communication and Fast Shipping will definitely buy again..  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Bought these to use on an older Sonicare which has seen better days.</li>
            <li>It is powerful; looks good; brushes last about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for your quick service.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The sensitive head is also great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a quick pause that alerts you to change the area you are brushing.  </li>
            <li>My dentist and I are both pleased with how much better my regular checkups are!  </li>
            <li>My dental care has been much easier and more fun since I got a Philips Sonicare Elite about two years ago.</li>
            <li>and my cleanings are a quick fifteen minute in and out.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick response and item as advertised.</li>
            <li>Sent quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered in the time specified and it was very easy to replace my old brush head.  </li>
            <li>so glad to find a good deal on a pair of this hard to find replacement - the first one works as it should and am happy to have a back up.</li>
            <li>The way it operates help to clean up the tooth, but also keeps the right way to brush.</li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare for several years, and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>There was a funny twang sound as my gums were assaulted by the bristles on this beast of a brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare since it first became available</li>
            <li>I have been using this model for more than 5 years and no complaint.</li>
            <li>If you want to have healthier teeth and gums and minimize your dental expenses, you will be very pleased with the SonicCare Elite brush and regular refills!</li>
            <li>have never had a problem with the tooth brush heads before but the first one I used fell apart after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;The metal at the ends that fit in the toothbrush just fell apart.</li>
            <li>This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I had to clean brush head buildups more frequently compare to E-Series.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the ad on internet was clear and easy to find, then easy to order.</li>
            <li>The vibration on these is much more powerful - get these, they aren&#x27;t that much more than the generic brand, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>We receive a new 2-Pack every 3 months and it is cheaper and more convinient that having to go to the store to buy them.  </li>
            <li>Love the new design and shape.  </li>
            <li>Love my sonic toothbrush and it was time for some new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>but, when it is time for a new one, I will look for a better design.</li>
            <li>When I changed to the new replacement head the power and feel noticeably picked up for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have a new model- love it -but</li>
            <li>Just want to get something new. :)</li>
            <li>Love my toothbrush, needed some new brush heads.</li>
            <li>Not bad, the price is right</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; gets less pronounced and almost goes away with time, but the great results continue.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering such a quality product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase, as I could not find it ANYWHERE else for less.</li>
            <li>Previously bought these and they were great.</li>
            <li>these units are as expected, they do the job just as the first did I am happy</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>It does most of the action on your teeth and leaves your teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still going strong, and that&#x27;s of course thanks to routine replacement of the heads.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and easy to install.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is longer and really has a strong oscillation.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li>They certainly work fine.  </li>
            <li>They work okay, but are very loud.</li>
            <li>They are exactly like those that came with the original product.</li>
            <li>I was one of the original testers for the first Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li>Would not use any other kind of toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more when I need them!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Of course, she isnt making as much money off of me any longer!!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as the original brush heads.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads are great and they last about three months before you need a new one.</li>
            <li>They clean beneath the gums, in the cracks, the surface, while gently polishing (or sonically vibrate) your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>If you can look past that then these are great, my toothbrush feels like new again and it feels more powerful than that original brush head</li>
            <li>Not only were these brush heads offered at a great price, their ergo design and smaller brush size makes it easy to reach into those hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li>the bottom part of these can get pretty grungy and are a bit of a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush &amp; the other head worked fine but couldn&#x27;t get a replacement easily.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
            <li>I really like the free shipping.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much firmer than the genuine ones (even after a week or two of use).</li>
            <li>The newer brush heads fit the handle but are of much lower quality.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it may be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Reliable and useful, my wife has had her electronic toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li>I owned an old Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like)</li>
            <li>I just smile and nod.</li>
            <li>How I look at it is that if they protect my teeth it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Sonicare tooth brushes are worth their weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel dentist fresh every time.  </li>
            <li>It feels so much more natural</li>
            <li>&quot; Amazon offers may make more sense at a minimum rate of 2 brush heads each 6 months than does 3 brush heads</li>
            <li>keeps my mouth feeling fresh, and has helped me with my gums.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny that you may spend on it.  </li>
            <li>Fit my Sonicare perfectly, last and will order again when I need more</li>
            <li>you have a 50 year mouth (like mine) and have taken coffee and tea for many moons, a professional whitening may be in order</li>
            <li>The Sonicare with its ultrasonic cleaning action cleans most fully, with out damage to my gums.</li>
            <li>I only wish that a well known consumer magazine would consider reviewing electric toothbrushs, but they refuse even though they have been available for many years.</li>
            <li>This is an important product for many health reasons to numerous to delve into here.</li>
            <li>The cost vs. results does make the system worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>Everytime I purchase a replacement, I am reminded that I should be doing so more frequently....</li>
            <li>but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>well worth using.</li>
            <li>When brushing, the brush makes a loud chattering noise, like the foot of the brush head isn&#x27;t quite touching the sonic vibrating part.  </li>
            <li>The research said that the combination of sonic and rotary action over time (within a month or two of use) demonstrated a greater effect on reduction of plaque and gingivitis scores (the plaque and gingivitis levels were lower for the sonic rotary devices (Oral B) compared to the sonic cradle-rock devices (Sonicare)).  </li>
            <li>It is worth making the switch.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest, I&#x27;ve used the same head for over a year now.  </li>
            <li>Hope Amazon continues to carry them at a reasonable price, as they are a good investment in future dental health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years and every visit to the dentist supports  that this products is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I like these heads for the Sonicare toothbrush better than the old style.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $17 every six months to maintain quality dental care.</li>
            <li>These are cheap enough I can replace them more often.</li>
            <li>They work so much better than the old ones.  </li>
            <li>and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>back to enjoying the teeth brushing and glad i could get a double pack!!:-)</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Philips engineered this product to allow for the replacement of the brush itself rather than the entire mechanical component.  </li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, and these are definitely worth the time and money.</li>
            <li>Forces you to buy replacements more frequently I guess.</li>
            <li>Yes, you do have to replace the heads from time to time, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort and money, considering what you get in return.</li>
            <li>my old sonicare brushes had a lot of torque were able to continually run while I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>AND THEY ARE WELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>durable  and powerful  </li>
            <li>Far better deal to buy them there.</li>
            <li>The Product (Sonicare Elite) replacement Brush heads, I found to be of good quality and it performs as well as I expected and will repeat the process when the time comes around again fro replacement.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost of OEM parts that eliminate the vibration and noise of the off brands.</li>
            <li>Third and most important</li>
            <li>Well worth the price they ask.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush will leave your teeth with the same feeling you get after seeing your dentist - very smooth and clean.   </li>
            <li>It works much better than the original larger brushhead.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, and received quickly.</li>
            <li>Either way, the mold just accumulates again pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>These brushes appear to be the real deal and work just like the original brushes.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are long lasting and the whole brushing system is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The firmness is just right, as advised by the dentist.</li>
            <li>was not the right toothbrush head-  returned and have not received confirmation of return or a credit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten off brands before and they don&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is just right.</li>
            <li>&quot; You are doing it right.)</li>
            <li>However, it did end up being the right replacement part.</li>
            <li>My annual checkups confirm I&#x27;ve been making the right</li>
            <li>Right now I am using Elite (E-series) brush head</li>
            <li>It took a while to find, but this company had &amp;#34;the right stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The order was processed in a timely way, the price was &#x27;right&#x27;, and I will undoubtedly order these again.</li>
            <li>Brush just right size.</li>
            <li>But both my partner and I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>It takes fiddling with the head to get the thing to work right.</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time, and I like it, the price was right, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>refills on time and right to my door..  </li>
            <li>Just the right replacement for my Sonicare e-Series toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It really gets your teeth clean and your gums get a workout too.  </li>
            <li>The E series brush heads fit the older style Sonicare</li>
            <li>I have been ordering same from Amazon based on reviews from other users, who can vouch for the quality because of their own purchase,  The replacement heads are all they have been claimed to be and I am very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really high pitched metallic sound.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads clean great but do not last as long as stated 6 months.</li>
            <li>And it performs much better and leaves less plaque which results to many dental issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In just 2 months I was able to improve the health of my gum tissue and teeth in general.</li>
            <li>As usual, Sonicare is always a great purchage.  </li>
            <li>I actually like them better as they are more contoured than the old ones.</li>
            <li>The power of the system is better than the generic heads and the bristles are far better.</li>
            <li>On the upside, it works great when it works, and the battery lasts 2 weeks using it twice a day, so no need to pack the relatively small recharger on vacation.</li>
            <li>This is great for people who don&#x27;t have normal strength in their hands due to arthritis or a disability.</li>
            <li>I would have loved a better price, but at least knowing that I got the real thing for my money helps.</li>
            <li>My first order arrived quickly, with no problem whatsoever, and as far as I can tell, this plan is going to work out fine.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I needed, priced right, described correctly so that I could make the right purchase for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a dental cleaning since using these replacements and they seem to be working just as fine, just very loud...</li>
            <li>First time in my life my teeth really felt clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>A decent replacement for the original brushes</li>
            <li>Easy to use and Better than any other elec tootbrush</li>
            <li>These arrived in a user friendly package, making it easy to open and get out.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brushes are far more effective than other brands of electric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, lo and behold, these actually fit quite well and saved me from buying a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I need and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It performs well and clean the teeth quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>Just a quick twist on and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>I was happy with Sonicare standard brush heads except for occasional gum irritation.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and were very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>They quit making that great product in order to make more expensive models and charge over $10 for each brush to go on them.</li>
            <li>It does wear out rather quickly and gets much softer in about a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the best testimonial to the Sonicare: I recently had braces for a few years.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are good and cost less than the drugstore, Target, etc.</li>
            <li>The head is easy to replace and it cleans thoroughly and completely.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t seem like it pulses as strongly every 30 seconds like the old series.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for heads not available at local stores.</li>
            <li>This one makes a very loud buzzing sound when attached.</li>
            <li>After brushing, it really leaves you with a very clean feeling, much better than the other electric toothbrush i had before.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I have had the Sonicare Elite for about 2 months now and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I doubt very much that these came from Philips.</li>
            <li>I am not one to floss very much, so I can have quite a bit of build up on my teeth when it comes to my 6-month check-up.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare is much more effective with a new brush head every few months.</li>
            <li>They are really, really loud which is fine</li>
            <li>I have been using soncicare for a little over a year now and have seen good results.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the heads on the original unit makes it run like new again.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat the price for these especially if you still own one of the older model sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>Usually hard to find because of the age and great price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a great product and increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li>they worked, but these replacement heads are VERY LOUD compared to the original heads.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after a new head.</li>
            <li>So much better than the generic!!!</li>
            <li>My mouth is much happier now.&lt;br /&gt;Good value!</li>
            <li>I at first hesitated looking at the cost of just 2 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are exactly what I needed for my e-series sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>tab.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Sonicare brush is okay, I definitely would not buy another Sonicare product again based on the company&#x27;s incorrect handling of its promotion offer!</li>
            <li>&quot; I got the first time using it</li>
            <li>She said my teeth and gums were much improved!  </li>
            <li>You update me when you ship and the  product usually gets here fast and the auto ship feature is great.  </li>
            <li>always exactly what I want, when I need it.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush heads, but I wish a two pack wouldn&#x27;t come the same color!</li>
            <li>About that price:  Now that you can subscribe to delivery on Subscribe and Save, you can save 15% more off of Amazon&#x27;s already low price.  </li>
            <li>At first they changed the recommendation to replace it from every six month to every 3 month</li>
            <li>Cleans the teeth pretty thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is a must have for getting your teeth ultra cleen and being able to have the replacement brush heads sent automaticaly every three months is a big plus.</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes fit my old model Sonicare (fat handle)</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>One package lasts you a whole year!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased replacement heads for my sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It does the job better than any regular toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always ready to go!</li>
            <li>The product was received in a timely manner, and was exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>The first set I had never tore like this one.</li>
            <li>They worked just as well as my first ones</li>
            <li>I looked around in stores for them and found them at much higher prices.</li>
            <li>I still have an old model sonicare, and these fit it.  </li>
            <li>The first time using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that the Amazon price on these replacement heads varies a lot, I paid $21 a month ago, and now they are up to almost $30.</li>
            <li>I finally was able to get to the brushes, although they were knicked by by blade on the box cutter, it does not seem to effect their service.</li>
            <li>Seeing as I already own a Sonicare, the replacement brushes were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love the Sonicare, it actually improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li>In fact when I first got it I kept brushing my teeth over and over all day.    </li>
            <li>My dental appointments for the last 3 years have been outstanding and I owe it all to my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I have recently started using this toothbrush and so far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>pack is exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li>Love the product compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The replacement brush heads I purchased were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Since purchasing the Sonicare electric toothbrush he now only needs to go in twice a year as recommended by most dentists.  </li>
            <li>My grandson who recently got braces was told by his orthodontist that there is nothing better out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay the slightly higher price and have exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>It does the job better than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It tickles at first</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My most recent visit to the dentist office</li>
            <li>I love sonicare and have my 2nd one in 4 years.</li>
            <li>They have longer bristles on the front and back edges, which reach around teeth more efficiently.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have bought replacement heads that would bog-down when putting pressure on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>But what really made me smile was the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>this is not the first time that I have had a defective Sonic Care replacement head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>need to have better Q.C. especially at the price they charge for these .</li>
            <li>Dental exams are much better than when using a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>noticed how much cleaner his teeth were at his 6 month check up!</li>
            <li>My husband was reluctant to try it because it tickles at first, but now he loves it too.</li>
            <li>My first one did not have replaceable brushes.</li>
            <li>I only wish they lasted 6 months instead of 4, but I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I recommend Philips Sonicare to anyone who is interested in maintaining and keeping their teeth.  </li>
            <li>The younger you start, the better.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite versus the smaller brush head.  </li>
            <li>When I first got my Sonicare</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrush heads for years and this is my first time ordering them online, and I won&#x27;t be doing that again -</li>
            <li>Threw it away thinking it was the first defect I have had with a Sonicare head in five years.</li>
            <li>I was even happier when I realized I could save even more by setting up a regular subscription.  </li>
            <li>Be aware when purchasing these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The magnets seem to be made of iron and within the first month of use</li>
            <li>I definitely would not buy more of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfectly - so much better than generic replacements!</li>
            <li>These work great and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>This product fit old style sonicare battery.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the brush the rubber grommet ripped.  </li>
            <li>Better price than at local retailers.</li>
            <li>Love my sonic tooth brush and these are necessary.</li>
            <li>Just enough to get the job done, and not what most companies use to survive the zombi apoplectic ending..</li>
            <li>The first head broke within a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and brush-heads for a dozen years now and this is the first time (2014)</li>
            <li>These are exact brush head replacements for the Philips unit.</li>
            <li>These are better than the originals as the slim angled neck reaches hard-to-clean areas and the come in standard and compact brush sizes.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;ve had problems buying Sonicare products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li>I like it better than a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>First of all these brushes arrived in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;Second, they are both defective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought refills before, this was the first time I had defective one.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t upgrade to a higher quality brush unless the price difference is not an issue.</li>
            <li>Some were saying the magnets were cheap or the bristle heads were soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Since that time my cleanings have been much quicker and easier, and my teeth feel sparkling, fresh, and have that \\&quot;just cleaned feeling\\&quot; all the time.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as you would expect for replacement toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m about to order some more, actually!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have purchased these tooth brush heads via internet.</li>
            <li>This most likely is just a defective fluke.</li>
            <li>Yes it might cost more than the regular toothbrush but your teeth and gum will thank you for making the investment on the sonicare brush!</li>
            <li>But health are first</li>
            <li>The product is just exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that my teeth are better off with the total product.</li>
            <li>generic brands are even better than these.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to a different model and it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are a unit in themselves...and cost almost as much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare since they first came out.  </li>
            <li>This happened to both brushes after the first usage.</li>
            <li>Two sound like weed wackers (excessively loud).</li>
            <li>Next time I will examine the brush heads more closely.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than the generic brand, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Junk, they seem to be offbrand fits for these, about halfway through the first one, the magnet at the bottom came off.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>At 6 months on the first year, no problems.  </li>
            <li>The brush physically still works except the bristles are softer and at 1 year, more spread out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush won&#x27;t do as a good a job if you don&#x27;t replace the head every few months.  </li>
            <li>Each of the two heads in the package (one I was using, the other - my son, in his identical E-series) experienced the same problem: only a couple of months into using it, the brush started making a strong noise and the vibration weakened significantly, to the point where it wasn&#x27;t cleaning at all.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised at how much better the new head works -</li>
            <li>These tooth brush heads were not only cheap, but came quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I have had several other styles of electric toothbrushes and this is by far the best of them all.</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time and they work very well as stated</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase more later</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads were to replace the original ones from the old style Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes (Oral B) and tried every kind of tooth cleaning brush, powder, and gimmick you can imagine.</li>
            <li>I would Highly recommended to anyone interested!</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected which was a great surprise.</li>
            <li>These heads do a good job of cleaning, but they wear out much faster than the previous straight head design.  </li>
            <li>been using Phillips Sonicare for a number of years and so far have had no problems except you must remove heads periodically and clean the mold that form inside.</li>
            <li>Besides,it&#x27;s very frugal to purchase only these replaceable top parts.</li>
            <li>I had problem finding replacement brushes for my old model sonicare and this model did make a difference, it will replace most of sonicare old model handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush, my teeth have been so much healthier over the last 10 years</li>
            <li>work very well, much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Two brush heads in simple cardboard packaging, couldn&#x27;t really ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes and the price is reasonable enough.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and worked better than generic brand</li>
            <li>They do a good job, but they are expensive, even though they are cheaper than in most stores.</li>
            <li>Price is high, but it is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>HX5310.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s brand new and loud and strong at first.</li>
            <li>The brushes last a long time and are effective in cleaning and getting in between the teeth to thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>not only were the bristles themselves better, but the whole unit performed as if brand new!!</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I wanted in reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I wish the packaging were a little more earth friendly and easy to open.</li>
            <li>They came quickly, brand new and really needed the replacement.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean the metal insides every few days</li>
            <li>The first one worked fine but the second one is defective, won&#x27;t work correctly.  </li>
            <li>The new Flexcare handle incorporates a new switch design and the who brush head is smaller, attaches more easily to the handle, is less to throw away when used up, and does a better job.</li>
            <li>This ia a major improvement from the original replacement heads.</li>
            <li>These heads fit my old Sonicare handle even though they look different from the heads it originally came with.</li>
            <li>first one out of the package made a real loud noise but the brush didn&#x27;t move!  </li>
            <li>with Sonicare replacement brushes: instead of paying a couple bucks for just a new brush head with bristles (costing about the same as a new manual toothbrush), you have to pay $10 for a toothbrush head that comes in its own cartridge.</li>
            <li>with my new Sonicare brush heads my breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li>The heads get &#x27;old&#x27; too quickly though.  </li>
            <li>Easy to open and all paper, no plastic!!!</li>
            <li>Very low price and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My shipments always arrive well packaged in easy to open packaging.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the first couple of days using the Sonicare delivers an overwhelming experience (not really)</li>
            <li>sonicare company does not make the package easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Came in easy to open packaging (plastic bag)</li>
            <li>We tried some clones from Walgreen and they are pure junk, all they do is make</li>
            <li>Finally ordered some new brush heads, wasn&#x27;t sure if these were the correct ones, but they were.  </li>
            <li>This is my third one and each gets better with new brushes.</li>
            <li>One of these has a loose fitting and buzzes like a ....</li>
            <li>These work great, but wear out fairly quickly and are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, easy to open, quality product.</li>
            <li>The Elite are thinner, smaller; but work fine with my Advance Sonicare.</li>
            <li>and she could not compete with the low price on Amazon for this fine product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The second one has been fine....</li>
            <li>This is a great brush, and so reasonably priced, MUCH less than one would pay at the various dept stores where I use to purchased my replacements brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some replacement heads at the store shortly after and they worked fine.</li>
            <li>After removing it and regluing it in the proper position, it worked fine.</li>
            <li>And we often give this or another Philips Sonicare model as Christmas presents to our children and grandchildren, who also think very highly of them.</li>
            <li>They work very well, certainly as advertised</li>
            <li>i like the performance, although the original heads seem to be a little strong.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, came highly recommended by friends.</li>
            <li>It is very loud and feel like isnt correctly connecting!!</li>
            <li>The other one worked great and was as quiet as a new one.</li>
            <li>It is hard to believe that any toothbrush is better than the Sonicare Advanced, but this one truly is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare E Series for over a year now and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, long lasting electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You would think Philips could come up with packaging that&#x27;s just as secure, but is much easier to open.</li>
            <li>I do not work for Amazon, but I am just one happy customer, who found the way to save a few extra $$$.</li>
            <li>I have used generic and some cheap defective, and these are the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they did fit our toothbrush and worked better for us than some of the negative reviewers reported, BUT.....  </li>
            <li>This price beat all the local stores and the service was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>After using the Sonicare units, you place them in their chargers where they stay until you&#x27;re ready to use them again.  </li>
            <li>These were the real replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I would have bought them earlier if I had known that they would fit my sonicare.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care, though</li>
            <li>: Very exspensive the brushes are like $30.00 and you have to replace them every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Longer use the bristles are too worn &amp; it exhibits too much bacteria.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>All the crevices and places for water and germs to seep is too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>enjoy the freshness feeling following a brushing with this system.</li>
            <li>I am going with the real thing from now on.</li>
            <li>Once this product was no longer available through my business, I had to search for the proper replacements.</li>
            <li>I am on the automatic replacement ordering system for the refills and it really helps me to remember to change them.  </li>
            <li>I add enough to my order to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>I give my thanks to this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>with \\&quot;normal pressure\\&quot; and on the higher setting).</li>
            <li>they are straight.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have really improved since using it.</li>
            <li>It has a timer on it, so you know how much time you are spending brushing.  </li>
            <li>Makes me want to just throw the whole thing in the trash.</li>
            <li>The real deal.  </li>
            <li>So much for my venting, Amazon is the cheapest place I can find Soniccare brushes.  </li>
            <li>absolutely no problem fitting my sonic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into the hygeine aspect of sonic care, and sonic care really does take care of teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>As described and fast delivery</li>
            <li>But you can get refills much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I tried a box opener again with out much luck.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these to anyone with teeth!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure these would fit my 4 year old handle because when I zoomed in on the product picture, it looked fairly different than the one that I currently have.</li>
            <li>Its dependable and works very well.  </li>
            <li>So much for trusting Philips products.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both see a real difference in the way our teeth look and feel.  </li>
            <li>$25 a year for brushes isn&#x27;t that much when you consider how much you&#x27;ll save on a periodontist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and really didn&#x27;t need to..</li>
            <li>My Teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>but I will use them very soon.</li>
            <li>my teeth are much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>These are not knock off, which I have tried and returned, but the real deal.</li>
            <li>From now on, I buy the real Sonicare e-Series heads.</li>
            <li>It comes out cheaper to replace the heads than the whole toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The difference is really noticeable..</li>
            <li>We compared with ones we bought onsite at a local retailer, and these were clearly cheap imitations when you looked at the printing on the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates so much that it sounds like a lawn mower in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My advice, spend a few dollars more and get the authentic product at your local store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed the replacements until I changed them.</li>
            <li>Get the real thing, don&#x27;t skimp on those off brands,</li>
            <li>thank you so much I will order again</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and they work very well.</li>
            <li>And much cheaper than the store I was going to buy them in</li>
            <li>the sonic care brush removes so much food particles, flossing is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Has really helped with gingivitis too.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sonicare and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>so I am stuck with this unless I replace the whole model.</li>
            <li>I really like subscribe and save through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But it was very obvious after receiving these, that they are not the genuine heads designed for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These couldn&#x27;t be real Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>cause you won&#x27;t have much plague build-up.</li>
            <li>Further, rather than operate with the low volume hum of an authentic Sonicare product, those I received produced a loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>my my whole head is vibrating.</li>
            <li>After much inspection I found that the magnets which makes it operate move around.</li>
            <li>this is very usefull product to fight cavities</li>
            <li>and keeps me out of the Dentist chair a lot they work very well</li>
            <li>It really made a difference.</li>
            <li>FAST EFFICIENT DELIVERY -- HAVE USED SONICARE FOR 15 YEARS -- MY DENTIST LOVES ME</li>
            <li>These are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>My dentist commented that there is much improvement once I started using the product.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like paying so much for these brushes, but looks like it pays off.</li>
            <li>Tried replacing etc but still is very noisy.</li>
            <li>as excepted thank you for the fast delivery too</li>
            <li>They were reasonably priced and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads worked well with my Philips Sonicare, and they arrive quite fast.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Pair it with some mouthwash and you have a much healthier</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe depends on what company you buy them from and how much you pay for them.</li>
            <li>did not want to throw out something that still worked really well</li>
            <li>neither the head&#x27;s softness nor smallness is much of a drawback.  </li>
            <li>Only the compact brushes are available in my area.  </li>
            <li>For years my uncle told me this would really make a difference in my dental health.  </li>
            <li>I am a Sonicare user now and can really tell a difference in the way my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sticking to the Real Deal.</li>
            <li>in fact, they appeared to be knock-offs of the real deal.</li>
            <li>So, I was very dissatisfied with the product and had to return it.</li>
            <li>We were very displeased with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the refund.</li>
            <li>And your prompt attention on my order got them to me really fast</li>
            <li>Thanks again for</li>
            <li>the fast and prompt delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips needs to lower their prices on these refills as the cost too much</li>
            <li>I am really dissapointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These brushes are much easier to buy online than trying to find them in a store.</li>
            <li>It seems they are not actually made by sonicare or some really cheap version.  </li>
            <li>Nothing much to write home about.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Well, except that they almost cost as much.</li>
            <li>maybe I don&#x27;t eat really plaque building foods, but for my use, changing brushes annually works.  </li>
            <li>Because this is my elderly mom&#x27;s toothbrush, she was very reluctant to use it, claiming it wont work.</li>
            <li>the magnet rusted, not something that happens to the real sonicare heads, and the brush didn&#x27;t move much.  </li>
            <li>and I thought that I would need to replace the whole unit.  </li>
            <li>I tried both of them and they were noisy and rattled no matter how carefully and how many times I tried re-screwing them in.  </li>
            <li>Phillips is very reliable</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I keep a different brand (Philip&#x27;s biggest competitor), in the RV, and while it has more vigorous action, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Whenever I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days, if I use a regular toothbrush for a trip or something, it always feels nice to come back to these.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have the option of buying two different size head brush in the same pack.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various third party replacement heads over the years, and none of them work as effectively.</li>
            <li>The name brand Sonicare replacement brush heads work far better than the generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li>It fit my base and works perfectly</li>
            <li>The item was new in the box and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying them very much, had been putting off buying them for a long time and finally broke down and got them because you had them at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>This has been my first trial of this new style for my Elite Toothbrush</li>
            <li>Brand new exact model.</li>
            <li>These are the right head for the old type sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristle heads were not too soft, they were just right.</li>
            <li>I love the fact Philips uses real tooth brush heads vs. the rotary things that other brands use.</li>
            <li>Normally would have paid the cost for just ONE!  </li>
            <li>I became concerned when I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes that looked like my original and prior replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>Combining these with a couple other needed items and the shipping was free too!</li>
            <li>but mine was burst a couple of months ago and the findings were significant enough to spread the news.</li>
            <li>It is very different from the original head that came with my Sonicare brush handle.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe anyone brushes their teeth with a normal toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this happen with a generic replacement head, but I&#x27;ve noticed the issue with these original Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Works just like original and had no luck with the generic version.</li>
            <li>This replacement is way different from the original.</li>
            <li>Since the original has become obsolete, I changed to the e-series and the smaller heads, but the recommend change time is 3 months versus 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to fork out a fortune to buy a whole new Sonic Care toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It beeps every thirty seconds to prompt you to clean a different area, and shuts off automatically after two minutes.</li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare does require some extra effort to keep clean.</li>
            <li>We have purchased these heads for the past few years and always are impressed with the quality and convenience of havig them on hand.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to brushing because my teeth feel so clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Now I have clean, white teeth again!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare tooth brush is the only way to clean up my teeth.  </li>
            <li>These bristles are pretty soft, softer than the originals that came with the whole unit, but they still work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li>these brush heads are workhorses.they are small enough to fit comfortably in your mouth and have a built in timer to guide the length of brushing needed to produce a sparklingly clean feeling for your teeth.</li>
            <li>Thus I clean it daily.       </li>
            <li>but they dont clean the same.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like it is going to break apart while you are brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head with the green band also works, with the normal brushing sound of my original brush head.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare uses gentle bristles but has a high speed movement that removes all plaque from your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Could not believe what a difference these new brush heads made.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth getting to replace old ones.</li>
            <li>Magnet came out first time I tried to wash it, had to use second one right away.  </li>
            <li>I finally found exactly the right brush replacemnts for my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>and I think it cleans better than conventional manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the name brand and spent a little more for the quality.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers stated, the brush is good when new but Philips makes a special effort to make this product as short lived as possible.  </li>
            <li>They just do not screw all the way down so it makes a loud buzzing sound and doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>This results in a very loud vibration / sound, not the standard buzz or hum.</li>
            <li>One unexpected benefit is that the green light on the handle glows sufficiently bright enough at night that it actually acts as a night light providing me with enough light that I can see where I&#x27;m going and not miss the toilet at night.</li>
            <li>If we were smart we&#x27;d remember as the wear marks in the bristles showed we needed new ones...</li>
            <li>On the first brush, it was clear that something was off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have this on auto-ship for as long as they&#x27;re available.  </li>
            <li>However, I purchased the regular full head</li>
            <li>Sonicare Elites are better than average electronic toothbrushes, but you should know what you&#x27;re getting into before you buy a kit.</li>
            <li>There is really no good reason why the manufacturer didn&#x27;t integrate the brush cartridge and neck into the handle itself so that you&#x27;d just have to replace the tip, but there is a good reason why they chose not to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fit my old sonicare base perfectly</li>
            <li>Cleans like the first time you used it, the old ones don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>b/c one of the magnets on one of the heads didn&#x27;t work probably and it was only a mild vibrate, not enough to actually clean your teeth</li>
            <li>The brush heads are exactly what i was looking for to replace the old ones I had.</li>
            <li>Directly out of the package the first issue was that I couldn&#x27;t get the toothbrush head cover off.</li>
            <li>I believe it also features a more efficient up and down brushing motion.  </li>
            <li>Used daily, it helps keep you gums in good shape and little or no cavities.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s like having a completely new Sonicare system!</li>
            <li>Well, you learn something new every day!  </li>
            <li>What a difference a new toothbrush makes!</li>
            <li>After using the new Elite Sonicare for about a month now, I can tell you this thing works!</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly, and it feels like I have a brand new toothbrush again!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without one!</li>
            <li>The fit on the base is perfect and easy to manipulate - the brushes themselves are soft enough to be comfortable, but solid enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>And they are cheaper than a whole new setup.</li>
            <li>I may have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush system</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to get a whole new one all together.</li>
            <li>Reminded me how important it is to replace the brush heads on the electric toothbrush at least once every 6 months, makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I know my brushing is longer and more thorough and with less effort.     </li>
            <li>NOT the older ones.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for years, and with my older model toothbrush (pre E-Series)</li>
            <li>For older folks are those with arthritis, this must be a nightmare.</li>
            <li>The bristles last longer, and the heads seem to brush a lot more aggressively than the generic ones I tried.</li>
            <li>They work well with my older e series tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Worked for Philips Sonicare Essence Classic Edition</li>
            <li>(The brush is designed to fit your hand only when it faces directly forward.)  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the older models anywhere</li>
            <li>I have an older e-series, and the product number on it is HX5300.  </li>
            <li>I do brush 2 times or more a day if possible, floss occasionally</li>
            <li>Classic &amp;#34; get what you pay for&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>you have an older model Sonicare like me look at the bottom of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was relieved to discover that I could order replacement toothbrush heads from Amazon at a decent price and with speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li>Second, they are loud, they sound like a jet engine going off in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>the second one in the pack malfunctioned quickly.  </li>
            <li>These replacement toothbrush heads are a good value and slip onto the base quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>The only solution for this problem is to screw the whole replacement head unit on until it&#x27;s almost but not entirely tight, then move the smaller part at the top of the cup until it aligns with the front, then tighten the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and purchase the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and am so very pleased I did.</li>
            <li>Ordering refills on line is much easier than going into a busy store!</li>
            <li>Fantastic, I had not changed my brushes in a long time, and had forgotten how a new brush feels.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone using these brushes.</li>
            <li>I also use BRUSHPICKS, I highly endorse this product too.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The product has a high ROI ( return on investment)  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended by my dentist too.</li>
            <li>They hook you on the product and then make high profits on the replacement parts.</li>
            <li>I mentioned to my orthodontist that I&#x27;d graduated from high school in 1983, and she said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist highly recommend Sonicare, and I have not had any teeth problems since purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended by my dental hygeinist.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I find that I don&#x27;t replace the brushes as often as I should because of their high cost.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly if you like your Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>They are of high quality &amp; very&lt;</li>
            <li>This new style is smaller and much better for me in my entire mouth.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good, only one thing that I am not very satisfied is:  the rubber rings and covers on the heads are not as tight as the original ones came with the toothbrush I bought before.</li>
            <li>Even with all of this, I still can&#x27;t clean every part, so the mold is never completely gone.</li>
            <li>I tried some other products but I discovered that those products were inferior and costly since I needed to replace them more frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have no reason to use any other kind of tooth brush.</li>
            <li>But I feel better for nuking that little farm of god-knows-what every season...</li>
            <li>They are LOUD!!</li>
            <li>We rinse them, and dry in the rack provided with the original toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The initial cost of the unit is high, but over the life of the product the benefits are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Although a little pricey when compared to a regular tooth brush or many of the electric brushes, it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>Both new heads were so loud, much more than any other heads used before.  </li>
            <li>They fit better and produce less noise than other types.</li>
            <li>I have an older model Sonicare toothbrush and can&#x27;t be bothered to upgrade to the new, fancy kinds.</li>
            <li>This replacement brush heads work well, and I can certainly tell the difference in the cleaning ability from these new brush heads to the old brush heads that they replaced.</li>
            <li>fit as expected, and do their job</li>
            <li>I find this much faster than regular brushing and does a nice job on the gumbs, not too harsh and keeps them tone to help fight tooth decay.</li>
            <li>I would have expected this from cheap aftermarket heads, but not from ones made by Philips.</li>
            <li>They are loud and very abrasive.</li>
            <li>Clean the brush handle under the cap and towel dry after each use.  </li>
            <li>It is no where near the real Philips Sonicare quality.</li>
            <li>The unit is about 20 years old and works very well yet.</li>
            <li>I really meant to get one for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>(I feel that twice a day might be too intense for my 50+ year old teeth.)  </li>
            <li>These are cheap and came crushed.</li>
            <li>After one more round, I think i&#x27;m going to switch to manual brushes.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I bought the normal brush heads (not compact) and boy</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush, but these heads just don&#x27;t last nearly as long as advertised.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived defective, most of the brush part was missing.  </li>
            <li>These particular brush heads look exactly like the previous hundreds of brush heads we&#x27;ve used over the course of many years, but something isn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
            <li>It would be a better product if the white rubbery boot did not split open near where the brush head passes through.</li>
            <li>Could come in a few more colors.  </li>
            <li>I purchased two packages of these and so far none of the brushes have lasted more than a few weeks before vibrating at a much lower rate and even stopping at times.</li>
            <li>Plus, the sonicare works better than others with the round oscillating heads</li>
            <li>I am a traditional kind of guy and resisted for a while but finally relented and came into the 21st Century of dental care!</li>
            <li>Now a few more words needed for the minimum.</li>
            <li>Works well, but it vibrates roughly with my older model sonicare as the original brush heads are no longer sold.</li>
            <li>I wish they cost less, but they do get your teeth clean!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time or money buying generic replacement heads, they do fit, but don&#x27;t clean as well and don&#x27;t last as long as these genuine sonicare replacements!</li>
            <li>It is amazing that Sonicare has a brush head that last six months and not three or less.</li>
            <li>When I changed my old brush head for a new one, it was like getting a whole new toothbrush...</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be much difference between the old and new, but after a couple of years, what a difference the new ones made.  </li>
            <li>The description had enough detail for me to pick to right head type for the Sonicare unit I have.  </li>
            <li>I was verrrry dissapointed and shipped them right back.</li>
            <li>; product my choice; price was right; representative helped with the technical stuff and did it well</li>
            <li>It is right next to an unopened package of heads from Costco.</li>
            <li>However, this replacement is like a normal cheap brush, large and harsh on your gum.</li>
            <li>Although I was doubtful they would fit my old, standard Sonicare, they were perfect.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this particular set (still using first one), does not appear to be of the same quality as others that I have on auto-delivery.  </li>
            <li>But I really like the bigger heads, so I ended up ordering the large heads too.  </li>
            <li>After five years, I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>One time when my brush head had worn out, I threw it away but didn&#x27;t immediately buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to get the new heads ever.  </li>
            <li>Makes my Sonicare feel brand new.</li>
            <li>But, prefer it over oral B, which manufactures new toothbrushes every year/</li>
            <li>it was time to try something new.     </li>
            <li>These are brand new brushheads</li>
            <li>Shipment came in time as well given we live overseas.</li>
            <li>These brush heads were brand new.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy a new brush until I found these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I was selected to test the prototype for this new Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li>I bought new power brushes and that&#x27;s what the manufacturer aimed at?</li>
            <li>It works just as new, just buy new replacement</li>
            <li>I imagine the newer model with the new heads cures this problem.  </li>
            <li>A refill makes the toothbrush run like new.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;like new level.</li>
            <li>We like the idea of being notified every six months of needing to replace the heads and if we do not cancel our subscription, Amazon automatically sends us new heads.  </li>
            <li>Fits my toothbrush just like the new one&#x27;s do</li>
            <li>I got a new Sonicare toothbrush [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C</li>
            <li>The product needs a new design as the gunk gets into the grooves of the screw of the thread of the brush handle and inside.</li>
            <li>I like using the Sonicare products so when it was time for new brush heads, I ordered online, rather then having to drive all over Tucson to try to find a set for the unit I have.</li>
            <li>I immediately order a new set.</li>
            <li>I recommend this seller to anyone who needs new toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>They shop Amazon all the time and live in Alaska.</li>
            <li>Oh what a difference a new one makes.  </li>
            <li>I bought new brushes for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I like my sonicare and just needed some new replacement brush heads for it.</li>
            <li>I bought this new toothbrush and the dentist</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like our brushes are brand new.</li>
            <li>Extend the life of your Sonicare by getting these replacement heads to make the brush like new again.  </li>
            <li>It works with my toothbrush power head like new.</li>
            <li>I have an e-series toothbrush and needed new replacement brush heads and purchased these through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to purchase a new Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like the planned-obsolescence factor.</li>
            <li>neither are useable and both are like new.........</li>
            <li>After replacing , I felt as though I were using a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After 4 years, it&#x27;s time for a new handle.</li>
            <li>We passed on our toothbrush to the kids, so we needed new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Basically, I noticed they just were not vibrating like when they were new.  </li>
            <li>I use the subscription service to purchase new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I get two new brush heads per month to re-supply 4 toothbrushes - one at home, one at work, one for my husband, and one for my mother</li>
            <li>New replacements.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should I have issues with these new Brush Heads, I will revisit this review.</li>
            <li>I want a new fancy Sonicare</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li>I was excited to save at least $10 on the 2-brush head set, but unfortunately, I&#x27;ve experienced two serious problems with these non-name brand heads.  </li>
            <li>one of those things where OEM works best,  tried the Target brand, they vibrated awful and made huge amounts of noise,these were like silk after I wore out the target ones.  </li>
            <li>told me something was different, and when I visited the hygenist for the regular cleaning my thoughts were confirmed.  </li>
            <li>Since childhood,I tend to brush my teeth relatively strongly,so this item is quite useful for me to do natural and tender care for my teeth.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize the old one had steadily grown weaker...</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are more expensive but compared to paying your dentist for cleaning and cavities, they are way cheap.</li>
            <li>The action of the brush totally cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money on these.</li>
            <li>They are perfect, just wish they were a little harder and lasted a little longer....</li>
            <li>Just buying new heads for my old Sonicares...love it!</li>
            <li>They are very soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, I was shocked at the powerful motor and rpms, and LOVED the professionally cleaned feeling my teeth had.  </li>
            <li>They are very loud when the tooth brush is turned on.</li>
            <li>I have a very old model and could not find any replacement heads ,called the manufacture</li>
            <li>I usually buy household products off Amazon since I live in NYC and it is just so much more convenient and cost-effective this way.</li>
            <li>They usually retail for a lot more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a small part at all.</li>
            <li>But the economics of size don&#x27;t apply: the standard 3-pack is a bout $12/brush at present whereas the standard 2-pack is more like $10 each.    </li>
            <li>When attached to the handle these brush heads made a loud noise not like the normal sonicare vibration.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I am aware that I selected a different line but had I known about the cheaper version, you know I would have chosen the cheaper one.  </li>
            <li>When they&#x27;re charged completely they&#x27;re even stronger!</li>
            <li>My first brush had a different design and did not have this problem.</li>
            <li>They look slightly different and the &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; model name printed on the brush head has a different font than the original.</li>
            <li>The first brush head only lasted a month.</li>
            <li>So loud that my while I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom, I couldn&#x27;t hear the door bell ringing!</li>
            <li>the first one already broke on the second brushing.</li>
            <li>The first time, the magnet fell off one of the toothbrushes within 3 days of usage, so I sent the item back as defective.  </li>
            <li>but in the long run, well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The first one that I used did not vibrate properly and then broke -- the magnet on the bottom fell off after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier model which used much larger brushes in the present brushes are much more convenient to use because of their size.</li>
            <li>And in general has really improved my oral care.</li>
            <li>Well, you do pay quite a bit for this advantage - the heads cost much more than the usual</li>
            <li>Initial cost is of course higher</li>
            <li>Thus far, only genuine replacements have worked 100% properly in our toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These ones felt cheap and make a loud noise, when pressing on my teeth the movement becomes weak and don&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as promised;  however, my only comment would be that I wish the brush heads would last a little longer, they seem to wear pretty quickly.      </li>
            <li>The first brush head lasted a few weeks and then started vibrating super loudly.</li>
            <li>Nothing else gets my teeth as clean and reaches into tight spaces as well as this particular product.</li>
            <li>I have had this tooth brush for years and these replacement heads make the old brush like new.</li>
            <li>Not a all like the old, better quality in the past.</li>
            <li>It was quickly delivered and exactly as expected</li>
            <li>It was done over a long period of time (over years, not weeks) and on very large groups of people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other brands brushes instead of the original and have found them to be very sub standard.</li>
            <li>I usually use many generic products, but you really can&#x27;t skimp with sonicare, the generics don&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble removing the old toothbrush and putting in the new one.  </li>
            <li>This newer model is lighter, smaller, fits in the mouth better, and uses less toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I expect this one to last as long, which makes it a great bargain over the years, since regular use will cut down on my dental bills!</li>
            <li>Reason is, it cleans much better than just a regular toothbrush, and in less time.  </li>
            <li>They look exactly like the original Philips product, but the magnets on the bottom of these brushes actually rust and come a little loose.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s absolutely right: mine is long gone, and I have to clean black crud out of the handle well with each replacement.</li>
            <li>I am already on the second one and it seems to be working ok, but I am assuming that one will not last very long either.</li>
            <li>The brush that came with the original was soft and small, very comfirtable to use.</li>
            <li>There is just no better way to get really clean teeth!</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll just spend a little more and take a trip to CVS.</li>
            <li>I did a little research and saw that OralB had a similar product and wondered which had a better product-- Sonicare or Oral B.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this type of brush for my teeth due to some problems that I was having and it has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for any years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time)</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, and the units fit my base, however the fit is a little off, and the brush protector is not the same as others i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The older style heads lasted about 6 months, the new rippled ones only 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li>When I received these brush heads, both of them had clearly been cut off.</li>
            <li>It suddenly stopped making contact correctly with the handle resulting in a loud noise whenever the brush is on and much weaker vibration.</li>
            <li>They feel uncomfortable, almost like a high-speed dentist drill - and the sound is higher-pitched (not that the sound matters, but it&#x27;s indicative of a change in the design).</li>
            <li>The products shipped were clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li>These replacements were clearly counterfeit</li>
            <li>I ended up epoxying them back, but really?</li>
            <li>The vibration is a firmer, but may just be because old brush became soft over time.  </li>
            <li>My electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t that old, but my dentist&#x27;s office could no longer get them for me.  </li>
            <li>and then we let the heads go to far...</li>
            <li>I was concerned about finding a replacement head for my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>When I bought my Philips Sonicare E4300, I didn&#x27;t really like it because the brush heads were way too big.</li>
            <li>Buying these from amazon through subscribe and save is by far the cheapest way to buy these replacement heads.    </li>
            <li>The bristles seem to go soft and bend sooner.</li>
            <li>Sent these back straight away.</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygenist both noticed the early stages of gingivitis (gum inflammation)and recommended Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The expense really adds up but electric toothbrushes are addictive.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to get the professional cleaning as often.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh as some brushes can be.  </li>
            <li>and I finally found it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The brushes were purchased to replace an old existing brush.</li>
            <li>Make sure you charge it fully at least once every three days</li>
            <li>/&gt;For extra cleaning, dip your loaded toothbrush into a cup of baking soda, it&#x27;s a gentle abrasive and aids in bringing the teeth up.  </li>
            <li>So far it has done this on each of the brush heads that I have used.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my patients who needed the extra care and really talked it up because it does help</li>
            <li>step backward from the old design.  </li>
            <li>Received a pair of these inside a box marked with the Philips name on it.  </li>
            <li>My wife started directly with the Elite, and it was her prompting that moved me to upgrade.</li>
            <li>I have never disliked that decision.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, I have had this product for a year</li>
            <li>AND sometimes Costco offers a  a $10 off coupon for these heads.</li>
            <li>I bought the brush head to replace the old one.</li>
            <li>I used to brush over vigorously with soft bristle manual toothbrushes and it wore at my gum line.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find them in any store, maybe because I have a 2 year old model.</li>
            <li>These did not look like the heads in my unit which was old and had no model number that I could find</li>
            <li>and maybe I could find some old brushes in a  drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize that my old brushes were geting worn out.  </li>
            <li>It rattles so loud</li>
            <li>(so far).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using one so far</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t get the old version</li>
            <li>The cleaning ability is about the same but much easier to clean and takes up less</li>
            <li>The brush head must be tightened complete.</li>
            <li>Have used for 10 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to get one for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Automatic reordering  Ship directly to home    </li>
            <li>Looks like a 3 year old cut them.</li>
            <li>2 days after using one of the replacement brush heads, it started to make a really loud buzzing noise.</li>
            <li>As it stands, I&#x27;m out the $24 and an additional $38 for the replacement--the real thing--from my local (trusted) grocery store.</li>
            <li>but i dont think sonicare carries the old holder</li>
            <li>I purchased these Philips Sonicare brush heads because my old one did not work.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these brushes.</li>
            <li>still use my old one in my RV, hence this purchase and review.</li>
            <li>my old Essence model (from 2009).  </li>
            <li>As long as our e-series battery units keep charging, I&#x27;ll keep buying these exact replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>but in a couple of days it started to make a loud buzzing noise in operation.</li>
            <li>The brush heads arrived completely destroyed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got an old Sonicare</li>
            <li>One of the brush heads is LOUD when turned on.  </li>
            <li>The heads seem to last a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I can say about a smaller head toothbrush that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;OK?</li>
            <li>The bristles are a combination of soft, extra-soft, and uselessly-soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(The real sticker-shock will happen when I have to throw away the Sonicare because the integrated Ni-Cad batteries cannot be replaced, but only mutilatingly removed for recycling.)</li>
            <li>These brushes easily last much longer than the recommended time, but I replace them anyway.  </li>
            <li>One was so loud I tossed it after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>we have bought the Phillips Sonicare tooth brush for years and replacements this by far</li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying these at local supermarkets.</li>
            <li>Thought the brushes were a bit soft.  </li>
            <li>I went through 4 heads in 2 weeks because once the soft plastic isn&#x27;t there to cushion the vibrations and noise, you feel like you have a jackhammer in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It fits my old SoniCare Advance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was greatly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Still like it but preferred the old style</li>
            <li>Rehabilitated my old portable rechargeable toothbrush and provided the newer action that help eliminate my gingivitis.</li>
            <li>I had an old one that was worn out</li>
            <li>Then I bought this actual Philips Sonicare version from Amazon, and they are sooo much quiter and smoother-running.</li>
            <li>you know you should do more often but don&#x27;t at least I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>same as factory, fast delivery</li>
            <li>Do you really not believe improved dental health and appearance is worth $6.00 per year???</li>
            <li>I have had a sonicare toothbrush for a few years now and love it, however, these refills are definitely not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads work perfectly with my sonicare elite base.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the time or hassle of sending them back, particularly since my old head was thrown in the trash!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately these replacement brush heads seemed to fit my older Sonicare fine, but would not vibrate properly.</li>
            <li>They were the right size and will last me for the next 12 months.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a little louder than my original brush head</li>
            <li>and I have just had to clean the inside a little here and there.</li>
            <li>cost of the Elite replacement brushes is minimal and the brushes last for quite some time if one does not use them to provide the conventional kind of brushing that is not needed with this battery charged tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I find I can get back behind the molars more easily with the Elite Brush heads than with the more expensive Advance Brush heads.</li>
            <li>manufactures change the model, forcing one to buy entire new product ,  Sonicare has not!</li>
            <li>My son always had trouble keeping his teeth clean from plaque build-up.</li>
            <li>If they are as in the past - they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>In the past, through my independent business, I had been able to receive orders as needed.</li>
            <li>No hidden grooves to accumulate muck.</li>
            <li>the first sonicare replacement head did not work properly so I removed it and installed the second which seems to work</li>
            <li>The third brush left all the bristles from one hole my mouth the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone, especially those with gum problems.  </li>
            <li>Definitely would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s money very much well spent.  </li>
            <li>I thus highly and only recommend using these Sonicare heads for your Sonicare brush system.</li>
            <li>And I compared the new with the old brush heads; definitely a difference.</li>
            <li>Same heads for less money with free S&amp;H</li>
            <li>I enjoy using my sonicare, but don&#x27;t like how the inside of the brush head can get dirty easily.  </li>
            <li>By switching to E-Series two years ago, not only did the irritation go away, but also I enjoy less noisy brushing.</li>
            <li>They retain their shape as long as you use the plastic cover, and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer posted photos of his old heads which were the same as my old ones and verified that these newer heads would work with my old model.  </li>
            <li>The fat bottom of the head disallows putting the Sonicare far enough into my mouth to brush the back of my tongue, so I wind up having to keep a real toothbrush around, anyway.  </li>
            <li>Basically its like an old car engine that chugs along and barely makes it up the hill.  </li>
            <li>I received exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These are more expensive than generic, but I think they&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li>In the picture above it clearly shows two toothbrushes with a light green ring.</li>
            <li>THEN I went to Amazon and found these, carefully researched them, and really appreciated the complete information and photos provided!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Very good product although a little expensive.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, got the product for a little cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had periodontal work or had root canal, implants, crowns or bridges done, you know that figure is not an exaggeration, and you&#x27;re lucky if your insurance covers even a little bit of it.</li>
            <li>Though you may save $5 or so by opting for an imitation, you&#x27;re still wasting your money by buying something that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the real thing!</li>
            <li>Although the battery on my sonicare elite doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore, the quality of the brush is very high.</li>
            <li>I will certainly use this seller in the future when I buy my next replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Returned for a new one and same result.</li>
            <li>My new brush head doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the store bought version of the same thing.</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrush that these heads are for is a recent gift to me to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; the brush before I spend $$ on a new one for myself.  </li>
            <li>Watching Amazon for a Sonicare deal and will end up buying an entire new unit.</li>
            <li>The new brushed do make a difference from one in use for over a year.</li>
            <li>Totally works like new.  </li>
            <li>brush-head that came with my toothbrush is starting to get frazzled, and it&#x27;s time to start looking for new heads.  </li>
            <li>second problem is that the brush itself doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate as vigorously as the brand-name replacement does,&lt;br /&gt;and, at the same time, it&#x27;s much noisier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently, Philips is outsourcing not only the manufacture but also the design of those, in which case one has to ask themselves why not get an aftermarket replacement (like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NN07NT0?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage) - it might not be any better but at least it would be cheaper.</li>
            <li>Cheap knock off with brush unevenly cut and SHORT!</li>
            <li>It took a few days to get used to the tingling vibrations when using the brush, and I quickly learned to not remove the toothbrush from my mouth while it was turned on (toothpaste splattered all over bathroom mirror, etc).</li>
            <li>And the average person can do a very thorough job without having to brush too hard, like many people who use a manual toothbrush, which damages the gums.</li>
            <li>While the brush heads seem to work fine, we just replaced them,  the body of the brush which is subject to rotation so that the head and the battery commpartment are not always lined up making it slightly more difficult to opperate the brush.</li>
            <li>No other brush keeps me from needing my dentist.</li>
            <li>No other complaints.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if they really aren&#x27;t lasting as long as the old ones.  </li>
            <li>One of the metal strips responsible for producing the vibration broke loose and basically reduced its vibrating power by 50%.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads fit my Sonic base very well and are a better price than I can buy locally.  </li>
            <li>I can see the need for replacing the whole component from time to time but certainly far less frequently than the brush.  </li>
            <li>the replacement heads can be a little pricey, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>My only complaints with this product are the clamshell packaging, which sliced my thumb while trying to open and its high cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced bad quality.</li>
            <li>Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper to buy these through Amazon than to wait for aa sale and to pay salestax as long as you plan enough in advance.</li>
            <li>I will steer clear of these in the future.</li>
            <li>:  loud, don&#x27;t power up well (they stall when applying the tiniest bit of force), and the two magnets simply came off one of the heads.  </li>
            <li>This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t remove the mildewy smell despite 20 minutes of scrubbing it with (yes) an old regular toothbrush to get into the crevices.  </li>
            <li>I feel like after a week they are soft and feel the same as the do after 3 months.</li>
            <li>the head flopped from side to side and barely vibrated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have ANY cavities either (27 years old) - been using since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li>I used generic brand for about a year, and it was so loud you practically had to wear ear plugs.  </li>
            <li>i let my old brush tip go faaaar longer than 6mos and finally replaced it--what a difference!</li>
            <li>I had been using the same old head for some time without replacing it.</li>
            <li>I want the old brush heads back.</li>
            <li>Overall, though the advantages far outweigh the costs....</li>
            <li>Barely scrapes anything anymore</li>
            <li>Apparently these are either knock offs or seconds - not what you would expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Just like the ones pictured, they work very well with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>Not happy with the latest purchase.</li>
            <li>It is just poor quality control when the toothbrush has more power than the toothbrush head can handle.  </li>
            <li>so I was a little worried it wasn&#x27;t the right replacement head.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost for potential issues down the road.</li>
            <li>I hope they don&#x27;t change the design like they did after the first one I bought (had to throw away several spare heads, as the new handle/battery holder would not fit).</li>
            <li>Guess it doesn&#x27;t really matter for us since we get new ones every round, but maybe it would for others.  </li>
            <li>Also, my harsh cleaning methods have caused the metal part at the bottom to rust, which creates a whole new set of problems.</li>
            <li>and I believe the fact that it still works perfectly is due  largely  to using the correct replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these replacements for the old bulky type and really are much less intrusive, in fact I don&#x27;t feel lile choking or vomiting when brushing the rear teeth.</li>
            <li>I had one of these heads on my toothbrush so long the magnets unglued themselves, so I needed a new set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of this product, but have just subscribed to your service of sending new repolacement heads at specified intervals.  </li>
            <li>Love my sonicare, but the packaging on these is ridiculous!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for at half the store price.  </li>
            <li>These are an exact replacement for the e series and they are delivered to my door at a price that is less than what I can buy them</li>
            <li>These are much higher quality than the previous replacement heads I have bought from Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the same level of clean.</li>
            <li>I feel like these newer heads do not last as long as the older ones.</li>
            <li>A little expensive, but they do a great job and the dentist recommends.  </li>
            <li>so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
            <li>a little too harsh to me, but probably doing a better job.</li>
            <li>This one is in the middle of the brush and runs down much quicker than the old line at the front of the brush.  </li>
            <li>This time, while the issue is not as bad as a defective magnet, so the toothbrush head is still usable, it has enough issues for me to not be completely happy.      </li>
            <li>Although it took several months to actually turn my dental health completely around, I consider the Sonicare system as pivital to my oral health.  </li>
            <li>I have a very low gag reflex and the old style always made me gag when I worked the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>As far as peoples&#x27; complaints about the cost of the replacement heads - $10 buys a brush head that lasts for 6 months, while you have to replace regular toothbrushes every 3 months, and some of those cost $5 each, so it works out to about the same.  </li>
            <li>I recommend only getting replacements directly from Sonicare, to ensure they will work properly.</li>
            <li>One worked and the 2nd one made such a loud noise</li>
            <li>Now, the 2nd head is showing early signs of doing the same after about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the low price compared to the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I had tried some generic replacements from a local drugstore, but they made a loud noise after being installed.</li>
            <li>I would not have purchased such an expensive brush on my own.  </li>
            <li>Juust make sure you aren&#x27;t missing a spot and get into a thorough routine rotating the undulatiing round brush throughout your mouth.</li>
            <li>I just bought not long time ago, I still didn&#x27;t use it because I bought these 2 pack brush head for keep instock</li>
            <li>handle is over 5 years old and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge too long</li>
            <li>The magnets came off both heads not long after receiving this item.</li>
            <li>These brushes are barely vibrating and they don&#x27;t have the same sound.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First few brushes felt like I was sitting in the dentist office getting my teeth cleaned before getting used to it</li>
            <li>(i know buying them in bulk is truly worth the savings $$$), but i usually end up getting the two pack.</li>
            <li>First, the toothbrush heads I received are the green ones, not the ones pictured.</li>
            <li>Not as much water running down the stem.  </li>
            <li>Very hard to open, but exactly what you would be paying nearly 2x as much for in a store, not to mention tax and standing in line.</li>
            <li>Bought the replacement from amazon much cheaper than the typical price at the store.</li>
            <li>It is dishearteninbg to see a much cheaper , by half, of a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is the OEM but is much lighter and louder that the previous one I have had</li>
            <li>They last a long time, near 6 months each.</li>
            <li>The first few times you use an electric brush with these heads your mouth will likely feel as if it&#x27;s all a-buzz.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are easy to change but the assembly should be opened and cleaned between changes because material collects inside the mechanism and that&#x27;s unappealing.  </li>
            <li>brushes don&#x27;t wear down fast, last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Other is the price, a normal toothbrush is $1, but these are about $10 a piece.</li>
            <li>One of the brush heads broke down after several weeks of normal use, it stopped working suddenly, the brush head would not vibrate as hard as before and it could not be used to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>They really should make the brushheads to have a water tight seal</li>
            <li>They work but wear our a little to fast.</li>
            <li>Even if I could fit the head back there, it would be too small for the job, due to my big tongue.  </li>
            <li>Intense vibration takes a little getting used to - but your teeth will feel clean!I typically alternate with regular toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Every electric toothbrush I have ever used (got my DDS in 1964) has cleaning issues, but the job they do, and Phillips is the best in my experience, make it worth the trouble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great item, pleased with seller and with the product</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the prompt service.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are priced right and are  of great quality!</li>
            <li> He was right - fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very Fair price and came in an original Phillips Sonicare brush head box.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to be able to receive, at a good price, the Sonicare Elite brush heads every 6 months.</li>
            <li> great tooth brushes  and the rest is by far the best tooth brush</li>
            <li> They work great and keep my teeth nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed and they arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First of all the brushing experience is 100 times better!  </li>
            <li> LOVE Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I love changing these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be damned if Philips can come up with a better head for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> LOVE the toothbrush itself though!</li>
            <li> But I love them!</li>
            <li> go ahead and make the purchase, you will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I am very happy to notice that I really like it!  </li>
            <li> I will get more!</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  </li>
            <li> And what is even better, I could use my accumulated points to pay for them!  </li>
            <li> They were a better price on Amazon than in the store!</li>
            <li> Love our Sonic toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as advertised and provides the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the heads we needed and work perfectly for our bases.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> The brush is great and Amazon is always easy to deal with</li>
            <li> She was very excited!  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that they work fine.  </li>
            <li> Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> and we then again realize why they are so wonderful is largely because we have refreshed the heads again.  </li>
            <li> They work beautifully, and I can tell you after years of usging sonic, and great check ups at dentist, I highly recommend, sonic over manual burshing.  </li>
            <li> These heads fit our SoniCare toothbrushes, and do a great job of brushing.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are an amazing value-</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Initially happy that these were correct fit for my Sonicare, unlike the generics I bought with a Groupon.</li>
            <li> Got these through Amazon and my wife is happy the jackhammer sound is gone again.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is an amazing brand.</li>
            <li> This does an amazing job at removing plaque, and massaging gums.</li>
            <li> These heads are amazing at brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> Fit great on my handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item came in a very timely manor and was in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li> Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li> My hygenist is thrilled with my teeth and my gums these days.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to have found a good price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Nice brushes at a nice price.</li>
            <li> It will be nice to not have to remember when it&#x27;s time to re-order.</li>
            <li> Nice not to have to wait in line in some discount store forever.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are good for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> Amazon is great to have them at such a great price!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> They may be some kind of knockoff.</li>
            <li> Since we have started using it we have experienced a much cleaner feel and have been receiving great comments from out dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> But to be effective the brush heads have to be changed of course.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to find these heads at a good price.  </li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and always looking for a good price in the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they aren&#x27;t good for your teeth either.</li>
            <li> Its performance and reliability are downright astounding.</li>
            <li> at times  be hazardous.  </li>
            <li> Finding a place I can trust as to name products, good prices,  good quality and honest salesmanship is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted the service was excellent thanks</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and this was a good price ad</li>
            <li> I liked the minimalist packaging the company used.</li>
            <li> , good quality replacemnt head, cover for head is redesigned and stays on better now.</li>
            <li> Kind of a reminder of the way things once were and should be today.</li>
            <li> the Sonicare is so effective,</li>
            <li> and that was so nice.  </li>
            <li> So have a nice day.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own a Sonicare Toothbrush system, you should.</li>
            <li> this is a great way to automatically receive head replacements when you need them, at a good discount, and right to your door.  </li>
            <li> They are original manufactures brushes and work great.</li>
            <li> These work great and fit perfectly and are new and packaged as they should be.</li>
            <li> Fits the older Sonicares perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are great and the price was pretty good..</li>
            <li> Although this is an older brand of toothbrush, the replacement brushes worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great for keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are excellent and come highly recommended by dentists.  </li>
            <li> High quality - best price.  </li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare for many years and are very satisfied with the type of cleaning it provides for our teeth.</li>
            <li> They clean teeth!!  </li>
            <li> These sonic toothbrushes work best when they are new.  </li>
            <li> This new style brush fits and works perfectly in my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> These new heads work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> but I just recently went to a continuing education seminar on homecare devices and found my beloved Sonicare was not the one that did the best job according to the research.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com is a very easy way to shop on line.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it to be very easy to use and care for my teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very easy.</li>
            <li> The way these brushes clean is impeccable.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing with an older Sonicare for many years, and just had an excellent dental check up after two years.  </li>
            <li> My family and my dentist are happy with the results that Sonicare Elite system provides and since every replacement heads lasts 6 months, it is well worth the $9.50.</li>
            <li> good fit as a replacement head</li>
            <li> Amazon had by far the best price.  </li>
            <li> and I believe that this is the best product for complete teeth cleaning out there.</li>
            <li> Better than the Oral B tooth brush, which I also own.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing old varnish from furniture or the enamel from your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively</li>
            <li> Phillips make them great and well worth it.</li>
            <li> They are good to fit my Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> IT IS THE MOST AMAZING TOOTH BRUSH EVER.</li>
            <li> Having the toothpaste right in the brush is great as well.  </li>
            <li> They came very quickly and were immediately put into use!</li>
            <li> The heads easily snapped on!</li>
            <li> I was greatly relieved to find that these brush heads fit the Advance just fine.  </li>
            <li> The replacement head was as good as the original.</li>
            <li> This is a good replacement for the original model.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were as good as the original.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean it and the brush was still good</li>
            <li> These are good brush heads (for a good toothbrush), but it seems Sonicare is asking a bit too much money for them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tooth brush and keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to replace those sonicare brushes so that you keep your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The sonic action is the greatest in the Oral B top of the line model and that is what helps reduce tartar and staining.  </li>
            <li> basically made a fair amount of noise but didn&#x27;t clean my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my healthy smile.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush (which is super reliable and great for my teeth and gums) but don&#x27;t love spending a lot on periodic replacement heads...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine!</li>
            <li> These pillows are very comfortable, I would or will them buy again.</li>
            <li> for  easy  and effective  way of removing  plaque ...</li>
            <li> Thank you for making it so easy for me to keep my teeth so very clean!</li>
            <li> We get new replacement heads in every six months (how often you are supposed to replace the toothbrush head anyways) and are always thrilled to swap out and keep using our great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love this new tooth brush!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Philips certainly has a great sonic toothbrush but hasn&#x27;t bothered to make the price of their brush head replacements cost-effective.  </li>
            <li> I am certain there is a great reason to brush your teeth for 2 minutes, so I still use it.</li>
            <li> A new brush head feels so good!       </li>
            <li> Very good value--better pricing than direct from Phillips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes a huge difference when brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> Have this product  for years,  love it.</li>
            <li> Should have bought these with the toothbrush, but glad Amazon reminded me that they had them when I needed them.</li>
            <li> I found just what I needed to keep my Philips Sonicare Tooth brush in tip top shape.  </li>
            <li> I have to buy them every 3 months or so and wish I could get a better price.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the toothbrush then and have had one since then.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using them for many years now and he has had zero cavities.</li>
            <li> They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my teeth and gums are way better off.</li>
            <li> Now after purchasing the sonic care brush when I go to the dentist they always say to me that it looks like you have been brushing better and flossing.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I could find even in the local store.  </li>
            <li> I love Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> We love the Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush heads.  </li>
            <li> One more</li>
            <li> This was a no brainer, I love the toothbrush, the replacements in the store are $30</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, but would be astonished if I hadn&#x27;t been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I bought a second one for my mother!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The way it is designed is perfect for oral health….teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Also there appears to be more power and</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has seen my gums improve and my teeth in better condition.</li>
            <li> I love Phillips sonicare.  </li>
            <li> And with the Amazon subcription discount makes this an even better deal.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years and have tried many of the knock-off substitutes for these brush heads.</li>
            <li> This one fits, but is a much better brush.  </li>
            <li> Keep your body healthy, use this brush today.  </li>
            <li> I could not ask for a better transaction.</li>
            <li> In addition, there are too many corners and moving parts that bacterias and thrive in.</li>
            <li> do I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over three years, and I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satsified with my purchase, have no complaints and would gladly buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I have braces and, as a result, have to replace my brush heads more often.</li>
            <li> so glad to get these via delivery</li>
            <li> It cleans better</li>
            <li> We are satisfied with all aspects of this system.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> and i dont have to worry about buying more for a year.</li>
            <li> We are repeat buyers of this product and have been for many years.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for a great deal in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> --you will love it.</li>
            <li> Want to save more, then use Amazon credit card.</li>
            <li> If this product was priced more appropriately, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums and mouth are getting the best care possible with the sonicare system.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with its performance using the replacemant brush head.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the OEM ones like these.</li>
            <li> Sure makes the teeth feel</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not laying out a grand for the procedure.  </li>
            <li> and I love how my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> Love my brush and glad to have nice,fresh,stiff bristles again.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for 2 Sonicare Elite replacement heads!  </li>
            <li> I just wonder with so many people using this product, how many of them ended up in the ER?</li>
            <li> My husband and I love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Also, with free delivery!  </li>
            <li> But the alternative is manual toothbrushes and more cavities.  </li>
            <li> Much better than retail.</li>
            <li> but at  a much better price</li>
            <li> and the design is much better.</li>
            <li> Her dentist is pleased with her reduced plaque.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Elite for a couple of years and am totally satisfied with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have been using the sonicare for 4 years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I listened to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare tooth brush so of course I need to purchase replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and Sonicare did not fare as well as the top of the line Oral B</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s why the Sonicare is the most frugal product I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare delete brush.</li>
            <li> You can wipe some of it off, but for the most part you just have to pretend that you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonicare system for about 12 years now and absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li> will be asking for a refund for sure.</li>
            <li> Plus the shipping was free!</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this product, which I received as a gift.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> We have had ours for more than 6 years.</li>
            <li> Have bought this item many times.</li>
            <li> This year I purchased two for my grown children and they love it.  </li>
            <li> Genuine Sonicare heads as promised!  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Does well for keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more \\&quot;painful\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> I now realize.  :)</li>
            <li> But I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare Elite for over a year now and love how it makes my teeth feel...</li>
            <li> Thank you for great and fast service.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I love these heads.  </li>
            <li> need I say more?  </li>
            <li> Cleans teeth much better than a regualr tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare Elite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over 10 years, and love the way it makes my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> It works not any better than replacement I can get at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> glad i did.</li>
            <li> Love using he sonic care tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they made the e-Series compatible with mine</li>
            <li> But the actual Philips replacement heads shown here are excellent and love the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise they get the job done and and remove most visible plaque after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;5/5, would brush again</li>
            <li> I KNEW SOMEONE MUST HAVE A BETTER</li>
            <li> The e-Series is, of course, an updated - better - version from my original.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We like the slip on version much better.  </li>
            <li> These immediately made much more noise than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in OEM packaging from stores.</li>
            <li> I love the way they feel.</li>
            <li> Love my teeth and love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> If you buy a pair of these replacement brushes make sure you try both as soon as you get them.</li>
            <li> Glad I switched to this type of electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love that.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for coupons or discounts for this product, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find any.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I need to replace more often.</li>
            <li> and that is why I have ordered this item which cost more in the department stores located where I shop.</li>
            <li> I love the sonic and I could not find the replacement head in any store</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for over 10 years and it sure has made a difference during my annual dentist cleaning visits.</li>
            <li> And the flaired design at the top of the screw-on cap seems to keep crud from seeping into the battery/handle recess.</li>
            <li> We really love these toothbrushes and like using them.  </li>
            <li> I really love my Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> I mostly like the oral B prodocts but</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I compared these heads to the OEM version and these are many differences: plastic quality, bristle quality/cut, and labeling.</li>
            <li> If the Stills company reads this I would love a replacement.  </li>
            <li> the more I use them.  </li>
            <li> It is much better to buy these than the knock offs.</li>
            <li> I would love to see Amazon offer the compact heads as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to Amazon more and more because of the reliability of product information and ease of purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for about five years and generally love it.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> Many people have mentioned it... and our dentist and hygienist...</li>
            <li> Love these ...</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I like being able to buy them cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> So much better priced here.  </li>
            <li> These work better, but I don&#x27;t know why or how.  </li>
            <li> I can make it work but must make sure the magnets are in the correct position every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Patients with the Sonicare did much better, but don&#x27;t take my word for it.  </li>
            <li> I wish they came with more replacement brush heads to reduce the price per brush head.</li>
            <li> Love these sonicare series brushes.</li>
            <li> They use to make them a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Better than the knock off clones.</li>
            <li> and I am sure the company knows this</li>
            <li> My hygienist says my teeth and gums look so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare, and love these replacement heads for when the bristles go.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> *Do not* buy the off brand replacement heads, unless you like to be able to hear your spouse/s.o/partner brush their teeth all the way in the farthest bathroom downstairs whilst they&#x27;re upstairs.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dental hygienist many years ago so have used it/them for years.</li>
            <li> use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.</li>
            <li> i love my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shiopping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more and get what I need.</li>
            <li> there are better out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can judge for yourself when you need a new&lt;br /&gt;brush</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Even BB&amp;B are more money with a coupon.</li>
            <li> but if you want to replace them more often be prepared to shell out close to $30.00 each time.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare e-series brush and heads.  </li>
            <li> This is about 20 cents more than a buying manual toothbrushes every (recommended) 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> We have had our sonicare toothbrushes for about 4 years now and, since newer models are sold in stores, I have not been able to find brush head replacements in stores.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you know your  sonicare toothbrush series or name before ordering.  </li>
            <li> To keep the brush working in top form, you have to replace the brush heads every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and the way my teeth feel after brushing![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, matches up to model, saves me from hunting for the correct brush-head in stores.</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads...</li>
            <li> They are made of a thinner plastic and make a lot more noise.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more at Target and the Target brushes are working much better.</li>
            <li> With even the slightest amount of pressure (i.e. touching the bristles to your teeth)</li>
            <li> but you can also buy these in packs of 6 or more for more cost savings.</li>
            <li> As many others have already said, what I received appear to be either non-OEM brush heads, or were defective in some way.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and have had one for many years.</li>
            <li> Bristles look like they have seen better days.</li>
            <li> , okay</li>
            <li> Always better than a manual</li>
            <li> Ok but overpriced brush refills.  </li>
            <li> I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for many years now.</li>
            <li> I made sure to buy those listed for sale by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare for many years</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare, and I love these heads for 3 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re labeled as coming from Sonicare, and I believe they&#x27;re authentic.</li>
            <li> love the Sonicare system though.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> and these are so much better at cleaning my teeth-much faster and much more thorough.  </li>
            <li> Then there was yet more blister pack packaging inside.</li>
            <li> I have had my toothbrush for about 10 years and used many replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I also told her they probably dont make the type that she had any more.</li>
            <li> i get these at the drug store, i love em, they work well for ages.</li>
            <li> I ordered another set that came in actual Philips packaging and they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> We ordered these, and they&#x27;re not the authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love these -</li>
            <li> That is very nice - quite unlike certain replacement parts for razors.</li>
            <li> works fine, came on time, gives me a good clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Wow - seriously good customer service!  </li>
            <li> as promised fits right and works just like the original brush head and all that at a great price too</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of keeping the teeth clean and clearing any plaque build up.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush has given me great results, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> love feeling my teeth are amazingly  clean after using this tooth brush!</li>
            <li> They have helped me greatly and I will continue to use them until I must buy a new Sonicare foe sure.</li>
            <li> Get teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 years since a checkup and the dentist said my teeth where very clean considering the time without a cleaning.</li>
            <li> By leaving the scrubbing motions to the device, I&#x27;m able to spend more attention to aiming accurately and evenly, to avoid overscrubbing, to avoid falling asleep from boredom, and it does a better job than I could.  </li>
            <li> I got a pretty good deal with this order.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Sonicare for decades since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing fun again!!</li>
            <li> Brand new in package, great price and received with in days.</li>
            <li> It feels great to start brushing again with a new head on your Sonicare and</li>
            <li> so glad I could easily get replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure which replacement brush I needed,but found it easily with the description and pictures.  </li>
            <li> Haave been using the Sonicare products since their introduction several years ago, and this one continues the trend of great value products, while being extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I am most satisfied to have the Philips brand available through Amazon and I will continue to order my replacements on an as needed basis.</li>
            <li> My friend finally convinced me that the Sonicare product is superior, and then I read a review on Amazon from a hygenist who said that she went to a continuing education seminar and learned that Oral B was found to be superior...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a better way to protect your teeth and more importantly your gums.</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt this clean, even after the dentist&#x27;s office!  </li>
            <li> So basically it doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> These heads are great - vibrate as expected and do a super great job of cleaning my teeth and stimulating my gums.</li>
            <li> I love what this toothbrush does, but these replacement brushes were even better than the original ones I purchased.</li>
            <li> If you want a great toothbrush that really gets your teeth clean, then this Sonicare Elite is for you.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best method I know to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and the price was very reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li> The basic electrical part of the brush has held up very good.</li>
            <li> very good the item was sent internationally</li>
            <li> Sonicare units are easy to clean, and it is very easy to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li> New brushes feel really great on your gums and keep them clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Many newer models were available on the store shelves...</li>
            <li> they fit more than one</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these replacement heads for my OLD Sonic Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> What I expected from Sonicare, an excellent replacement part.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they arrived on time in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase and it arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> The price, which is lower than those available at my nearest drug store,  is also something I am pleased about.</li>
            <li> And dear god is it better than the cheap ones that emit that ear deafening banshee screech when you turn on your brush.</li>
            <li> Attached to old body and they worked great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would fit, but a CSR at Phillips told me they would.  </li>
            <li> A great replacement for the old one.</li>
            <li> These brushes were too loud and vibrated through too great a field.  </li>
            <li> Sure they fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> great for the price and replace for old brush head.  </li>
            <li> It was much better and a tighter fit.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and price good.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a good price.  </li>
            <li> These Philips brush heads vibrate better, perhaps because they fit more securely on the handle.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were a good price (cheaper than anywhere else I checked) and the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit upset that I go through these brushes so fast, but they do a good job with cleaning.</li>
            <li> Good price, QWik ship, thanks....</li>
            <li> I was concerned I would have to buy a whole new unit because of the age of my Sonicare, but these are the perfect replacement head.</li>
            <li> Great price and got it super fast with my prime membership.</li>
            <li> I will purchase the full head from now on!</li>
            <li> These replacement parts work as well or better than what came originally with the unit.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s A LOT more compact than the original brush.</li>
            <li> and I like this newer style brush better than the original.</li>
            <li> I love which they don&#x27;t make original brush heads</li>
            <li> Great product that fit my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Amazon.com makes it so easy to replace my toothbrush heads on schedule.  </li>
            <li> We have found it to be an integral part of keeping our teeth and gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Its great to be able to just open a package instead  of getting out the hedge clippers!</li>
            <li> Easy to use adn efficirnt in cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Even though Philips says it can be done quite easily, is isn&#x27;t so.   </li>
            <li> These heads easily run about $35 in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Easy way to get replacement brushes for Sonicare, keeps it working at  &lt;</li>
            <li> Easy purchase.</li>
            <li> so well, I purchased one for each of my sons because, after all the years of emphasizing the importance of a clean, healthy mouth, how could I NOT have bought them?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it has helped clean my teeth and help get rid of my tarter.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for about ten years, and it&#x27;s an excellent toothbrush that is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes shopping for these types of items incredibly easy.</li>
            <li> There seems to be an issue with how easy they are to attach and remove.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Phillips tooth brushes for years now and they always perform well and are easy to keep charged.</li>
            <li> I LIKE HOW EASY IT IS TO USE</li>
            <li> Easy to install and remove.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are so easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.  </li>
            <li> , continue doing.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad for this amazing product, they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li> how easy can it get.  </li>
            <li> No rattling and strong brushing.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that I was purchasing the incorrect replacement brushes, I think the clue is to make sure you get the correct series, they were reasonably priced, arrived in a timely manner and nicely packaged</li>
            <li> We have had these toothbrushes for about 8 years now and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> but I would strongly suggest upgrading to a newer model that uses the brush heads that are just the stick part.</li>
            <li> Any one who use a Sonicare tooth brush-which my dentist recommended-will be pleased with this replacement and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Price was good, and shipping was pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the fast arrival.</li>
            <li> The problem after the first shipment the price rose almost two dollars.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save has sent me this kind of brush head.</li>
            <li> Also so happy they included the clear cover for the brush head as I had lost the original.  </li>
            <li> A full size brush provides much better cleaning than a compact.  </li>
            <li> Buy replacement heads from a more reputable dealer or risk getting brushheads that will not make a good enough connection with the magnet.</li>
            <li> They screw on and off very easily and are of the right firmness.</li>
            <li> Efficient &amp; light weight way to clean my teeth, absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a great product because it&#x27;s simply a replacement for the original brush, but the brush design could have been better.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this electric toothbrush through Amazon.com thanks to the many reviews by those who own it.</li>
            <li> However, these new brush heads aren&#x27;t as good as the ones I&#x27;ve used all along.</li>
            <li> The Elite Sonicare Brush heads work fine with the Advance Sonicare Electric Toothbrush that I have.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush is a fine product that I have used every day for a decade.</li>
            <li> and you are fine.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes it easy to keep my household stocked with toothbrushes without worrying that the product will not be available.</li>
            <li> no paperwork,  otherwise fine</li>
            <li> Replacement head worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to replace the heads on my Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> They work fine.  </li>
            <li> We have used the Sonicare for a year and a half, this is the best price we&#x27;ve found on the replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes fit easily into the Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But now I find it works just fine</li>
            <li> All seemed fine.</li>
            <li> They work fine ...</li>
            <li> I thank you for making this process so easy and available.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes work fine.</li>
            <li> The brush head replacement started out fine</li>
            <li> They work fine in our brush.</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine - it&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> One of the heads worked fine; one was defective and did not vibrate when attached to the brush head.</li>
            <li> Work fine.</li>
            <li> However, the two heads we ordered work just fine.</li>
            <li> Packaging is not for retail display, which is fine.  </li>
            <li> I am glad these newer brushes fit on the older Sonicare that I own.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping--arrived as presented---will use again!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads arrived quickly and were priced much more favorably than any retail store in our town.</li>
            <li> #34;better deals.&amp;#34; Super product for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Beside the Phillips Sonicare tooth brush being superior to most other brands, the brushes are the key to having wonderful teeth.  </li>
            <li> A very good product, the same item that I buy in stores, the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Good bye old fashioned manuel toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> I really like this teeth cleaning system, and Amazon is an easy and cost effective way to get replacements.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit and work fine.</li>
            <li> I showed her that it fit on the holder, so it will be fine.</li>
            <li> These heads work pretty well and are very strong.  </li>
            <li> Perfect but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> They arrived in good condition in the time promised, nothing special to say, if you need replacement heads and don&#x27;t like spending your weekends hunting them down at a good price, the internet&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Sonicare brushes for years and they have made a huge improvement in the health of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my dentist visits.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge difference, 1 brush a year versus 4 brushes a year.  </li>
            <li> YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW FANTASTIC THIS ITEM IS.</li>
            <li> 34;BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Beware of Sonicare&#x27;s Buy 2 Get 1 Free Brush Head Offer.  </li>
            <li> companies- if you tout how easy it is to clean your electric toothbrush people will sit up and listen.  </li>
            <li> Once you have used any type of advanced cleaning system, you never want to brush your teeth with a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> some heads don&#x27;t fit some models etc</li>
            <li> So bought Phillips/the heads fit all models.</li>
            <li> (Important for a guy.)     </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I have read where some of these replacment brushes are cheap knock-offs.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Sonicare and they confirmed that this product is a knock off.  </li>
            <li> and they were cheap</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and it has greatly improved my dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> They fit my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Am on third set of replacement heads for this one and am quite happy with performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work great and last a while!</li>
            <li> These brushes fit the Sonic Advance handle and are a substantial improvement over the Advance replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a sonicare for several years and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> With free shipping, and no tax from Amazon it was a no brainer.</li>
            <li> At my next visit, the gums looked great.  </li>
            <li> The important thing is to not just rely on a manual toothbrush all the time.</li>
            <li> These were great before they became backward compatible with the earlier model bodies.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they fit the elite unit but they are not the ones I ordered.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> Electronic toothbrushes use the the Gilette model: sell the shavers for cheap, get them on the razor blades.</li>
            <li> Order something else to get over $25 and qulify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Research if it fit your model before order.</li>
            <li> These arrived and are so easy to install and get to working on keeping my teeth so so clean.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean your teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li> Really feels nice on gums, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the genuine philips replacement brush.</li>
            <li> I bought another brush before which was supposed to fit into my philips sonicare tooth brush, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My sister just has to get use to the vibrating sensation &amp; Inky her cat who looks for that sound.</li>
            <li> My family has been using the Sonicare toothbrush for several years and are quite happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush has made such a great difference in my dental care.</li>
            <li> Healthy gums equal a great, all-natural smile.</li>
            <li> The cheap stuff didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was free and received shipment promptly.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason my elite is about 20% more powerful with the replacement brush head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curved head and speed have made my hygienist sing my praises for teeth that are plague free.</li>
            <li> Not  Didn&#x27;t fit correctly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried store-brand heads that fit the Sonicare, but they didn&#x27;t function as well.</li>
            <li> cleaner and smooth</li>
            <li> Frankly, they were added to another purchase to qualify for free shipment.</li>
            <li> I got the two replacement heads for my Essence toothbrush --- about $23 from Amazon (Dec 08) with Subscribe and Save, free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if they are genuine as advertised.</li>
            <li> so I was happy when I found actual Sonicare replacements on Amazon</li>
            <li> Always buy brand name, these fit and held up well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these were genuine sonicare replacements.</li>
            <li> On a genuine product the word &amp;#34;e-Series&amp;#34; is engraved on the shaft.</li>
            <li> These are the name brand ones and fit well.</li>
            <li> however these heads are great and last longer even at 2-3 times a day of usage than the box says.  </li>
            <li> One was perfect, one did not fit well and lead to water leakage and corrosion.</li>
            <li> for.&lt;br /&gt;These fit.</li>
            <li> detailed find teeth</li>
            <li> fit.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit like they used to.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s available for the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are well worth the money, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a B&amp;M store with a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li> They work; they fit the advertised model of electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have bought genuine replacements and knock-offs and store brands.</li>
            <li> Worked great and got my sonicare and teeth back into shape!</li>
            <li> They fit.  </li>
            <li> The HX7002/62 e-Series happen to be the heads that fit my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It filled the need for replacement brush heads for the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my wifes&#x27; Sonicare toothbrush and they fit and work well.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my Sonic care</li>
            <li> At a drug store, I bought a two-pack of the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; version of these that were supposed to fit my Sonicare model.  </li>
            <li> Such a good deal for authentic brush head replacement parts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally (inci \\&quot;dental\\&quot; ly?), Amazon&#x27;s price on these heads is excellent -- much cheaper than my local pharmacies.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the national name brand and is far cheaper.  </li>
            <li> , this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun [Oral B] brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth.</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;old school\\&quot; replacement units ARE good quality-</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare, but these brushes really need to be designed better.</li>
            <li> These are much easier to keep clean and seem to do a better job of cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement, bristles a little stiffer than original, works</li>
            <li> Love the brush but the replacements don&#x27;t seem to fit quite right as they make a lot of noise and don&#x27;t have the movement of the originals.</li>
            <li> my mouth has never felt better than it does right now.</li>
            <li> Slipped right into position with no problem and will order more when needed.</li>
            <li> better than getting it at the store and receives it right away.</li>
            <li> This newer design is not as easy to clean as the original version</li>
            <li> It works, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same amount of vibration as the original brush, oh well the noise helps me wake up in the morning lol.</li>
            <li> These do not give the strong vibration of the full price heads.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> THANKS!!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY quite like these!!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush keeps my mouth clean and is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My dentist believes that not only did the Elite model improve my oral care but that the decrease for the need for filings was the best (I agree since I don&#x27;t particularly care to have my face drilled on too often).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the head for my now older Sonicare electric tooth brush that doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one brushing anymore.  </li>
            <li> These are the original, not some cheap copy that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit the original base/battery</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 electric toothbrush is rated highly in reviews because it&#x27;s comfortable to use, and is effective at removing plaque.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the reordering system and the price offered for being on the system is much better than I can buy them in a local store, plus I don&#x27;t have to go and get them!!</li>
            <li> Ordering and receiving this product was easy and quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After dental cleaning you can pick up a dental head as opposed to a free toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the most reasonable, price location to purchase!</li>
            <li> They are very easy to change and they work very well on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> i believe it is money well spent now that i have healthy gums and a dazzling smile!</li>
            <li> ( doc said to floss more), and very very very seldom miss a brushing.  </li>
            <li> One thing very few people note about the Sonicare is that it not only cleans your teeth beautifully, it also keeps your gums in great shape, and that may be even more valuable.</li>
            <li> Pro: These toothbrush heads are a good size and they allow me to easily get to the back molars.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and am glad the heads are still easy to find.</li>
            <li> but even better was the whole process and how easy it was.  </li>
            <li> However, now that I found then at this great price (less than 1/2 of most stores)</li>
            <li> I have had my original handsets for 5 years and continue to replace the brushes here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an identical replacement for my original E5300 head.  </li>
            <li> HAS A UNIQUE &amp;#</li>
            <li> These brush heads are original replacements.</li>
            <li> The brushes in the pack are just like the original brush that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Sonicare brush heads and sent the original UPC symbol to Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a postcard stating that it did not receive the original UPC symbol or proof-of-purchase</li>
            <li> Always get the original manufacturer product for toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> They are just like the ones that came w/ the original set.  </li>
            <li> Always thought I had to buy original heads.    </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Philips toothbrush, and my first one gave many years of service before it had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This replacement head is not the original size.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER DOESN&#x27;T LIST FOR REPLACEMENT.</li>
            <li> and since my first head wore out quickly,Im pleased to have two.</li>
            <li> I changed my mind and thought it was on par with the original.</li>
            <li> We have had our original charger for years and order replacement brushes every three months as recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the original brush.  </li>
            <li> They are what they say they are and come in the original branded packaging.</li>
            <li> the original</li>
            <li> Works as well as the original.  </li>
            <li> We have had our original Philips Sonicare Elite system for over 6 years.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase with Amazon.com and plan to shop more.</li>
            <li> The small head replacements would be great for kids!</li>
            <li> Original equipment quality replacement.</li>
            <li> These are original heads and function as intended.</li>
            <li> Mine was just the original series not the E-series.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stiffer than the original (4-year-old) one), and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Original equipment but cheapest I found.</li>
            <li> The latest version Sonicare fixes all of that and is FIRST CLASS.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I made this change, the amount of tartar build up has been significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> Amazon, usually, has the best prices on products if you have the Prime Membership.</li>
            <li> How excited can you get over toothbrush heads??</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Philips Sonicare HX7002/62 e-Series Standard Replacement Brush Heads!!</li>
            <li> We were so excited to find these, since I don&#x27;t think you can in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> so I ordered them thinking that they would not be like the original Sonicare product that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love Sonicare and have been an avid user for years.  </li>
            <li> Not the original.</li>
            <li> They come in a two pack so if you need to share, it is easy as they each have a different colored plastic insert to be able to tell them apart very easy.  </li>
            <li> right item, quick delivery, and a satisfied wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have new brush heads...</li>
            <li> I had forgotten how nice new brushes are,</li>
            <li> Believe me, within a couple of days, I could tell my mouth did not feel as clean</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel so clean after use.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever tried to clean the sonicare?  </li>
            <li> I have used these brushes for years and find them well suited for clean teeth.  </li>
            <li> and my teeth are brighter and feel clean all the time.</li>
            <li> This also results in a lower quality outcome (teeth aren&#x27;t as clean).  </li>
            <li> Hygenist always raves about how clean my teeth are after I switched to these from Oral B.</li>
            <li> I wind up feeling like the teeth are almost as clean as when I go into the dentist for my six month cleaning.  </li>
            <li> clean and taken care of.</li>
            <li> Keep the heads clean</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s teeth are sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> CLEAN INSIDE OF TOOTHBRUSH WITH CLR</li>
            <li> These clean my teeth so well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy 6 at Costco because that&#x27;s just too many at one time since I&#x27;m the only one that uses this kind of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> they make your teeth and gums feel clean</li>
            <li> MY TEETH FEEL CLEAN AFTER EACH USE.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to rinse and keep clean.</li>
            <li> remember to keep it clean inside.</li>
            <li> As far as the seller is concerned, I have no complaints about the order -- the packaging was adequate for the product to arrive in perfect condition, the duration was within Amazon&#x27;s agreed upon time, and the price is the lowest I&#x27;ve found, both locally in stores and online.</li>
            <li> These are the real Sonicare heads, and they work just as well as the original head, and I love it.    </li>
            <li> Replacements are always needed, nothing special.</li>
            <li> The plastic vent cap is a great idea, it protects the brush heads and allows them to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush, but find cleaning the brushheads a real chore if you remove the head and try to clean everything up once in a while.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and are identical to the original version.  </li>
            <li> The whole thing went very smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> great.. just what i expected</li>
            <li> Great value and these are getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to find a product that really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> To be able to get them at a reduced price, and sign up for automatic delivery was a REAL bonus.  </li>
            <li> The simpler the machine, the easier it is to keep in good condition and this basic brush will take care of anyone.  </li>
            <li> last thing that really good</li>
            <li> I think the last time I changed my SonicCare toothbrush head was over a year ago..not a good replacement cycle.</li>
            <li> That can be good for getting to the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> They are good and last me about 6 - 8 months.  </li>
            <li> Good investment since you only have to replace every six months.  </li>
            <li> Signing up for subscription for this item is a good idea, especially with the discount.</li>
            <li> Nice that replacements still being made for my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you used a regular toothbrush (good quality), you&#x27;d probably pay about $3.50 for one you can use for 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> Used regularly it really helped me getting and mainting healthy gums and prevent tartar build up.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful to be able to obtain the replacement brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Returning to amazon for full refund.</li>
            <li> Use the routine after every meal or snack if possible, of course at work not so good.</li>
            <li> mark works, but sounds like a freight train at full speed.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and being able to order the brush-head replacements</li>
            <li> They are not flimsy and work very well with my toothbrush for a fraction of the price I would find in  most stores.</li>
            <li> and I love it as much now as I did then---</li>
            <li> ...you don&#x27;t really have many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ads are true:</li>
            <li> This brush head is a full size brush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really beleive him plus Sonicare cost so much more than the brand I was using.  </li>
            <li> Nice, unexpected increase in cycle speed.</li>
            <li> It honestly makes me think they might be counterfeit, even though they are marked &amp;#34;sonicare&amp;#34; on the heads and the box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember that happening on the full price heads.</li>
            <li> I hope I get a good report from the dental hygienist at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> Real Sonicare brush heads are better than the non-Sonicare brands.</li>
            <li> Once she started using it, she said it was good enough, she just has to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Also, this price was not bad.</li>
            <li> Even though they may all have the same name brand box, be leary of prices that are too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I gave my old one away after many years of use, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> i liked the fact that had the easy open box</li>
            <li> Also, the price is right and free</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and they came in a very quick time frame.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I know that neither of these are normal, since the original brush heads worked fine, and the replacements I received in the \\&quot;frustration-free packaging\\&quot; version also seemed fine.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it is different but it still fits perfectly and the smaller head seems to be far more effective than the one that came with it.    </li>
            <li> Great quality replacement heads that last a good long time and seem to clean very well.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just like recieving exactly as listed!</li>
            <li> these brushes make my teeth fell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to know that this replacement brush head fit my older style sonicare, It actually works better then</li>
            <li> It does help me keep my smile clean.  </li>
            <li> the sonicare toothbrush is seriously one of thee best toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li> fresh from the dentist clean</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Got it quickly and all in tact.  </li>
            <li> A super product at any cost.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush ever you will not go back to a regular brush again.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the brush actually tell you to go more than two minutes for the top of the mollars.</li>
            <li> Waterpik quit making their 3000 model electric tooth brush three years ago that required $5 to buy 4 brushes and it did a fairly adequate job.</li>
            <li> the heads wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> But shipping was rather quick, since I needed to replace rather quickly.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]], or brush head, are simply the best tooth-care product.</li>
            <li> each 6 months have been a worthy investment for me.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly and so glad to find one since older brush.</li>

            <li> Thank you for your quick service.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The sensitive head is also great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a quick pause that alerts you to change the area you are brushing.  </li>
            <li> My dentist and I are both pleased with how much better my regular checkups are!  </li>
            <li> My dental care has been much easier and more fun since I got a Philips Sonicare Elite about two years ago.</li>
            <li> and my cleanings are a quick fifteen minute in and out.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick response and item as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sent quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered in the time specified and it was very easy to replace my old brush head.  </li>
            <li> so glad to find a good deal on a pair of this hard to find replacement - the first one works as it should and am happy to have a back up.</li>
            <li> The way it operates help to clean up the tooth, but also keeps the right way to brush.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare for several years, and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> There was a funny twang sound as my gums were assaulted by the bristles on this beast of a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare since it first became available</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for more than 5 years and no complaint.</li>
            <li> If you want to have healthier teeth and gums and minimize your dental expenses, you will be very pleased with the SonicCare Elite brush and regular refills!</li>
            <li> have never had a problem with the tooth brush heads before but the first one I used fell apart after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;The metal at the ends that fit in the toothbrush just fell apart.</li>
            <li> This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I had to clean brush head buildups more frequently compare to E-Series.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that the ad on internet was clear and easy to find, then easy to order.</li>
            <li> The vibration on these is much more powerful - get these, they aren&#x27;t that much more than the generic brand, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> We receive a new 2-Pack every 3 months and it is cheaper and more convinient that having to go to the store to buy them.  </li>
            <li> Love the new design and shape.  </li>
            <li> Love my sonic toothbrush and it was time for some new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> but, when it is time for a new one, I will look for a better design.</li>
            <li> When I changed to the new replacement head the power and feel noticeably picked up for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have a new model- love it -but</li>
            <li> Just want to get something new. :)</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush, needed some new brush heads.</li>
            <li> Not bad, the price is right</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; gets less pronounced and almost goes away with time, but the great results continue.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for offering such a quality product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase, as I could not find it ANYWHERE else for less.</li>
            <li> Previously bought these and they were great.</li>
            <li> these units are as expected, they do the job just as the first did I am happy</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> It does most of the action on your teeth and leaves your teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still going strong, and that&#x27;s of course thanks to routine replacement of the heads.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and easy to install.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is longer and really has a strong oscillation.&lt;br /&gt;Feels</li>
            <li> They certainly work fine.  </li>
            <li> They work okay, but are very loud.</li>
            <li> They are exactly like those that came with the original product.</li>
            <li> I was one of the original testers for the first Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> Would not use any other kind of toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> I will be back to buy more when I need them!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Of course, she isnt making as much money off of me any longer!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as the original brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great and they last about three months before you need a new one.</li>
            <li> They clean beneath the gums, in the cracks, the surface, while gently polishing (or sonically vibrate) your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> If you can look past that then these are great, my toothbrush feels like new again and it feels more powerful than that original brush head</li>
            <li> Not only were these brush heads offered at a great price, their ergo design and smaller brush size makes it easy to reach into those hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> the bottom part of these can get pretty grungy and are a bit of a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush &amp; the other head worked fine but couldn&#x27;t get a replacement easily.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I really like the free shipping.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much firmer than the genuine ones (even after a week or two of use).</li>
            <li> The newer brush heads fit the handle but are of much lower quality.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it may be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Reliable and useful, my wife has had her electronic toothbrush for years.</li>
            <li> I owned an old Sonicare for many years.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like)</li>
            <li> I just smile and nod.</li>
            <li> How I look at it is that if they protect my teeth it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Sonicare tooth brushes are worth their weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel dentist fresh every time.  </li>
            <li> It feels so much more natural</li>
            <li> &quot; Amazon offers may make more sense at a minimum rate of 2 brush heads each 6 months than does 3 brush heads</li>
            <li> keeps my mouth feeling fresh, and has helped me with my gums.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny that you may spend on it.  </li>
            <li> Fit my Sonicare perfectly, last and will order again when I need more</li>
            <li> you have a 50 year mouth (like mine) and have taken coffee and tea for many moons, a professional whitening may be in order</li>
            <li> The Sonicare with its ultrasonic cleaning action cleans most fully, with out damage to my gums.</li>
            <li> I only wish that a well known consumer magazine would consider reviewing electric toothbrushs, but they refuse even though they have been available for many years.</li>
            <li> This is an important product for many health reasons to numerous to delve into here.</li>
            <li> The cost vs. results does make the system worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I purchase a replacement, I am reminded that I should be doing so more frequently....</li>
            <li> but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> well worth using.</li>
            <li> When brushing, the brush makes a loud chattering noise, like the foot of the brush head isn&#x27;t quite touching the sonic vibrating part.  </li>
            <li> The research said that the combination of sonic and rotary action over time (within a month or two of use) demonstrated a greater effect on reduction of plaque and gingivitis scores (the plaque and gingivitis levels were lower for the sonic rotary devices (Oral B) compared to the sonic cradle-rock devices (Sonicare)).  </li>
            <li> It is worth making the switch.  </li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I&#x27;ve used the same head for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> Hope Amazon continues to carry them at a reasonable price, as they are a good investment in future dental health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years and every visit to the dentist supports  that this products is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I like these heads for the Sonicare toothbrush better than the old style.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $17 every six months to maintain quality dental care.</li>
            <li> These are cheap enough I can replace them more often.</li>
            <li> They work so much better than the old ones.  </li>
            <li> and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> back to enjoying the teeth brushing and glad i could get a double pack!!:-)</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Philips engineered this product to allow for the replacement of the brush itself rather than the entire mechanical component.  </li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, and these are definitely worth the time and money.</li>
            <li> Forces you to buy replacements more frequently I guess.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to replace the heads from time to time, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort and money, considering what you get in return.</li>
            <li> my old sonicare brushes had a lot of torque were able to continually run while I was brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE WELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> durable  and powerful  </li>
            <li> Far better deal to buy them there.</li>
            <li> The Product (Sonicare Elite) replacement Brush heads, I found to be of good quality and it performs as well as I expected and will repeat the process when the time comes around again fro replacement.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost of OEM parts that eliminate the vibration and noise of the off brands.</li>
            <li> Third and most important</li>
            <li> Well worth the price they ask.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush will leave your teeth with the same feeling you get after seeing your dentist - very smooth and clean.   </li>
            <li> It works much better than the original larger brushhead.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and received quickly.</li>
            <li> Either way, the mold just accumulates again pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These brushes appear to be the real deal and work just like the original brushes.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are long lasting and the whole brushing system is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The firmness is just right, as advised by the dentist.</li>
            <li> was not the right toothbrush head-  returned and have not received confirmation of return or a credit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten off brands before and they don&#x27;t work right.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the price is just right.</li>
            <li> &quot; You are doing it right.)</li>
            <li> However, it did end up being the right replacement part.</li>
            <li> My annual checkups confirm I&#x27;ve been making the right</li>
            <li> Right now I am using Elite (E-series) brush head</li>
            <li> It took a while to find, but this company had &amp;#34;the right stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The order was processed in a timely way, the price was &#x27;right&#x27;, and I will undoubtedly order these again.</li>
            <li> Brush just right size.</li>
            <li> But both my partner and I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> It takes fiddling with the head to get the thing to work right.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, and I like it, the price was right, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> refills on time and right to my door..  </li>
            <li> Just the right replacement for my Sonicare e-Series toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It really gets your teeth clean and your gums get a workout too.  </li>
            <li> The E series brush heads fit the older style Sonicare</li>
            <li> I have been ordering same from Amazon based on reviews from other users, who can vouch for the quality because of their own purchase,  The replacement heads are all they have been claimed to be and I am very pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really high pitched metallic sound.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads clean great but do not last as long as stated 6 months.</li>
            <li> And it performs much better and leaves less plaque which results to many dental issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In just 2 months I was able to improve the health of my gum tissue and teeth in general.</li>
            <li> As usual, Sonicare is always a great purchage.  </li>
            <li> I actually like them better as they are more contoured than the old ones.</li>
            <li> The power of the system is better than the generic heads and the bristles are far better.</li>
            <li> On the upside, it works great when it works, and the battery lasts 2 weeks using it twice a day, so no need to pack the relatively small recharger on vacation.</li>
            <li> This is great for people who don&#x27;t have normal strength in their hands due to arthritis or a disability.</li>
            <li> I would have loved a better price, but at least knowing that I got the real thing for my money helps.</li>
            <li> My first order arrived quickly, with no problem whatsoever, and as far as I can tell, this plan is going to work out fine.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed, priced right, described correctly so that I could make the right purchase for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a dental cleaning since using these replacements and they seem to be working just as fine, just very loud...</li>
            <li> First time in my life my teeth really felt clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> A decent replacement for the original brushes</li>
            <li> Easy to use and Better than any other elec tootbrush</li>
            <li> These arrived in a user friendly package, making it easy to open and get out.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brushes are far more effective than other brands of electric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, lo and behold, these actually fit quite well and saved me from buying a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I need and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It performs well and clean the teeth quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> Just a quick twist on and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> I was happy with Sonicare standard brush heads except for occasional gum irritation.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and were very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> They quit making that great product in order to make more expensive models and charge over $10 for each brush to go on them.</li>
            <li> It does wear out rather quickly and gets much softer in about a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the best testimonial to the Sonicare: I recently had braces for a few years.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are good and cost less than the drugstore, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> The head is easy to replace and it cleans thoroughly and completely.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t seem like it pulses as strongly every 30 seconds like the old series.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for heads not available at local stores.</li>
            <li> This one makes a very loud buzzing sound when attached.</li>
            <li> After brushing, it really leaves you with a very clean feeling, much better than the other electric toothbrush i had before.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I have had the Sonicare Elite for about 2 months now and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I doubt very much that these came from Philips.</li>
            <li> I am not one to floss very much, so I can have quite a bit of build up on my teeth when it comes to my 6-month check-up.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare is much more effective with a new brush head every few months.</li>
            <li> They are really, really loud which is fine</li>
            <li> I have been using soncicare for a little over a year now and have seen good results.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the heads on the original unit makes it run like new again.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price for these especially if you still own one of the older model sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> Usually hard to find because of the age and great price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great product and increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> they worked, but these replacement heads are VERY LOUD compared to the original heads.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after a new head.</li>
            <li> So much better than the generic!!!</li>
            <li> My mouth is much happier now.&lt;br /&gt;Good value!</li>
            <li> I at first hesitated looking at the cost of just 2 replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly what I needed for my e-series sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> tab.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Sonicare brush is okay, I definitely would not buy another Sonicare product again based on the company&#x27;s incorrect handling of its promotion offer!</li>
            <li> &quot; I got the first time using it</li>
            <li> She said my teeth and gums were much improved!  </li>
            <li> You update me when you ship and the  product usually gets here fast and the auto ship feature is great.  </li>
            <li> always exactly what I want, when I need it.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush heads, but I wish a two pack wouldn&#x27;t come the same color!</li>
            <li> About that price:  Now that you can subscribe to delivery on Subscribe and Save, you can save 15% more off of Amazon&#x27;s already low price.  </li>
            <li> At first they changed the recommendation to replace it from every six month to every 3 month</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth pretty thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is a must have for getting your teeth ultra cleen and being able to have the replacement brush heads sent automaticaly every three months is a big plus.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes fit my old model Sonicare (fat handle)</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> One package lasts you a whole year!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased replacement heads for my sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It does the job better than any regular toothbrush.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always ready to go!</li>
            <li> The product was received in a timely manner, and was exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> The first set I had never tore like this one.</li>
            <li> They worked just as well as my first ones</li>
            <li> I looked around in stores for them and found them at much higher prices.</li>
            <li> I still have an old model sonicare, and these fit it.  </li>
            <li> The first time using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that the Amazon price on these replacement heads varies a lot, I paid $21 a month ago, and now they are up to almost $30.</li>
            <li> I finally was able to get to the brushes, although they were knicked by by blade on the box cutter, it does not seem to effect their service.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I already own a Sonicare, the replacement brushes were exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare, it actually improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> In fact when I first got it I kept brushing my teeth over and over all day.    </li>
            <li> My dental appointments for the last 3 years have been outstanding and I owe it all to my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this toothbrush and so far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> pack is exactly what it should be.</li>
            <li> Love the product compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads I purchased were exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Since purchasing the Sonicare electric toothbrush he now only needs to go in twice a year as recommended by most dentists.  </li>
            <li> My grandson who recently got braces was told by his orthodontist that there is nothing better out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay the slightly higher price and have exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> It does the job better than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It tickles at first</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My most recent visit to the dentist office</li>
            <li> I love sonicare and have my 2nd one in 4 years.</li>
            <li> They have longer bristles on the front and back edges, which reach around teeth more efficiently.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have bought replacement heads that would bog-down when putting pressure on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> But what really made me smile was the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> this is not the first time that I have had a defective Sonic Care replacement head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> need to have better Q.C. especially at the price they charge for these .</li>
            <li> Dental exams are much better than when using a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> noticed how much cleaner his teeth were at his 6 month check up!</li>
            <li> My husband was reluctant to try it because it tickles at first, but now he loves it too.</li>
            <li> My first one did not have replaceable brushes.</li>
            <li> I only wish they lasted 6 months instead of 4, but I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I recommend Philips Sonicare to anyone who is interested in maintaining and keeping their teeth.  </li>
            <li> The younger you start, the better.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite versus the smaller brush head.  </li>
            <li> When I first got my Sonicare</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrush heads for years and this is my first time ordering them online, and I won&#x27;t be doing that again -</li>
            <li> Threw it away thinking it was the first defect I have had with a Sonicare head in five years.</li>
            <li> I was even happier when I realized I could save even more by setting up a regular subscription.  </li>
            <li> Be aware when purchasing these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The magnets seem to be made of iron and within the first month of use</li>
            <li> I definitely would not buy more of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> Worked perfectly - so much better than generic replacements!</li>
            <li> These work great and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product fit old style sonicare battery.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the brush the rubber grommet ripped.  </li>
            <li> Better price than at local retailers.</li>
            <li> Love my sonic tooth brush and these are necessary.</li>
            <li> Just enough to get the job done, and not what most companies use to survive the zombi apoplectic ending..</li>
            <li> The first head broke within a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and brush-heads for a dozen years now and this is the first time (2014)</li>
            <li> These are exact brush head replacements for the Philips unit.</li>
            <li> These are better than the originals as the slim angled neck reaches hard-to-clean areas and the come in standard and compact brush sizes.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I&#x27;ve had problems buying Sonicare products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li> I like it better than a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> First of all these brushes arrived in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;Second, they are both defective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought refills before, this was the first time I had defective one.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t upgrade to a higher quality brush unless the price difference is not an issue.</li>
            <li> Some were saying the magnets were cheap or the bristle heads were soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Since that time my cleanings have been much quicker and easier, and my teeth feel sparkling, fresh, and have that \\&quot;just cleaned feeling\\&quot; all the time.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as you would expect for replacement toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m about to order some more, actually!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased these tooth brush heads via internet.</li>
            <li> This most likely is just a defective fluke.</li>
            <li> Yes it might cost more than the regular toothbrush but your teeth and gum will thank you for making the investment on the sonicare brush!</li>
            <li> But health are first</li>
            <li> The product is just exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> All I know is that my teeth are better off with the total product.</li>
            <li> generic brands are even better than these.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to a different model and it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are a unit in themselves...and cost almost as much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare since they first came out.  </li>
            <li> This happened to both brushes after the first usage.</li>
            <li> Two sound like weed wackers (excessively loud).</li>
            <li> Next time I will examine the brush heads more closely.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than the generic brand, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Junk, they seem to be offbrand fits for these, about halfway through the first one, the magnet at the bottom came off.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> At 6 months on the first year, no problems.  </li>
            <li> The brush physically still works except the bristles are softer and at 1 year, more spread out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush won&#x27;t do as a good a job if you don&#x27;t replace the head every few months.  </li>
            <li> Each of the two heads in the package (one I was using, the other - my son, in his identical E-series) experienced the same problem: only a couple of months into using it, the brush started making a strong noise and the vibration weakened significantly, to the point where it wasn&#x27;t cleaning at all.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at how much better the new head works -</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads were not only cheap, but came quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I have had several other styles of electric toothbrushes and this is by far the best of them all.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time and they work very well as stated</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase more later</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads were to replace the original ones from the old style Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes (Oral B) and tried every kind of tooth cleaning brush, powder, and gimmick you can imagine.</li>
            <li> I would Highly recommended to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected which was a great surprise.</li>
            <li> These heads do a good job of cleaning, but they wear out much faster than the previous straight head design.  </li>
            <li> been using Phillips Sonicare for a number of years and so far have had no problems except you must remove heads periodically and clean the mold that form inside.</li>
            <li> Besides,it&#x27;s very frugal to purchase only these replaceable top parts.</li>
            <li> I had problem finding replacement brushes for my old model sonicare and this model did make a difference, it will replace most of sonicare old model handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, my teeth have been so much healthier over the last 10 years</li>
            <li> work very well, much better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Two brush heads in simple cardboard packaging, couldn&#x27;t really ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li> I love these brushes and the price is reasonable enough.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and worked better than generic brand</li>
            <li> They do a good job, but they are expensive, even though they are cheaper than in most stores.</li>
            <li> Price is high, but it is definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> HX5310.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s brand new and loud and strong at first.</li>
            <li> The brushes last a long time and are effective in cleaning and getting in between the teeth to thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> not only were the bristles themselves better, but the whole unit performed as if brand new!!</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I wish the packaging were a little more earth friendly and easy to open.</li>
            <li> They came quickly, brand new and really needed the replacement.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you clean the metal insides every few days</li>
            <li> The first one worked fine but the second one is defective, won&#x27;t work correctly.  </li>
            <li> The new Flexcare handle incorporates a new switch design and the who brush head is smaller, attaches more easily to the handle, is less to throw away when used up, and does a better job.</li>
            <li> This ia a major improvement from the original replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These heads fit my old Sonicare handle even though they look different from the heads it originally came with.</li>
            <li> first one out of the package made a real loud noise but the brush didn&#x27;t move!  </li>
            <li> with Sonicare replacement brushes: instead of paying a couple bucks for just a new brush head with bristles (costing about the same as a new manual toothbrush), you have to pay $10 for a toothbrush head that comes in its own cartridge.</li>
            <li> with my new Sonicare brush heads my breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li> The heads get &#x27;old&#x27; too quickly though.  </li>
            <li> Easy to open and all paper, no plastic!!!</li>
            <li> Very low price and came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My shipments always arrive well packaged in easy to open packaging.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the first couple of days using the Sonicare delivers an overwhelming experience (not really)</li>
            <li> sonicare company does not make the package easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Came in easy to open packaging (plastic bag)</li>
            <li> We tried some clones from Walgreen and they are pure junk, all they do is make</li>
            <li> Finally ordered some new brush heads, wasn&#x27;t sure if these were the correct ones, but they were.  </li>
            <li> This is my third one and each gets better with new brushes.</li>
            <li> One of these has a loose fitting and buzzes like a ....</li>
            <li> These work great, but wear out fairly quickly and are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, easy to open, quality product.</li>
            <li> The Elite are thinner, smaller; but work fine with my Advance Sonicare.</li>
            <li> and she could not compete with the low price on Amazon for this fine product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The second one has been fine....</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, and so reasonably priced, MUCH less than one would pay at the various dept stores where I use to purchased my replacements brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some replacement heads at the store shortly after and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> After removing it and regluing it in the proper position, it worked fine.</li>
            <li> And we often give this or another Philips Sonicare model as Christmas presents to our children and grandchildren, who also think very highly of them.</li>
            <li> They work very well, certainly as advertised</li>
            <li> i like the performance, although the original heads seem to be a little strong.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, came highly recommended by friends.</li>
            <li> It is very loud and feel like isnt correctly connecting!!</li>
            <li> The other one worked great and was as quiet as a new one.</li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that any toothbrush is better than the Sonicare Advanced, but this one truly is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare E Series for over a year now and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, long lasting electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You would think Philips could come up with packaging that&#x27;s just as secure, but is much easier to open.</li>
            <li> I do not work for Amazon, but I am just one happy customer, who found the way to save a few extra $$$.</li>
            <li> I have used generic and some cheap defective, and these are the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they did fit our toothbrush and worked better for us than some of the negative reviewers reported, BUT.....  </li>
            <li> This price beat all the local stores and the service was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> After using the Sonicare units, you place them in their chargers where they stay until you&#x27;re ready to use them again.  </li>
            <li> These were the real replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I would have bought them earlier if I had known that they would fit my sonicare.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care, though</li>
            <li> : Very exspensive the brushes are like $30.00 and you have to replace them every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Longer use the bristles are too worn &amp; it exhibits too much bacteria.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> All the crevices and places for water and germs to seep is too much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> enjoy the freshness feeling following a brushing with this system.</li>
            <li> I am going with the real thing from now on.</li>
            <li> Once this product was no longer available through my business, I had to search for the proper replacements.</li>
            <li> I am on the automatic replacement ordering system for the refills and it really helps me to remember to change them.  </li>
            <li> I add enough to my order to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I give my thanks to this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> with \\&quot;normal pressure\\&quot; and on the higher setting).</li>
            <li> they are straight.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have really improved since using it.</li>
            <li> It has a timer on it, so you know how much time you are spending brushing.  </li>
            <li> Makes me want to just throw the whole thing in the trash.</li>
            <li> The real deal.  </li>
            <li> So much for my venting, Amazon is the cheapest place I can find Soniccare brushes.  </li>
            <li> absolutely no problem fitting my sonic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into the hygeine aspect of sonic care, and sonic care really does take care of teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> As described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> But you can get refills much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I tried a box opener again with out much luck.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these to anyone with teeth!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure these would fit my 4 year old handle because when I zoomed in on the product picture, it looked fairly different than the one that I currently have.</li>
            <li> Its dependable and works very well.  </li>
            <li> So much for trusting Philips products.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both see a real difference in the way our teeth look and feel.  </li>
            <li> $25 a year for brushes isn&#x27;t that much when you consider how much you&#x27;ll save on a periodontist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and really didn&#x27;t need to..</li>
            <li> My Teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> but I will use them very soon.</li>
            <li> my teeth are much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> These are not knock off, which I have tried and returned, but the real deal.</li>
            <li> From now on, I buy the real Sonicare e-Series heads.</li>
            <li> It comes out cheaper to replace the heads than the whole toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The difference is really noticeable..</li>
            <li> We compared with ones we bought onsite at a local retailer, and these were clearly cheap imitations when you looked at the printing on the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates so much that it sounds like a lawn mower in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My advice, spend a few dollars more and get the authentic product at your local store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed the replacements until I changed them.</li>
            <li> Get the real thing, don&#x27;t skimp on those off brands,</li>
            <li> thank you so much I will order again</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and they work very well.</li>
            <li> And much cheaper than the store I was going to buy them in</li>
            <li> the sonic care brush removes so much food particles, flossing is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Has really helped with gingivitis too.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sonicare and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> so I am stuck with this unless I replace the whole model.</li>
            <li> I really like subscribe and save through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> But it was very obvious after receiving these, that they are not the genuine heads designed for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These couldn&#x27;t be real Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> cause you won&#x27;t have much plague build-up.</li>
            <li> Further, rather than operate with the low volume hum of an authentic Sonicare product, those I received produced a loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> my my whole head is vibrating.</li>
            <li> After much inspection I found that the magnets which makes it operate move around.</li>
            <li> this is very usefull product to fight cavities</li>
            <li> and keeps me out of the Dentist chair a lot they work very well</li>
            <li> It really made a difference.</li>
            <li> FAST EFFICIENT DELIVERY -- HAVE USED SONICARE FOR 15 YEARS -- MY DENTIST LOVES ME</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> My dentist commented that there is much improvement once I started using the product.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like paying so much for these brushes, but looks like it pays off.</li>
            <li> Tried replacing etc but still is very noisy.</li>
            <li> as excepted thank you for the fast delivery too</li>
            <li> They were reasonably priced and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads worked well with my Philips Sonicare, and they arrive quite fast.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Pair it with some mouthwash and you have a much healthier</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe depends on what company you buy them from and how much you pay for them.</li>
            <li> did not want to throw out something that still worked really well</li>
            <li> neither the head&#x27;s softness nor smallness is much of a drawback.  </li>
            <li> Only the compact brushes are available in my area.  </li>
            <li> For years my uncle told me this would really make a difference in my dental health.  </li>
            <li> I am a Sonicare user now and can really tell a difference in the way my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sticking to the Real Deal.</li>
            <li> in fact, they appeared to be knock-offs of the real deal.</li>
            <li> So, I was very dissatisfied with the product and had to return it.</li>
            <li> We were very displeased with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the refund.</li>
            <li> And your prompt attention on my order got them to me really fast</li>
            <li> Thanks again for</li>
            <li> the fast and prompt delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips needs to lower their prices on these refills as the cost too much</li>
            <li> I am really dissapointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> These brushes are much easier to buy online than trying to find them in a store.</li>
            <li> It seems they are not actually made by sonicare or some really cheap version.  </li>
            <li> Nothing much to write home about.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Well, except that they almost cost as much.</li>
            <li> maybe I don&#x27;t eat really plaque building foods, but for my use, changing brushes annually works.  </li>
            <li> Because this is my elderly mom&#x27;s toothbrush, she was very reluctant to use it, claiming it wont work.</li>
            <li> the magnet rusted, not something that happens to the real sonicare heads, and the brush didn&#x27;t move much.  </li>
            <li> and I thought that I would need to replace the whole unit.  </li>
            <li> I tried both of them and they were noisy and rattled no matter how carefully and how many times I tried re-screwing them in.  </li>
            <li> Phillips is very reliable</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I keep a different brand (Philip&#x27;s biggest competitor), in the RV, and while it has more vigorous action, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Whenever I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days, if I use a regular toothbrush for a trip or something, it always feels nice to come back to these.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have the option of buying two different size head brush in the same pack.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various third party replacement heads over the years, and none of them work as effectively.</li>
            <li> The name brand Sonicare replacement brush heads work far better than the generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It fit my base and works perfectly</li>
            <li> The item was new in the box and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying them very much, had been putting off buying them for a long time and finally broke down and got them because you had them at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> This has been my first trial of this new style for my Elite Toothbrush</li>
            <li> Brand new exact model.</li>
            <li> These are the right head for the old type sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristle heads were not too soft, they were just right.</li>
            <li> I love the fact Philips uses real tooth brush heads vs. the rotary things that other brands use.</li>
            <li> Normally would have paid the cost for just ONE!  </li>
            <li> I became concerned when I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes that looked like my original and prior replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> Combining these with a couple other needed items and the shipping was free too!</li>
            <li> but mine was burst a couple of months ago and the findings were significant enough to spread the news.</li>
            <li> It is very different from the original head that came with my Sonicare brush handle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe anyone brushes their teeth with a normal toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this happen with a generic replacement head, but I&#x27;ve noticed the issue with these original Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Works just like original and had no luck with the generic version.</li>
            <li> This replacement is way different from the original.</li>
            <li> Since the original has become obsolete, I changed to the e-series and the smaller heads, but the recommend change time is 3 months versus 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to fork out a fortune to buy a whole new Sonic Care toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It beeps every thirty seconds to prompt you to clean a different area, and shuts off automatically after two minutes.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare does require some extra effort to keep clean.</li>
            <li> We have purchased these heads for the past few years and always are impressed with the quality and convenience of havig them on hand.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to brushing because my teeth feel so clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Now I have clean, white teeth again!</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is the only way to clean up my teeth.  </li>
            <li> These bristles are pretty soft, softer than the originals that came with the whole unit, but they still work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> these brush heads are workhorses.they are small enough to fit comfortably in your mouth and have a built in timer to guide the length of brushing needed to produce a sparklingly clean feeling for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Thus I clean it daily.       </li>
            <li> but they dont clean the same.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like it is going to break apart while you are brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head with the green band also works, with the normal brushing sound of my original brush head.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare uses gentle bristles but has a high speed movement that removes all plaque from your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Could not believe what a difference these new brush heads made.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth getting to replace old ones.</li>
            <li> Magnet came out first time I tried to wash it, had to use second one right away.  </li>
            <li> I finally found exactly the right brush replacemnts for my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and I think it cleans better than conventional manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the name brand and spent a little more for the quality.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers stated, the brush is good when new but Philips makes a special effort to make this product as short lived as possible.  </li>
            <li> They just do not screw all the way down so it makes a loud buzzing sound and doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li> This results in a very loud vibration / sound, not the standard buzz or hum.</li>
            <li> One unexpected benefit is that the green light on the handle glows sufficiently bright enough at night that it actually acts as a night light providing me with enough light that I can see where I&#x27;m going and not miss the toilet at night.</li>
            <li> If we were smart we&#x27;d remember as the wear marks in the bristles showed we needed new ones...</li>
            <li> On the first brush, it was clear that something was off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have this on auto-ship for as long as they&#x27;re available.  </li>
            <li> However, I purchased the regular full head</li>
            <li> Sonicare Elites are better than average electronic toothbrushes, but you should know what you&#x27;re getting into before you buy a kit.</li>
            <li> There is really no good reason why the manufacturer didn&#x27;t integrate the brush cartridge and neck into the handle itself so that you&#x27;d just have to replace the tip, but there is a good reason why they chose not to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fit my old sonicare base perfectly</li>
            <li> Cleans like the first time you used it, the old ones don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> b/c one of the magnets on one of the heads didn&#x27;t work probably and it was only a mild vibrate, not enough to actually clean your teeth</li>
            <li> The brush heads are exactly what i was looking for to replace the old ones I had.</li>
            <li> Directly out of the package the first issue was that I couldn&#x27;t get the toothbrush head cover off.</li>
            <li> I believe it also features a more efficient up and down brushing motion.  </li>
            <li> Used daily, it helps keep you gums in good shape and little or no cavities.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s like having a completely new Sonicare system!</li>
            <li> Well, you learn something new every day!  </li>
            <li> What a difference a new toothbrush makes!</li>
            <li> After using the new Elite Sonicare for about a month now, I can tell you this thing works!</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly, and it feels like I have a brand new toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without one!</li>
            <li> The fit on the base is perfect and easy to manipulate - the brushes themselves are soft enough to be comfortable, but solid enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> And they are cheaper than a whole new setup.</li>
            <li> I may have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush system</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to get a whole new one all together.</li>
            <li> Reminded me how important it is to replace the brush heads on the electric toothbrush at least once every 6 months, makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I know my brushing is longer and more thorough and with less effort.     </li>
            <li> NOT the older ones.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for years, and with my older model toothbrush (pre E-Series)</li>
            <li> For older folks are those with arthritis, this must be a nightmare.</li>
            <li> The bristles last longer, and the heads seem to brush a lot more aggressively than the generic ones I tried.</li>
            <li> They work well with my older e series tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Worked for Philips Sonicare Essence Classic Edition</li>
            <li> (The brush is designed to fit your hand only when it faces directly forward.)  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the older models anywhere</li>
            <li> I have an older e-series, and the product number on it is HX5300.  </li>
            <li> I do brush 2 times or more a day if possible, floss occasionally</li>
            <li> Classic &amp;#34; get what you pay for&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> you have an older model Sonicare like me look at the bottom of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was relieved to discover that I could order replacement toothbrush heads from Amazon at a decent price and with speedy delivery.  </li>
            <li> Second, they are loud, they sound like a jet engine going off in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> the second one in the pack malfunctioned quickly.  </li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads are a good value and slip onto the base quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> The only solution for this problem is to screw the whole replacement head unit on until it&#x27;s almost but not entirely tight, then move the smaller part at the top of the cup until it aligns with the front, then tighten the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchase the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and am so very pleased I did.</li>
            <li> Ordering refills on line is much easier than going into a busy store!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I had not changed my brushes in a long time, and had forgotten how a new brush feels.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them to anyone using these brushes.</li>
            <li> I also use BRUSHPICKS, I highly endorse this product too.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product has a high ROI ( return on investment)  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended by my dentist too.</li>
            <li> They hook you on the product and then make high profits on the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I mentioned to my orthodontist that I&#x27;d graduated from high school in 1983, and she said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist highly recommend Sonicare, and I have not had any teeth problems since purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended by my dental hygeinist.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I find that I don&#x27;t replace the brushes as often as I should because of their high cost.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly if you like your Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li> They are of high quality &amp; very&lt;</li>
            <li> This new style is smaller and much better for me in my entire mouth.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty good, only one thing that I am not very satisfied is:  the rubber rings and covers on the heads are not as tight as the original ones came with the toothbrush I bought before.</li>
            <li> Even with all of this, I still can&#x27;t clean every part, so the mold is never completely gone.</li>
            <li> I tried some other products but I discovered that those products were inferior and costly since I needed to replace them more frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have no reason to use any other kind of tooth brush.</li>
            <li> But I feel better for nuking that little farm of god-knows-what every season...</li>
            <li> They are LOUD!!</li>
            <li> We rinse them, and dry in the rack provided with the original toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The initial cost of the unit is high, but over the life of the product the benefits are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Although a little pricey when compared to a regular tooth brush or many of the electric brushes, it is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> Both new heads were so loud, much more than any other heads used before.  </li>
            <li> They fit better and produce less noise than other types.</li>
            <li> I have an older model Sonicare toothbrush and can&#x27;t be bothered to upgrade to the new, fancy kinds.</li>
            <li> This replacement brush heads work well, and I can certainly tell the difference in the cleaning ability from these new brush heads to the old brush heads that they replaced.</li>
            <li> fit as expected, and do their job</li>
            <li> I find this much faster than regular brushing and does a nice job on the gumbs, not too harsh and keeps them tone to help fight tooth decay.</li>
            <li> I would have expected this from cheap aftermarket heads, but not from ones made by Philips.</li>
            <li> They are loud and very abrasive.</li>
            <li> Clean the brush handle under the cap and towel dry after each use.  </li>
            <li> It is no where near the real Philips Sonicare quality.</li>
            <li> The unit is about 20 years old and works very well yet.</li>
            <li> I really meant to get one for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> (I feel that twice a day might be too intense for my 50+ year old teeth.)  </li>
            <li> These are cheap and came crushed.</li>
            <li> After one more round, I think i&#x27;m going to switch to manual brushes.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I bought the normal brush heads (not compact) and boy</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, but these heads just don&#x27;t last nearly as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived defective, most of the brush part was missing.  </li>
            <li> These particular brush heads look exactly like the previous hundreds of brush heads we&#x27;ve used over the course of many years, but something isn&#x27;t quite the same.  </li>
            <li> It would be a better product if the white rubbery boot did not split open near where the brush head passes through.</li>
            <li> Could come in a few more colors.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two packages of these and so far none of the brushes have lasted more than a few weeks before vibrating at a much lower rate and even stopping at times.</li>
            <li> Plus, the sonicare works better than others with the round oscillating heads</li>
            <li> I am a traditional kind of guy and resisted for a while but finally relented and came into the 21st Century of dental care!</li>
            <li> Now a few more words needed for the minimum.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it vibrates roughly with my older model sonicare as the original brush heads are no longer sold.</li>
            <li> I wish they cost less, but they do get your teeth clean!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money buying generic replacement heads, they do fit, but don&#x27;t clean as well and don&#x27;t last as long as these genuine sonicare replacements!</li>
            <li> It is amazing that Sonicare has a brush head that last six months and not three or less.</li>
            <li> When I changed my old brush head for a new one, it was like getting a whole new toothbrush...</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be much difference between the old and new, but after a couple of years, what a difference the new ones made.  </li>
            <li> The description had enough detail for me to pick to right head type for the Sonicare unit I have.  </li>
            <li> I was verrrry dissapointed and shipped them right back.</li>
            <li> ; product my choice; price was right; representative helped with the technical stuff and did it well</li>
            <li> It is right next to an unopened package of heads from Costco.</li>
            <li> However, this replacement is like a normal cheap brush, large and harsh on your gum.</li>
            <li> Although I was doubtful they would fit my old, standard Sonicare, they were perfect.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this particular set (still using first one), does not appear to be of the same quality as others that I have on auto-delivery.  </li>
            <li> But I really like the bigger heads, so I ended up ordering the large heads too.  </li>
            <li> After five years, I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li> One time when my brush head had worn out, I threw it away but didn&#x27;t immediately buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to get the new heads ever.  </li>
            <li> Makes my Sonicare feel brand new.</li>
            <li> But, prefer it over oral B, which manufactures new toothbrushes every year/</li>
            <li> it was time to try something new.     </li>
            <li> These are brand new brushheads</li>
            <li> Shipment came in time as well given we live overseas.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were brand new.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a new brush until I found these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I was selected to test the prototype for this new Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> I bought new power brushes and that&#x27;s what the manufacturer aimed at?</li>
            <li> It works just as new, just buy new replacement</li>
            <li> I imagine the newer model with the new heads cures this problem.  </li>
            <li> A refill makes the toothbrush run like new.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;like new level.</li>
            <li> We like the idea of being notified every six months of needing to replace the heads and if we do not cancel our subscription, Amazon automatically sends us new heads.  </li>
            <li> Fits my toothbrush just like the new one&#x27;s do</li>
            <li> I got a new Sonicare toothbrush [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C</li>
            <li> The product needs a new design as the gunk gets into the grooves of the screw of the thread of the brush handle and inside.</li>
            <li> I like using the Sonicare products so when it was time for new brush heads, I ordered online, rather then having to drive all over Tucson to try to find a set for the unit I have.</li>
            <li> I immediately order a new set.</li>
            <li> I recommend this seller to anyone who needs new toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> They shop Amazon all the time and live in Alaska.</li>
            <li> Oh what a difference a new one makes.  </li>
            <li> I bought new brushes for the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I like my sonicare and just needed some new replacement brush heads for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this new toothbrush and the dentist</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like our brushes are brand new.</li>
            <li> Extend the life of your Sonicare by getting these replacement heads to make the brush like new again.  </li>
            <li> It works with my toothbrush power head like new.</li>
            <li> I have an e-series toothbrush and needed new replacement brush heads and purchased these through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to purchase a new Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like the planned-obsolescence factor.</li>
            <li> neither are useable and both are like new.........</li>
            <li> After replacing , I felt as though I were using a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After 4 years, it&#x27;s time for a new handle.</li>
            <li> We passed on our toothbrush to the kids, so we needed new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Basically, I noticed they just were not vibrating like when they were new.  </li>
            <li> I use the subscription service to purchase new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I get two new brush heads per month to re-supply 4 toothbrushes - one at home, one at work, one for my husband, and one for my mother</li>
            <li> New replacements.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should I have issues with these new Brush Heads, I will revisit this review.</li>
            <li> I want a new fancy Sonicare</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li> I was excited to save at least $10 on the 2-brush head set, but unfortunately, I&#x27;ve experienced two serious problems with these non-name brand heads.  </li>
            <li> one of those things where OEM works best,  tried the Target brand, they vibrated awful and made huge amounts of noise,these were like silk after I wore out the target ones.  </li>
            <li> told me something was different, and when I visited the hygenist for the regular cleaning my thoughts were confirmed.  </li>
            <li> Since childhood,I tend to brush my teeth relatively strongly,so this item is quite useful for me to do natural and tender care for my teeth.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize the old one had steadily grown weaker...</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are more expensive but compared to paying your dentist for cleaning and cavities, they are way cheap.</li>
            <li> The action of the brush totally cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money on these.</li>
            <li> They are perfect, just wish they were a little harder and lasted a little longer....</li>
            <li> Just buying new heads for my old Sonicares...love it!</li>
            <li> They are very soft on the gums.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it, I was shocked at the powerful motor and rpms, and LOVED the professionally cleaned feeling my teeth had.  </li>
            <li> They are very loud when the tooth brush is turned on.</li>
            <li> I have a very old model and could not find any replacement heads ,called the manufacture</li>
            <li> I usually buy household products off Amazon since I live in NYC and it is just so much more convenient and cost-effective this way.</li>
            <li> They usually retail for a lot more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a small part at all.</li>
            <li> But the economics of size don&#x27;t apply: the standard 3-pack is a bout $12/brush at present whereas the standard 2-pack is more like $10 each.    </li>
            <li> When attached to the handle these brush heads made a loud noise not like the normal sonicare vibration.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I am aware that I selected a different line but had I known about the cheaper version, you know I would have chosen the cheaper one.  </li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re charged completely they&#x27;re even stronger!</li>
            <li> My first brush had a different design and did not have this problem.</li>
            <li> They look slightly different and the &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; model name printed on the brush head has a different font than the original.</li>
            <li> The first brush head only lasted a month.</li>
            <li> So loud that my while I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom, I couldn&#x27;t hear the door bell ringing!</li>
            <li> the first one already broke on the second brushing.</li>
            <li> The first time, the magnet fell off one of the toothbrushes within 3 days of usage, so I sent the item back as defective.  </li>
            <li> but in the long run, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The first one that I used did not vibrate properly and then broke -- the magnet on the bottom fell off after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier model which used much larger brushes in the present brushes are much more convenient to use because of their size.</li>
            <li> And in general has really improved my oral care.</li>
            <li> Well, you do pay quite a bit for this advantage - the heads cost much more than the usual</li>
            <li> Initial cost is of course higher</li>
            <li> Thus far, only genuine replacements have worked 100% properly in our toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These ones felt cheap and make a loud noise, when pressing on my teeth the movement becomes weak and don&#x27;t clean well.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as promised;  however, my only comment would be that I wish the brush heads would last a little longer, they seem to wear pretty quickly.      </li>
            <li> The first brush head lasted a few weeks and then started vibrating super loudly.</li>
            <li> Nothing else gets my teeth as clean and reaches into tight spaces as well as this particular product.</li>
            <li> I have had this tooth brush for years and these replacement heads make the old brush like new.</li>
            <li> Not a all like the old, better quality in the past.</li>
            <li> It was quickly delivered and exactly as expected</li>
            <li> It was done over a long period of time (over years, not weeks) and on very large groups of people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands brushes instead of the original and have found them to be very sub standard.</li>
            <li> I usually use many generic products, but you really can&#x27;t skimp with sonicare, the generics don&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble removing the old toothbrush and putting in the new one.  </li>
            <li> This newer model is lighter, smaller, fits in the mouth better, and uses less toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I expect this one to last as long, which makes it a great bargain over the years, since regular use will cut down on my dental bills!</li>
            <li> Reason is, it cleans much better than just a regular toothbrush, and in less time.  </li>
            <li> They look exactly like the original Philips product, but the magnets on the bottom of these brushes actually rust and come a little loose.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s absolutely right: mine is long gone, and I have to clean black crud out of the handle well with each replacement.</li>
            <li> I am already on the second one and it seems to be working ok, but I am assuming that one will not last very long either.</li>
            <li> The brush that came with the original was soft and small, very comfirtable to use.</li>
            <li> There is just no better way to get really clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just spend a little more and take a trip to CVS.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and saw that OralB had a similar product and wondered which had a better product-- Sonicare or Oral B.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this type of brush for my teeth due to some problems that I was having and it has helped me tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for any years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time)</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, and the units fit my base, however the fit is a little off, and the brush protector is not the same as others i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The older style heads lasted about 6 months, the new rippled ones only 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> When I received these brush heads, both of them had clearly been cut off.</li>
            <li> It suddenly stopped making contact correctly with the handle resulting in a loud noise whenever the brush is on and much weaker vibration.</li>
            <li> They feel uncomfortable, almost like a high-speed dentist drill - and the sound is higher-pitched (not that the sound matters, but it&#x27;s indicative of a change in the design).</li>
            <li> The products shipped were clearly counterfeit.</li>
            <li> These replacements were clearly counterfeit</li>
            <li> I ended up epoxying them back, but really?</li>
            <li> The vibration is a firmer, but may just be because old brush became soft over time.  </li>
            <li> My electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t that old, but my dentist&#x27;s office could no longer get them for me.  </li>
            <li> and then we let the heads go to far...</li>
            <li> I was concerned about finding a replacement head for my old Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> When I bought my Philips Sonicare E4300, I didn&#x27;t really like it because the brush heads were way too big.</li>
            <li> Buying these from amazon through subscribe and save is by far the cheapest way to buy these replacement heads.    </li>
            <li> The bristles seem to go soft and bend sooner.</li>
            <li> Sent these back straight away.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygenist both noticed the early stages of gingivitis (gum inflammation)and recommended Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The expense really adds up but electric toothbrushes are addictive.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to get the professional cleaning as often.  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh as some brushes can be.  </li>
            <li> and I finally found it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The brushes were purchased to replace an old existing brush.</li>
            <li> Make sure you charge it fully at least once every three days</li>
            <li> /&gt;For extra cleaning, dip your loaded toothbrush into a cup of baking soda, it&#x27;s a gentle abrasive and aids in bringing the teeth up.  </li>
            <li> So far it has done this on each of the brush heads that I have used.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my patients who needed the extra care and really talked it up because it does help</li>
            <li> step backward from the old design.  </li>
            <li> Received a pair of these inside a box marked with the Philips name on it.  </li>
            <li> My wife started directly with the Elite, and it was her prompting that moved me to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I have never disliked that decision.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, I have had this product for a year</li>
            <li> AND sometimes Costco offers a  a $10 off coupon for these heads.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush head to replace the old one.</li>
            <li> I used to brush over vigorously with soft bristle manual toothbrushes and it wore at my gum line.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find them in any store, maybe because I have a 2 year old model.</li>
            <li> These did not look like the heads in my unit which was old and had no model number that I could find</li>
            <li> and maybe I could find some old brushes in a  drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that my old brushes were geting worn out.  </li>
            <li> It rattles so loud</li>
            <li> (so far).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using one so far</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t get the old version</li>
            <li> The cleaning ability is about the same but much easier to clean and takes up less</li>
            <li> The brush head must be tightened complete.</li>
            <li> Have used for 10 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to get one for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Automatic reordering  Ship directly to home    </li>
            <li> Looks like a 3 year old cut them.</li>
            <li> 2 days after using one of the replacement brush heads, it started to make a really loud buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> As it stands, I&#x27;m out the $24 and an additional $38 for the replacement--the real thing--from my local (trusted) grocery store.</li>
            <li> but i dont think sonicare carries the old holder</li>
            <li> I purchased these Philips Sonicare brush heads because my old one did not work.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these brushes.</li>
            <li> still use my old one in my RV, hence this purchase and review.</li>
            <li> my old Essence model (from 2009).  </li>
            <li> As long as our e-series battery units keep charging, I&#x27;ll keep buying these exact replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> but in a couple of days it started to make a loud buzzing noise in operation.</li>
            <li> The brush heads arrived completely destroyed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an old Sonicare</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads is LOUD when turned on.  </li>
            <li> The heads seem to last a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I can say about a smaller head toothbrush that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;OK?</li>
            <li> The bristles are a combination of soft, extra-soft, and uselessly-soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;(The real sticker-shock will happen when I have to throw away the Sonicare because the integrated Ni-Cad batteries cannot be replaced, but only mutilatingly removed for recycling.)</li>
            <li> These brushes easily last much longer than the recommended time, but I replace them anyway.  </li>
            <li> One was so loud I tossed it after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> we have bought the Phillips Sonicare tooth brush for years and replacements this by far</li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying these at local supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Thought the brushes were a bit soft.  </li>
            <li> I went through 4 heads in 2 weeks because once the soft plastic isn&#x27;t there to cushion the vibrations and noise, you feel like you have a jackhammer in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It fits my old SoniCare Advance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was greatly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Still like it but preferred the old style</li>
            <li> Rehabilitated my old portable rechargeable toothbrush and provided the newer action that help eliminate my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> I had an old one that was worn out</li>
            <li> Then I bought this actual Philips Sonicare version from Amazon, and they are sooo much quiter and smoother-running.</li>
            <li> you know you should do more often but don&#x27;t at least I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> same as factory, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Do you really not believe improved dental health and appearance is worth $6.00 per year???</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare toothbrush for a few years now and love it, however, these refills are definitely not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads work perfectly with my sonicare elite base.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the time or hassle of sending them back, particularly since my old head was thrown in the trash!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these replacement brush heads seemed to fit my older Sonicare fine, but would not vibrate properly.</li>
            <li> They were the right size and will last me for the next 12 months.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a little louder than my original brush head</li>
            <li> and I have just had to clean the inside a little here and there.</li>
            <li> cost of the Elite replacement brushes is minimal and the brushes last for quite some time if one does not use them to provide the conventional kind of brushing that is not needed with this battery charged tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I find I can get back behind the molars more easily with the Elite Brush heads than with the more expensive Advance Brush heads.</li>
            <li> manufactures change the model, forcing one to buy entire new product ,  Sonicare has not!</li>
            <li> My son always had trouble keeping his teeth clean from plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> If they are as in the past - they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> In the past, through my independent business, I had been able to receive orders as needed.</li>
            <li> No hidden grooves to accumulate muck.</li>
            <li> the first sonicare replacement head did not work properly so I removed it and installed the second which seems to work</li>
            <li> The third brush left all the bristles from one hole my mouth the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone, especially those with gum problems.  </li>
            <li> Definitely would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s money very much well spent.  </li>
            <li> I thus highly and only recommend using these Sonicare heads for your Sonicare brush system.</li>
            <li> And I compared the new with the old brush heads; definitely a difference.</li>
            <li> Same heads for less money with free S&amp;H</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my sonicare, but don&#x27;t like how the inside of the brush head can get dirty easily.  </li>
            <li> By switching to E-Series two years ago, not only did the irritation go away, but also I enjoy less noisy brushing.</li>
            <li> They retain their shape as long as you use the plastic cover, and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer posted photos of his old heads which were the same as my old ones and verified that these newer heads would work with my old model.  </li>
            <li> The fat bottom of the head disallows putting the Sonicare far enough into my mouth to brush the back of my tongue, so I wind up having to keep a real toothbrush around, anyway.  </li>
            <li> Basically its like an old car engine that chugs along and barely makes it up the hill.  </li>
            <li> I received exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are more expensive than generic, but I think they&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li> In the picture above it clearly shows two toothbrushes with a light green ring.</li>
            <li> THEN I went to Amazon and found these, carefully researched them, and really appreciated the complete information and photos provided!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Very good product although a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, got the product for a little cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had periodontal work or had root canal, implants, crowns or bridges done, you know that figure is not an exaggeration, and you&#x27;re lucky if your insurance covers even a little bit of it.</li>
            <li> Though you may save $5 or so by opting for an imitation, you&#x27;re still wasting your money by buying something that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the real thing!</li>
            <li> Although the battery on my sonicare elite doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore, the quality of the brush is very high.</li>
            <li> I will certainly use this seller in the future when I buy my next replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Returned for a new one and same result.</li>
            <li> My new brush head doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the store bought version of the same thing.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush that these heads are for is a recent gift to me to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; the brush before I spend $$ on a new one for myself.  </li>
            <li> Watching Amazon for a Sonicare deal and will end up buying an entire new unit.</li>
            <li> The new brushed do make a difference from one in use for over a year.</li>
            <li> Totally works like new.  </li>
            <li> brush-head that came with my toothbrush is starting to get frazzled, and it&#x27;s time to start looking for new heads.  </li>
            <li> second problem is that the brush itself doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate as vigorously as the brand-name replacement does,&lt;br /&gt;and, at the same time, it&#x27;s much noisier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, Philips is outsourcing not only the manufacture but also the design of those, in which case one has to ask themselves why not get an aftermarket replacement (like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NN07NT0?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage) - it might not be any better but at least it would be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off with brush unevenly cut and SHORT!</li>
            <li> It took a few days to get used to the tingling vibrations when using the brush, and I quickly learned to not remove the toothbrush from my mouth while it was turned on (toothpaste splattered all over bathroom mirror, etc).</li>
            <li> And the average person can do a very thorough job without having to brush too hard, like many people who use a manual toothbrush, which damages the gums.</li>
            <li> While the brush heads seem to work fine, we just replaced them,  the body of the brush which is subject to rotation so that the head and the battery commpartment are not always lined up making it slightly more difficult to opperate the brush.</li>
            <li> No other brush keeps me from needing my dentist.</li>
            <li> No other complaints.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if they really aren&#x27;t lasting as long as the old ones.  </li>
            <li> One of the metal strips responsible for producing the vibration broke loose and basically reduced its vibrating power by 50%.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Sonic base very well and are a better price than I can buy locally.  </li>
            <li> I can see the need for replacing the whole component from time to time but certainly far less frequently than the brush.  </li>
            <li> the replacement heads can be a little pricey, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaints with this product are the clamshell packaging, which sliced my thumb while trying to open and its high cost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced bad quality.</li>
            <li> Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper to buy these through Amazon than to wait for aa sale and to pay salestax as long as you plan enough in advance.</li>
            <li> I will steer clear of these in the future.</li>
            <li> :  loud, don&#x27;t power up well (they stall when applying the tiniest bit of force), and the two magnets simply came off one of the heads.  </li>
            <li> This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t remove the mildewy smell despite 20 minutes of scrubbing it with (yes) an old regular toothbrush to get into the crevices.  </li>
            <li> I feel like after a week they are soft and feel the same as the do after 3 months.</li>
            <li> the head flopped from side to side and barely vibrated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have ANY cavities either (27 years old) - been using since I was a teen.  </li>
            <li> I used generic brand for about a year, and it was so loud you practically had to wear ear plugs.  </li>
            <li> i let my old brush tip go faaaar longer than 6mos and finally replaced it--what a difference!</li>
            <li> I had been using the same old head for some time without replacing it.</li>
            <li> I want the old brush heads back.</li>
            <li> Overall, though the advantages far outweigh the costs....</li>
            <li> Barely scrapes anything anymore</li>
            <li> Apparently these are either knock offs or seconds - not what you would expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones pictured, they work very well with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the latest purchase.</li>
            <li> It is just poor quality control when the toothbrush has more power than the toothbrush head can handle.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little worried it wasn&#x27;t the right replacement head.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost for potential issues down the road.</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t change the design like they did after the first one I bought (had to throw away several spare heads, as the new handle/battery holder would not fit).</li>
            <li> Guess it doesn&#x27;t really matter for us since we get new ones every round, but maybe it would for others.  </li>
            <li> Also, my harsh cleaning methods have caused the metal part at the bottom to rust, which creates a whole new set of problems.</li>
            <li> and I believe the fact that it still works perfectly is due  largely  to using the correct replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these replacements for the old bulky type and really are much less intrusive, in fact I don&#x27;t feel lile choking or vomiting when brushing the rear teeth.</li>
            <li> I had one of these heads on my toothbrush so long the magnets unglued themselves, so I needed a new set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this product, but have just subscribed to your service of sending new repolacement heads at specified intervals.  </li>
            <li> Love my sonicare, but the packaging on these is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at half the store price.  </li>
            <li> These are an exact replacement for the e series and they are delivered to my door at a price that is less than what I can buy them</li>
            <li> These are much higher quality than the previous replacement heads I have bought from Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the same level of clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like these newer heads do not last as long as the older ones.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but they do a great job and the dentist recommends.  </li>
            <li> so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product.</li>
            <li> a little too harsh to me, but probably doing a better job.</li>
            <li> This one is in the middle of the brush and runs down much quicker than the old line at the front of the brush.  </li>
            <li> This time, while the issue is not as bad as a defective magnet, so the toothbrush head is still usable, it has enough issues for me to not be completely happy.      </li>
            <li> Although it took several months to actually turn my dental health completely around, I consider the Sonicare system as pivital to my oral health.  </li>
            <li> I have a very low gag reflex and the old style always made me gag when I worked the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> As far as peoples&#x27; complaints about the cost of the replacement heads - $10 buys a brush head that lasts for 6 months, while you have to replace regular toothbrushes every 3 months, and some of those cost $5 each, so it works out to about the same.  </li>
            <li> I recommend only getting replacements directly from Sonicare, to ensure they will work properly.</li>
            <li> One worked and the 2nd one made such a loud noise</li>
            <li> Now, the 2nd head is showing early signs of doing the same after about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the low price compared to the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I had tried some generic replacements from a local drugstore, but they made a loud noise after being installed.</li>
            <li> I would not have purchased such an expensive brush on my own.  </li>
            <li> Juust make sure you aren&#x27;t missing a spot and get into a thorough routine rotating the undulatiing round brush throughout your mouth.</li>
            <li> I just bought not long time ago, I still didn&#x27;t use it because I bought these 2 pack brush head for keep instock</li>
            <li> handle is over 5 years old and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge too long</li>
            <li> The magnets came off both heads not long after receiving this item.</li>
            <li> These brushes are barely vibrating and they don&#x27;t have the same sound.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First few brushes felt like I was sitting in the dentist office getting my teeth cleaned before getting used to it</li>
            <li> (i know buying them in bulk is truly worth the savings $$$), but i usually end up getting the two pack.</li>
            <li> First, the toothbrush heads I received are the green ones, not the ones pictured.</li>
            <li> Not as much water running down the stem.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to open, but exactly what you would be paying nearly 2x as much for in a store, not to mention tax and standing in line.</li>
            <li> Bought the replacement from amazon much cheaper than the typical price at the store.</li>
            <li> It is dishearteninbg to see a much cheaper , by half, of a Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is the OEM but is much lighter and louder that the previous one I have had</li>
            <li> They last a long time, near 6 months each.</li>
            <li> The first few times you use an electric brush with these heads your mouth will likely feel as if it&#x27;s all a-buzz.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are easy to change but the assembly should be opened and cleaned between changes because material collects inside the mechanism and that&#x27;s unappealing.  </li>
            <li> brushes don&#x27;t wear down fast, last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Other is the price, a normal toothbrush is $1, but these are about $10 a piece.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads broke down after several weeks of normal use, it stopped working suddenly, the brush head would not vibrate as hard as before and it could not be used to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> They really should make the brushheads to have a water tight seal</li>
            <li> They work but wear our a little to fast.</li>
            <li> Even if I could fit the head back there, it would be too small for the job, due to my big tongue.  </li>
            <li> Intense vibration takes a little getting used to - but your teeth will feel clean!I typically alternate with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not as messy and nice thin stem holding the head.  </li>
            <li> Although the bristles are a different color from the original heads, these replacements worked fine in the base unit.</li>
            <li> Each brush head lasted less than 2 weeks, then started making a high pitched noise and quit cleaning.</li>
            <li> the brush heads dont clean too well since the power of the holder seems to be too weak.  </li>
            <li> - they were less than 1/4 of an inch long and cut in a very irregular fashion.</li>
            <li> The only other time the toothbrush felt loud was when I bought generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> ; ACTION THAT OTHER TOOTHBRUSHES ONLY WISH THEY HAD.  </li>
            <li> Also in certain positions the vibrational energy doesn&#x27;t seem to move the brush head which makes brushing no better than a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I usually use the head I&#x27;m replacing to brush out the little mold shotglass that these fit into</li>
            <li> I got these as replacement heads, one of them worked, the other was so loud that I had to end up buying another set.</li>
            <li> OEM brushes, just in a cardboard box instead of the clamshell packaging that is so hard to open, and cardboard is so much easier to recycle!</li>
            <li> Obviously the handle and charger last a long time too.</li>
            <li> At first I had a hard time attaching it.</li>
            <li> cost of the replacement heads are far less then an actual dentis bill, even if you have insurance.  </li>
            <li> My local pharmacy charges about the same amount for a single replacement head as Amazon charges for a package of two heads.  </li>
            <li> They are constructed well and last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads last a long time.</li>
            <li> The head of brush dislodged with no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> last a long time.  </li>
            <li> But, I cut myself badly, not on the scissors or the box cutters, but on the thick sharp plastic.</li>
            <li> Now the brush is very weak and runs out of batteries very quickly, a problem I never had until I switched to these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> For some reason these didn&#x27;t fit my Essence Sonicare properly and made the power of the toothbrush seem very weak.</li>
            <li> First, when you&#x27;re rinsing out the cups that holds the brushes, and then screw the entire head back on, the brush doesn&#x27;t always end up at the front of the base, which is important when you use the off/on button and when you try to hold it upright in your hand.  </li>
            <li> If you let the brush do the work, and don&#x27;t press too hard, each brush will last 6 months, just in time for your dentist to really take you to the cleaners.</li>
            <li> I used a manual tooth brush for a few days until my new Sonicare came.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used a Phillips Sonicare for years, I just buy new head every few months.</li>
            <li> These would not fit new toothbrush</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long considering the price.</li>
            <li> they do not last very long.</li>
            <li> Less than 3 months old when this happened.  </li>
            <li> Since it is so old, I was afraid I could not find replacement heads to fit.  </li>
            <li> Then put it back together or let brush head dry on a towel.</li>
            <li> The 2 will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> but they last a long time (I probably use mine too long, think ~9 months or so).</li>
            <li> Made a very loud buzzing noise for a few days then just stopped working (looked like the magnet seperated at the bottom).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The E-Series toothbrushes are gentle, and the way the brushes are aligned in the head, it works very well for getting into tight spaces and around behind the back</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also tough to clean- after just a week or two of regular use, black sludge starts to build up inside of them, especially in the threads of the collar.</li>
            <li> This brush has significantly cut down on dentist bills and he actually brushes his teeth with out complaint!</li>
            <li> The recent package was purchased as a back up to the brush I was using (down to my last brush)</li>
            <li> Both toothbrush heads make a really loud noise, no matter how tight they are.  </li>
            <li> I have used generic clones in the past and was happy with the low price but terribly disappointed in the performance.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one did not fit the brush properly and made a loud sound when used.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive but they work fine.</li>
            <li> I am currently using the other one, hope it could last longer.</li>
            <li> My GF was a little surprised to have found them.  </li>
            <li> But the replacement brush heads are little expensive since they do not last more than three months maximum.  </li>
            <li> The exact same problem on each brush-head, a clear sign of poor design and execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and fixed the brush-head by separating the plate from the base of the head, and the magnets - from the plate, and gluing them with superglue, and now the brush is working just fine.</li>
            <li> But the plastic cover is very tight, and since I live with cats, I want my toothbrush head protected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made hundreds of purchases on Amazon, and this one was the most disappointing of them all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, dissatisfyingly extra-soft bristles are all that&#x27;s available for the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Clearly were not genuine Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I trashed the container because those are harder to open than aspirin bottles.</li>
            <li> Why so long?  </li>
            <li> Tootbrush heads were missing nearly all of the bristles</li>
            <li> Bought these replacements because I plan on keeping this system for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> you are on a budget, it is still acceptable to use the battery operated toothbrushes as long as you can change the head, the head spins around and you can either recharge or replace the batteries.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had procrastinated this long from my dentists recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that it is all thanks to this toothbrush, and probably my poor use of technique with brushing with a regular toothbrush prior to this</li>
            <li> so you know how long you should be brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brush head bristles are not soft.</li>
            <li> I have been a long timer user of Philips Sonicare Toothbrush Family.</li>
            <li> I hope they hold up for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> you can see the tooth brush strains and one is long, some are shorter.  </li>
            <li> a few as replacment will be needed with frequent use.</li>
            <li> I have no hesitation in recommending this as long as your dentist doesn&#x27;t tell you your teeth can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> only minor concern was that delivery (from China) took longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Seems less powerful and intermittently doesn&#x27;t assemble back on to base smoothly.</li>
            <li> There was a high pitched rattling as if there was some piece of loose metal or a bad fit somewhere.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers comments about toothpaste, saliva etc collecting in the base are right, but it&#x27;s not that big a deal to have to clean it once a week or so?</li>
            <li> The box says they should last for several weeks, however I&#x27;ve found that any longer then a month or a month and a half</li>
            <li> Had this set up for the subscribe and save program and saved a little extra money and will get the next ones shipped automatically.  </li>
            <li> i followed other folks advice and only bought the philips brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried buying generic brand replacements, and while you can get away with doing so with other things, you can&#x27;t with these.  </li>
            <li> The last 2 orders were the same green and grey.</li>
            <li> We have not had any issues with the two other heads we bought at a local store.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was extremely disspointed to see how these two ended up in the trash a month later.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes which causes a lot of other problems such as gum disease and rapid tooth decay.</li>
            <li> LOVE these silly things!</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to the medications I take, so using the Sonicare toothbrush makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing my teeth a favor than just a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to wait very long for them to be shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonicare toothbrushes for the past 7 years and I have to say, there is no better brushing experience than when you exchange your old head with a brand new one out-of-the-box.  </li>
            <li> And because the way it&#x27;s designed, it&#x27;s difficult to clean inside the brush head.</li>
            <li> Let everything air dry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve used one brush head a few times already and can honestly say that I hate to brush my teeth because the sound is so loud.  </li>
            <li> These were in terrible shape, so much so that I wondered if it was some kind of scam to sell defective items.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about a toothbrush, but this style is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Cause bleeding every single time.</li>
            <li> nothing is wrong with this brushes, however, one thing I wonder is: on the label, it recommends to replace the head every 6 months, just wondering if it&#x27;s true, as for my case, I replace these almost every 2/3 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll be grossed out by the muck left behind on your teeth if you go back to your old \\&quot;manual\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is seriously annoying and most likely a potential hazard.</li>
            <li> The magnet is loose.</li>
            <li> You get loose strains of tooth brush in your mouth........</li>
            <li> The only down side is that I seem to go through these things way faster</li>
            <li> Gums are often over brushed and wear down or neglected altogether, so remember...</li>
            <li> These only worked correctly for a few days and then started making a very loud noise and not vibrating correctly, what a waste!</li>
            <li> , i.e. I start a new brush head at least every two months.                    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve worn out two previous Sonicare&#x27;s and this is the only brand I&#x27;ll use.  </li>
            <li> Cost less that the local purchase stores.  </li>
            <li> The research was done by independent folks, was funded independently and was carried out such that the results could be taken seriously (valid results).  </li>
            <li> I had bought generic replacements previously and threw them out when I bought these..</li>
            <li> I recently had to repurchase these as a house guest quite literally ate my previous brushes, a traumatic experience for both of us...</li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement heads at my local Walmart the equate brand because they were half price of the Sonicare what I got them home and put them in a toothbrush they worked well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 4 years on the recommendation of my dentist, and I would never ever go back to a traditional toothbrush...</li>
            <li> It is the same model as the brushhead I was previously using (e series).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them at my local Walmart any longer and had previously tried the Equate version which I had to return because they didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as previous replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Con: They seem to wear out fairly quickly, which could get expensive.  </li>
            <li> However, there are not many alternatives available to these brush heads, so taking a gamble on these may unfortunately be the only option.</li>
            <li> Juts don&#x27;t actively brush using it, just move it slowly around; first, so it says in the manual; second, you will mess up your brush head in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish the brush heads were a little larger, but they do the job</li>
            <li> the two pack deal gives you one extra so you can stall on buying another set a little longer.</li>
            <li> I only gave these three stars because they seem to be a little rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but these brush heads are very loud no matter how tight I screw them on.</li>
            <li> It would be practically impossible to get teeth as clean with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Long stem reaches into the back of the mouth and small heads</li>
            <li> It may have been worth it to buy an expensive toothbrush once--</li>
            <li> did not work as expected when you went to brush the head</li>
            <li> Well, not much to say, they work?</li>
            <li> There is not much to say.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll pass in few short days.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said.</li>
            <li> Yes they are expensive, and worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well, a couple of my close relatives have spent well over $10,000 each having their teeth and gums repaired.</li>
            <li> Got it several years ago and have my self on one of the Amazon subscritions to save 15% and get them mailed to me every few months.</li>
            <li> Even after I had only used it a few times</li>
            <li> These are the same refills without the heavy packaging.</li>
            <li> With traditional toothbrush, I always did it too heavily so that my tooth suffered.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are just what I expected from Phillips.</li>
            <li> So basically, the money you spend on prevention saves you the money you would have spent on imperfect fixes to oral health problems.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are not cheap, but they last 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> These heads do not fit properly.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.  </li>
            <li> A few months later, I braved the chances and ordered from Amazon again.  </li>
            <li> Product came as expected.</li>
            <li> They work exactly as expected, and as described.  </li>
            <li> But these are the only ones we have had trouble with in the almost 10 years we have been using Sonicare.     </li>
            <li> these work as i expected and hoped they would.</li>
            <li> Thess brush head works as expected</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.  </li>
            <li> what I like or expected</li>
            <li> Arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Just a few simple guidelines.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> They are quite expensive but worth every penney.  </li>
            <li> but the money is already spent</li>
            <li> They work exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic on the insides of the heads seems rough and unfinished.  </li>
            <li> and they are not real Philips brand.  </li>
            <li> these are replica and not real Sonicare</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I have any qualms, bristles are a tad stiffer than the brand, but, not much....</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no reason to lock these toothbrush heads up like they&#x27;re made of gold.</li>
            <li> the bristles were uneven and short...</li>
            <li> My base is fully charged and I&#x27;ve tried taking it off and putting it multiple times to make sure that wasn&#x27;t the problem.  </li>
            <li> Similar systems, by other brands, do not clean and stimulate the gums as well.  </li>
            <li> I could tell they had been cut down as there were also one or two rogue bristles that were as long as they should have been.  </li>
            <li> It usually breaks in over time and gets less loud with use.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Unlike the &#x27;plain&#x27; series specific brush heads, these require a bit of fiddling to get to attach or detach.  </li>
            <li> While it is a little hard on the gums the first few times you use it, you will see immediate improvement in the pockets.  </li>
            <li> It definitely cleaning the teeth much better the mechanical toothbrush, but needed to be changed at least every 3 months ( sometimes less) and it is  a little bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> Not worth a single penny.</li>
            <li> Having seen my relatives go through that, I&#x27;ve decided that as I get older, I want to spend my money on vacations and real estate, and not on painful dental</li>
            <li> I dont respond usually when asked to rate a product, only when it&#x27;s outstanding or bad.  </li>
            <li> star because they do not screw onto the base 100% like other reviewers have mentioned so it does make a loud noise compared to the original head that came with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> their so called \\&quot;newer\\&quot; replacement heads are deficient compared to the older Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> Maybe we just got lucky enough to receive a bad batch.</li>
            <li> The bristles were only half the length they should be, uneven, and frayed.</li>
            <li> I used to have other replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I was in a rush the other morning</li>
            <li> I will not use any other automatic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> my teeth are sharp?</li>
            <li> so I fully discharge one while the other sits in the charger).  </li>
            <li> At first it feels weird in my mouth and even tickles some</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used other electric brushes and this one pales in comparison.   </li>
            <li> There were other researchers who compared all the research that has been done with rigorous standards to see what their results were too.</li>
            <li> However, I have not found a less-costly and equally effect product, yet, beyond using an ordinary non-mechanical tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have claimed they received knockoffs-</li>
            <li> One of the 2 heads had the plastic wrapper opened, the other one was sealed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find heads to fit this model anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the replacements from other places and have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for 1 working brush if you ask me</li>
            <li> and I did, these work just like any other tops.</li>
            <li> Let you know how the other 3 brush heads work.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;ve come here to see these other reviews.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, stay away!</li>
            <li> but they were extremely noisy something in the construction with a touch of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Also does not remove plaque as well as other products</li>
            <li> This time one works the other doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are pretty expensive if not bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read in other reviews</li>
            <li> She will use/test the other one in due time.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t use the other one yet.  </li>
            <li> Be careful ordering these!</li>
            <li> these are the larger brush heads which I prefer over the small ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the inside of these things becomes coated with mold.</li>
            <li> One worked the other did not these are not Phillips i believe knock offs ,I  would not order again</li>
            <li> Well, one is defective and is louder than the store brand and the other has cracked.</li>
            <li> The other brush has been working well.  </li>
            <li> Then the packaging had sharp edges on it.</li>
            <li> Got other stuff to do</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using these replacement heads for a little while since I just bought the 5300, but I like the smaller, narrow head on this brush.</li>
            <li> I finally managed to wrangle it off but then noticed the fit was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; when connected to my base.</li>
            <li> When it was time to replace the brushheads that came with my eSeries toothbrush I experimented with one of the less expensive non-Sonicare products but sent them back since they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well..!</li>
            <li> Wish the heads were a little less expensive, but worth it .  </li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements.</li>
            <li> They do have a slightly bigger gap between the base than the original brush that came with.</li>
            <li> The older series would look so badly flailed that it clearly didn&#x27;t brush as well.  </li>
            <li> The only way I manage it is to either soak the base of the head in mouthwash, or thoroughly clean it out with a q-tip (or both).</li>
            <li> Super helpful customer service at Sonicare to find the right size brush head for my outdated base unit.</li>
            <li> When I brush with a regular toothbrush I push to hard</li>
            <li> I had had a hard time finding them in the local stores, and now they come automatically.</li>
            <li> They vibrate hard enough to break your teeth!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Our only complaint is about the packaging of the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I am not a doctor, but I have read somewhere that at least some of our bodily health is hinging on our oral health.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to initally even purchase an expensive toothbrush, but once I read the reviews and did the math, it made sense.  </li>
            <li> Product should last 1.5 years at least now.</li>
            <li> But please note, there are at least two types -- standard (this product) and compact.  </li>
            <li> These are replacements, so not really worth rating the product.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the $6 or whatever I saved.</li>
            <li> Of the two heads in the package, one of them vibrated weakly, the other one just barely hummed.</li>
            <li> The Brush heads last for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> These were clearly a knock off poorly executed.</li>
            <li> We have tried many ways to adjust it, even put WD40 on the base before attaching it and it hasn&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li> Not asking for too much out of a toothbrush head, but unfortunately one of the toothbrushes stopped working (wouldn&#x27;t vibrate) after less than one week.</li>
            <li> It is a very competitive price, less expensive than an &amp;#34;in-store&amp;#34; purchase.  </li>
            <li> down fall</li>
            <li> The bristles looked like they had been cut down or something (see photo).</li>
            <li> Already worn down after three weeks.</li>
            <li> These brushes are cut down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broke down on me yet.  </li>
            <li> Down by the water.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads are a little stiffer than other replacements I have used but are the way I like them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, once it was time to replace the first head, the second one makes this god awful high pitched buzzing noise (not like the normal buzz).</li>
            <li> Our family all have very small mouths, so the full size is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Other than these are not cheap</li>
            <li> and so went back to my old regular toothbrush, and my teeth felt dirty!    </li>
            <li> I would recomend these tooth brushes and they are less costly online at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My dental visits are less intrusive than before.  </li>
            <li> you know i could have bought less then $ 30.00 from wal mart, target stores.</li>
            <li> and I see my dentist less since I started using them.</li>
            <li> The stem of the brush has some pivot capacity, which I never noticed on previous models.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I had a lot less plaque on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> A tad less than buying at the store.</li>
            <li> so I went online and ordered these at half the price.  </li>
            <li> (sorry folks, the most expensive model).  </li>
            <li> The bristles looked like they had been cut in half - as others have stated in their reviews.  </li>
            <li> Beware of  imitation brands like these!</li>
            <li> They cut the brush part in half and called it travel size and the package did not distinguish that it was not standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the stem is too short to get the proper vibration on the toothbrush body.  </li>
            <li> Previously Amazon sent Sonicare Advance heads, and I never had any problems with those.</li>
            <li> Product seems inferior to previous refills.</li>
            <li> They appear as if they were cut in half.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish they were a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers said here, the brush heads were too stiff.</li>
            <li> After the plastic threads have stretched a bit you do not have to twist as hard.  </li>
            <li> But with my newest replacement brushes, the black piece has be shedding itself all over the inside of the brush with little pieces of black rubber or plastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mess around with a replacement - don&#x27;t want to take a chance it will be defective too.  </li>
            <li> Grocery stores have the generic version which are NOT GOOD.  </li>
            <li> , they just make a mess, tried those too.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will have to spend even more now at walmart !</li>
            <li> Very poorly made product, brush less than 1/8 inch high, returned.</li>
            <li> I think all of you who still use this older model Sonicare will agree that the design of the device is horrible- impossible to clean  the innards of the \\&quot;bell\\&quot; where it screws onto the power unit - it can become utterly GROSS unless carefully and constantly cleaned and attended to.</li>
            <li> So instead of paying less for ink bottles in bulk, you (the consumer) have to pay up the wazoo for relatively little amounts of ink in proprietary plastic boxes.&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for replacement heads for this Sonicare model and have been frustrated because two different times, I bought replacement heads in local stores, and they did NOT fit (although they said they were universal).</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes just screw into the base as easy as can be.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that the Sonicare brushes cost so much at the local pharmacy</li>
            <li> It also does not clean my teeth along the gum line.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with an off brand, I wen back to Philips and am so much happier.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little costly, but packagd well and does the job.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels a little battered after brushing, and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little pricey up front</li>
            <li> Not worth the savings!</li>
            <li> That works out to a little over $1.85 a month.</li>
            <li> When our dentist recommended the Sonicare  bought one but a little sceptical.</li>
            <li> The position is off  and looks a little bent.  </li>
            <li> May take a little while to get used to</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant about the quality of these headbrushes.  </li>
            <li> and I notice the little magnets on the bottom move around.</li>
            <li> I just wish they made it a little bit wider.</li>
            <li> We have really a really old Sonicare base and needed new replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to open.  </li>
            <li> causes them to make a whole lot of noise but hardly vibrate, rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> Of course, it gets a little funky in there after 3 months of drool sliding down past the o-ring...</li>
            <li> Makes a terrible noise---doesn&#x27;t seem to fit like the last refills purchased.</li>
            <li> a few minutes before that call.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t waste any time going to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasure to save a few bucks by ordering on-line.</li>
            <li> It was a few dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> The heads we received buzz and do not fit correctly.</li>
            <li> and then they changed the bristles to wear out even faster so after few weeks it feels worn out.</li>
            <li> Just replace the heads every few months</li>
            <li> (they say change them once every three moths, I seem to wear mine out in a few weeks...</li>
            <li> one of the heads doesn&#x27;t work and now I have to go through all the trouble of packing it, shipping it and waiting for a refund before I take another chance and buy the replacement heads all over again.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I replaced the heads for hygienic reasons, but it also solved the harsh vibrating noise my toothbrush was making.</li>
            <li> Arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Poor design and still not possible to change recharge battery by consumer.</li>
            <li> Of course you need to change the tooth brush head every few months.  </li>
            <li> but that goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> They got here at least a day or two before I expected they would.  </li>
            <li> Started using it a few years ago when suggested by dentist.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or money buying these online again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the compact size is never available.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were horribly uneven.  </li>
            <li> The last time I bought these they were quality brushes, now they are poorly made and the quality is non existent.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> We use these everyday.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are what I would call firm.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brush heads for a few years and have bought from amazon before, but these</li>
            <li> These do not fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If I could do it all over, I would choose the Sonicare again over the old method, but I&#x27;m still sickened by the single-option of expensive, minimum-value and minimum-lifetime heads.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads have always fit the base and work as they should.</li>
            <li> The trouble with that is these brush heads aren&#x27;t the easiest to find in stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These literally are a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are not genuine OEM heads.  </li>
            <li> We purchased these and found they must be defects because they stopped working after just a few days (no longer oscillated/twisted and made grinding noises).  </li>
            <li> Bristles are unevenly trimmed and not installed correctly.  </li>
            <li> So frustrating and a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The price I paid was less than I have ever seen them anywhere!  </li>
            <li> and they were less price than the Walmart brand order them and no more noisy toothbrushing in the morning</li>
            <li> they are original and got some generic crap !  </li>
            <li> I was worried due to all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush head are quite stiff.  </li>
            <li> Never have I seen bristles as stiff as those on these brushes.</li>
            <li> My visits to the dentist for cleaning have become extremely tolerable, as the dental hygienist has very little to do !</li>
            <li> Vibration was not strong.</li>
            <li> These replacements are not easy to find in a store.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but worth it to save money from expensive dental work.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than going into stores such as Target, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, and Linen &#x27;n Things.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is unworkable, and now I am stuck having paid for two brushes that only half work.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but you only replace them every 3 months.</li>
            <li> These brushes need to be very tightly torqued onto the body or else the handle vibrates instead of the brush head.  </li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t last a few weeks without a weird smell and</li>
            <li> This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the brush head base and the unit.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but they work!</li>
            <li> On a previous e series brush, the bottom half started to come loose from the stem regularly, quite annoying.</li>
            <li> The brush head immediately loosened, so there was very little vibration.</li>
            <li> Very little pressure on the brush head would make them quit vibrating all together.  </li>
            <li> The other is faulty!!!</li>
            <li> The uneven brush line is hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is they&#x27;re quite expensive.</li>
            <li> but I finally gave it up because the replacement brushes were getting expensive and</li>
            <li> It turns itself off after two minutes (usually the recommending brushing time)</li>
            <li> I usually change my brush head every 4-6 months...  </li>
            <li> Usually don&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> It has simplified my life in a small respect plus saves me money.  </li>
            <li> These are expensive compared to a regular tooth brush, but what are you going to do.  </li>
            <li> The originals I have bought from Sonicare in the past lasted a lot longer.</li>
            <li> It saves some money &amp; you don&#x27;t need heavy equipment to get them out!</li>
            <li> I have never had a cavity in my 40 year life, and I got a small one after using this brush for 6 months.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Sonicare for the past 3 or 4 years after having it recommended to us by our son.  </li>
            <li> This is clearly not an authentic Sonicare product.</li>
            <li> I am  not sure if I  got  a lemon.</li>
            <li> Well, not no more.</li>
            <li> but by the time I tried it I was past my return &#x27;window&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These were the small head replacements.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THESE IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s past my return time</li>
            <li> Once on, they perform as usual.  </li>
            <li> These fit my sonicare base, but were much louder and seem to have contributed to the base no longer working.  </li>
            <li> So for me a wasted buy!</li>
            <li> they were opened past the return date.........</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never had this problem in the past and have used them for years.......</li>
            <li> The brush head is too small, almost like a child size.</li>
            <li> As usual, this Philips Sonicare Rocks.  </li>
            <li> Cost a small fortune...  </li>
            <li> these are NOT authentic.</li>
            <li> Not sure my dentist noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> I usually go to Bed bath and Beyond with my 20% off coupon, but with the price increasing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall ever having these problems in the past.</li>
            <li> I would have purchased a different Sonicare if I had known how expensive these are.</li>
            <li> The heads are small.  </li>
            <li> I have written a review on this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a QA issue or</li>
            <li> I usually purchase them @</li>
            <li> Using it for the past 5 years .</li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased a two-pack usually at Walmart for my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> she usually advices me, &amp;#34;whatever</li>
            <li> No more</li>
            <li> These are not authentic heads...</li>
            <li> The brushes were not packaged and just laying in the box in a small plastic bag</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the expensive replacement heads...</li>
            <li> The last two replacement heads I bought either split open at the neck or the base of the brush head..</li>
            <li> One unit makes a terrible noise and is not as powerful as the other one.  </li>
            <li> The  first brush tore at the base of the brush shaft after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> First, the head doesn&#x27;t screw on all the way, and there is a gap at the base.  </li>
            <li> Heads are compact and very stiff.  </li>
            <li> I also find the Sonicare base a little difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I needed a new brush head that bad, until I replaced it</li>
            <li> Black mold began growing after a few months and is difficult to get rid of.    </li>
            <li> Hoping they will loosen up with use but a bit hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite replacement brushes are hard to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Once you have one, it is hard to do without the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> How are you supposed to get the brushes out of the hard plastic that surrounds them.</li>
            <li> They are hard and non-giving.  </li>
            <li> The accessory heads are hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> If I use them it will be hard plastic on my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> but they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> The bristles were hard and thick, and the heads don&#x27;t vibrate like the Sonicare heads.    </li>
            <li> These replacement heads will continue this toothbrush for at least another year.</li>
            <li> This was such a disappointment</li>
            <li> The magnets are glued on so at least they don&#x27;t slip around anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for at least 10 years and I will say I have never had a problem before.</li>
            <li> thils product was not what was shown in the picture and as such we were unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that water will soon leak in and short out the battery.    </li>
            <li> Regular cutting wouldn&#x27;t work so</li>
            <li> so I could at least tear it along the holes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes since the late 1990s and my dentist affirms its done me well.  </li>
            <li> the printed series name on them was cheap and chipping off.... terrible.</li>
            <li> At home, I just put it in the charger base after using and it is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> The soft plastic between the head and base ripped within a few uses on every head I purchased in this order.</li>
            <li> i am not very happy because you have charged shipping charges #5.oo some cents whre price is $24.99.</li>
            <li> The look the same as the other replacement heads, but the tolerances for the this product do not work with the Sonicare base.</li>
            <li> When I told them what I had been told by the other guy, the response was that he was wrong, that no one at Philips would ever say that.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know what I mean after you use sonicare.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, i was a bit uncomfortable buying these items online.</li>
            <li> The brushes were missing off both toothbrushes!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on silly whitening products and mouthwash- these brushes pay for themselves in a few months!</li>
            <li> When I had a major dental problem and my dentist told me that the my problem would not have been nearly as bad ( or costly)</li>
            <li> I looked carefully at the brush and noticed that the base of the head, which contains a couple of rare-earth magnets, seated on a steel plate, had become loose and was hanging on the plastic tab that protrudes from a hole in the plate (see accompanying pictures).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the new head maybe three times, and the bristle part wiggles in the base of it</li>
            <li> i assume i might need a new base that holds the e series brush</li>
            <li> as with other products that include consumable parts (think printers and razor blades), once you&#x27;ve decided on the base unit, you end up with limited options for for the consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less expensive than at the store with the subscription.</li>
            <li> The only thing one has to know is that the battery life is around 24 months and to change it is quite impossible.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than buying at the dentist or the drugstore.</li>
            <li> However, this product is less expensive at Costco.</li>
            <li> These work well, but they have a  serious design flaw.</li>
            <li> if perhaps a little difficult to remove and replace when using the &#x27;sterilization&#x27; feature.</li>
            <li> Little expensive....</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> It is totally unnecessary to use hard fiber with sonicare.</li>
            <li> The other was so stiff that it was too noisy and painful to use.</li>
            <li> The replacement has now failed after a few months.</li>
            <li> i think it is not fair at all.</li>
            <li> They are not good.</li>
            <li> After not seeing a dentist for two years (not a good thing)</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these in advance a few months ago and now I am unable to return or exchange them because the return time has expired.</li>
            <li> Some I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere were hard as a rock &amp; that&#x27;s what it felt like I was brushing with too!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened with these, but something is wrong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty disgusting.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by drugstore brand generic replacements</li>
            <li> Worst of all half the bristles were either missing or cut almost down to the head.</li>
            <li> This fake thing vibrates very awkward with a very loud noise.</li>
            <li> Tough call.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, since I ruined the hard plastic cover, I figured it would be inappropriate to try and exchange it.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the magnets don&#x27;t connect properly with the toothbrush base.  </li>
            <li> Improved gums and decreased pocket depths.</li>
            <li> , I deducted one star because the quality control seems poor.</li>
            <li> One brush head I received seemed outright broken-</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> They did not stand behind their product and now I understand it is made in China.  </li>
            <li> The base was fully charged and I took it apart and put it back together</li>
            <li> Upon inspection, the flaw was from poor quality construction.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheaper brand and was not happy at all and the dentist noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I opened the package last month (July) and within 3 weeks the magnet broke off of the base.  </li>
            <li> maybe I just haven&#x27;t broken them in yet?</li>
            <li> A poor quality issue.</li>
            <li> I am now going on my 5th toothbrush head because 2 of the 4 were broken within 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> is the absolute worst replacements brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Exceptionally POOR quality.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about an \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; thinking it was merely a gimmick for people too lazy to even exert any effort to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Not Good Philips!</li>
            <li> It appears that the bristles had been cut down to the base and were almost flush with the plastic.  </li>
            <li> In comparing it to the head I had not yet used, I noticed a chip on the corner of the black base of the defective one.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes were useless.</li>
            <li> It failed in a year.</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads ARE expensive, but compared to dental visits and cavity repairs</li>
            <li> however, I sent for the WRONG model.</li>
            <li> way to expensive.  </li>
            <li> These brushes may be a bit on the expensive side, but that cost is a drop in the bucket compared to dental bills.</li>
            <li> This is a sad day because I was a Sonicare fan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if I burst any bubbles</li>
            <li> Expensive?</li>
            <li> These are fake.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are too expensive.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these heads a laughable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical when I read reviews for a product claiming they are knock-offs.</li>
            <li> Who would have imagined that in my quest to save time and money I would inadvertently purchase fake Sonicare items?</li>
            <li> It made it useless with the handheld part.</li>
            <li> They can be expensive.</li>
            <li> I am just disgusted with these last brush heads.</li>
            <li> The coloring is wrong, the labeling is incorrect.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying one of their brush heads.</li>
            <li> i e fake rip offs.</li>
            <li> The brushes are expensive to replace.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately one does not know that they are defective until you unpack it and use them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of these had a magnet glued on wrong and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be complicated</li>
            <li> Unable to evaluate because I bought the wrong sonicare brush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was the wrong brush head for my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The replacement head does not properly fit the toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> They have changed the model number and it is difficult to match up.  </li>
            <li> Fits well on my toothbrush and doesn&#x27;t make an awful noise like the generic brands do.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and quality of these.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable for  brushing.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am all about buying non-oem when it works as well.</li>
            <li> Be wary of buying things from Antelope Pharma.</li>
            <li> I compared these fake heads with my originals</li>
            <li> It was some fake product and now we are out $25 bucks.  </li>
            <li> Shame on you, Amazon - for allowing a fake product like this to be advertised and sold on this site.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggested this product and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Almost like it is a fake, knock off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong in ordering these</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> The Elite switch failed and was very poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> These are very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND ITEM!!!</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to buy online.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely unhappy about having to spend $10 per head.  </li>
            <li> but I suspect they&#x27;re counterfits from China which is disappointing</li>
            <li> Mine arrived with very little bristles... terrible product.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong when it felt like the brush was jackhammering my teeth!</li>
            <li> They are cut wrong!</li>
            <li> These have gotten expensive!  </li>
            <li> They are just very expensive.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive too.</li>
            <li> a useless crap</li>
            <li> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT AMAZON BY PHONE OR EMAIL TO CORRECT</li>
            <li> My husband was using a manual brush when we met and needed to go to the dentist every 3 months because his teeth were so bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve had bad luck with these or not, but I&#x27;ve ordered four from Amazon.</li>
            <li> .. Became so frustrated it trying to find the heads...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has saved me from having to have expensive and very painful gum surgery.</li>
            <li> I am deeply disappointed and would caution all to look at price each shipment.  </li>
            <li> phillips would not replace :(</li>
            <li> I purchased these as I couldn&#x27;t find them in retail stores anymore, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got one head for the price of two :(</li>
            <li> Concerns:   (1)  </li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will be writing to philips to see what they can do for me, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> biggest disadvantage to this style of brush heads is that the design allows them to get very dirty in the area where the brush head screws onto the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work well with the Sonicare base.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I share a Sonicare base, so we have to buy 2 heads at a time.</li>
            <li> One of the two brush heads was defective and sounded like a lawn mower on the Sonicare base.</li>
            <li> (ie, non electric) toothbrush does, and I have had to replace the base once in 5 years (costs ~ 110$).  </li>
            <li> worthless.</li>
            <li> This way you will never have any tooth paste buidup or anything growing inside the brush head base.  </li>
            <li> Already have the charging base and handle, have to buy the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> However, cleaning up my base and refills did the trick.</li>
            <li> The base is still going.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Turns out the issue was not with these brush-heads at all, but with a part on the brush base.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about it, They screwed onto the base backwards.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> annoying.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 weeks during the test and hated having to return it.</li>
            <li> Never used an electric toothbrush, so I hated to spend the $100</li>
            <li> Hated them.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i bought some at walmart (made in china) and was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed with performance as well as feel.</li>
            <li> Always remove and rinse the brush assembly after each use or disgusting stuff will grow inside.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> worst design change.  </li>
            <li> One of the worst purchases I have ever made.  </li>
            <li> and it becomes quite disgusting inside where the magnet is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try to save some money by buying a set of the off-brand replacement heads, but they were awful.</li>
            <li> Piece Of Crap !  </li>
            <li> but the DESIGN is awful.  </li>
            <li> We tried store-brand and they buzzed very annoyingly.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL</li>
            <li> But this time they horrible!!</li>
            <li> It is just so disgusting to think that I am putting these things in/near my mouth ever day.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that there are groups that recycle the toothbrush heads if you feel terrible, like me, when you have to toss one of these out.</li>
            <li> Terrible after market product.</li>
            <li> The packaging was insane.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed and they arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> So much better than the generic!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe these are from Philips.  Definitely different:  loud, don&#x27;t power up well (they stall when applying the tiniest bit of force), and the two magnets simply came off one of the heads.  Less than 3 months old when this happened.  I ended up epoxying them back, but really?</li>
            <li> One of the heads broke after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare, but the packaging on these is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Same heads for less money with free S&amp;H</li>
            <li> I love the Phillips Sonicare and the brushes are excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product! I used to have other replacement heads. Those didn&#x27;t have the power to brush so I switched to these.</li>
            <li> Have this product  for years,  love it.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal for authentic brush head replacement parts. I have had my original handsets for 5 years and continue to replace the brushes here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the brushes arrived looking as if they had been held on a bias against a table sander.  the bristles were shaved off on a angle.  the brushes were useless.</li>
            <li> My mouth is much happier now.&lt;br /&gt;Good value!</li>
            <li> Happy with this product!</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrush heads for a very good electric toothbrush.  They screw on and off very easily and are of the right firmness. A little expensive, but you only replace them every 3 months.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and fit my charging piece perfectly.</li>
            <li> These replacement toothbrush heads are a good value and slip onto the base quickly and easily. The firmness is just right, as advised by the dentist.</li>
            <li> was not the right toothbrush head-  returned and have not received confirmation of return or a credit</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. IF YOU&#x27;RE A USER OF THE SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW FANTASTIC THIS ITEM IS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL.</li>
            <li> This is an identical replacement for my original E5300 head.  It fits perfectly.  I could not find it anywhere at a lower price than Amazon.  I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the Sonicare tooth brushes for several years.  We replace the brush heads about every 3-4 months. We have been very pleased with the performance of the units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare units are easy to clean, and it is very easy to replace the brush heads. After using the Sonicare units, you place them in their chargers where they stay until you&#x27;re ready to use them again.  We&#x27;ve had no problems with the batteries in the units running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our only complaint is about the packaging of the replacement brush heads. The package is plastic, and it&#x27;s sealed around the edges.  It&#x27;s very hard to open.  I have to use metal cutters to cut through the sealed plastic.  You would think Philips could come up with packaging that&#x27;s just as secure, but is much easier to open.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite is a great product and the price on these replacement heads is better than I have found anywhere.  I recomend anyone use this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush head would not stay &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; when the toothbrush was on.  The brush head immediately loosened, so there was very little vibration.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electronic tooth brush because my dentist suggested it.  I at first hesitated looking at the cost of just 2 replacement heads.  I did the math...&lt;br /&gt;First of all the brushing experience is 100 times better!  Every day my teeth feel as though they have been cleaned by a dentist.  And it performs much better and leaves less plaque which results to many dental issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the replacement heads are far less then an actual dentis bill, even if you have insurance.  Well worth the cost for potential issues down the road.</li>
            <li> Should have bought these with the toothbrush, but glad Amazon reminded me that they had them when I needed them.</li>
            <li> These were the real replacement heads.  I&#x27;ve gotten off brands before and they don&#x27;t work right.  These were perfect.</li>
            <li> I found just what I needed to keep my Philips Sonicare Tooth brush in tip top shape.  The shipping was fast, and price good.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Not only were these brush heads offered at a great price, their ergo design and smaller brush size makes it easy to reach into those hard-to-reach areas. Fits the older Sonicares perfectly.</li>
            <li> fit as expected, and do their job</li>
            <li> THE VERY BEST TOOTHBRUSH ON THE MARKET TODAY.  DEFINATELY DENTIST RECOMMENDED.  HAS A UNIQUE &amp;#34;BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER&amp;#34; ACTION THAT OTHER TOOTHBRUSHES ONLY WISH THEY HAD.  GET ONE--YOU&#x27;LL NEVER REGRET IT!</li>
            <li> The Elite Sonicare Brush heads work fine with the Advance Sonicare Electric Toothbrush that I have. The Elite are thinner, smaller; but work fine with my Advance Sonicare. I find I can get back behind the molars more easily with the Elite Brush heads than with the more expensive Advance Brush heads. I would have bought them earlier if I had known that they would fit my sonicare.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly what I needed for my e-series sonicare.  They are exactly like those that came with the original product.</li>
            <li> this is a replacemet brush for my sonicare toothbrush.  I have to buy them every 3 months or so and wish I could get a better price.</li>
            <li> Leave it to someone else to sell you on the value of a Sonicare.  Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but it may be worth it.  What WASN&#x27;T worth it to me was the thought that my perfectly servicable \\&quot;Advance\\&quot; had become obsolete, and replacement heads for it were scarce as hen&#x27;s teeth.  It may have been worth it to buy an expensive toothbrush once--but I wasn&#x27;t about to do it twice.  I was greatly relieved to find that these brush heads fit the Advance just fine.  They are smaller, and some people like them that way.  I really don&#x27;t care, though, if pressed, I would call them an improvement in getting around the corners of my mouth.  They certainly work fine.  And they are cheaper than a whole new setup.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush head are quite stiff.  Hoping they will loosen up with use but a bit hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> I was one of the original testers for the first Sonicare products.  I fell in love with the toothbrush then and have had one since then.  I highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone, especially those with gum problems.  While it is a little hard on the gums the first few times you use it, you will see immediate improvement in the pockets.  Get this toothbrush.  You can actually feel the removal of the plaque off your teeth.  They feel polished.</li>
            <li> Great price for this item...way better than the store.  These are great toothbrushes...all of my kids use them and they are recommended by our orthodontist.</li>
            <li> These are good quality toothbrushes. I wish the packaging were a little more earth friendly and easy to open. But the brushes themselves are good.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are original replacements. They work perfectly, and a great price.</li>
            <li> perfect.  not noisy like the cheapos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these replacements for the old bulky type and really are much less intrusive, in fact I don&#x27;t feel lile choking or vomiting when brushing the rear teeth. I highly recommend them to anyone using these brushes.</li>
            <li> did not work as expected when you went to brush the head quit moving.</li>
            <li> Well, not much to say, they work? lol    My only con I can think of is the cost. I wish they cost less, but they do get your teeth clean!</li>
            <li> There is not much to say. The brushes in the pack are just like the original brush that came with the toothbrush. The Sonicare toothbrush is a fine product that I have used every day for a decade.</li>
            <li> Been a Sonicare user for years.  Going back to the E-series after failures on some of the \\&quot;newer and better\\&quot; models bought for my wife (the ones including the UV sanitizer) that just stopped working or charging.  The E-series seems rock solid.  Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Good Value. Good product.</li>
            <li> Philips certainly has a great sonic toothbrush but hasn&#x27;t bothered to make the price of their brush head replacements cost-effective.  The standard price is around $15 for each brush-head.  That&#x27;s why I-m grateful for the 2-pack replacement pack priced at $15.  Have yet to see them cheaper anywhere else.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Beware of Sonicare&#x27;s Buy 2 Get 1 Free Brush Head Offer.  I bought 2 Sonicare brush heads and sent the original UPC symbol to Sonicare.  They sent me a postcard stating that it did not receive the original UPC symbol or proof-of-purchase tab.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Sonicare brush is okay, I definitely would not buy another Sonicare product again based on the company&#x27;s incorrect handling of its promotion offer!</li>
            <li> Reliable and useful, my wife has had her electronic toothbrush for years. These replacement heads will continue this toothbrush for at least another year. Well made.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product online, everything was as stated on the website.  The item came in a very timely manor and was in excellent condition.  It is a gift but I let my daughter see it before putting it away until her birthday.  She was very excited!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using [[ASIN:B00008BQVM Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]for two years now and I have had great dental checkups. My dentist recomends these tooth brushes and my teeth get cleaner. I would recomend these tooth brushes and they are less costly online at Amazon.com. My husband has been using them for many years now and he has had zero cavities. Try them I think you will like them.</li>
            <li> I owned an old Sonicare for many years. It was a great product.    After five years, I purchased a new one. This was after Philips bought the company. It failed in a year. They replaced it, but with another model, which they said at the time was better. The replacement has now failed after a few months. They refuse to replace it again.    What&#x27;s interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line (for dentists and the like) a few minutes before that call. There I was told the replacement model they sent me had a known history of failures and they would replace it with an improved version. We started to get the replacement information and he found out I was a retail customer. He said he couldn&#x27;t do it and gave me a different number where, he said, they would take care of it. A that line (retail customer service) they told me that there was no problem with the unit and they would not replace it. This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures. When I told them what I had been told by the other guy, the response was that he was wrong, that no one at Philips would ever say that. But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure. There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.    Clearly, there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs, and another company line for consumers who actually buy them. Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My dental visits are less intrusive than before.  My dentist also likes the results.  I recommended Philips Sonicare to anyone.      What is even better is the subscription service from Amazon since it keeps you on track to replace the toothbrush at a great price &amp; no delivery charge.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite 7500 electric toothbrush is rated highly in reviews because it&#x27;s comfortable to use, and is effective at removing plaque. Its ultrasonic bristle movement reaches hard-to-clean areas, like along the gum line and between teeth. The Sonicare toothbrush has a non-slip handle, two speeds, and is rechargeable. It beeps every thirty seconds to prompt you to clean a different area, and shuts off automatically after two minutes. Oral-health experts say we should brush twice a day for two minutes, and there&#x27;s evidence that people brush longer with the Sonicare electric toothbrush than with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon did not disappoint me when I came across these replacement heads for my Sonicare Elite 7500. At the time the price was $18.99 and I could not resist but buy 2 of them.  My family and my dentist are happy with the results that Sonicare Elite system provides and since every replacement heads lasts 6 months, it is well worth the $9.50.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist almost 2 years ago.  My annual check-ups have been excellent since I began using the Sonic Elite toothbrush, and my annual cleanings have been a breeze.  I have been unable to find any store that sells the replacement heads for this product at a better price then Amazon.com does.</li>
            <li> Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush has given me great results, I highly recommend it.  One time when my brush head had worn out, I threw it away but didn&#x27;t immediately buy a new one.  Believe me, within a couple of days, I could tell my mouth did not feel as clean and I didn&#x27;t waste any time going to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my teeth and gums are way better off. If you are like me and do not like to floss then use this product. When I go to the dentist I always get yelled at for not brushing well and flossing. Now after purchasing the sonic care brush when I go to the dentist they always say to me that it looks like you have been brushing better and flossing. I just smile and nod. I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One down fall: Very exspensive the brushes are like $30.00 and you have to replace them every 6 months. How I look at it is that if they protect my teeth it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Had this set up for the subscribe and save program and saved a little extra money and will get the next ones shipped automatically.  This is good otherwise I use the same brush head all year.</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush head. It works well.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads only last 4-6 weeks not 6 months. Longer use the bristles are too worn &amp; it exhibits too much bacteria. The way these brushes clean is impeccable. The only drawback is they&#x27;re quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads ARE expensive, but compared to dental visits and cavity repairs they&#x27;re a drop in the proverbial bucket. The first few times you use an electric brush with these heads your mouth will likely feel as if it&#x27;s all a-buzz. Don&#x27;t panic and don&#x27;t give up. Keep using the brush and it&#x27;ll pass in few short days. My dentist praises my teeth now that I&#x27;ve been using this system for several years. My gums and teeth are cleaner, brighter, and cavity-free.</li>
            <li> This is one amazing toothbrush!  The \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; I got the first time using it told me something was different, and when I visited the hygenist for the regular cleaning my thoughts were confirmed.  She said my teeth and gums were much improved!  The \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; gets less pronounced and almost goes away with time, but the great results continue.  Having the toothpaste right in the brush is great as well.  It&#x27;s refreshing to find a product that really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I could find even in the local store.  Plus, if you register on the Sonicare site, you can get a $5 coupon too.</li>
            <li> Pro: These toothbrush heads are a good size and they allow me to easily get to the back molars.  Con: They seem to wear out fairly quickly, which could get expensive.  For example- I have only had the toothbrush 2 months and have already gone through one of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> A very good product, the same item that I buy in stores, the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> With my Sonicare I need to replace brush head every 6-9 months. Amason I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes just screw into the base as easy as can be.  They are very soft on the gums.  My hygenist is thrilled with my teeth and my gums these days.  I have auto shipment from Amazon for these brushes.  I get a discount on the price and I never have to worry about forgetting to replace the brush heads!</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare.  My teeth always feel so clean after use.  I am glad these newer brushes fit on the older Sonicare that I own.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT PHILIPS SONICARE ELITE! however, I sent for the WRONG model. I trashed the container because those are harder to open than aspirin bottles. BUT, Amazon.com received the much-taped boxed appliance and immediately reimbursed me! LOVE Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Amazon has these heads for the best price.  I will definitely continue to pick them up here.  They usually retail for a lot more.</li>
            <li> Very good service and product. Definitely will continue to shop Amazon and refer to friends. Whoops! forgot to use my coupon.</li>
            <li> Always get the original manufacturer product for toothbrush heads. Just a best practice.</li>
            <li> Great price for these replacement heads!  Normally would have paid the cost for just ONE!  Thanks again</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite replacement brushes are hard to find in retail stores.  To be able to get them at a reduced price, and sign up for automatic delivery was a REAL bonus.  I will definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> We love the Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush heads.  We receive a new 2-Pack every 3 months and it is cheaper and more convinient that having to go to the store to buy them.  We don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to get the new heads ever.  This is a wonderful product and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Have you ever tried to clean the sonicare?  All the crevices and places for water and germs to seep is too much. I&#x27;m a public health nurse and I think it&#x27;s a haven for germs.  I tried to clean it and the brush was still good but I couldn&#x27;t remove the mildewy smell despite 20 minutes of scrubbing it with (yes) an old regular toothbrush to get into the crevices.  I&#x27;ll look for another but won&#x27;t be surprized if I cannot find an electric one that doesn&#x27;t have similar problems.  One more thing- this electric brush also isn&#x27;t the best for people with disabilities who rely on others for cleaning their toothbrushes.   I&#x27;ve wondered if there will be a tooth brush disease to be discovered like legionnaires someday.  Hello tooth brush companies- if you tout how easy it is to clean your electric toothbrush people will sit up and listen.  Julie- Public Health Nurse from Minnesota</li>
            <li> This was a no brainer, I love the toothbrush, the replacements in the store are $30+ I jumped on these!!! Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> A replacement toothbrush head is a fairly straight-forward item to purchase.  I received exactly what I wanted and expected.  It arrived quickly.  I am satisfied, but would be astonished if I hadn&#x27;t been satisfied.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads fit and work fine. Less expensive than at the store with the subscription.</li>
            <li> Once you have used any type of advanced cleaning system, you never want to brush your teeth with a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty good deal with this order.  It is less expensive than going into stores such as Target, Bed, Bath, and Beyond, and Linen &#x27;n Things.</li>
            <li> Other than these are not cheap I love changing these! Makes my Sonicare feel brand new.</li>
            <li> It has been suggested that I use the compact head because it&#x27;s easier to reach.  However, I purchased the regular full head and I find it reaches just as well and can brush a larger surface.  I will purchase the full head from now on!</li>
            <li> It was delivered in the time specified and it was very easy to replace my old brush head.  Works great.</li>
            <li> These replacements have a newer, stronger motor. The angled brush head is like on the newer models, and it is very effective. The replacement fit and operated perfectly.  I received excellent and prompt service.</li>
            <li> It does everything it claims to do.  It brushes teeth, it, well, er, it brushes teeth.  What else do you expect from it?</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for about 3 years now and my dentist has been giving me good reviews on my check-ups. I was glad to have found a good price on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare. It has made a world of difference in dental checkups. Phillips Sonicare does require some extra effort to keep clean. But, prefer it over oral B, which manufactures new toothbrushes every year/some heads don&#x27;t fit some models etc.. Became so frustrated it trying to find the heads...I even e-mailed the  company several times. They never responded to my questions. So bought Phillips/the heads fit all models. Very happy.</li>
            <li> My local pharmacy charges about the same amount for a single replacement head as Amazon charges for a package of two heads.  It&#x27;s always a pleasure to save a few bucks by ordering on-line.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to make this purchase. The description had enough detail for me to pick to right head type for the Sonicare unit I have.  Amazon.com is a very easy way to shop on line.</li>
            <li> Replacing the heads on the original unit makes it run like new again.  The vibration is a firmer, but may just be because old brush became soft over time.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am happy with your service. You update me when you ship and the  product usually gets here fast and the auto ship feature is great.  I will always be your customer. Price is great also.    Thank you,  Everett F Jester</li>
            <li> Love this new tooth brush!!!!!!  I was so pleased that I bought a second one for my mother!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The way it is designed is perfect for oral health….teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush out there and Amazons prices can&#x27;t be beat.  I have it set up on a subscription and they get delivered every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have had the Sonicare Elite for about 2 months now and I like it very much. I used Oral-B power brushes for years but I finally gave it up because the replacement brushes were getting expensive and it was time to try something new.     My mouth and teeth feel cleaner using the Sonicare versus the Oral-B. I also find it easier to handle. One unexpected benefit is that the green light on the handle glows sufficiently bright enough at night that it actually acts as a night light providing me with enough light that I can see where I&#x27;m going and not miss the toilet at night. (Important for a guy.)     Definitely would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i am not very happy because you have charged shipping charges #5.oo some cents whre price is $24.99. you know i could have bought less then $ 30.00 from wal mart, target stores. i think it is not fair at all. i do not buy any thing now from amazon. I have learn my lesson. i do not do that mistake again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Elite toothbrush is the best...so I guess the replacement brush head is also great!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product on your site after searching in 4 stores in town.  I should have started here I guess.  Many newer models were available on the store shelves...NOT the older ones.  They came very quickly and were immediately put into use! Thanks</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job of keeping your teeth and gums in great shape.  It turns itself off after two minutes (usually the recommending brushing time) and it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  We&#x27;ve worn out two previous Sonicare&#x27;s and this is the only brand I&#x27;ll use.  The simpler the machine, the easier it is to keep in good condition and this basic brush will take care of anyone.  One last thing that really good:  the battery lasts for over a week before the brush needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> My electric toothbrush isn&#x27;t that old, but my dentist&#x27;s office could no longer get them for me.  I found just what I needed on Amazon and at a good price.  They were just perfect and work great.</li>
            <li> My family has now been using Sonicare tooth brushes for around 7-9 years.  The results are very impressive.  Peridontal checkups are now just routine and no treatment has been required since we started using Sonicare.  Ditto for tooth cavities - we no longer have them.  Sonicare tooth brushes are worth their weight in gold.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  But they gotta lower the price...way to expensive.  After one more round, I think i&#x27;m going to switch to manual brushes.</li>
            <li> No needs for further explanation. Sonicare is the best solution for dental needs and I see my dentist less since I started using them.</li>
            <li> Love the new design and shape.  Also there appears to be more power and my  teeth actually look whiter.</li>
            <li> I have been using soncicare for a little over a year now and have seen good results.  My dental hygienist has seen my gums improve and my teeth in better condition.</li>
            <li> I love Phillips sonicare.  With Amazon offering scheduled shipments at a great price this was the best ever.  The problem after the first shipment the price rose almost two dollars.  I am deeply disappointed and would caution all to look at price each shipment.  I am cancelling my enrollment.</li>
            <li> I have read where some of these replacment brushes are cheap knock-offs.  These brushes appear to be the real deal and work just like the original brushes.</li>
            <li> It was a few dollars cheaper &amp; i did not have to leave my house to get it.</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be a knock off.  I contacted Sonicare and they confirmed that this product is a knock off.  If you receive brushes in a brown cardboard box, they are not the OEM product.  The heads we received buzz and do not fit correctly.</li>
            <li> Just buying new heads for my old Sonicares...love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second order for these replacement brush heads.  They work very well, certainly as advertised - I do   enjoy the freshness feeling following a brushing with this system.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me the Sonicare system as part of a dental repair that I had done.  I would not have purchased such an expensive brush on my own.  But now that I have it I am very pleased.  It is recommended that the brush head be replaced every three months. And with the Amazon subcription discount makes this an even better deal.</li>
            <li> These are brand new brushheads and they were cheap so I gave them 5 stars. I dont care where they came from.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and it has greatly improved my dental hygiene.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com makes it so easy to replace my toothbrush heads on schedule.  Every three months the heads arrive in the mail, and I just have to go to my mailbox.  No going to the store in hopes they have the size, style, model and price!  Its always exactly what I want, when I need it.  Try it.</li>
            <li> good fit as a replacement head no issues at all</li>
            <li> Always use the toothbrush and I have to buy a replacement from time to time, this seller has been faster in sending spare parts and as described on page ..</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrush is used by each member of our household. We have found it to be an integral part of keeping our teeth and gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Cheapest I found on line.  Got it quickly and all in tact.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product.  Your teeth feel dentist fresh every time.  I was in a rush the other morning and so went back to my old regular toothbrush, and my teeth felt dirty!    Other reviewers comments about toothpaste, saliva etc collecting in the base are right, but it&#x27;s not that big a deal to have to clean it once a week or so?</li>
            <li> Since childhood,I tend to brush my teeth relatively strongly,so this item is quite useful for me to do natural and tender care for my teeth. Besides,it&#x27;s very frugal to purchase only these replaceable top parts.</li>
            <li> Haave been using the Sonicare products since their introduction several years ago, and this one continues the trend of great value products, while being extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years and have tried many of the knock-off substitutes for these brush heads. Some were ill fitting and would not sit on the handle unit squarely. Others did not work at all. I am going with the real thing from now on.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008BFXL Philips Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]    Excellent product and perfect replacement for the Sonicare Elite.  Very good value--better pricing than direct from Phillips.</li>
            <li> I love the brush heads, but I wish a two pack wouldn&#x27;t come the same color!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little costly, but packagd well and does the job.  It&#x27;s not a small part at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who was having some problems with her gums.  Her dentist recommended this and since she&#x27;s been using it, her gums have returned to their healthy state and her dentist is happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I swear by my Sonicare. Bought the replacement from amazon much cheaper than the typical price at the store. The heads are same ones that came with my Sonicare when I bought it.</li>
            <li> My periodontist was very happy to hear I&#x27;m using Sonicare. When at dental school, he participated in a study comparing Sonicare with regular manual brushing. According to him, the best manual could do was clean teeth 43%, whereas Sonicare cleaned 93%.</li>
            <li> These replacement parts work as well or better than what came originally with the unit.  That is very nice - quite unlike certain replacement parts for razors.</li>
            <li> We often forget how wonderful the Sonicare&#x27;s are and then we let the heads go to far...then, moments like now where we just swapped them a week ago and we then again realize why they are so wonderful is largely because we have refreshed the heads again.  If we were smart we&#x27;d remember as the wear marks in the bristles showed we needed new ones...maybe next time.</li>
            <li> nothing but the real thing.don&#x27;t waste your money on&amp;#34; after market look a likes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was concerned about finding a replacement head for my old Sonicare.  This one fits, but is a much better brush.  Not as messy and nice thin stem holding the head.  Not as much water running down the stem.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> keep teeth is perfect condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonicare toothbrushes for the past 7 years and I have to say, there is no better brushing experience than when you exchange your old head with a brand new one out-of-the-box.  Sonicare uses gentle bristles but has a high speed movement that removes all plaque from your teeth.  The e-series head replaces heads from, well, the Sonicare e-series brushes.  They are constructed well and last for a long time.  I usually change my brush head every 4-6 months...  Why so long?  Because they are pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the price, these heads are great.  About that price:  Now that you can subscribe to delivery on Subscribe and Save, you can save 15% more off of Amazon&#x27;s already low price.  That is a deal you just can&#x27;t pass up!</li>
            <li> A good price for the Sonicare refills.</li>
            <li> I have used the Philips Sonicare Elite Replacement Brush Heads for several years. In the past, through my independent business, I had been able to receive orders as needed. Once this product was no longer available through my business, I had to search for the proper replacements. I tried some other products but I discovered that those products were inferior and costly since I needed to replace them more frequently.I am most satisfied to have the Philips brand available through Amazon and I will continue to order my replacements on an as needed basis.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping--arrived as presented---will use again!</li>
            <li> The bristles looked like they had been cut down or something (see photo). They fit my sonicare toothbrush but um, I am not brushing my teeth with that. I was verrrry dissapointed and shipped them right back.</li>
            <li> They are just like the ones that came w/ the original set.  Shipment came in time as well given we live overseas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been six years since I began using Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes; all have taken the Elite (E-Series) replacement heads. Nothing else gets my teeth as clean and reaches into tight spaces as well as this particular product. I keep a different brand (Philip&#x27;s biggest competitor), in the RV, and while it has more vigorous action, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Sonicare. My mouth feels a little battered after brushing, and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E-Series toothbrushes are gentle, and the way the brushes are aligned in the head, it works very well for getting into tight spaces and around behind the back molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with a top-of-the-line Sonicare device, but I discovered that the middle-of-the-road model works just as well. Which brings me to another great point about these heads:  they fit more than one model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Philips doesn&#x27;t decide to improve on a good thing and change the design. If it ain&#x27;t broke, then it doesn&#x27;t need fixing!</li>
            <li> I started to use Sonicare after my gums started to bleed, which was a result of not properly brushing my teeth and gums.  Although it took several months to actually turn my dental health completely around, I consider the Sonicare system as pivital to my oral health.  I will not use any other automatic tooth brush. And I will never brush with a hand held brush again.  I am not a doctor, but I have read somewhere that at least some of our bodily health is hinging on our oral health.  Keep your body healthy, use this brush today.  I also use BRUSHPICKS, I highly endorse this product too.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers stated, the brush is good when new but Philips makes a special effort to make this product as short lived as possible.  At first they changed the recommendation to replace it from every six month to every 3 month and then they changed the bristles to wear out even faster so after few weeks it feels worn out. For over $10 a brush I would expect it to last longer.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were brand new. It shipped on time. I could not ask for a better transaction.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, only one thing that I am not very satisfied is:  the rubber rings and covers on the heads are not as tight as the original ones came with the toothbrush I bought before. The water and toothpaste mix will sink through the gaps and need extra care after each time using.</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth pretty thoroughly. Just make sure you clean the metal insides every few days and you are fine. Overall a solid product.</li>
            <li> When I bought my Philips Sonicare E4300, I didn&#x27;t really like it because the brush heads were way too big. In addition, there are too many corners and moving parts that bacterias and thrive in. I was going to buy a new brush until I found these replacement heads. I didn&#x27;t even know they made these kinds of brush. Always thought I had to buy original heads.    Anyways, I bought the normal brush heads (not compact) and boy do I love it. It feels so much more natural and it&#x27;s A LOT more compact than the original brush. Not to mention the price is just right. These are the only brush heads I buy. I&#x27;ll be damned if Philips can come up with a better head for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads don&#x27;t work properly.  It seems that the magnets don&#x27;t connect properly with the toothbrush base.  They are not good.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter and she says they work great, being they are replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes and replacements- I&#x27;ve used them for years.  But the economics of size don&#x27;t apply: the standard 3-pack is a bout $12/brush at present whereas the standard 2-pack is more like $10 each.    Not only that, but the \\&quot;subscription plan\\&quot; Amazon offers may make more sense at a minimum rate of 2 brush heads each 6 months than does 3 brush heads each 6 months. This way my wife &amp; I can both be reminded at 6 month intervals and refreshed for just $8 apiece. I know they advise 3 month intervals but I do 6.    One fellow said that he longs for the O-ring that goes underneath these refills and he&#x27;s absolutely right: mine is long gone, and I have to clean black crud out of the handle well with each replacement. Yuk.</li>
            <li> I got my sonic care toothbrush about 3 years ago and I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the Philips toothbrush, and my first one gave many years of service before it had to be replaced. Am on third set of replacement heads for this one and am quite happy with performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started out to buy the replacement brushes from the manufacturer. Amazon&#x27;s price and shipping costs were lower.</li>
            <li> Amazon makes it easy to keep my household stocked with toothbrushes without worrying that the product will not be available.</li>
            <li> These heads fit our SoniCare toothbrushes, and do a great job of brushing. They lose something after 3 months, so we have them on automatic shipment.</li>
            <li> Buying these from amazon through subscribe and save is by far the cheapest way to buy these replacement heads.    I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for about 9 years. I feel like these newer heads do not last as long as the older ones. The bristles seem to go soft and bend sooner. The brushing strength also seems to decreases faster.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Fast shipping and a good price.  I should have bought these a lot sooner than I did.  The Sonicare is much more effective with a new brush head every few months.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it was advertised.  Like that they offer to send it automatically on my terms.  Also that they have the packaging option.  Its great to be able to just open a package instead  of getting out the hedge clippers!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over three years, and I am completely satisfied.  Won&#x27;t accept substitutes, Philips Sonicare is the best toothbrush out in the market.</li>
            <li> I ordered three packages of these Elite replacements because they&#x27;ve been reconstructed to accept the handle of the Advance Sonicare which is no longer being made. I opened one package and tried it, and the brush head does work, so that&#x27;s a relief in taking the chance on purchasing it. As far as the seller is concerned, I have no complaints about the order -- the packaging was adequate for the product to arrive in perfect condition, the duration was within Amazon&#x27;s agreed upon time, and the price is the lowest I&#x27;ve found, both locally in stores and online. I&#x27;m satsified with my purchase, have no complaints and would gladly buy from them again.</li>
            <li> the worked with my Sonicare and was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> When attached to the handle these brush heads made a loud noise not like the normal sonicare vibration.  Worst of all half the bristles were either missing or cut almost down to the head. Sent these back straight away.</li>
            <li> These are simply the replacement heads that come from the manufacturer. They work great and last a while! Amazon has great prices on them too.</li>
            <li> I think the last time I changed my SonicCare toothbrush head was over a year ago..not a good replacement cycle.</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush, but these heads just don&#x27;t last nearly as long as advertised. I feel like after a week they are soft and feel the same as the do after 3 months.</li>
            <li> These heads will probably be phased out soon as the newer models of Sonicare replace the heads only.  This was a good price and superfast shipping.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrush is a must have for getting your teeth ultra cleen and being able to have the replacement brush heads sent automaticaly every three months is a big plus. I would never go back to a manual brush again.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit the Sonic Advance handle and are a substantial improvement over the Advance replacement brushes.  One feels the difference immediately.  I will never purchase another type of replacement brush head.  Amazon had by far the best price.  Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> This replacement head is not the original size. It is quite a bit smaller.  That can be good for getting to the back teeth.  No issue on that factor.  But the plastic cover is very tight, and since I live with cats, I want my toothbrush head protected. The stem of the brush has some pivot capacity, which I never noticed on previous models. So when I push on the cap, I worry about what I am doing to the pivot part.  What ever</li>
            <li> I am on the automatic replacement ordering system for the refills and it really helps me to remember to change them.  They, of course, work beautifully, and I don&#x27;t have to remember which refills to buy for the toothbrush model I have.   Very pleased with the reordering system and the price offered for being on the system is much better than I can buy them in a local store, plus I don&#x27;t have to go and get them!!</li>
            <li> This replacement brush for the Sonicare is a well mede product. It performs well and clean the teeth quickly and completely. I would purchase another in the future.</li>
            <li> Have used the Sonicare system for years. Just replace the heads every few months and it still works after about seven years! Would not use any other kind of toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> We have purchased these heads for the past few years and always are impressed with the quality and convenience of havig them on hand.</li>
            <li> I love what this toothbrush does, but these replacement brushes were even better than the original ones I purchased. These actually have a worn indicator in the color of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I have braces and, as a result, have to replace my brush heads more often. I add enough to my order to qualify for free shipping. Now I always have a spare on hand when I need it and save over the drug store prices. Great service from Amazon. Great product. By the way, don&#x27;t fall for the drug store replacement brands. I&#x27;ve tried them. They don&#x27;t work! Get the Sonicare replacements from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for years, and with my older model toothbrush (pre E-Series) I became concerned when I couldn&#x27;t find replacement brushes that looked like my original and prior replacement brushes.  These replacement brushes fit my old model Sonicare (fat handle) and I like this newer style brush better than the original.</li>
            <li> Sonic electric tooth brushes are the best i have ever used.  The heads get &#x27;old&#x27; too quickly though.  This is the 5th set I have in 2 years.  After brushing, it really leaves you with a very clean feeling, much better than the other electric toothbrush i had before.</li>
            <li> I have been using the &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; Sonicare for several years. I was selected to test the prototype for this new Sonicare Elite. I used it for 6 weeks during the test and hated having to return it. It is really a great toothbrush. It is hard to believe that any toothbrush is better than the Sonicare Advanced, but this one truly is.</li>
            <li> I use these replacement brush heads with my Sonicare Elite and I&#x27;ve never been happier with my dental setup at home. My dentist says he can tell the difference, and my teeth feel great every time I brush. These brushes may be a bit on the expensive side, but that cost is a drop in the bucket compared to dental bills. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a sonicare for several years and it does a great job.  Eventually the brushes wear out and need to be replaced to continue doing a great job!</li>
            <li> so glad to find a good deal on a pair of this hard to find replacement - the first one works as it should and am happy to have a back up.</li>
            <li> so glad to get these via delivery and they seem to help w plaque buildup unlike manual brushes</li>
            <li> This makes brushing a lot easier than using a manual toothbrush.  It cleans better and I found it to be a great gift.  At first, I didn&#x27;t use it.  Then one day I decided to give it a try.  What beautiful results!!  My dentist told me that I had a lot less plaque on my teeth.  I give my thanks to this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has saved us lots of money on dentist bills. My husband was using a manual brush when we met and needed to go to the dentist every 3 months because his teeth were so bad. This brush has significantly cut down on dentist bills and he actually brushes his teeth with out complaint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and have no reason to use any other kind of tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these replacement heads for my OLD Sonic Toothbrush.  Since it is so old, I was afraid I could not find replacement heads to fit.  But, lo and behold, these actually fit quite well and saved me from buying a new toothbrush.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you have the Sonicare Elite you need these brushes.  They are good and last me about 6 - 8 months.  You can sometimes find them cheaper when on sale at Target.  With free shipping, and no tax from Amazon it was a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Great product use them every day.  I have my Sonicare for over 10 years and would not use a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li> These are great brushes to do a thorough job and help avoid cavities.   I find this much faster than regular brushing and does a nice job on the gumbs, not too harsh and keeps them tone to help fight tooth decay.</li>
            <li> only use these tooth brushes</li>
            <li> nothing is wrong with this brushes, however, one thing I wonder is: on the label, it recommends to replace the head every 6 months, just wondering if it&#x27;s true, as for my case, I replace these almost every 2/3 months. my teeth are sharp?</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for.  Shipping was quick, got the product for a little cheaper than in the stores.  Good investment since you only have to replace every six months.  One package lasts you a whole year!  Will definitely purchase again when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the Sonicare is the a very effective tool for dental hygene. My dentist and hygenist both noticed the early stages of gingivitis (gum inflammation)and recommended Sonicare.  At my next visit, the gums looked great.  I understand Oral B has a very good competing product, as well.  The important thing is to not just rely on a manual toothbrush all the time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the Sonicare Elite toothbrush for a number of years.  It has performed flawlessly.  The brush heads have to be replaced periodically.  They are designed for the brush, and also perform excellently.  We are satisfied with all aspects of this system.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as promised;  however, my only comment would be that I wish the brush heads would last a little longer, they seem to wear pretty quickly.      LOVE the toothbrush itself though!</li>
            <li> These were great before they became backward compatible with the earlier model bodies.  I have an E-series (actually two of them so I fully discharge one while the other sits in the charger).  These brushes need to be very tightly torqued onto the body or else the handle vibrates instead of the brush head.  After the plastic threads have stretched a bit you do not have to twist as hard.  Always remove and rinse the brush assembly after each use or disgusting stuff will grow inside.</li>
            <li> Love these. Got an excellent report from the dentist after using. Improved gums and decreased pocket depths.</li>
            <li> Intense vibration takes a little getting used to - but your teeth will feel clean!I typically alternate with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say that hasn&#x27;t already been said. The E-series brushes are the best out there. The only down side is that I seem to go through these things way faster (they say change them once every three moths, I seem to wear mine out in a few weeks... with \\&quot;normal pressure\\&quot; and on the higher setting). But I love them!</li>
            <li> i have used this product for over a year, and it is great.</li>
            <li> If you want a great toothbrush that really gets your teeth clean, then this Sonicare Elite is for you.  I was very hesitant to initally even purchase an expensive toothbrush, but once I read the reviews and did the math, it made sense.  This toothbrush will leave your teeth with the same feeling you get after seeing your dentist - very smooth and clean.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My husband and I actually share one toothbrush and just purchase the replacements heads that we swap out each morning.  This has been a great way to save money while we both take advantage of the great cleaning.  If you get a chance to purchase these heads when their on sale, do so!  I got a great price and then saved even more with a coupon, using Amazon.com.  Remember, each replacement head lasts about six months.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased replacement heads for my sonicare.  These toothbrushes are the best thing around for healthy gums and teeth.  I have had the great dental reports ever since beginning to use this brush.  Also, my teeth feel cleaner after brushing than I can ever remember.  I would recommend this toothbrush as one of the best on the market.  The heads have to be replaced every 6 months so I was happy to be able to purchase them at Amazon.  Great price--great results!!</li>
            <li> The expense really adds up but electric toothbrushes are addictive.</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes for years and find them well suited for clean teeth.  The wear out about every 6-8 months and must be replaced.</li>
            <li> These are the best tooth brushes on the market.  No doubt my teeth are cleaner and I don&#x27;t need to get the professional cleaning as often.  Yes they are expensive, and worth it.  Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads for the Sonicare Elite are not as shown or described.  The ones I received are not the \\&quot;slim angled neck\\&quot;  they are straight.  Yes, they fit the elite unit but they are not the ones I ordered.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush and buying the 2 brush heads at a time saves me some money and i dont have to worry about buying more for a year.</li>
            <li> my mouth has never felt better than it does right now. keeps my mouth feeling fresh, and has helped me with my gums. A super product at any cost.</li>
            <li> Tootbrush heads were missing nearly all of the bristles</li>
            <li> Ordered the Phillips Sonicare Elite Replacement Brush Heads and received the shipment as promised. Items in good condition. I priced the same in CVS and saved about $10.00 ordering through Amazon, including shipping charge.</li>
            <li> We are repeat buyers of this product and have been for many years.  My wife and I are totaly sold on both the health benefits Sonicare products provide and the dependability of the product.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads for a great product.  Since using the sonic care system my teeth are whiter and gums healthier.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will simply never feel cleaner than after using this brush a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be grossed out by the muck left behind on your teeth if you go back to your old \\&quot;manual\\&quot; brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny. (Whenever your dentist says, \\&quot;Keep doing whatever you&#x27;re doing.\\&quot; You are doing it right.)</li>
            <li> Nice brushes at a nice price.</li>
            <li> The replacement head was as good as the original. This is a great toothbrush, and I would recommend it to anyone. Price is high, but it is definitely worth every penny. My teeth and gums have really improved since using it. Good bye old fashioned manuel toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Recommended by my dentist.  First time in my life my teeth really felt clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> no paperwork,  otherwise fine</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the fast arrival. I was also surprised at how much better the new head works - didn&#x27;t realize the old one had steadily grown weaker... Also, was very happy with the price as I saw it at Wal-mart for $10 more! It will be nice to not have to remember when it&#x27;s time to re-order. Thank you for a great deal in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> these brushes make my teeth fell fresh and clean.  Whenever I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days, if I use a regular toothbrush for a trip or something, it always feels nice to come back to these.</li>
            <li> Good products, performs as advertised. A bit pricey but what are you gonna do? Gotta have them and they do the job. A tad less than buying at the store.</li>
            <li> The product has a high ROI ( return on investment)  Easy to use adn efficirnt in cleaning your teeth.  Leaves you with a feeeling of a job well done.  The only thing one has to know is that the battery life is around 24 months and to change it is quite impossible. Tried on two electic brushes and gave up. Even though Philips says it can be done quite easily, is isn&#x27;t so.   I bought new power brushes and that&#x27;s what the manufacturer aimed at? Nevertheless, I recommend it.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best.  It is worth every penny that you may spend on it.  It does most of the action on your teeth and leaves your teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh. It is not harsh as some brushes can be.  It does the job better than any regular toothbrush.   It is also very good for your gums. You don&#x27;t have to use any pressure.  The brush does the work.   It has a timer on it, so you know how much time you are spending brushing.  I have tried many electronic toothbrushes, but this is the best.  I have been using it for over four years now, and would recommend it to anyone.  Your teeth will be the healthiest.  Don&#x27;t hesitiate--you will love it.</li>
            <li> Great for kids, or if you travel it makes a wonderful travel tooth brush head, with  batteries it&#x27;s always ready to go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product at Walmart and Target and I finally found it reasonably priced. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product from you.</li>
            <li> I love the fact Philips uses real tooth brush heads vs. the rotary things that other brands use. The price on Amazon was the lowest I could find around...</li>
            <li> Have used these for a number of years.  Teeth feel like you just left the dentist office for a cleaning.  Auto ship made them a beter value than locally.</li>
            <li> It is dishearteninbg to see a much cheaper , by half, of a Sonicare toothbrush.  Yes, I am aware that I selected a different line but had I known about the cheaper version, you know I would have chosen the cheaper one.  50% off of $195 is quite a savings.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Elites are better than average electronic toothbrushes, but you should know what you&#x27;re getting into before you buy a kit. Electronic toothbrushes use the the Gilette model: sell the shavers for cheap, get them on the razor blades. Inkjet printers also use this model.&lt;br /&gt;All marketing hype aside, the truth of the matter is the actual cost of the consumables should be a fraction of what you&#x27;re paying. For example, it is technically possible to create an inkhead that refills like a gas tank, but the printer companies would tell you otherwise because such a design would cut into their fat margins. So instead of paying less for ink bottles in bulk, you (the consumer) have to pay up the wazoo for relatively little amounts of ink in proprietary plastic boxes.&lt;br /&gt;Same with Sonicare replacement brushes: instead of paying a couple bucks for just a new brush head with bristles (costing about the same as a new manual toothbrush), you have to pay $10 for a toothbrush head that comes in its own cartridge. There is really no good reason why the manufacturer didn&#x27;t integrate the brush cartridge and neck into the handle itself so that you&#x27;d just have to replace the tip, but there is a good reason why they chose not to.&lt;br /&gt;Always know what your money is going towards before you shop -- your wallet will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than buying at the dentist or the drugstore. Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> I just want to say that this is one great product as many people noted here in their reviews. There is no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want to focus is the price. At $20 this is cheaper than Wal-mart. So, this is definetely a deal. Order something else to get over $25 and qulify for free shipping. Want to save more, then use Amazon credit card. I do not work for Amazon, but I am just one happy customer, who found the way to save a few extra $$$.</li>
            <li> These are good brush heads (for a good toothbrush), but it seems Sonicare is asking a bit too much money for them.  If this product was priced more appropriately, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  There&#x27;s just like the orginal ones!  If you need a replacement brush for your e-series (i have the e-series elite), then you&#x27;ll be very happy with these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to get a product through Amazon that costs much more in the stores.</li>
            <li> The product was received in a timely manner, and was exactly what was ordered. I have used the Sonicare for several years, and am very pleased with it.  These brushes, ordered from Amazon.com, are perfect replacements.</li>
            <li> A necessary accessory for the elite brushes.  It appears as though they will last about 6 months.  Elite brush is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> excellent product been using it for over 7 years! best toothbrush ever you will not go back to a regular brush again.</li>
            <li> I had problem finding replacement brushes for my old model sonicare and this model did make a difference, it will replace most of sonicare old model handle.&lt;br /&gt;Research if it fit your model before order.</li>
            <li> The brushes were purchased to replace an old existing brush. It&#x27;s a good tooth brush and keep my teeth clean. So I&#x27;m very pleased to have ordered these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare e-series system for years now. I am religious about the care of my teeth and I believe that this is the best product for complete teeth cleaning out there. My teeth and gums and mouth are getting the best care possible with the sonicare system. Thank you Philips</li>
            <li> This is a great price for these replacement brush heads.  I have shopped locally and online.  This price coupled with no shipping charge and no tax cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Product should last 1.5 years at least now.</li>
            <li> Love my sonic toothbrush and it was time for some new brush heads.  These arrived and are so easy to install and get to working on keeping my teeth so so clean.  They come in a two pack so if you need to share, it is easy as they each have a different colored plastic insert to be able to tell them apart very easy.  Just a quick twist on and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> The brush heads arrived in perfect condition; and they are genuine Philips Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> great product that does the job of getting teeth in shape.</li>
            <li> The brush head looks worn out by mo.5 but it seems to   work</li>
            <li> one of the heads doesn&#x27;t work and now I have to go through all the trouble of packing it, shipping it and waiting for a refund before I take another chance and buy the replacement heads all over again. Meanwhile doing without my Sonicare while waiting for all of this to occur. Makes me want to just throw the whole thing in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great, how could they not be? They go with my awesome sonic toothbrush</li>
            <li> I think this brushhead does the job well in under 2 minutes. The instructions on the brush actually tell you to go more than two minutes for the top of the mollars. I recommend this brushhead to anyone switching from mannual to electric.    One thing. Make sure you charge it fully at least once every three days or you will notice the difference in the power of the tool</li>
            <li> Not sure what makes these different from what you&#x27;d buy at the store, but both broke in the first month of use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare Elite for three years. I am satisfied with its performance using the replacemant brush head. It is easy to clean your teeth efficiently.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! This product has no follow up service. I have a faulty and defective brush head which has caused mold to grown inside the unit. I contacted customer service and they told me to send in the Model Number and they would replace the unit and brush heads. When I replied to their email I received a non-delivery status, FOUR TIMES! When contacting customer service via telephone they stated they couldn&#x27;t replace anything because I didn&#x27;t have proof of purchase. I suppose owning the unit isn&#x27;t enough. Don&#x27;t expect anything from Sonicare if you have a problem. Buy your toothbrush from another manufacturer. When I finally contacted another representative she told me the email is sent out by a person who has no control and just returns emails and says whatever it is they want to say. Caveat Emptor!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these replacements because I plan on keeping this system for a long time.  Really feels nice on gums, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product because it&#x27;s simply a replacement for the original brush, but the brush design could have been better.  I enjoy using my sonicare, but don&#x27;t like how the inside of the brush head can get dirty easily.  And because the way it&#x27;s designed, it&#x27;s difficult to clean inside the brush head.</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommended. They have a battery operated SoniCare that works great too. It&#x27;s makes a huge difference when brushing your teeth!</li>
            <li> The rubber part is already cracking. Ive only used it for 2 months. The first set I had never tore like this one.</li>
            <li> Cost less that the local purchase stores.  Fit my Sonicare perfectly, last and will order again when I need more</li>
            <li> This is the genuine philips replacement brush. I bought another brush before which was supposed to fit into my philips sonicare tooth brush, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These heads easily run about $35 in retail stores. Signing up for subscription for this item is a good idea, especially with the discount. I only with that they had subscriptions that delivered in longer intervals, like once a year instead of once every 6 months.</li>
            <li> one broke after 2 weeks. phillips would not replace :( I got rid of the toothbrush after this...</li>
            <li> I got this Sonicare the Elite {E-Series} as a Christmas gift from my parents. My dentist told my mom this is what I need to help my teeth. I used it everyday.Now wondering what to do with it was a mystery. I referred my niece to my dentist and got in return a newer&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare I got a FlexCare + 900+series. Just for referring someone I care about. I ended up giving this Elite to my 2nd oldest sister.&lt;br /&gt;  It works just as new, just buy new replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;  My sister just has to get use to the vibrating sensation &amp; Inky her cat who looks for that sound.</li>
            <li> I have been using sonicare for five years after going thru a gum surgery. I was happy with Sonicare standard brush heads except for occasional gum irritation. By switching to E-Series two years ago, not only did the irritation go away, but also I enjoy less noisy brushing. I must say that I had to clean brush head buildups more frequently compare to E-Series.</li>
            <li> My family has been using the Sonicare toothbrush for several years and are quite happy with it.  From time to time we order refill brush heads.  The basic electrical part of the brush has held up very good.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see that the Sonicare brushes cost so much at the local pharmacy so I went online and ordered these at half the price.  They arrived quickly and were very well packaged.  The real deal.  I will definitely order online through Amazon again.  Kudos to the vendor, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect but a little pricey. They worked just as well as my first ones</li>
            <li> Great quality replacement heads that last a good long time and seem to clean very well.</li>
            <li> Ya can&#x27;t beat a Sonic Care toothbrush! These replacement heads are great and they last about three months before you need a new one. Good prices on Amazon for them compared to retail stores!</li>
            <li> with my new Sonicare brush heads my breath is fresh.  I can see the differance in my gums too.</li>
            <li> These heads work pretty well and are very strong.  When they&#x27;re charged completely they&#x27;re even stronger!</li>
            <li> Waterpik quit making their 3000 model electric tooth brush three years ago that required $5 to buy 4 brushes and it did a fairly adequate job. They quit making that great product in order to make more expensive models and charge over $10 for each brush to go on them. Where will we be in five years with this BS?    So much for my venting, Amazon is the cheapest place I can find Soniccare brushes.  I refuse to use a Waterpic model ever again!  I hope someone sees this and sends it to them.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I&#x27;ve had.  I hope it lasts a long time.  Does a great job oon your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush has made such a great difference in my dental care. Healthy gums equal a great, all-natural smile. And these replacement heads are great. I looked around in stores for them and found them at much higher prices. Amazon&#x27;s pricing was the best. Combining these with a couple other needed items and the shipping was free too! Amazon rocks.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.I&#x27;ve been using a sonicare for 8 years and they are the best. I work in the dental field and it doesn&#x27;t matter which model you use, they are all the same in my opinion.</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND ITEM!!! ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER DOESN&#x27;T LIST FOR REPLACEMENT. COULDN&#x27;T FIND ON E-BAY BUT FOUND ON AMAZON. THANKS!!! FAST SHIPPING ALSO!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These work well. Be sure to get the OEM ones like these. The cheap stuff didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> The brush that keeps on cleaning!</li>
            <li> absolutely no problem fitting my sonic</li>
            <li> You get two, which could last up to a year.  Not bad, the price is right, I&#x27;ve seen these at membership stores for $17.00.  You&#x27;ll need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra cleaning, dip your loaded toothbrush into a cup of baking soda, it&#x27;s a gentle abrasive and aids in bringing the teeth up.  Sure makes the teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a 50 year mouth (like mine) and have taken coffee and tea for many moons, a professional whitening may be in order but I&#x27;m not laying out a grand for the procedure.  I&#x27;m into the hygeine aspect of sonic care, and sonic care really does take care of teeth and gums.  Gums are often over brushed and wear down or neglected altogether, so remember...Sonic care for health, and looks.  But there is a point in life when you either accept the aging and yellow hue or shell out some cash for a cosmetic cleaning procedure.</li>
            <li> I ordered my item expecting it to take 5 days to receive. But to my surprise, it arrived 2 days later. I was very impressed with the speed of shipping. Plus it was the same prices, if cheaper, than going to the store. Nice not to have to wait in line in some discount store forever.</li>
            <li> As described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are great. They last a long time, near 6 months each. They do a very nice job on my teeth. Amazon has a good price on them. It is cheaper than any place I have seen retail. If you need replacement brushes save some money and get them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for years and I love how my teeth feel after brushing. My dentist even notices the difference.</li>
            <li> Good.They do have a slightly bigger gap between the base than the original brush that came with.I wonder if the product changed a tad? Maybe not,and its only a mm or 2.Excellent value and since my first head wore out quickly,Im pleased to have two.I should have tried the mini brushes just for comparison,but then again,these were on sale,cheaper and I can already attest to the quality without wondering.  Love my brush and glad to have nice,fresh,stiff bristles again.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy if you go and check the market place.  I am recieving this on an auto buy system.  Every 3 months.  Reminds me and it was a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the non-name-brand brush heads, and they just don&#x27;t work as well. These Philips brush heads vibrate better, perhaps because they fit more securely on the handle. The non-name-brand ones also fell apart! I&#x27;ll be sticking with these Philips-branded heads from now on!</li>
            <li> I got this for christmas as a gift and this toothbrush is great. At first it feels weird in my mouth and even tickles some but I have been using it for about a week now and my teeth are brighter and feel clean all the time.</li>
            <li> When I brush with a regular toothbrush I push to hard and it wears on my gums. It also does not clean my teeth along the gum line. The Sonicare with its ultrasonic cleaning action cleans most fully, with out damage to my gums. Oral hygiene is very important to me and this is the best product ive found. Only issues is this model gets moldy where the head attaches to the battery unit, its gross and requires daily cleaning.I imagine the newer model with the new heads cures this problem.  Other is the price, a normal toothbrush is $1, but these are about $10 a piece.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have owned the Brush for several years. No problems with unit. Replacement brushes are good for more than 3 months. Use to be 6 months. No change in production. Just have to satisfy government regulations.</li>
            <li> This last order was such a dissapointment. Both heads started to shred and have long unfolding strands start popping out within the first few uses. Already worn down after three weeks. Not a all like the old, better quality in the past.</li>
            <li> Good price, and work great.  I still have an old model sonicare, and these fit it.  I will never go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the sonicare system is superior.  Similar systems, by other brands, do not clean and stimulate the gums as well.  My dentist recommended sonicare to me, and in turn I recommend this product to anyone considering an electronic toothbrush system.</li>
            <li> I NEVER USED SONICAR PRODUCTS BEFORE THIS ONE I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BRUSHING WITH A REG TOOTHBRUSH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare E Series for over a year now and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, long lasting electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Amazon no longer provides the best available price on the market for two replacement toothbrush heads for the Elite series of Sonicare electric toothbrush. A refill makes the toothbrush run like new. But you can get refills much cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrush helps me to keep gum disease at bay. The fact that it is timed helps greatly to assure I brush the required time suggested. The sonicare is a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for 2 Sonicare Elite replacement heads!  I will be back to buy more when I need them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Sonicare product and purchasing the replacement brushes at Amazon was a great deal! These brush heads are long lasting and the whole brushing system is wonderful. Amazon is great to have them at such a great price!</li>
            <li> These are not legitimate.  These brushes are cut down to almost nothing.  Buyer beware.  Sent back immediately.</li>
            <li> After opening the packaging, I discovered the writing along the neck of the brush didn&#x27;t say e-Series like the picture had shown so I was a little worried it wasn&#x27;t the right replacement head. However, it did end up being the right replacement part. The first time using it I thought it was a little louder than my original brush head but the second and third time using it I changed my mind and thought it was on par with the original. It does a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Great product.  Will order again in 6-7 months.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I was given a Sonicare toothbrush and needed replacements.  These were on sale and a great deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to replace those sonicare brushes so that you keep your teeth clean. Ordering through Amazon makes this a convenient process.</li>
            <li> Once you have one, it is hard to do without the Sonicare toothbrush. Replace the head once every 6 months and your gums and teeth will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the Amazon price on these replacement heads varies a lot, I paid $21 a month ago, and now they are up to almost $30. Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite toothbrush is the best one I have ever used.  It really gets your teeth clean and your gums get a workout too.  It is highly recommended by my dentist too.</li>
            <li> Easy way to get replacement brushes for Sonicare, keeps it working at  &lt;br /&gt;like new level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing with an older Sonicare for many years, and just had an excellent dental check up after two years.  This newer model is lighter, smaller, fits in the mouth better, and uses less toothpaste.  I believe it also features a more efficient up and down brushing motion.  I gave my old one away after many years of use, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I expect this one to last as long, which makes it a great bargain over the years, since regular use will cut down on my dental bills!</li>
            <li> They are perfect, just wish they were a little harder and lasted a little longer....Still a great product for a great product.</li>
            <li> Replacement head worked fine.  Delivery was timely, with a good price  through Amazon</li>
            <li> The Sonicare electric tootbrush and the brush heads are a great product. It is amazing that Sonicare has a brush head that last six months and not three or less. I originally bought this electric toothbrush through Amazon.com thanks to the many reviews by those who own it. I only wish that a well known consumer magazine would consider reviewing electric toothbrushs, but they refuse even though they have been available for many years. My dentist recently advised me to use an electric toothbrush and I stated that I do. This is an important product for many health reasons to numerous to delve into here. The reason I gave this product four stars instead of five was the packaging. How are you supposed to get the brushes out of the hard plastic that surrounds them. They give no instructions on what is the best way. I tried scissors, no luck. I tried a box opener again with out much luck. I finally lost my temper after about 20 minutes and started jabbing away with the box opener. I finally was able to get to the brushes, although they were knicked by by blade on the box cutter, it does not seem to effect their service. But, I cut myself badly, not on the scissors or the box cutters, but on the thick sharp plastic. It took awhile to stop the bleeding. I just wonder with so many people using this product, how many of them ended up in the ER? For older folks are those with arthritis, this must be a nightmare. I beg you Sonicare, please change your packaging.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love these brush heads.  They retain their shape as long as you use the plastic cover, and they work very well.  I find that they last for about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are more expensive but compared to paying your dentist for cleaning and cavities, they are way cheap. They give a thorough cleaning which pays when I go to the dentist. My dentist praises my teeth now that I&#x27;ve been using this system for several years. My gums and teeth are cleaner, brighter, and cavity-free.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I already own a Sonicare, the replacement brushes were exactly what I expected.  The speed with thich they arrived was exceptional, though. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these replacement brush heads.  They fit my unit perfectly.  Shipping was free and received shipment promptly.</li>
            <li> We checked with our dentist who sold us the SonicCare Toothbrush and she could not compete with the low price on Amazon for this fine product.  We like the idea of being notified every six months of needing to replace the heads and if we do not cancel our subscription, Amazon automatically sends us new heads.  Also, with free delivery!  You can&#x27;t beat it!! Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads for my Sonicare Elite toothbrush (bought at Costco) work well.  But please note, there are at least two types -- standard (this product) and compact.  The compact version has a smaller head as you would expect.    Also, the price is right and free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime is a great deal.</li>
            <li> right item, quick delivery, and a satisfied wife.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Sonicare brushes for years and they have made a huge improvement in the health of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I can not imagine living without my Sonicare toothbrush. My teeth and gums are much healthier. The cost vs. results does make the system worth it to me.  But the replacement brush heads are little expensive since they do not last more than three months maximum.  But the alternative is manual toothbrushes and more cavities.  Purchasing them online is cheaper than Wallymart.</li>
            <li> Nice that replacements still being made for my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. It has worked and is good as anything I&#x27;ve purchased at retail. I like the price too. Much better than retail. I will reorder future refills.</li>
            <li> Great turnaround from Amazon on these brushes.  Beats driving to the local discount store.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to replace the heads on my Sonicare brush. You only gots one set of tooths….so take care of &#x27;em…..</li>
            <li> Great brusheads at a nice price!</li>
            <li> These are the best brushing heads for Sonicare. Theyy seem to last longer than oters we have purchased.</li>
            <li> These brusheads fit perfectly on my Sonicare toothbrush and come with a plastic cap to put over the bristles when you&#x27;re not using them. I like this feature because it makes it easier/cleaner for travel, etc. I would definitley buy this product again.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are good, work like a charm. Everytime I purchase a replacement, I am reminded that I should be doing so more frequently....go ahead and make the purchase, you will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Our dentist credits my consistently good check-ups to the Sonicare. We have had our original charger for years and order replacement brushes every three months as recommended. A little pricey up front but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Fits my toothbrush just like the new one&#x27;s do but at  a much better price</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I wanted in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> They work well, but the Amazon add is misleading. As the picture indicates two heads with brushes but what you get is 1 head and an extra brush.</li>
            <li> These were in terrible shape, so much so that I wondered if it was some kind of scam to sell defective items.</li>
            <li> Am returning.  The brushes arrived defective, most of the brush part was missing.  Usually don&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> I always feel I&#x27;m getting a great value when I order these brush heads.  Being on Subscribe &amp; Save, I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about not having a back up.</li>
            <li> The design of the brush leads to a lot of gunk build up and a constant need to take the head off and scrub the inside. I got a new Sonicare toothbrush [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizer]] and the design is much better.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the original brush.  Her dentist is pleased with her reduced plaque.  We missed buying a set of 4 at Costco when they were on sale.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes are the greatest, but heads need to be replaced every 3 months. This is a great place to buy them!</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare toothbrush well worth using. This &#x27;two-pack&#x27; brush head is a good value, plus the automatic delivery every six months prompts the replacement of the in-use brush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Elite for a couple of years and am totally satisfied with the toothbrush. It was recommended by my dentist and I&#x27;ve found it to be very easy to use and care for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Surprise, my eye surgeon recommended the Sonicare and instead of my dentist. I have arthritis in my hands and brushing my teeth with a manual brush was getting to be a chore. Now I have cleaner teeth and my hands get a rest.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are an amazing value- everytime I go to the dentist(only annually) they tell me how great a job Taking care of my teeth. All I do is brush my teeth twice daily, and floss once. That&#x27;s all you need! Don&#x27;t waste your money on silly whitening products and mouthwash- these brushes pay for themselves in a few months!</li>
            <li> Fit my old sonicare base perfectly</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned this system for a number of years now. While the brush heads seem to work fine, we just replaced them,  the body of the brush which is subject to rotation so that the head and the battery commpartment are not always lined up making it slightly more difficult to opperate the brush.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. The savings on this was remarkable. I will continue to use Amazon for further purchases.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of the sonicare, this is the best place I&#x27;ve found to buy the replacement heads. I replaced the heads for hygienic reasons, but it also solved the harsh vibrating noise my toothbrush was making. I found these heads last longer than standard toothbrushes too. They are what they say they are and come in the original branded packaging.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads were to replace the original ones from the old style Sonicare toothbrush.  These are much easier to keep clean and seem to do a better job of cleaning my teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but these brush heads are very loud no matter how tight I screw them on.</li>
            <li> Have been using the sonicare for 4 years and love it. Experimented with the compact brush heads but like the comfort/performance of the standard brush heads. Wonderful way to keep your teeth and gums healthy!</li>
            <li> Best price around.  Delivery can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly works very good</li>
            <li> It was quickly delivered and exactly as expected</li>
            <li> Item shipped on time but was defective. Bristle on the brush head were all hacked off. Returned for a new one and same result. Will NOT be transacting with this seller again. These looked like rejects from quality control. Absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> What I expected from Sonicare, an excellent replacement part. I have used generic clones in the past and was happy with the low price but terribly disappointed in the performance. Not worth the savings!</li>
            <li> Fakes. No Philips logo and the bristles aren&#x27;t shaped correctly.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they arrived on time in perfect condition.  Item was as described and fit my toothbrush.  Neither replacement head appeared to be used (just kidding).  Good price and quick service!</li>
            <li> My parents have used the Sonicare toothbrush for YEARS and they have loved it. When my dentist recommended it to me I decided to get one through Amazon and I am very pleased with the product. Makes my mouth feel great and my gums are healing nicely.</li>
            <li> To all those who complain about the cost:  do the math.  If you buy here, the Phillips replacement head is about $10.  (buy bulk and save the shipping).  If you used a regular toothbrush (good quality), you&#x27;d probably pay about $3.50 for one you can use for 2-3 months.  These heads can be used for 5-6 months.  So you&#x27;re looking at $7.00 versus $10.00 for the same period of time a difference of $3.00 per six months.  Do you really not believe improved dental health and appearance is worth $6.00 per year??? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have had several other styles of electric toothbrushes and this is by far the best of them all. My dentist recommended that I use this brush to improve my receeding gums. In just 2 months I was able to improve the health of my gum tissue and teeth in general. This toothbrush has saved me from having to have expensive and very painful gum surgery. I actually look forward to brushing because my teeth feel so clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Bristles hold their shape for months. The plastic vent cap is a great idea, it protects the brush heads and allows them to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> my sonicare toothbrush is great! my only complaint is the expensive replacement heads...i compared prices all over town and on the net and amazon beats the lowest deal at walmart. i believe it is money well spent now that i have healthy gums and a dazzling smile!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used other electric brushes and this one pales in comparison.   the heads wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite series is a very good quality tooth brush and the heads wear well, and does a good job of cleaning ones teeth. Better than the Oral B tooth brush, which I also own.</li>
            <li> Never used an electric toothbrush, so I hated to spend the $100+ on this product.  Problem solved--it was my Xmas present.  First time I used it, I was shocked at the powerful motor and rpms, and LOVED the professionally cleaned feeling my teeth had.  A couple of months earlier, my hygienist told me that if my gums didn&#x27;t improve, i&#x27;d have to see to a specialist. This time she said my mouth was beautiful.  No gum-guy for me.  She aslo remarked that she always sees an improvement in folks who switch to an electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;ll not go back to manual.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I&#x27;m so glad I listened to my daughter.  My mouth has never felt this clean, even after the dentist&#x27;s office!  Highly recommend these to anyone with teeth!</li>
            <li> very good the item was sent internationally</li>
            <li> Sonicare Elite is a great toothbrush and these replacement heads are a great deal!</li>
            <li> Get the subscription so you don&#x27;t have to think about replacing the brush heads anymore.  It has simplified my life in a small respect plus saves me money.  I have a Sonicare toothbrush at home and at the office.  I use 2 brush heads every 3 months.  I don&#x27;t have to search the internet to find the best price anymore.  I found the best price after extensive searching once and am subscribing now for every 3 mos delivery at that \\&quot;best price.\\&quot;  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the quality that I would expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it vibrates roughly with my older model sonicare as the original brush heads are no longer sold.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase and it arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> These particular brush heads look exactly like the previous hundreds of brush heads we&#x27;ve used over the course of many years, but something isn&#x27;t quite the same.  When brushing, the brush makes a loud chattering noise, like the foot of the brush head isn&#x27;t quite touching the sonic vibrating part.  This also results in a lower quality outcome (teeth aren&#x27;t as clean).  Not sure what happened with these, but something is wrong.</li>
            <li> Cleans like the first time you used it, the old ones don&#x27;t compare. Don&#x27;t listen to these people badmouthing these brush heads.</li>
            <li> This has been my first trial of this new style for my Elite Toothbrush and I am very happy to notice that I really like it!  I have a very low gag reflex and the old style always made me gag when I worked the back of my mouth.  This new style is smaller and much better for me in my entire mouth.  I am impressed and very pleased!  I will get more!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure these would fit my 4 year old handle because when I zoomed in on the product picture, it looked fairly different than the one that I currently have. Sure enough, it is different but it still fits perfectly and the smaller head seems to be far more effective than the one that came with it.    If you have a doubt like mine, fear not!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to know that this replacement brush head fit my older style sonicare, It actually works better then the original</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare tooth brush so of course I need to purchase replacement brushes. However, think these are overpriced. Just like razor blades. They hook you on the product and then make high profits on the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I wish the brush heads were a little larger, but they do the job and I love Sonicare toothbrush.  Super helpful customer service at Sonicare to find the right size brush head for my outdated base unit.</li>
            <li> I got hooked and keep buying these items recommended by my dental hygienist. Save a lot of money from going to dentist and amazon got the best deal.</li>
            <li> one of those things where OEM works best,  tried the Target brand, they vibrated awful and made huge amounts of noise,these were like silk after I wore out the target ones.  Sometimes you do get what you pay for.  Hygenist always raves about how clean my teeth are after I switched to these from Oral B. That worked well but not like these.</li>
            <li> It would be a better product if the white rubbery boot did not split open near where the brush head passes through. So far it has done this on each of the brush heads that I have used.</li>
            <li> best product - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the generic product. . . .</li>
            <li> This is a sad day because I was a Sonicare fan.  I recommended it to my patients who needed the extra care and really talked it up because it does help but I just recently went to a continuing education seminar on homecare devices and found my beloved Sonicare was not the one that did the best job according to the research.  The research was done by independent folks, was funded independently and was carried out such that the results could be taken seriously (valid results).  It was done over a long period of time (over years, not weeks) and on very large groups of people.  There were other researchers who compared all the research that has been done with rigorous standards to see what their results were too. In all the research presented, they compared all the electric toothbrushes that were out there and Sonicare did not fare as well as the top of the line Oral B (sorry folks, the most expensive model).  The research said that the combination of sonic and rotary action over time (within a month or two of use) demonstrated a greater effect on reduction of plaque and gingivitis scores (the plaque and gingivitis levels were lower for the sonic rotary devices (Oral B) compared to the sonic cradle-rock devices (Sonicare)).  I you are on a budget, it is still acceptable to use the battery operated toothbrushes as long as you can change the head, the head spins around and you can either recharge or replace the batteries.  The sonic action is the greatest in the Oral B top of the line model and that is what helps reduce tartar and staining.  It is worth making the switch.  I&#x27;m sorry if I burst any bubbles but mine was burst a couple of months ago and the findings were significant enough to spread the news.</li>
            <li> they worked, but these replacement heads are VERY LOUD compared to the original heads.  I&#x27;ve had a dental cleaning since using these replacements and they seem to be working just as fine, just very loud...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Used regularly it really helped me getting and mainting healthy gums and prevent tartar build up. I love it.</li>
            <li> Its dependable and works very well.  It does wear out rather quickly and gets much softer in about a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Spend $22.50 a year and save $10,000? How does that work? Well, a couple of my close relatives have spent well over $10,000 each having their teeth and gums repaired. If you&#x27;ve had periodontal work or had root canal, implants, crowns or bridges done, you know that figure is not an exaggeration, and you&#x27;re lucky if your insurance covers even a little bit of it. Having seen my relatives go through that, I&#x27;ve decided that as I get older, I want to spend my money on vacations and real estate, and not on painful dental procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why the Sonicare is the most frugal product I&#x27;ve bought. I too have had some costly dental work, and I&#x27;m determined to keep my fixed-up choppers in tip-top condition. This toothbrush is amazing. One thing very few people note about the Sonicare is that it not only cleans your teeth beautifully, it also keeps your gums in great shape, and that may be even more valuable. Here&#x27;s the best testimonial to the Sonicare: I recently had braces for a few years. I mentioned to my orthodontist that I&#x27;d graduated from high school in 1983, and she said, \\&quot;You&#x27;re not that old.\\&quot; \\&quot;Yes, I&#x27;m 40,\\&quot; I said. She actually checked my chart! \\&quot;Well, your teeth and gums look like they belong to someone in their 20s!\\&quot; she concluded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please invest wisely and don&#x27;t skimp on dental care. I&#x27;ve had other electric toothbrushes (Oral B) and tried every kind of tooth cleaning brush, powder, and gimmick you can imagine. This is the one I&#x27;ve used for the last 5 years (I used the earlier Sonicare model for about 5 years before that), and this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with. My annual checkups confirm I&#x27;ve been making the right choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally (inci \\&quot;dental\\&quot; ly?), Amazon&#x27;s price on these heads is excellent -- much cheaper than my local pharmacies. A two-pack will last a year, since these heads wear out like clockwork at about 6 months. That works out to a little over $1.85 a month. Heck, you could spend that on regular toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> As usual, Sonicare is always a great purchage.  These toothbrush heads work perfectly with my sonicare elite base.</li>
            <li> Great price, always buy name brand, not some no-name brand.</li>
            <li> They work but wear our a little to fast. Cheaper on Amazon than at your local drug store, but you knew that.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason my elite is about 20% more powerful with the replacement brush head. Maybe magnet is stronger. I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Easy purchase. Arrived in just a few days. Love the Sonicare, it actually improved the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> Recently I have a lot of dental work done that included veneers, caps and a bridge.  My dentist recommended the Sonicare and I bought it immediately.  I needed replacement brushes so I bought these.  They were perfect!  I love the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Of course you have to have the Sonicare to begin with, it&#x27;s amazing! My dental hygenist highly recommend Sonicare, and I have not had any teeth problems since purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I got a really good deal on these Sonicare repplacement heads.  The price I paid was less than I have ever seen them anywhere!  Go Amazon!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends sonicare and I get my replacement heads at Amazon because it is cheaper than in the stores.  The brush is great and Amazon is always easy to deal with</li>
            <li> Sonic care is a great product that truly improves oral health and helps me to maintain a healthy mouth</li>
            <li> The product needs a new design as the gunk gets into the grooves of the screw of the thread of the brush handle and inside. Poor design and still not possible to change recharge battery by consumer.</li>
            <li> I like using the Sonicare products so when it was time for new brush heads, I ordered online, rather then having to drive all over Tucson to try to find a set for the unit I have. They arrived in good condition in the time promised, nothing special to say, if you need replacement heads and don&#x27;t like spending your weekends hunting them down at a good price, the internet&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
            <li> Of course you need to change the tooth brush head every few months.  These are expensive compared to a regular tooth brush, but what are you going to do.  This replacement brush heads work well, and I can certainly tell the difference in the cleaning ability from these new brush heads to the old brush heads that they replaced.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  Exactly what I ordered and they came in a very quick time frame.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare delete brush. Got it several years ago and have my self on one of the Amazon subscritions to save 15% and get them mailed to me every few months. Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Quality mdse and promt service and the repurchase plan was to my liking for the options.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are excellent and come highly recommended by dentists.  I have been using one for some time.  It is very helpful to be able to obtain the replacement brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> NO PRODUCT LINK. I HAVE USED SONICARE FOR YEARS AND THE PRODUCT HOLDS UP AND IS VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY!!</li>
            <li> In regards to the Sonicare, it is an excellent product.  Even after I had only used it a few times my husband and I both noticed my teeth were whiter and brighter.  After I use it I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist.  In fact when I first got it I kept brushing my teeth over and over all day.    The brush-heads themselves were well-received.  But I haven&#x27;t used them yet, saving them for later.</li>
            <li> This product works great. The action of the brush totally cleans my teeth and leaves them feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth... between them...and massaged of gums!</li>
            <li> They work fine.  My dental appointments for the last 3 years have been outstanding and I owe it all to my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> They work, but are costly at $10 each every 3 months, or $40 a year.  I also do not like having to replace heads every 3 months.  However, I have not found a less-costly and equally effect product, yet, beyond using an ordinary non-mechanical tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These work great, but wear out fairly quickly and are expensive to replace. They&#x27;re also tough to clean- after just a week or two of regular use, black sludge starts to build up inside of them, especially in the threads of the collar. You can wipe some of it off, but for the most part you just have to pretend that you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there. Blech. I recommend removing the brush head after every use so it dries thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I deducted one star because the quality control seems poor. Other reviewers have claimed they received knockoffs- I don&#x27;t if that&#x27;s the case, or if there are just duds. One brush head I received seemed outright broken- the head flopped from side to side and barely vibrated. The other was so stiff that it was too noisy and painful to use. I know that neither of these are normal, since the original brush heads worked fine, and the replacements I received in the \\&quot;frustration-free packaging\\&quot; version also seemed fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sonicare system for about 12 years now and absolutely love the results. Easy to use and Better than any other elec tootbrush</li>
            <li> If I could zero stars I would.  The brushes were defective and I had to return the product.  One of the 2 heads had the plastic wrapper opened, the other one was sealed.  I don&#x27;t want to mess around with a replacement - don&#x27;t want to take a chance it will be defective too.  I&#x27;ll be driving to Target tomorrow to get toothbrush head that is not defective.  I specifically bought the Philips brand to not have problems.  So much for trusting Philips products.</li>
            <li> These sonic toothbrushes work best when they are new.  They give a good cleaning while removing plaque buildup and also massage your gums which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Initially happy that these were correct fit for my Sonicare, unlike the generics I bought with a Groupon. However, the bristles wore out after 3 weeks. The originals I have bought from Sonicare in the past lasted a lot longer. I purchased these as I couldn&#x27;t find them in retail stores anymore, but disappointed. I may have to buy a whole new electric toothbrush system</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this toothbrush and so far I am very satisfied.  My husband and I both see a real difference in the way our teeth look and feel.  As far as peoples&#x27; complaints about the cost of the replacement heads - $10 buys a brush head that lasts for 6 months, while you have to replace regular toothbrushes every 3 months, and some of those cost $5 each, so it works out to about the same.  The initial cost of the unit is high, but over the life of the product the benefits are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush keeps my mouth clean and is also easy to clean. No hidden grooves to accumulate muck. Only wish the heads were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> service perfect; product my choice; price was right; representative helped with the technical stuff and did it well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. The last pack was inferior and rattled when the power was on. My guess is that suppliers changed.&lt;br /&gt;This pack is exactly what it should be. No rattling and strong brushing.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  Will continue to purchase for my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Title says it.  These are more expensive than generic, but I think they&#x27;re worth it.  The bristles last longer, and the heads seem to brush a lot more aggressively than the generic ones I tried.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads worked perfectly...just like the originals.  Now I have clean, white teeth again!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest, I&#x27;ve used the same head for over a year now.  Replacing the heads makes a big difference in performance and feel--it&#x27;s like having a completely new Sonicare system!</li>
            <li> Brand new in package, great price and received with in days.</li>
            <li> These two babies work perfectly with our Sonicare, and they have extended the useful life of the machine indeffinately.  An excellent value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a sonicare brush head look like this.  Philips sonicare needs to pay closer attention to their products on the line! I knew something was wrong when it felt like the brush was jackhammering my teeth! will be asking for a refund for sure.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads arrived quickly and were priced much more favorably than any retail store in our town. The Sonicare is a great toothbrush, but it is advisable to replace the brush heads about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say about a toothbrush head?  Love the product compared to a regular toothbrush. Great results according to my dentist. Whoever thought of making this a subscription item ought to be commended. I never remember when I changed brushes and it should be replaced every six months.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty finding replacement brushes in stores, so I check Amazon to see if I could find them online.  I was very happy to find them and they arrived in a timely manner.  They are exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the original.  Exactly what I was looking for at half the store price.  My gums are tingling.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads I purchased were exactly what I needed.  They were the right size and will last me for the next 12 months.  Both heads were in very good condition when they arrived to me (no damage in shipping).  Good Product for a Good Price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have new brush heads...I just wish I could remember to replace them every 6 months.</li>
            <li> The product works well and I am happy with the results  I get using these replacements. However, this product is less expensive at Costco.</li>
            <li> Bought for my hubby.  He does not like the brushes.  They are hard and non-giving.  Would not purchase again.  Looking to replace</li>
            <li> We have had our original Philips Sonicare Elite system for over 6 years. They&#x27;re still going strong, and that&#x27;s of course thanks to routine replacement of the heads. Of course, it gets a little funky in there after 3 months of drool sliding down past the o-ring... I usually use the head I&#x27;m replacing to brush out the little mold shotglass that these fit into--it&#x27;s gross, and I wouldn&#x27;t ask my wife to do it (I do hers as well as mine). But I feel better for nuking that little farm of god-knows-what every season...</li>
            <li> These heads do a good job of cleaning, but they wear out much faster than the previous straight head design.  The older style heads lasted about 6 months, the new rippled ones only 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best prices that I could find for this product.  Plus the shipping was free!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008BFXL Philips Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]  Great way to buy and money savings</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this product, which I received as a gift. I was a bit skeptical about an \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; thinking it was merely a gimmick for people too lazy to even exert any effort to brush their teeth. It took a few days to get used to the tingling vibrations when using the brush, and I quickly learned to not remove the toothbrush from my mouth while it was turned on (toothpaste splattered all over bathroom mirror, etc). This toothbrush is easy to use and does an excellent job. I have noticed an increase in the whiteness of my teeth. I have taken it with me on trips of up to a week without the charger and have had no problem with it dying on me. At home, I just put it in the charger base after using and it is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> The brush heads clean great but do not last as long as stated 6 months.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is the only way to clean up my teeth.  I used a manual tooth brush for a few days until my new Sonicare came.  No contest.   I use the Sonicare with the timer.  I brush a quarter of my teeth with each cycle.  I wind up feeling like the teeth are almost as clean as when I go into the dentist for my six month cleaning.  Combining flossing and the Sonicare is a daily, before going to bed, event for me</li>
            <li> These are replacements, so not really worth rating the product. But shipping was rather quick, since I needed to replace rather quickly.</li>
            <li> great Replacement heads . Use them all the time.</li>
            <li> We love our Sonicare toothbrushes. We have had ours for more than 6 years. My husband had a problem with plaque build up and needed to have his teeth cleaned 4 times a year. 2 of those were not covered by our insurance as they only cover twice a year.  Since purchasing the Sonicare electric toothbrush he now only needs to go in twice a year as recommended by most dentists.  I purchased these for all 9 of our children and grandchildren for Christmas a couple years ago. We did receive one defective handle but it was replaced with no questions asked and have had no issues since.  My grandson who recently got braces was told by his orthodontist that there is nothing better out there. Just replace the heads as recommended. I always keep a spare set on hand and when I change to the back up set I immediately order a new set. Obviously the handle and charger last a long time too.</li>
            <li> worst design change.  Heads are compact and very stiff.  Perfect for removing old varnish from furniture or the enamel from your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge step backward from the old design.  Or these are simply defective.</li>
            <li> Quality product; timely delivery; I recommend.</li>
            <li> The local Wal-Mart did not carry the replacement toothbrush head (no surprise) so I went to a reliable source www.amazon.com and had the product in a couple days.  I really like the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my toothbrush.  A quality product at a fair price.  Makes brushing fun again!!</li>
            <li> I talked to Philips Sonicare today.  The product I received is the compact model, not the standard.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and am glad the heads are still easy to find. Good oral hygiene is also good heart health.</li>
            <li> One of the worst purchases I have ever made.  Received a pair of these inside a box marked with the Philips name on it.  The bristles looked like they had been cut in half - as others have stated in their reviews.  I doubt very much that these came from Philips.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work well with the Sonicare base.  Have always had good checkups with the dentist after using them.  Hope Amazon continues to carry them at a reasonable price, as they are a good investment in future dental health.</li>
            <li> these heads fit perfectly and were sold at a great price. I recommend this seller to anyone who needs new toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> I started using Philips Sonicare on the behest of my dentist and oral hygienist. I purchased the cheaper model to start with just because I couldn&#x27;t afford the more expensive elite. My wife started directly with the Elite, and it was her prompting that moved me to upgrade. I have never disliked that decision.&lt;br /&gt;I find the Elite the best of the two models available. It&#x27;s curved head and speed have made my hygienist sing my praises for teeth that are plague free. My dentist believes that not only did the Elite model improve my oral care but that the decrease for the need for filings was the best (I agree since I don&#x27;t particularly care to have my face drilled on too often).&lt;br /&gt;The cost of the Elite replacement brushes is minimal and the brushes last for quite some time if one does not use them to provide the conventional kind of brushing that is not needed with this battery charged tooth brush.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Sonic base very well and are a better price than I can buy locally.  Have bought this item many times.</li>
            <li> product is good. shipped quickly. the only thing that bothered me is that before, the brushes needed to be changed every 6 months. now the label says to change it every 3 months.... i just think they&#x27;re trying to make money, but who isn&#x27;t. besides that, like the brushes</li>
            <li> Wow, I have had this product for a year and I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had procrastinated this long from my dentists recommendation.  This year I purchased two for my grown children and they love it.  It feels as though you have just returned from the dentist.  The charge lasts up to 2 weeks and it goes with me everywhere when we travel.  I highly recommend this product. These are the replacement brush heads for the Essence recharge toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I looked at local stores for months to find the larger size head for my Sonicare. No other brush keeps me from needing my dentist. Amazon had the correct brush here in days.</li>
            <li> Very good product although a little expensive. When I go to the dentist for a cleaning the dental hygienist always comments on the good job I do at cleaning my teeth since I am using this product... I would have liked to have the option of buying two different size head brush in the same pack.  I also find the Sonicare base a little difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> A great product.  So convenient to get the replacement heads from amazon. Thank you for making it so easy for me to keep my teeth so very clean!</li>
            <li> Purchased these thinking I&#x27;d found a great deal. Not  Didn&#x27;t fit correctly. Kept shutting off and on. Vibration was not strong. Not a happy camper.  Returning to amazon for full refund. Ended up going to Costco where you can buy 6 heads for $50.  AND sometimes Costco offers a  a $10 off coupon for these heads. They had a great stock of these.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the best place to buy these replacement parts.  Ive had my Sonicare for awhile and all it ever needs is the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I had one of these heads on my toothbrush so long the magnets unglued themselves, so I needed a new set.  Reasonable price and easy to install.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Philips Sonicare for several years now. I like it so well, I purchased one for each of my sons because, after all the years of emphasizing the importance of a clean, healthy mouth, how could I NOT have bought them?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried store-brand heads that fit the Sonicare, but they didn&#x27;t function as well. I&#x27;d rather pay the slightly higher price and have exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Arrived quickly.  Genuine Sonicare heads as promised!  :)  I&#x27;ve loved the Sonicare for years!  It&#x27;s very difficult to find heads to fit this model anymore.  So when I found these, I was Happy Happy Happy!</li>
            <li> When I received these brush heads, both of them had clearly been cut off. The bristles were only half the length they should be, uneven, and frayed. So frustrating and a total waste of time and money. Next time I&#x27;ll just spend a little more and take a trip to CVS.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and fit/work perfect with my Elite.</li>
            <li> Does well for keeping teeth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> These are the same refills without the heavy packaging. It saves some money &amp; you don&#x27;t need heavy equipment to get them out!</li>
            <li> My Dentist told me to use this.  I have never had a cavity in my 40 year life, and I got a small one after using this brush for 6 months. I am certain there is a great reason to brush your teeth for 2 minutes, so I still use it. Juust make sure you aren&#x27;t missing a spot and get into a thorough routine rotating the undulatiing round brush throughout your mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product at a fair price.[[ASIN:B00008BFXL Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]</li>
            <li> When I changed my old brush head for a new one, it was like getting a whole new toothbrush...not only were the bristles themselves better, but the whole unit performed as if brand new!!</li>
            <li> After starting using the Sonocare toothbrush my dentist always complement my teeth when I come in for my semi-anual cleaning.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B00008BFXL Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]], or brush head, are simply the best tooth-care product. They clean beneath the gums, in the cracks, the surface, while gently polishing (or sonically vibrate) your teeth clean. Takes a while to get used to, about two weeks, but by then your mouth will feel cleaner then it ever has after using this product. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush head to replace the old one. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare series for 4 years. It&#x27;s a revolutional product. The way it operates help to clean up the tooth, but also keeps the right way to brush. With traditional toothbrush, I always did it too heavily so that my tooth suffered. With this, I don&#x27;t have any problem now!</li>
            <li> The brush heads are just what I expected from Phillips.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush. It does the job better than a regular tooth brush. You have to get used to the vibration. It tickles at first but that goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that I now use the Sonicare toothbrush.  It does help me keep my smile clean.  I have dry mouth due to the medications I take, so using the Sonicare toothbrush makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing my teeth a favor than just a regular toothbrush.  It came highly recommended by my dental hygeinist.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Elite is the best product to prevent gum disease.  I&#x27;ve been using for 10 years and every visit to the dentist supports  that this products is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, Sonicare electric toothbrushes and their replacement heads do cost money.  It&#x27;s money very much well spent.  My gums no longer get sore from recession from vigorous tooth brushing.  I used to brush over vigorously with soft bristle manual toothbrushes and it wore at my gum line.  Now I use the Sonicare Essence and no longer have that problem.  Not only that, but my teeth feel cleaner than they ever did using a manual toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t have ANY cavities either (27 years old) - been using since I was a teen.  So I only have to go to the dentist for prophalaxis (cleanings) and checkups/X-rays.  So basically, the money you spend on prevention saves you the money you would have spent on imperfect fixes to oral health problems.  What&#x27;s more \\&quot;painful\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this type of brush for my teeth due to some problems that I was having and it has helped me tremendously.  I love the way it has helped clean my teeth and help get rid of my tarter.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes the best electronic toothbrush. 75% of that is the brush. If you let the brush do the work, and don&#x27;t press too hard, each brush will last 6 months, just in time for your dentist to really take you to the cleaners. Expensive? Not really. $25 a year for brushes isn&#x27;t that much when you consider how much you&#x27;ll save on a periodontist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admitted, I&#x27;ve seen the brush go up in price twice in two years, so now I buy six at a time if I find them on \\&quot;sale.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for any years and am pleased with the results (though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time) My gripe is that they couldn&#x27;t figure out that the brush head is not sealed well. This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the brush head base and the unit. It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements. Eventually, you see mold and bacteria developing and this is not sanitary.  I don&#x27;t know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively but I&#x27;m going to check.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to be able to receive, at a good price, the Sonicare Elite brush heads every 6 months. I had had a hard time finding them in the local stores, and now they come automatically. Thanks!</li>
            <li> We have used the Sonicare for a year and a half, this is the best price we&#x27;ve found on the replacement brushes.  Great produce, like Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> This is the third set of brushes we have ordered and received. They are original manufactures brushes and work great. No problems experianced nor anticipated.</li>
            <li> I always had issues with my gums bleeding before this tooth brush.  My most recent visit to the dentist office and I had the best review.  I have to say that it is all thanks to this toothbrush, and probably my poor use of technique with brushing with a regular toothbrush prior to this I now realize.  :)</li>
            <li> I used to use another electric toothbrush and was a bit resistant to switch. But I am so glad that I did. I have been using the Sonicare Elite for over a year now and love how it makes my teeth feel...clean and taken care of. The brushes last a long time and are effective in cleaning and getting in between the teeth to thoroughly clean. My electric toothbrush is an integral part of my dental hygiene regime.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work well. However, I would prefer to see a larger size bristlehead like the one made for the Advance model.</li>
            <li> I love sonicare and have my 2nd one in 4 years. They do start to lose their oomph after 2 years. The only problem with this version and these brush heads is that moisture gets inside the collar of the brush and it becomes quite disgusting inside where the magnet is. My first brush had a different design and did not have this problem. It is not enuogh to make me make a change yet but, when it is time for a new one, I will look for a better design.</li>
            <li> These are what I was looking for to replace my sonicare brush.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in any store, maybe because I have a 2 year old model.</li>
            <li> I like these heads for the Sonicare toothbrush better than the old style.  They have longer bristles on the front and back edges, which reach around teeth more efficiently.</li>
            <li> These did not look like the heads in my unit which was old and had no model number that I could find so I did not know if they would work.  Another reviewer posted photos of his old heads which were the same as my old ones and verified that these newer heads would work with my old model.  I am happy to report that they work fine.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thank you for great and fast service. This was my first purchase with Amazon.com and plan to shop more. I can&#x27;t get this product in stores in my area and was worried it had been discontiued but family reccommended Amazon. They shop Amazon all the time and live in Alaska.</li>
            <li> Oh what a difference a new one makes.  Suggested change every three months. Well worth the $17 every six months to maintain quality dental care.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the national name brand and is far cheaper.  I am extremely pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phillips Sonicare e-Series for years.  This is the first time that I have bought replacement heads that would bog-down when putting pressure on my teeth.  I know that you are not suppose to do that, but sometimes I do.  Anyway, this particular set (still using first one), does not appear to be of the same quality as others that I have on auto-delivery.  I will use these in a pinch and try to use them with a lighter hand.  I have never had this happen before and will not buy except on my auto-delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually buy household products off Amazon since I live in NYC and it is just so much more convenient and cost-effective this way. The retail price of buying Sonicare e-Series standard replacement heads is about $30 in stores so seeing this for $16 + tax and shipping was a no-brainer decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNFORTUNATELY, when I received the brush heads, they felt cheaper than the ones I am currently using. They look slightly different and the &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; model name printed on the brush head has a different font than the original. I truly believe these are knock-offs that the seller is trying to pass off as Sonicare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am requesting a return immediately. This was such a disappointment and I guess there&#x27;s a reason why they are going for almost 50% cheaper than retail price.</li>
            <li> Not asking for too much out of a toothbrush head, but unfortunately one of the toothbrushes stopped working (wouldn&#x27;t vibrate) after less than one week.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the price but they work just as good as the OEM brushes that come with the Sonicare.  I had forgotten how nice new brushes are, These are cheap enough I can replace them more often.</li>
            <li> A decent replacement for the original brushes</li>
            <li> A great product that I have been using for years!  But what really made me smile was the packaging.  &amp;#34;No hassle&amp;#34; packaging.  Easy to open and all paper, no plastic!!!</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacement brush heads for e-series Sonicare toothbrushes.  Highly recommended.  I&#x27;ve had the best dental checkups since using these (as recommended by my dentist).</li>
            <li> Finally ordered some new brush heads, wasn&#x27;t sure if these were the correct ones, but they were.  They work so much better than the old ones.  Love them.</li>
            <li> After searching on line for what replacement brush head I needed, I came across these and purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived promptly and work great!  I would purchase these again!</li>
            <li> I got this product and one of the heads worked great. The other is faulty!!! It is very loud and feel like isnt correctly connecting!!</li>
            <li> I love these heads.  They get into every nook and cranny in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought new brushes for the Sonicare.  The 2 were defective.  I called the office on the brochure.  I was told they had discontinued the brush and maybe I could find some old brushes in a  drugstore.  They did not stand behind their product and now I understand it is made in China.  I would not buy one again.</li>
            <li> The quality of these was not the same as the ones I buy at the store. The bristles get bent out of shape. They may be some kind of knockoff.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads improved my brushing experience 10x. Price was a lot for me to justify but after 2+years with the same brushing head I splurged to get this and it was worth it. First few brushes felt like I was sitting in the dentist office getting my teeth cleaned before getting used to it</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare toothbrush for a few years now and love it, however, these refills are definitely not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing.  While brushing my teeth, they hesitate continuously throughout brushing. And no it&#x27;s not my toothbrush.  Beware of  imitation brands like these!</li>
            <li> I used generic brand for about a year, and it was so loud you practically had to wear ear plugs.  Got these through Amazon and my wife is happy the jackhammer sound is gone again.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper to buy these through Amazon than to wait for aa sale and to pay salestax as long as you plan enough in advance.</li>
            <li> When our dentist recommended the Sonicare  bought one but a little sceptical. &lt;br /&gt;A world of difference between this and a regular toothbrush.  My teeth feel so &lt;br /&gt;much cleaner and smooth and there was a difference with my check up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t wear down fast, last quite a while.  I waited 7 months before &lt;br /&gt;replacing and really didn&#x27;t need to..</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses a sonicare knows what a good brush it is...need I say more?  That&#x27;s why we needed replacements.  They got here at least a day or two before I expected they would.  Fast service!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying in the store.  Do not be afraid to buy online.</li>
            <li> Bought a two pack of these ....one was defective .....basically made a fair amount of noise but didn&#x27;t clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The second one has been fine....this is not the first time that I have had a defective Sonic Care replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;They need to have better Q.C. especially at the price they charge for these .</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush with affordable replacement heads--timer helps you keep track of the quadrants that you are brushing and your teeth feel like you have just stepped out of the hygienist&#x27;s chair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize that my old brushes were geting worn out.  I just replaced them because Sonicare recomends it.  After replaceing them I noticed the differance instantly.  My Teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I just bought not long time ago, I still didn&#x27;t use it because I bought these 2 pack brush head for keep instock but I will use them very soon. Right now I am using Elite (E-series) brush head, It is very good quality. I don&#x27;t have to go to dentist every year anymore.</li>
            <li> i let my old brush tip go faaaar longer than 6mos and finally replaced it--what a difference! back to enjoying the teeth brushing and glad i could get a double pack!!:-)</li>
            <li> I am not one to floss very much, so I can have quite a bit of build up on my teeth when it comes to my 6-month check-up.  A dental hygenist suggested this toothbrush.  Now, I get great reviews during my checkups - my teeth are much cleaner.  I even had a dentist ask me if I had my teeth whitened - which I haven&#x27;t.  I feel like this toothbrush along with the replacement heads each 6 months have been a worthy investment for me.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes fit easily into the Phillips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush.  I have no trouble removing the old toothbrush and putting in the new one.  It takes just seconds.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have this type of toothbrush...buy one now!!  I save my gums and a 10K dental bill..I buy them for presents..  10 of 10!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my Phillips Sonicare Replacement Brush Heads.  These replacements are not easy to find in a store.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find my replacement heads for the Philips Sonicare toothbrush on Amazon.  And what is even better, I could use my accumulated points to pay for them!  Yay</li>
            <li> At first I had a hard time attaching it. But now I find it works just fine and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth much better than a regualr tooth brush.  Dental exams are much better than when using a regular tooth brush.  Have been using the Sonicare system for several years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is the OEM but is much lighter and louder that the previous one I have had</li>
            <li> Great price for two replacement heads! Perfect packaging! I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> great tooth brushes  and the rest is by far the best tooth brush I had</li>
            <li> In the picture above it clearly shows two toothbrushes with a light green ring. This is NOT what I have received.</li>
            <li> Great price and exactly what I wanted and shipped very quickly.  Slipped right into position with no problem and will order more when needed.</li>
            <li> I have had this tooth brush for years and these replacement heads make the old brush like new. I try to change brush heads every three months as suggested by the maker.</li>
            <li> These have to be copy cats. I&#x27;ve purchased the replacements from other places and have never had a problem. The brush stops vibrating when you put pressure on it!  So basically it doesn&#x27;t clean your teeth! I&#x27;ll never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Works great! I didn&#x27;t know I needed a new brush head that bad, until I replaced it a noticed a big difference in performance.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted at a good price.  Came earlier than expected which was a great surprise. I was happy.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, my teeth have been so much healthier over the last 10 years I have been using it. I would highly recommend. These are not knock off, which I have tried and returned, but the real deal.</li>
            <li> My only complaints with this product are the clamshell packaging, which sliced my thumb while trying to open and its high cost.  It would be nice if Philips engineered this product to allow for the replacement of the brush itself rather than the entire mechanical component.  I can see the need for replacing the whole component from time to time but certainly far less frequently than the brush.  I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare e-Series for close to 5 years now and I find that I don&#x27;t replace the brushes as often as I should because of their high cost.</li>
            <li> Shame on me, but I purchased an off brand replacement head for my Philips Sonicare and have struggled since. What a waste of money! I finally broke down and purchase the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; and am so very pleased I did. These heads are great - vibrate as expected and do a super great job of cleaning my teeth and stimulating my gums. The fit on the base is perfect and easy to manipulate - the brushes themselves are soft enough to be comfortable, but solid enough to get the job done. I guess you get what you pay for, and these are definitely worth the time and money. From now on, I buy the real Sonicare e-Series heads. Period.</li>
            <li> Its been over a month and I still have not received the product even though I have written Amazon customer service and the UPS tracking says it was delivered! I can&#x27;t get anyone from Amazon to help!!!</li>
            <li> What can I say...I like my sonicare and just needed some new replacement brush heads for it. They were a better price on Amazon than in the store!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for years and me &amp; my dentist are happy of the results..</li>
            <li> My son always had trouble keeping his teeth clean from plaque build-up. I bought this new toothbrush and the dentist noticed how much cleaner his teeth were at his 6 month check up!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes. Frankly, they were added to another purchase to qualify for free shipment. They fit my Sonicare Elite toothbrush perfectly and do a magnificent cleaning job. Their price is below Rite Aid&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> the sonicare toothbrush is seriously one of thee best toothbrushes on the market. the replacement heads can be a little pricey, but they are worth it. i am always tempted just to get the 6 pack of the brush heads (i know buying them in bulk is truly worth the savings $$$), but i usually end up getting the two pack. fast shipping, easy to open, quality product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to sign up to receive this item every six months, but the link didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my brush head, and have been very happy with my phillips sonicare , but the stores have the price of replacement so high that I didnt want to spend the money,  got it from amazon at a great price.  thank you</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare Elite.  I&#x27;ve had it for over 10 years, and love the way it makes my teeth feel.  It&#x27;s like coming from the dentist.  I confess that I don&#x27;t take time to floss, but with this toothbrush the dentist may never know that.  Plus it&#x27;s timed so you know how long you should be brushing.  I highly recommend it.  Even bought it for my brother for Christmas one year.  My husband was reluctant to try it because it tickles at first, but now he loves it too.</li>
            <li> It rattles so loud I couldn&#x27;t use one of the brushes at all. Pretty expensive for 1 working brush if you ask me</li>
            <li> I only ordered these Sonicare brush heads online, as I was ordering something else from Amazon anyway.  You can find them locally when on sale at the same or lower price.  I love the Sonicare toothbrush, but find cleaning the brushheads a real chore if you remove the head and try to clean everything up once in a while.  They really should make the brushheads to have a water tight seal so you would not have to do this.  This is why I gave this item a four star rating instead of five.</li>
            <li> I got the two replacement heads for my Essence toothbrush --- about $23 from Amazon (Dec 08) with Subscribe and Save, free shipping.  Comes up cheaper than from a store.  It comes out cheaper to replace the heads than the whole toothbrush.  The toothbrush won&#x27;t do as a good a job if you don&#x27;t replace the head every few months.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the Philips Sonicare Elite and its replacement brush heads for many years with great satisfaction. And we often give this or another Philips Sonicare model as Christmas presents to our children and grandchildren, who also think very highly of them.If we ever change, it will be to another Philips Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> U have been using this product since it was invented. My first one did not have replaceable brushes. This is the best product of its kind. I am a retired Dentist.</li>
            <li> My new brush head doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the store bought version of the same thing. Seems less powerful and intermittently doesn&#x27;t assemble back on to base smoothly. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the same level of clean.</li>
            <li> Magnet came out first time I tried to wash it, had to use second one right away.  It works not any better than replacement I can get at Walmart.  Good price</li>
            <li> Great packaging and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> These are great and the price was pretty good.. I had bought generic replacements previously and threw them out when I bought these.. The difference is really noticeable..</li>
            <li> I have used generic and some cheap defective, and these are the real deal.  They work beautifully, and I can tell you after years of usging sonic, and great check ups at dentist, I highly recommend, sonic over manual burshing.  And a water pic flosser, along with manual flossing, and use a manual toothbrush for back of the lower and upper, and you will not need a dentis, I bet they don&#x27;t wnat you to know that. Use the routine after every meal or snack if possible, of course at work not so good.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made product, brush less than 1/8 inch high, returned.</li>
            <li> Great price on replacement heads.  Love our Sonic toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> the first sonicare replacement head did not work properly so I removed it and installed the second which seems to work okay (so far).</li>
            <li> They work well with my older e series tooth brush.Fitted on with out any issues. And was a good value.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  What&#x27;s up with that?.  It is also ill fitting.  Did not come in the packaging I&#x27;d ordered.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads work great.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with an off brand, I wen back to Philips and am so much happier.</li>
            <li> They are just as good.  I only wish they lasted 6 months instead of 4, but I am satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Is what it is. E series brush heads. Brushes my teeth!! I&#x27;m using one so far its working well. Got it for a good price!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using Sonicare for the past 3 or 4 years after having it recommended to us by our son.  Since we have started using it we have experienced a much cleaner feel and have been receiving great comments from out dental hygienist.  Although a little pricey when compared to a regular tooth brush or many of the electric brushes, it is well worth the investment.  I recommend Philips Sonicare to anyone who is interested in maintaining and keeping their teeth.  The younger you start, the better.</li>
            <li> It wasa replacements .</li>
            <li> These were fulfilled by Amazon but came from another supplier.  Received them and both broke within five uses.  We compared with ones we bought onsite at a local retailer, and these were clearly cheap imitations when you looked at the printing on the brush heads.  Maybe they&#x27;ve switched suppliers, but buyer beware.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think there&#x27;d be much difference between the old and new, but after a couple of years, what a difference the new ones made.  i followed other folks advice and only bought the philips brand.  glad i did.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same old head for some time without replacing it. All seemed fine. When I changed to the new replacement head the power and feel noticeably picked up for a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great price and service.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money buying generic replacement heads, they do fit, but don&#x27;t clean as well and don&#x27;t last as long as these genuine sonicare replacements!</li>
            <li> The 2nd replacement head that I received doesn&#x27;t work with my Sonicare. I recommend only getting replacements directly from Sonicare, to ensure they will work properly.</li>
            <li> Love using he sonic care tooth brush. Wish the heads were a little less expensive, but worth it .  Keep the heads clean</li>
            <li> These are a great price and work well!  Would recommend to anyone needing a refill.  Great value and arrived timely</li>
            <li> Got it quickly and so glad to find one since older brush. Will order from them again when I need another brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried buying generic brand replacements, and while you can get away with doing so with other things, you can&#x27;t with these.  The vibration on these is much more powerful - get these, they aren&#x27;t that much more than the generic brand, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Both new heads were so loud, much more than any other heads used before.  Threw them both out.  Makes me wonder if these are truly Philips heads or seconds.  Either way, will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> A very nice product...</li>
            <li> Fits and works like it should.</li>
            <li> I had my Sonicare tootbrush for, I don&#x27;t know, 10 years now.  It hasn&#x27;t broke down on me yet.  But to be effective the brush heads have to be changed of course.  These are my favorite versus the smaller brush head.  When I first got my Sonicare I had to buy a different series which they discontinued.  I&#x27;m glad they made the e-Series compatible with mine so I don&#x27;t have to get a whole new one all together.</li>
            <li> If you need replacement heads for your Sonicare don&#x27;t use compatibles.  They vibrate hard enough to break your teeth!  But the actual Philips replacement heads shown here are excellent and love the price</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as advertised and provides the best bang for the buck. I would Highly recommended to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but they do a great job and the dentist recommends.  Could come in a few more colors.  The last 2 orders were the same green and grey.</li>
            <li> I recently had to repurchase these as a house guest quite literally ate my previous brushes, a traumatic experience for both of us...&lt;br /&gt;Ergo I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity of these heads, however after several months of use they do begin to soften and rattle in the handle a tad.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise they get the job done and and remove most visible plaque after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;5/5, would brush again</li>
            <li> Its doing a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> These only worked correctly for a few days and then started making a very loud noise and not vibrating correctly, what a waste!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that I was purchasing the incorrect replacement brushes, I think the clue is to make sure you get the correct series, they were reasonably priced, arrived in a timely manner and nicely packaged</li>
            <li> I KNEW SOMEONE MUST HAVE A BETTER PRICE----IT WAS YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS HAPPENS INVARIABLY.  OH THANK HEAVEN FOR AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOUR BIGGEST FAN</li>
            <li> Both of the replacement heads broke in a very short time frame. I will not be purchasing these replacement heads again. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> A Good Choice&lt;br /&gt;This fits my toothbrush.  It is a very competitive price, less expensive than an &amp;#34;in-store&amp;#34; purchase.  I will shop at Amazon again when I need a replacement.</li>
            <li> These work great and fit perfectly and are new and packaged as they should be. Great price, will buy again when I need them.</li>
            <li> This is clearly not an authentic Sonicare product. It vibrates so much that it sounds like a lawn mower in my mouth. The brush head bristles are not soft. Had I realized I did not receive what I thought I ordered, I would have returned for a refund. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve used one brush head a few times already and can honestly say that I hate to brush my teeth because the sound is so loud.  I do not recommend. My advice, spend a few dollars more and get the authentic product at your local store.</li>
            <li> My wife and I each have Sonicare e-Series toothbrushes and I decided to get this two pack of replacement heads and it&#x27;s like our brushes are brand new.</li>
            <li> One unit makes a terrible noise and is not as powerful as the other one.  Won&#x27;t be buying this item again on line.</li>
            <li> Great price and great quality! I wanted to get a deal and I did, these work just like any other tops. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are the original, not some cheap copy that doesn&#x27;t work.  We tried some clones from Walgreen and they are pure junk, all they do is make noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work great!!!!!</li>
            <li> This has been the best toothbrush, manual or electric, that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It does a superb job cleaning, and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from my dentist since I started using it.  The replacement heads are not cheap, but they last 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Sonicare for decades since it first came out. I wouldn&#x27;t want to brush my teeth with anything else. The e-Series is, of course, an updated - better - version from my original.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I could easily get replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Extend the life of your Sonicare by getting these replacement heads to make the brush like new again.  It feels great to start brushing again with a new head on your Sonicare and the two pack deal gives you one extra so you can stall on buying another set a little longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Soniccare tooth brush for the last 19 years. The first brush head only lasted a month. The magnet is loose. I think I can glue it on. I am  not sure if I  got  a lemon. Let you know how the other 3 brush heads work.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush that these heads are for is a recent gift to me to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; the brush before I spend $$ on a new one for myself.  My GF was a little surprised to have found them.  The unit works great and the heads seemed to be good as well.</li>
            <li> I finally found exactly the right brush replacemnts for my Sonicare.  It took a while to find, but this company had &amp;#34;the right stuff!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was caught off guard by the packaging and the brush heads don&#x27;t look/wear like the Sonicare brush heads I&#x27;ve been using with the same toothbrush the last 13 years.  Makes me wonder if they are genuine as advertised.</li>
            <li> My husband has used a Phillips Sonicare for years, I just buy new head every few months. They work great and my husband is very happy with the heads and the Sonicare</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased to find these heads at a good price.  Although I was doubtful they would fit my old, standard Sonicare, they were perfect.  Some I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere were hard as a rock &amp; that&#x27;s what it felt like I was brushing with too!  They arrived in a timely manner, well packaged &amp; were just as claimed.  I will order from them again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife because what she had was all used up.  No question, Philips Sonicare is tops.  The 2 will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to replace a &#x27;Bed Bath and Beyond&#x27; joke.  They sold me a &#x27;travel&#x27; sized replacement head.  I paid the same price for the &#x27;travel head&#x27; as I did for both of these.  I didn&#x27;t know it was a &#x27;travel size&#x27;.  And that is such a joke you can&#x27;t even believe it.  They cut the brush part in half and called it travel size and the package did not distinguish that it was not standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is exactly what is advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought this online because I didn&#x27;t have the chance to get to the local Costco. These heads do not fit properly. They are very loud when the tooth brush is turned on. So loud that my while I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom, I couldn&#x27;t hear the door bell ringing! Garbage.</li>
            <li> Have been using this style brush head for about 10 years now.  This newer design is not as easy to clean as the original version but you can&#x27;t get the old version so doesn&#x27;t matter.  The magnets are glued on so at least they don&#x27;t slip around anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our handle is over 5 years old and doesn&#x27;t hold a charge too long so we bought the newer slim handle with the slip on brush heads.  We like the slip on version much better.  The cleaning ability is about the same but much easier to clean and takes up less space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend changing to the different handle and brush heads until your current handle stops charging.</li>
            <li> These heads work great, however, -1 star because they do not screw onto the base 100% like other reviewers have mentioned so it does make a loud noise compared to the original head that came with my toothbrush. If you can look past that then these are great, my toothbrush feels like new again and it feels more powerful than that original brush head the came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works well and we received it on time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sonic care, arrived quickly, good price point!</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and always looking for a good price in the replacement heads.  Perfectly packaged. Was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time I changed my sonicare toothbrush heads.  works for me.</li>
            <li> These immediately made much more noise than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in OEM packaging from stores. There was a high pitched rattling as if there was some piece of loose metal or a bad fit somewhere. Fairly soon, something inside began to rust - something that never happened with the examples I&#x27;ve purchased before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed the replacements until I changed them. I love the way they feel. Love my teeth and love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any idea.  I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.  If they are as in the past - they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Work great and service fast with best price.</li>
            <li> The brush head with the gray band just under the &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; mark works, but sounds like a freight train at full speed.  It sounds like it is going to break apart while you are brushing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head with the green band also works, with the normal brushing sound of my original brush head.  This is the one I have to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worked for Philips Sonicare Essence Classic Edition HX5310.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s brand new and loud and strong at first. It usually breaks in over time and gets less loud with use. This is a good replacement for the original model.</li>
            <li> Down by the water.  Get the real thing, don&#x27;t skimp on those off brands, Like I did.  Well, not no more.</li>
            <li> We have used Phillips Sonicare brushes for several years.  I like everything about them except the tendency to collect water in the space between the head and the body of the brush.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Appreciate that the replacements are available.sometimes manufactures change the model, forcing one to buy entire new product ,  Sonicare has not!</li>
            <li> One worked and the 2nd one made such a loud noise I couldn&#x27;t use it but by the time I tried it I was past my return &#x27;window&#x27;. If you buy a pair of these replacement brushes make sure you try both as soon as you get them.</li>
            <li> These are fake. Do not buy from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are horrible. I&#x27;m sure they aren&#x27;t good for your teeth either. Fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare toothbrush heads for years and this is my first time ordering them online, and I won&#x27;t be doing that again - the ones I got in this order are falling apart! I&#x27;ve used the new head maybe three times, and the bristle part wiggles in the base of it (I thought it was a manufacturer error but I checked and both brush heads do this!) and is ineffective for brushing my teeth. Disappointing</li>
            <li> For some reason these heads must have been faulty. When you press the brush against your teeth it would stop.  The base was fully charged and I took it apart and put it back together it still wouldn&#x27;t work properly.I have since replaced them with generic heads and they work.</li>
            <li> I ordered in March. The first brush head lasted a few weeks and then started vibrating super loudly. Threw it away thinking it was the first defect I have had with a Sonicare head in five years. Second one has only lasted a couple weeks and now I&#x27;ve come here to see these other reviews. Why is Amazon still selling these?? Total waste of money, stay away!</li>
            <li> Brush heads were noisy, after 2 weeks of use the internal magnets had rusted.  Clearly were not genuine Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> It works with my toothbrush power head like new. My brush head is a 070723, HX7500. The brush head must be tightened complete.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare model I ordered came with one Standard Replacement Bruch Head and one of the smaller brush heads.  I prefer these Standard size.  They work fine ... if perhaps a little difficult to remove and replace when using the &#x27;sterilization&#x27; feature.</li>
            <li> These were the small head replacements.  I ended up keeping and using them anyway!  But I really like the bigger heads, so I ended up ordering the large heads too.  The small head replacements would be great for kids!</li>
            <li> I purchased a replacement heads at my local Walmart the equate brand because they were half price of the Sonicare what I got them home and put them in a toothbrush they worked well but they were extremely noisy something in the construction with a touch of the toothbrush so I was happy when I found actual Sonicare replacements on Amazon and they were less price than the Walmart brand order them and no more noisy toothbrushing in the morning thank you so much I will order again</li>
            <li> I made the decision to purchase these after reading the reviews of the knock-offs. Happy that I did!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are official Philips brand....the first one already broke on the second brushing. Something internal. Now It doesn&#x27;t vibrate correctly at all and had to be thrown away. If the second one does the same, I will update this review to one star and recommend that no one buy it. Was not worth the $6 or whatever I saved.</li>
            <li> The order was processed in a timely way, the price was &#x27;right&#x27;, and I will undoubtedly order these again.</li>
            <li> Keep my teeth in great condition and do not irritate my gums. Brush heads last a long time. Glad I switched to this type of electronic toothbrush. I&#x27;m happy with my healthy smile.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, and so reasonably priced, MUCH less than one would pay at the various dept stores where I use to purchased my replacements brush heads.  I will continue to use this resource.</li>
            <li> Awesome value for the price.  Brand new exact model. It will extend the life of my toothbrush for another 2 years. Love that.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Philips Sonicare Elite replacement toothbrushes. I had been searching for coupons or discounts for this product, but hadn&#x27;t been able to find any.  When I found them offered on Amazon for a very good price, I was thrilled.  I was even happier when I realized I could save even more by setting up a regular subscription.  This is wonderful, now I don&#x27;t have to keep searching for the best price and I don&#x27;t have to go out to a store and buy them - they will be brought to me.  Thanks for offering such a quality product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an E-series brush for 3+ years. It has always been great and I have just had to clean the inside a little here and there. But with my newest replacement brushes, the black piece has be shedding itself all over the inside of the brush with little pieces of black rubber or plastic. Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> Works great! Sealed proper packaging. Best price out there for them that I could find.</li>
            <li> Best price around and shipping a breeze. Can not beat the price.Picture on Amazon was precise,clear. Description was great.</li>
            <li> As advertised and affordable pricing; as this is a product used on a daily basis in maintaining my dental health.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! My teeth feel so clean after a new head. I need to replace more often. Would definitely reccommend.</li>
            <li> Efficient &amp; light weight way to clean my teeth, absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I love feeling my teeth are amazingly  clean after using this tooth brush!</li>
            <li> I have been a long timer user of Philips Sonicare Toothbrush Family. Ordered these replacement for my Sonicare.  Amazon has&lt;br /&gt;a good price and that is why I have ordered this item which cost more in the department stores located where I shop. Will keep&lt;br /&gt;purchasing from Amazon.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Out of the package of two, one did not work properly.</li>
            <li> Be aware when purchasing these brush heads.  I have an e-series toothbrush and needed new replacement brush heads and purchased these through Amazon.  Unfortunately the stem is too short to get the proper vibration on the toothbrush body.  Very little pressure on the brush head would make them quit vibrating all together.  I will not purchase this product again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price for replacement heads.  The work perfectly.</li>
            <li> The replacement head fits great on my ancient Sonicare.  I was concerned I would have to buy a whole new unit because of the age of my Sonicare, but these are the perfect replacement head.</li>
            <li> I love the sonic and I could not find the replacement head in any store so I was happy to find it online.  The sonic toothbrush keeps my teeth feeling cleaner and I never want to stop using t</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are too expensive.  Moved on to another brand.</li>
            <li> Affordable quik and packaged perfectly. I had a great experience with this supplier. I will definatley loom for then in the future</li>
            <li> High quality - best price.  Had shopped locally and tried generics, but none matched this package deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.  Husband&#x27;s teeth are sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> On a previous e series brush, the bottom half started to come loose from the stem regularly, quite annoying. Forces you to buy replacements more frequently I guess.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sonicare for about ten years, and it&#x27;s an excellent toothbrush that is worth its weight in gold. Its performance and reliability are downright astounding. Yes, you do have to replace the heads from time to time, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort and money, considering what you get in return. I have tried various third party replacement heads over the years, and none of them work as effectively. Please heed my advice, and only buy the official Philips brand replacement heads. Though you may save $5 or so by opting for an imitation, you&#x27;re still wasting your money by buying something that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the real thing!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order. The whole thing went very smoothly and quickly. I appreciate that the ad on internet was clear and easy to find, then easy to order. I thank you for making this process so easy and available.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  The heads easily snapped on! I didn&#x27;t realize how wore out mine were until I got these.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Good price and they work very well. Have used for 10 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to get one for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for over 10 years and it sure has made a difference during my annual dentist cleaning visits.</li>
            <li> These good replacement brush for my sonicare tooth brushes. It is a good value for money, cheaper than brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> I have had my Soni Care electric toothbrush for some years now and I believe the fact that it still works perfectly is due  largely  to using the correct replacement brushes.  I have been ordering same from Amazon based on reviews from other users, who can vouch for the quality because of their own purchase,  The replacement heads are all they have been claimed to be and I am very pleased with them.  The price, which is lower than those available at my nearest drug store,  is also something I am pleased about. I am no longer driving and ordering on line can  at times  be hazardous.  Finding a place I can trust as to name products, good prices,  good quality and honest salesmanship is fantastic.</li>
            <li> These things simply do not work my old sonicare brushes had a lot of torque were able to continually run while I was brushing my teeth. These do not. When I press them up against my teeth they stop I had to try both both have the same issues</li>
            <li> works fine, came on time, gives me a good clean feeling.  BUT..tends to rust after 2-3 mos. Brush head needs to be changed or toothbrush won&#x27;t turn on. CLEAN INSIDE OF TOOTHBRUSH WITH CLR , SOAK OVERNIGHT AND RINSE ALL THE WAY.  Brush will last YRS longer.</li>
            <li> These will definitely give your teeth the feeling that you have been to the dentist and back without going to the dentist</li>
            <li> The picture makes me think of a pair of giraffes. I won&#x27;t be using these replacement heads for a little while since I just bought the 5300, but I like the smaller, narrow head on this brush. It gets to the back teeth easier....even the backs of the back teeth. And the flaired design at the top of the screw-on cap seems to keep crud from seeping into the battery/handle recess.</li>
            <li> We really love these toothbrushes and like using them.  They are just very expensive.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure which replacement brush I needed,but found it easily with the description and pictures.  I received it before it was promised and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good price and very good service will consider another purchase from Amazon.com. These last for 3 months each &amp; plan on reordering at that time.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were a good price (cheaper than anywhere else I checked) and the shipping was fast.  Amazon makes shopping for these types of items incredibly easy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these brush heads.  I bought a sonicare 5300 Essence power toothbrush.  It came with only one brush head and I needed 2.  So I bought the 2 pack and now have 3.  Now I have a spare when one of the two wears out.  I do wish Amazon sold them in singles.</li>
            <li> love my toothbrush but couldn&#x27;t find the replacement heads anywhere, very happy to be able to buy them on line through amazon.</li>
            <li> Received as promised and in good condition. Great way to save a lot of money on these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> My husband and I share a Sonicare base, so we have to buy 2 heads at a time. This was a great purchase, as I could not find it ANYWHERE else for less.</li>
            <li> We have really a really old Sonicare base and needed new replacement brushes.  I called Philips and they said this brush head works with my model.  It is wonderful.  It works much better than the original larger brushhead.</li>
            <li> Great features;    Competitive price  Automatic reordering  Ship directly to home    Overall effort-free process.</li>
            <li> After not seeing a dentist for two years (not a good thing) my dentist looked in my mouth and said \\&quot;Oh you&#x27;re teeth are beautiful!!\\&quot;.  Check up was perfect - no cavities, no problems. I had used the sonicare the entire time. I think that says it all.</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads were not only cheap, but came quickly in the mail.  Definitely cheaper to get them online vs in the store.</li>
            <li> I really love my Sonicare brush. I had procrastinated buying one because of  the expense, but wouldn&#x27;t want to go without it now. The heads should be replaced every so often but that is no suprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Sonicare replacement toothbrushes from Amazon twice.  The first time, the magnet fell off one of the toothbrushes within 3 days of usage, so I sent the item back as defective.  A few months later, I braved the chances and ordered from Amazon again.  This time, while the issue is not as bad as a defective magnet, so the toothbrush head is still usable, it has enough issues for me to not be completely happy.      I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare toothbrush user since 2002, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with toothbrush heads purchased in a regular store.   I&#x27;ll let you judge for yourself whether two defective purchases in a row is a fluke, but I can tell you that I am not ordering this item from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> THEY RUST !  These are obviouslhy not made of the same materials as the originals.  Yes, they did fit our toothbrush and worked better for us than some of the negative reviewers reported, BUT.....  The magnets seem to be made of iron and within the first month of use I started to see rust stains on my bathroom counter.  We rinse them, and dry in the rack provided with the original toothbrush.  We never had this problem with regular Phillips replacement heads.  The magnets are now coated with rust.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> These were&lt;br /&gt; great !! And much cheaper than the store I was going to buy them in</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best Ive used...I mostly like the oral B prodocts but the sonic care brush removes so much food particles, flossing is a breeze. These replacement heads are just like the one that came with it....for me they last about 3 months before I have to replace them. Little expensive....but in the long run, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works great for what I needed them for, and great prices compaired to what I found in the local stores. Thanks</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted the service was excellent thanks</li>
            <li> They are cut wrong! Looks like a 3 year old cut them. I bought it as a gift so I didn&#x27;t open them and now 30 days has passed so I have 8 of these that I cant return...</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare. Started using it a few years ago when suggested by dentist. Has really helped with gingivitis too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made hundreds of purchases on Amazon, and this one was the most disappointing of them all. The quality of these heads a laughable. I compared these heads to the OEM version and these are many differences: plastic quality, bristle quality/cut, and labeling. Definitely stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I requested a refund but I was beyond the timeline.</li>
            <li> For some reason these didn&#x27;t fit my Essence Sonicare properly and made the power of the toothbrush seem very weak. I purchased some replacement heads at the store shortly after and they worked fine. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time or money buying these online again.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long considering the price. Also does not remove plaque as well as other products It is very expensive too.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THESE IN THE PAST AND THEY ARE WELL WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> I purchased two packages of these and so far none of the brushes have lasted more than a few weeks before vibrating at a much lower rate and even stopping at times. I definitely would not buy more of these. I bought replacement heads from Costco and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Original equipment quality replacement. My dentist prescribed the Sonicare brush and it has greatly helped with my cavity-prone teeth. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since it first came out.  The brushes are perfect and I get&lt;br /&gt;fantastic dental checkups.  Thanks Sonicare and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Sonic-brand Replacement Brush Heads for years, but I decided recently to save some money and buy the generic brush heads sold at Walmart.  I was excited to save at least $10 on the 2-brush head set, but unfortunately, I&#x27;ve experienced two serious problems with these non-name brand heads.  First, when you&#x27;re rinsing out the cups that holds the brushes, and then screw the entire head back on, the brush doesn&#x27;t always end up at the front of the base, which is important when you use the off/on button and when you try to hold it upright in your hand.  (The brush is designed to fit your hand only when it faces directly forward.)  The only solution for this problem is to screw the whole replacement head unit on until it&#x27;s almost but not entirely tight, then move the smaller part at the top of the cup until it aligns with the front, then tighten the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is that the brush itself doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate as vigorously as the brand-name replacement does,&lt;br /&gt;and, at the same time, it&#x27;s much noisier.</li>
            <li> I ordered these toothbrush heads in January.  The first one worked fine but the second one is defective, won&#x27;t work correctly.  The position is off  and looks a little bent.  Now it&#x27;s past my return time and I&#x27;m stuck.  If the Stills company reads this I would love a replacement.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and this was a good price ad the shipping was fast.  I recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> i like the performance, although the original heads seem to be a little strong.  These replacement heads are getting stronger the more I use them.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> no cavities since I stared using this. wish I had know a lone time ago.</li>
            <li> Of the two brush heads, one was defective - vibrating at low speed. Upon inspection, the flaw was from poor quality construction. However, there are not many alternatives available to these brush heads, so taking a gamble on these may unfortunately be the only option.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive but they work fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine. This version has a one point seal that keeps water from entering the handset. This ia a major improvement from the original replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These arrived in a user friendly package, making it easy to open and get out. Appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;These work very well, much better than a regular toothbrush. Had the oral b before and this is similar in effect. Get teeth very clean.These bristles are pretty soft, softer than the originals that came with the whole unit, but they still work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time and they work very well as stated</li>
            <li> 2 days after using one of the replacement brush heads, it started to make a really loud buzzing noise. In comparing it to the head I had not yet used, I noticed a chip on the corner of the black base of the defective one.  It no longer brushes as well. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly - so much better than generic replacements!</li>
            <li> Use this all the time and like the results.  Brush just right size.</li>
            <li> These work great and last a long time.  It is much better to buy these than the knock offs.</li>
            <li> Product came as expected.</li>
            <li> This product fit old style sonicare battery. Very happy to find them.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived with very little bristles... terrible product. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says it is.  It was a perfect brush-head replacement for my Sonicare Essence E5300.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to add that these E-Series toothbrushes are a great replacement for Philips Sonicare Advance 4000 series toothbrushes which uses the A-Series.</li>
            <li> Very hard to open, but exactly what you would be paying nearly 2x as much for in a store, not to mention tax and standing in line.</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 500 items on Amazon and have never felt compelled to write a review until now. Philips must have bought out Sonicare but their so called \\&quot;newer\\&quot; replacement heads are deficient compared to the older Sonicare models. These are much smaller with an extremely tiny brush head. I&#x27;m supposed to pay the same price for crappier hardware? I can&#x27;t find the older models anywhere so I am stuck with this unless I replace the whole model. Might look for another company now for my electric toothbrush needs.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT LOOKED LIKE THE BRISTLES HAD BEEN SHAVED/SHORTENED</li>
            <li> I really like subscribe and save through Amazon. I don&#x27;t understand why the compact size is never available.  Our family all have very small mouths, so the full size is difficult to use.  I would love to see Amazon offer the compact heads as well.</li>
            <li> Great product that fit my old Sonicare.  Does a nice job of keeping the teeth clean and clearing any plaque build up.</li>
            <li> One of the heads broke within a week of using it. I got one head for the price of two :(</li>
            <li> had to return it b/c one of the magnets on one of the heads didn&#x27;t work probably and it was only a mild vibrate, not enough to actually clean your teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for replacement heads for this Sonicare model and have been frustrated because two different times, I bought replacement heads in local stores, and they did NOT fit (although they said they were universal). I thought I was going to have to purchase a new Sonicare and didn&#x27;t like the planned-obsolescence factor. THEN I went to Amazon and found these, carefully researched them, and really appreciated the complete information and photos provided! These work, and I am very pleased. I&#x27;m going to Amazon more and more because of the reliability of product information and ease of purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are original heads and function as intended. The product arrived ahead of time. It was properly packed in a cushioned envelope with no damage noted. I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical when I read reviews for a product claiming they are knock-offs. But it was very obvious after receiving these, that they are not the genuine heads designed for my toothbrush. Holding them side by side you can tell they are not made the same way and the printed &amp;#34;e-series&amp;#34; text also looks different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if they performed the same I wouldn&#x27;t care, but they don&#x27;t. The bristles are much firmer than the genuine ones (even after a week or two of use). One of the two also broke within a week of starting to use it. It suddenly stopped making contact correctly with the handle resulting in a loud noise whenever the brush is on and much weaker vibration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for about five years and generally love it. However, these new brush heads aren&#x27;t as good as the ones I&#x27;ve used all along. They feel uncomfortable, almost like a high-speed dentist drill - and the sound is higher-pitched (not that the sound matters, but it&#x27;s indicative of a change in the design). I know this sounds nutty. But both my partner and I noticed the difference right away. And I compared the new with the old brush heads; definitely a difference. What happened????</li>
            <li> This is the OEM replacement for the Sonicare e-Series toothbrushes.  They work exactly as expected, and as described.  Good price.</li>
            <li> great.. just what i expected</li>
            <li> Each brush head lasted less than 2 weeks, then started making a high pitched noise and quit cleaning. These couldn&#x27;t be real Sonicare.  Shame on you Amazon. I feel like I was robbed.</li>
            <li> Who would have imagined that in my quest to save time and money I would inadvertently purchase fake Sonicare items? On the first brush, it was clear that something was off. There was a funny twang sound as my gums were assaulted by the bristles on this beast of a brush. I could only take it for four brushing sessions.  In hindsight, a simple web search would have revealed the pervasiveness of this problem (counterfeit brushes on the web) and I would have saved myself $24. Well, you learn something new every day!  As it stands, I&#x27;m out the $24 and an additional $38 for the replacement--the real thing--from my local (trusted) grocery store. Perhaps I&#x27;ll use this brush to scrub my grout.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and the price was very reasonable as well.  Great Communication and Fast Shipping will definitely buy again..  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are the best. May take a little while to get used to but your dental visits will be a lot shorter cause you won&#x27;t have much plague build-up. These brush heads are good and cost less than the drugstore, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> the brush heads dont clean too well since the power of the holder seems to be too weak.  i assume i might need a new base that holds the e series brush headss  but i dont think sonicare carries the old holder,  any suggestions--right now i am disappointed.l.</li>
            <li> Purchased these refills two times in the last several months and the toothbrush bristles are falling out while using.  This is seriously annoying and most likely a potential hazard.</li>
            <li> The bristles were horribly uneven.  Appeared like they were cut.  Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like ones bought at Cosco.</li>
            <li> We have not had any issues with the two other heads we bought at a local store. Maybe we just got lucky enough to receive a bad batch. But these are the only ones we have had trouble with in the almost 10 years we have been using Sonicare.     The magnets came off both heads not long after receiving this item. It made it useless with the handheld part.</li>
            <li> I bought replacement brush heads at Bed, Bath and Beyond and they totally didn&#x27;t work in my Sonicare, even though they were supposed to. But these work great. I&#x27;ll stick to the name brand.</li>
            <li> These clean my teeth so well. I tried a cheaper brand and was not happy at all and the dentist noticed the difference. I&#x27;m going to stick with these from now on.</li>
            <li> Two brush heads in simple cardboard packaging, couldn&#x27;t really ask for anything more.  These work great.  Wish they sold the compact heads in the same way.</li>
            <li> Love these.  they do help prevent gum problems</li>
            <li> Always buy brand name, these fit and held up well</li>
            <li> This is second set of these that has had malformed brushes.  There seems to be a production issue going on so I will buy these from the local store until it is corrected.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly...Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these were genuine sonicare replacements. The first one that I used did not vibrate properly and then broke -- the magnet on the bottom fell off after 2 weeks. I am already on the second one and it seems to be working ok, but I am assuming that one will not last very long either.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> these work as i expected and hoped they would. i bought some at walmart (made in china) and was very disappointed</li>
            <li> great replacement brush for the sonicate</li>
            <li> For being an actual replacement product from Sonicare I must admit I was extremely disspointed to see how these two ended up in the trash a month later.</li>
            <li> The products shipped were clearly counterfeit. On a genuine product the word &amp;#34;e-Series&amp;#34; is engraved on the shaft. On the ones I received, the word was printed and rubbed off. Further, rather than operate with the low volume hum of an authentic Sonicare product, those I received produced a loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> There seems to be an issue with how easy they are to attach and remove.  Unlike the &#x27;plain&#x27; series specific brush heads, these require a bit of fiddling to get to attach or detach.  Once on, they perform as usual.  No other complaints.</li>
            <li> The sonicare brush head works very good in keeping my teeth and gums in excellent condition! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> What can I say that everyone else hasn&#x27;t already said?!!?  This toothbrush is great!  We are on the subscribe and save, and what a good idea it is.  We get new replacement heads in every six months (how often you are supposed to replace the toothbrush head anyways) and are always thrilled to swap out and keep using our great toothbrush.  This last time we got replacement heads, it&#x27;s using a different blue line indicator.  This one is in the middle of the brush and runs down much quicker than the old line at the front of the brush.  Makes me wonder if they really aren&#x27;t lasting as long as the old ones.  Guess it doesn&#x27;t really matter for us since we get new ones every round, but maybe it would for others.  Since using this toothbrush, we have seen noticeable results with the condition and color of our teeth.  Many people have mentioned it... and our dentist and hygienist... yay!</li>
            <li> This is the first time Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save has sent me this kind of brush head. Previously Amazon sent Sonicare Advance heads, and I never had any problems with those. The newer brush heads fit the handle but are of much lower quality. One of the metal posts in the bottom of the brush head broke after a month of use. Black mold began growing after a few months and is difficult to get rid of.    I want the old brush heads back.</li>
            <li> Price was good, and shipping was pretty quick. If you need replacement heads for your Sonicare its a good deal.</li>
            <li> These are the real Sonicare heads, and they work just as well as the original head, and I love it.    I thought I&#x27;d try to save some money by buying a set of the off-brand replacement heads, but they were awful. The bristles were hard and thick, and the heads don&#x27;t vibrate like the Sonicare heads.    I thus highly and only recommend using these Sonicare heads for your Sonicare brush system.</li>
            <li> The last time I bought these they were quality brushes, now they are poorly made and the quality is non existent. The first time I used the brush the rubber grommet ripped.  When I applied pressure while brushing it stopped vibrating.  Not Good Philips!</li>
            <li> Love these ...durable  and powerful  for  easy  and effective  way of removing  plaque ...</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I had not changed my brushes in a long time, and had forgotten how a new brush feels. Incredible difference. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> These replacement Brush Heads work awesome, fit perfectly, and give me a bright smile.  Better price than at local retailers.</li>
            <li> Of the two heads in the package, one of them vibrated weakly, the other one just barely hummed. It appeared as though the parts were assembles incorrectly; the magnets on one of them were not square to the rest of the parts, they were at an angle. I would have expected this from cheap aftermarket heads, but not from ones made by Philips.</li>
            <li> One head broke within 2 uses. I love this toothbrush &amp; the other head worked fine but couldn&#x27;t get a replacement easily.</li>
            <li> These fit my sonicare base, but were much louder and seem to have contributed to the base no longer working.  Now the brush is very weak and runs out of batteries very quickly, a problem I never had until I switched to these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Philips Sonicare brush heads because my old one did not work. Thess brush head works as expected</li>
            <li> Because they are the standard replacement brushes they work well and do the job correctly. I had an earlier model which used much larger brushes in the present brushes are much more convenient to use because of their size.</li>
            <li> Thought this was the correct brush replacements but nope. Mine was just the original series not the E-series. So for me a wasted buy!</li>
            <li> The recent package was purchased as a back up to the brush I was using (down to my last brush)....I opened the package last month (July) and within 3 weeks the magnet broke off of the base.  I began using the 2nd one and it did the same thing.....neither are useable and both are like new.........they were opened past the return date.........I feel they should be replaced with another pair, I&#x27;ve never had this problem in the past and have used them for years.......PLEASE MAKE GOOD MY PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are priced right and are  of great quality! I would recommend them to anyone. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these brushes. They are the cheapest parts for my tooth brush I have ever seen.  Who knows where they are manufactured. Beware because it could damage you tooth brush are your teeth.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes work fine. They&#x27;re stiffer than the original (4-year-old) one), and I like that.&lt;br /&gt;My only minor concern was that delivery (from China) took longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> If you have Philips Sonicare toothbrushes this is a great way to automatically receive head replacements when you need them, at a good discount, and right to your door.  The product met my expectations and was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> The brush head is too small, almost like a child size. The product description does not state that prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> As usual, this Philips Sonicare Rocks.  Juts don&#x27;t actively brush using it, just move it slowly around; first, so it says in the manual; second, you will mess up your brush head in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads broke down after several weeks of normal use, it stopped working suddenly, the brush head would not vibrate as hard as before and it could not be used to clean teeth. I am currently using the other one, hope it could last longer.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but they last a long time (I probably use mine too long, think ~9 months or so). And dear god is it better than the cheap ones that emit that ear deafening banshee screech when you turn on your brush.</li>
            <li> After replacing , I felt as though I were using a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Works great.</li>
            <li> received as promised.</li>
            <li> They came quickly, brand new and really needed the replacement.  I like Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare!!  I like being able to buy them cheaper through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> Makes a terrible noise---doesn&#x27;t seem to fit like the last refills purchased. Also, the brushes are already worn in a very short amount of time. Product seems inferior to previous refills.</li>
            <li> Very low price and came very quickly.  Would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Original equipment but cheapest I found.</li>
            <li> Great value and these are getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> Piece Of Crap !  Cost a small fortune...  They are so noisy i cannot even use them...  Tried putting in foam ear protectors but it just amplified it that much more !!  Have had this problem before when i bought generic replacement heads..!  So i buys this thinking they are original and got some generic crap !  Very disappointed and will have to spend even more now at walmart !</li>
            <li> Love my sonic tooth brush and these are necessary.</li>
            <li> So much better priced here.  They can be expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush and being able to order the brush-head replacements w/ no tax or shipping (or trying to find them in a bricks and mortar store) makes this purchase a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Philips replacement heads and some of the chain store brand replacement heads.  These work better, but I don&#x27;t know why or how.  Also, this price was not bad.</li>
            <li> Compatible with my sonicare toothbrush and I didn&#x27;t have to wait very long for them to be shipped to me. They are not flimsy and work very well with my toothbrush for a fraction of the price I would find in  most stores.</li>
            <li> as promised fits right and works just like the original brush head and all that at a great price too</li>
            <li> I only gave these three stars because they seem to be a little rough. When I am brushing my teeth my my whole head is vibrating. But they do a great job with cleaning. So it is a toss up. Also I have only been using them for a couple of days maybe I just haven&#x27;t broken them in yet? We will have to see.</li>
            <li> I liked the minimalist packaging the company used. Just enough to get the job done, and not what most companies use to survive the zombi apoplectic ending..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I am just disgusted with these last brush heads. I have used Sonicare for at least 10 years and I will say I have never had a problem before. This time one works the other doesn&#x27;t. After much inspection I found that the magnets which makes it operate move around. I can make it work but must make sure the magnets are in the correct position every time I use it. At what they cost - this should not happen.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.  No problems with seller.</li>
            <li> Bought these to use on an older Sonicare which has seen better days. Watching Amazon for a Sonicare deal and will end up buying an entire new unit.</li>
            <li> These are the name brand ones and fit well. They are great because they are cheaper here than at cosco.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  The first head broke within a week.  Made a very loud buzzing noise for a few days then just stopped working (looked like the magnet seperated at the bottom).  Now, the 2nd head is showing early signs of doing the same after about 3 weeks.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never ordered these, they have been returned. I still have 6 to go. Its been a nightmare</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads seem to be legit. I would have loved a better price, but at least knowing that I got the real thing for my money helps. I hope they hold up for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This product is the way to go. get them by the packs if it is the machine that you use. Phillips make them great and well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the head for my now older Sonicare electric tooth brush that doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one brushing anymore.  however these heads are great and last longer even at 2-3 times a day of usage than the box says.  They have helped me greatly and I will continue to use them until I must buy a new Sonicare foe sure.</li>
            <li> Attached to old body and they worked great. The new brushed do make a difference from one in use for over a year.</li>
            <li> I have an older e-series, and the product number on it is HX5300.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would fit, but a CSR at Phillips told me they would.  He was right - fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> these are the replacement toothbrush heads for the sonicare tooth brush which my wife stated works great. this is very usefull product to fight cavities</li>
            <li> this product has been serving me for the last 3 yrs. and keeps me out of the Dentist chair a lot they work very well and the PRICE is right.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon and Sonicare !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare since it first became available and I love it as much now as I did then---and you KNOW I&#x27;ve gone through a bunch of refills for it!  The price per unit here cannot be beat, not even if you buy the big bulk pack form a club store. My shipments always arrive well packaged in easy to open packaging.  I&#x27;ll have this on auto-ship for as long as they&#x27;re available.  ;o)</li>
            <li> My best friend has been raving about his Sonicare Elite for over a year now-- encouraging me to try it.  I did a little research and saw that OralB had a similar product and wondered which had a better product-- Sonicare or Oral B.  My friend finally convinced me that the Sonicare product is superior, and then I read a review on Amazon from a hygenist who said that she went to a continuing education seminar and learned that Oral B was found to be superior...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I decided to do some research. I found a Northwestern University study conducted over a 6 month period.  Patients with the Sonicare did much better, but don&#x27;t take my word for it.  Read the study results for yourself on the National Institute of Health web site:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Overall, this study demonstrates that long-term use of these two electric toothbrushes improves periodontal health in adult periodontitis patients, and that the Sonicare brush is superior to the Braun [Oral B] brush in reducing gingival inflammation and probing depth. Moreover, 6 months&#x27; use of Sonicare led to actual improvement in probing attachment levels of periodontal pockets.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a terrific toothbrush. You will never go back to a regular brush. My dentist recommended this because I was getting receeding gums and \\&quot;deep pockets\\&quot;. It really made a difference.</li>
            <li> When it was time to replace the brushheads that came with my eSeries toothbrush I experimented with one of the less expensive non-Sonicare products but sent them back since they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well..! I&#x27;m glad I spent the extra money on these.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It is powerful; looks good; brushes last about 6 months.  The 2-minute timer trains the user to brush thoroughly.  I would rate this device with 5 stars except I feel the replacement brush heads are overly priced.</li>
            <li> Usually hard to find because of the age and great price.</li>
            <li> One was perfect, one did not fit well and lead to water leakage and corrosion.</li>
            <li> They work perfect like original</li>
            <li> These are great. Brush heads are a little stiffer than other replacements I have used but are the way I like them. Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads fit my Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrush perfectly.  Why shouldn&#x27;t they, they are the Phillips Sonic brand..</li>
            <li> I wish they came with more replacement brush heads to reduce the price per brush head.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Nothing to note.</li>
            <li> Love the brush but the replacements don&#x27;t seem to fit quite right as they make a lot of noise and don&#x27;t have the movement of the originals.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is perfect would not use anything else so appreciate getting brushes from Amazon --they are just perfect too</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Saved my teeth</li>
            <li> Love these sonicare series brushes. I&#x27;ve purchased other brands brushes instead of the original and have found them to be very sub standard. I love these brushes and the price is reasonable enough.</li>
            <li> Sonicare, had one for close to 20 years, has helped me to keep my teeth!, good quality replacemnt head, cover for head is redesigned and stays on better now.</li>
            <li> Floss and use Sonicare!  Great for periodontal issues.  I also like Colgate complete/Crest ProHealth toothpaste, Plax pre-rinse to loosen up tartar, and Breath RX mouthwash/mints/gum.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine! My granddaughter loves the Hape dollhouse accessories. The toothbrushes are the correct ones and do a good job.</li>
            <li> Great price and got it super fast with my prime membership.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant about the quality of these headbrushes.  They are great and a great price!  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and will continue to order from amazon.</li>
            <li> The last two replacement heads I bought either split open at the neck or the base of the brush head.. They use to make them a lot better.  It is still a good product however.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and by the time I opened the package, my window for returning this item had passed. One of the two brush heads was defective and sounded like a lawn mower on the Sonicare base. Unfortunately, it is unworkable, and now I am stuck having paid for two brushes that only half work. I will NOT order from them again! Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> I think all of you who still use this older model Sonicare will agree that the design of the device is horrible- impossible to clean  the innards of the \\&quot;bell\\&quot; where it screws onto the power unit - it can become utterly GROSS unless carefully and constantly cleaned and attended to. These \\&quot;old school\\&quot; replacement units ARE good quality- 5 stars on that account- but the DESIGN is awful.  The latest version Sonicare fixes all of that and is FIRST CLASS.  I have a new model- love it -but still use my old one in my RV, hence this purchase and review.</li>
            <li> Totally works like new.  I looked at slightly cheaper compatible brands and decided that the OEM was worth it given that the main complaint was noise on the non Philips replacements.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy 6 at Costco because that&#x27;s just too many at one time since I&#x27;m the only one that uses this kind of toothbrush.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Better than the knock off clones.</li>
            <li> I bought a set for myself and one for my brother. We use these everyday. Great product.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your quick service.  This product arrived in a timely fashion and the product was in good condition.  I appreciate your service</li>
            <li> I feel that this brush has helped my gums.  Improved my mouth hygiene.  And in general has really improved my oral care.</li>
            <li> I switched over to electric toothbrushes a 5 years back (and to Sonicare a couple of years later), and there is no looking back. Ever since I made this change, the amount of tartar build up has been significantly diminished. My visits to the dentist for cleaning have become extremely tolerable, as the dental hygienist has very little to do ! Well, you do pay quite a bit for this advantage - the heads cost much more than the usual (ie, non electric) toothbrush does, and I have had to replace the base once in 5 years (costs ~ 110$).  Overall, though the advantages far outweigh the costs....and I am sure the company knows this, so don&#x27;t expect the heads (or brush) to become any cheaper. .</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price anywhere on these brushes.And the automatic delivery every 6 months is great.Don&#x27;t have to remember to order.</li>
            <li> These brushes never go on sale in the store so this is a fair deal.  They were recommended by my dentist and I think it cleans better than conventional manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this product, but have just subscribed to your service of sending new repolacement heads at specified intervals.  My first order arrived quickly, with no problem whatsoever, and as far as I can tell, this plan is going to work out fine.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes fit perfectly and were just like the one that came with the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEF1VO Philips Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Compact (2-Pack)]]  Very good price. Quick delivery. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> FAST EFFICIENT DELIVERY -- HAVE USED SONICARE FOR 15 YEARS -- MY DENTIST LOVES ME</li>
            <li> Beside the Phillips Sonicare tooth brush being superior to most other brands, the brushes are the key to having wonderful teeth.  The pricing on Amazon is unbeatable.  These replacement brushes are pretty expensive if not bought on Amazon.  This is truly a win-win item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  We tried store-brand and they buzzed very annoyingly.  These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> These are not OEM Sonicare brushes. Very disappointed. They are loud and very abrasive. The toothbrush on the left is the one I received via Amazon. The coloring is wrong, the labeling is incorrect. It is right next to an unopened package of heads from Costco. Far better deal to buy them there. Compare for yourself and you will see - these are NOT authentic.</li>
            <li> Great replacement brushes.  Arrived on time, packaged well.  Great price too!  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hygienist says my teeth and gums look so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare, and love these replacement heads for when the bristles go.  I think they last a lot longer than the strip indicates.</li>
            <li> Althought I had to replace it with ProResults, but I really loved it. I have been using this model for more than 5 years and no complaint. Just want to get something new. :)</li>
            <li> I cannot help but wonder if these are actually Philips brand. They work okay, but are very loud. The only other time the toothbrush felt loud was when I bought generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the heads we needed and work perfectly for our bases.  No complaints and I will probably order these again.</li>
            <li> Ordering and receiving this product was easy and quick. Perfect way to make shopping easy. The price was acceptable also.</li>
            <li> Good price, cheaper than I found at Target.  Comes with two replacement heads.  Was in retail packaging.  Bought from Amazon.com not from an individual seller.  Each head has a plastic brush head cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit my old Essence model (from 2009).  Works well.  Brush heads are what I would call firm.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It definitely has improved my brushing experience . The Brush heads last for at least 3 months. My dentist commented that there is much improvement once I started using the product. The shipment was fast too.</li>
            <li> Have been usung the Philipps tooth brush for years and needed the replacement heads.  I was surprised at the low price compared to the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Best price I could find for these anywhere. Have used these and the unit for over a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s been 2 years since a checkup and the dentist said my teeth where very clean considering the time without a cleaning. I do brush 2 times or more a day if possible, floss occasionally ( doc said to floss more), and very very very seldom miss a brushing.  Don&#x27;t like paying so much for these brushes, but looks like it pays off.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used Phillips tooth brushes for years now and they always perform well and are easy to keep charged. The replacement brush heads we have scheduled for a twice yearly purchase (from Amazon) are always here on time allowing us to maintain the highest level of tooth care!</li>
            <li> I have had these for a month and I have not had any of the issues listed below. Great item.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered---and what my teeth needed!</li>
            <li> The price is indicative.</li>
            <li> Excellent at cleaning teeth!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Great gum stimulation Great cleaning ability. The accessory heads are hard to find in stores so I buy them at a good price on Amazon. GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> do not buy these ... opened box tonight, product return expired, but needed them as toothbrush replacement. both heads were faulty, 1/4 size bristles, cut and misshapen. worthless. cannot make return, feel cheated for defective product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes and brush-heads for a dozen years now and this is the first time (2014) I&#x27;ve experienced bad quality. Each of the two heads in the package (one I was using, the other - my son, in his identical E-series) experienced the same problem: only a couple of months into using it, the brush started making a strong noise and the vibration weakened significantly, to the point where it wasn&#x27;t cleaning at all. I looked carefully at the brush and noticed that the base of the head, which contains a couple of rare-earth magnets, seated on a steel plate, had become loose and was hanging on the plastic tab that protrudes from a hole in the plate (see accompanying pictures). The exact same problem on each brush-head, a clear sign of poor design and execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and fixed the brush-head by separating the plate from the base of the head, and the magnets - from the plate, and gluing them with superglue, and now the brush is working just fine. But why should one have to do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, Philips is outsourcing not only the manufacture but also the design of those, in which case one has to ask themselves why not get an aftermarket replacement (like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NN07NT0?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage) - it might not be any better but at least it would be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Have worked out very nicely.</li>
            <li> they make your teeth and gums feel clean</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I have been using these brush heads for a few years and have bought from amazon before, but these&lt;br /&gt;brush heads are too &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34;. They feel like they are working on overdrive and hurts my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I like or expected</li>
            <li> I recently switched from a regular brush, to the Philips Sonicare and I love it. These replacement brush heads, fit perfectly and are great. I would buy from this vendor again, and recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> *Do not* buy the off brand replacement heads, unless you like to be able to hear your spouse/s.o/partner brush their teeth all the way in the farthest bathroom downstairs whilst they&#x27;re upstairs.</li>
            <li> Although this is an older brand of toothbrush, the replacement brushes worked perfectly. Everything worked great and the products shipped on time - I am very happy!</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, and the units fit my base, however the fit is a little off, and the brush protector is not the same as others i&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> ...you don&#x27;t really have many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use a Sonicare \\&quot;e\\&quot; series in our house.&lt;br /&gt;Just as with other products that include consumable parts (think printers and razor blades), once you&#x27;ve decided on the base unit, you end up with limited options for for the consumables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work --no surprise-- perfectly with our Sonicare e series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Select with confidence.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dental hygienist many years ago so have used it/them for years. What else is there to say. Done</li>
            <li> As long as our e-series battery units keep charging, I&#x27;ll keep buying these exact replacement brush heads.  Very Fair price and came in an original Phillips Sonicare brush head box.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> We have had these toothbrushes for about 8 years now and they are still going strong. We are very pleased with the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with a Philips Sonicare  toothbrush. I will order them again. They work well.</li>
            <li> This item is great. A great replacement for the old one. The sensitive head is also great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are exact brush head replacements for the Philips unit. If you like the product well enough to buy replacements, what else matters?</li>
            <li> The brush head replacement started out fine but in a couple of days it started to make a loud buzzing noise in operation. Tried replacing etc but still is very noisy. It works, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same amount of vibration as the original brush, oh well the noise helps me wake up in the morning lol. Classic &amp;#34; get what you pay for&amp;#34; example.</li>
            <li> These are an exact replacement for the e series and they are delivered to my door at a price that is less than what I can buy them locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.</li>
            <li> i love my sonicare. These are great but I would strongly suggest upgrading to a newer model that uses the brush heads that are just the stick part. the bottom part of these can get pretty grungy and are a bit of a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> These are the right head for the old type sonicare brushes.  This price beat all the local stores and the service was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> These brushes performed as well as the more expensive ones sold in drug stores.  I was very pleased with my purchase and the shipper.</li>
            <li> These are better than the originals as the slim angled neck reaches hard-to-clean areas and the come in standard and compact brush sizes.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and worked better than generic brand I had before.</li>
            <li> Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shiopping</li>
            <li> These were defective. This is not the first time I&#x27;ve had problems buying Sonicare products on Amazon. It must be a supplier problem. Never again. I&#x27;d rather pay more and get what I need.</li>
            <li> as excepted thank you for the fast delivery too</li>
            <li> they do not last very long. it&#x27;s a so so brush. there are better out there</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great product and increasingly hard to find.  They were reasonably priced and arrived on time.  I&#x27;m very happy.  Kind of a reminder of the way things once were and should be today.</li>
            <li> needed them and easier than finding them in the store!</li>
            <li> Arrived and works as expected.</li>
            <li> One of the units I purchased quit working after a month.</li>
            <li> Replacements are always needed, nothing special. Sonicare is an amazing brand. You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying one of their brush heads.</li>
            <li> Seller sent me a counterfeit knockoff. It is very different from the original head that came with my Sonicare brush handle. This fake thing vibrates very awkward with a very loud noise. a useless crap</li>
            <li> These heads fit my old Sonicare handle even though they look different from the heads it originally came with. I actually like them better as they are more contoured than the old ones. Delivery was extremely prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read in other reviews people believe sometimes Amazon gets stuck with knock offs i e fake rip offs. These must be them. I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for years. Never have I seen bristles as stiff as those on these brushes. It feels like you are using a wire brush. And your gums look like it afterwards. One use and I ended up having to go to the dentist. Bottom line is DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good price for these replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> They work fine in our brush.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads worked well with my Philips Sonicare, and they arrive quite fast.  Pleased with the purchase overall.</li>
            <li> The brush heads arrived completely destroyed.  It appears that the bristles had been cut down to the base and were almost flush with the plastic.  I could tell they had been cut down as there were also one or two rogue bristles that were as long as they should have been.  I don&#x27;t know what happened but I would not buy these brush replacements from this vendor.</li>
            <li> We purchased these brush heads because of the excellent price.  My wife has been using one of the brush heads in her Sonicare electronic toothbrush. Works great - no problems.  She will use/test the other one in due time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an old Sonicare I love which they don&#x27;t make original brush heads for.&lt;br /&gt;These fit. Long stem reaches into the back of the mouth and small heads allow&lt;br /&gt;for detailed find teeth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The color fades off gradually to show you when they need to be changed but&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just a gimmick.  I&#x27;m sure you can judge for yourself when you need a new&lt;br /&gt;brush head.&lt;br /&gt;If you have an older model Sonicare like me look at the bottom of these.&lt;br /&gt;If yours requires the type of brushheads that screw on at the bottom these&lt;br /&gt;will fit.</li>
            <li> Previously bought these and they were great. This time, both brush heads have issues.  One of the brush heads is LOUD when turned on.  We have tried many ways to adjust it, even put WD40 on the base before attaching it and it hasn&#x27;t helped.  The brush head stops working when I put the slightest amount of pressure on it.  Not happy with the latest purchase.</li>
            <li> New brushes feel really great on your gums and keep them clean and refreshing. Replacing the handle is the next purchase that I need to make. After 4 years, it&#x27;s time for a new handle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe anyone brushes their teeth with a normal toothbrush! You&#x27;ll know what I mean after you use sonicare.  Your teeth feel so much cleaner. You can rub your tongue against your teeth without feeling any grime. I love it. Pair it with some mouthwash and you have a much healthier mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the replacement heads- this is the cheaper you will find it. Especially if you use subscribe and save.  Grocery stores have the generic version which are NOT GOOD.  Even BB&amp;B are more money with a coupon. Amazon all the way.</li>
            <li> MY TEETH FEEL CLEAN AFTER EACH USE.  I LIKE HOW EASY IT IS TO USE AND THE BRISTLES HOLD UP GOOD.  I BOUGHT A PACKAGE OF SIX TODAY TO KEEP ON HAND.</li>
            <li> I like it better than a regular tooth brush.  It forces you to brush properly.  Not sure my dentist noticed a difference.  The brushes are expensive to replace.  It tells you to replace them every three months but if you want to replace them more often be prepared to shell out close to $30.00 each time.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great for keeping your teeth clean. They work very well. A little expensive but worth it to save money from expensive dental work.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work great with my Sonicare electric toothbrush. Easy to install and remove. Very happy. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Works fine and I&#x27;m happy with it&#x27;s performance.  Will buy again..</li>
            <li> The best place to buy the heads for my toothbrush...  Good service and good price..</li>
            <li> I just received these replacement heads. The bristles on both were defective. They appear as if they were cut in half. Strange. I&#x27;m in the process of receiving a refund.</li>
            <li> thils product was not what was shown in the picture and as such we were unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> excellent toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and received quickly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these replacement brush heads seemed to fit my older Sonicare fine, but would not vibrate properly. The sonicare brush was the same size and style of the current models, however the replacement brush heads just didn&#x27;t work. It was a couple of months after purchase that I attempted to use them, so I threw them in the trash.</li>
            <li> First of all these brushes arrived in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;Second, they are both defective. Unfortunately one does not know that they are defective until you unpack it and use them.&lt;br /&gt;Do not order from this provider.</li>
            <li> One of them was defective and I haven&#x27;t use the other one yet.  I&#x27;ve bought refills before, this was the first time I had defective one.  3 stars because the sonic care itself is awesome.</li>
            <li> They came on time and packaged well. One of these had a magnet glued on wrong and didn&#x27;t work at all. After removing it and regluing it in the proper position, it worked fine. A poor quality issue.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Easy!!!!</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money on OEM for this. We have gotten the generic 2 times before and they do not last or work properly. The generic also rusts over time.</li>
            <li> One of the brush heads lasted three weeks.  The head of brush dislodged with no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare e-series brush and heads.  My dental hygiene has greatly improved while using this product, and my teeth are a lot brighter.  This does an amazing job at removing plaque, and massaging gums. I wouldn&#x27;t upgrade to a higher quality brush unless the price difference is not an issue. These heads are amazing at brushing teeth.  Some complain about buildup inside the brush head.  I haven&#x27;t had this happen with a generic replacement head, but I&#x27;ve noticed the issue with these original Sonicare brush heads.  Overall, it&#x27;s not too bothersome and I would never go with another toothbrush or replacement head.  I change my replacement heads every 1/2 year so the cost of using the brush is $1.83 per month.  This is about 20 cents more than a buying manual toothbrushes every (recommended) 3 months.  Initial cost is of course higher but so is the reward!</li>
            <li> This new style brush fits and works perfectly in my Sonicare.  It is easier to rinse and keep clean. Just a few simple guidelines.  Remove and rinse the brush head after EVERY use. Clean the brush handle under the cap and towel dry after each use.  And do not put the brush head back on until you use it.  Let everything air dry. This way you will never have any tooth paste buidup or anything growing inside the brush head base.  It only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I ordered the double pack of Phillips Sonicare e- series replacement brush heads and was very happy with the price I paid and the brush heads as well.  Also so happy they included the clear cover for the brush head as I had lost the original.  I would definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> What a difference a new toothbrush makes! This fit perfectly in my e-series and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> These have gotten expensive!  Already have the charging base and handle, have to buy the replacement heads.  I usually go to Bed bath and Beyond with my 20% off coupon, but with the price increasing and the fact they&#x27;re always out of stock, tried amazon.  Cheaper and free shipping.  Will keep an eye on the price for next time. Score.  Plus, the sonicare works better than others with the round oscillating heads, they just make a mess, tried those too.</li>
            <li> Works just like original and had no luck with the generic version. Bought for boyfriend and he was happy camper</li>
            <li> As good as those I have purchased at Target.</li>
            <li> But I suggest going with an oral-b. But a lot of people I know like the sonic care. Tough call.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush! Have been using it for years. The heads seem to last a reasonable time. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great item. After reading some of the other reviews, i was a bit uncomfortable buying these items online. Some were saying the magnets were cheap or the bristle heads were soft. Well here is my review. These items were perfect. Fit perfect. Worked perfect. The bristle heads were not too soft, they were just right. Maybe depends on what company you buy them from and how much you pay for them. Even though they may all have the same name brand box, be leary of prices that are too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Works.  By the way, do not buy the Kroger brand knockoffs of these, they do not work properly, only the Philips ones do.</li>
            <li> The name brand Sonicare replacement brush heads work far better than the generic replacement heads. The power of the system is better than the generic heads and the bristles are far better.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my toothbrush. They just do not screw all the way down so it makes a loud buzzing sound and doesn&#x27;t clean well. Be careful ordering these!</li>
            <li> My recent order arrived. The replacement brushes are so short they look like they have been cut back to the plastic head. If I use them it will be hard plastic on my teeth. I don&#x27;t know what happened to these replacement heads. I&#x27;m sending them back.</li>
            <li> fit perfect on my &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; Sonicare</li>
            <li> excellent product-no problems.  Sonicare brushes are far more effective than other brands of electric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; brush.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fit like they used to. This one makes a very loud buzzing sound when attached. Also in certain positions the vibrational energy doesn&#x27;t seem to move the brush head which makes brushing no better than a regular tooth brush. It takes fiddling with the head to get the thing to work right. I don&#x27;t recall ever having these problems in the past.</li>
            <li> I have a very old model and could not find any replacement heads ,called the manufacture and then did a search and found it... YEAH..did not want to throw out something that still worked really well just need replacement head...Thank you</li>
            <li> The brush heads are exactly what i was looking for to replace the old ones I had. They are great.</li>
            <li> I would have purchased a different Sonicare if I had known how expensive these are.</li>
            <li> fit my toothbrush perfectly. great product.</li>
            <li> Great value on this product. That&#x27;s all I can say about a smaller head toothbrush that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;OK?</li>
            <li> These brush heads are so easy to replace. I thought it would be complicated but it&#x27;s very easy. I was please that you get 2 in a pack.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.  We passed on our toothbrush to the kids, so we needed new brush heads.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> We have had our sonicare toothbrushes for about 4 years now and, since newer models are sold in stores, I have not been able to find brush head replacements in stores.  The toothbrush still works great and with the option of brush head replacements, its a cost saver.</li>
            <li> very good quality and price</li>
            <li> these brush heads are workhorses.they are small enough to fit comfortably in your mouth and have a built in timer to guide the length of brushing needed to produce a sparklingly clean feeling for your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect fit for my Sonicare toothbrush. They work great and keep my teeth nice and healthy. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> After using the new Elite Sonicare for about a month now, I can tell you this thing works! I got the Elite as a gift from my sister-in-law, who is a dentist and was giving them away before they hit the market. Now, I don&#x27;t have to sit in &amp;quot;the chair&amp;quot; because my teeth feel great! The ads are true: Give this product one month and you&#x27;ll notice a difference. Actually...with a dentist in the family, who am I kidding? I&#x27;ll still have to get my regular checkup, but maybe I can avoid that sand polishing number...</li>
            <li> I have owned the Elite Pro for 1 year and the instructions recommended changing toothbrush heads once every six months.  I am now going on my 5th toothbrush head because 2 of the 4 were broken within 2 weeks of use.  Basically, I noticed they just were not vibrating like when they were new.  The same problem occurred on 2 of the heads.  One of the metal strips responsible for producing the vibration broke loose and basically reduced its vibrating power by 50%.  It is just poor quality control when the toothbrush has more power than the toothbrush head can handle.  On the upside, it works great when it works, and the battery lasts 2 weeks using it twice a day, so no need to pack the relatively small recharger on vacation.</li>
            <li> Good service, good price. I&#x27;m quite happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have had this tooth brush for over 5 years. Using this brush twice a day, plus flossing has kept my teeth and gums in excellent health. I debated about getting refills this time. However, cleaning up my base and refills did the trick. The base is still going.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to keep it clean inside. You can forget to do that. I thought it was beyond saving. It was not. Still working after all&lt;br /&gt;these years. A very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazonians, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The brush-head that came with my toothbrush is starting to get frazzled, and it&#x27;s time to start looking for new heads.  (My father always said he wanted to see me get a head...) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely unhappy about having to spend $10 per head.  I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be getting what I pay for, because: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The heads are small.  I&#x27;ve never chosen a \\&quot;compact head,\\&quot; but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s available for the Sonicare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The bristles are a combination of soft, extra-soft, and uselessly-soft bristles.  I assume that extra-soft bristles have a shorter lifetime than normally-soft bristles, which aggravates the megaprice problem.  Maybe the first couple of days using the Sonicare delivers an overwhelming experience (not really) that&#x27;s best overcome with extra-soft bristles, but at this point, I would be happy to have a head full of normally-soft bristles.  Unfortunately, dissatisfyingly extra-soft bristles are all that&#x27;s available for the Sonicare. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The fat bottom of the head disallows putting the Sonicare far enough into my mouth to brush the back of my tongue, so I wind up having to keep a real toothbrush around, anyway.  Even if I could fit the head back there, it would be too small for the job, due to my big tongue.  Pardon my tangent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Because the Sonicare is so effective, neither the head&#x27;s softness nor smallness is much of a drawback.  By leaving the scrubbing motions to the device, I&#x27;m able to spend more attention to aiming accurately and evenly, to avoid overscrubbing, to avoid falling asleep from boredom, and it does a better job than I could.  If I could do it all over, I would choose the Sonicare again over the old method, but I&#x27;m still sickened by the single-option of expensive, minimum-value and minimum-lifetime heads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;(The real sticker-shock will happen when I have to throw away the Sonicare because the integrated Ni-Cad batteries cannot be replaced, but only mutilatingly removed for recycling.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I give the heads 2-out-of-5 Amazonian stars because although they work, they take undue advantage of the customer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best luck, &lt;br /&gt;           -Neil-</li>
            <li> We have had this product in oru homes for 3 years.  The toothbrush heads have always fit the base and work as they should.</li>
            <li> This brush head is a full size brush.  Only the compact brushes are available in my area.  A full size brush provides much better cleaning than a compact.  The dentist recommends replacing the toothbrush every 6 months.  These brushes easily last much longer than the recommended time, but I replace them anyway.  Will order them again in Sep 07.</li>
            <li> I really like this teeth cleaning system, and Amazon is an easy and cost effective way to get replacements.  They even mail me reminders that I need to switch out the heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit upset that I go through these brushes so fast, but they do a good job with cleaning. The box says they should last for several weeks, however I&#x27;ve found that any longer then a month or a month and a half and I&#x27;m very disappointed with performance as well as feel.</li>
            <li> Unable to evaluate because I bought the wrong sonicare brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare company does not make the package easy to open.  I ended up ripping the plastic cover and to my chagrin, it was the wrong brush head for my electric toothbrush.  I needed the sonicare intellicare brush head.  Needless to say, since I ruined the hard plastic cover, I figured it would be inappropriate to try and exchange it.  Be sure you know your  sonicare toothbrush series or name before ordering.  I thought I knew mine.....I was dead wrong.  My fault. If I would have kept the box that the electric toothbrush came in, I would not have made this $27.00 error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intellicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Well, if you bought the toothbrush, you will have to buy replacement heads once in a while. They do a good job, but they are expensive, even though they are cheaper than in most stores.</li>
            <li> Best price I was able to find, just what I needed for my Sonicare Elite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare toothbrush for the past 4 years on the recommendation of my dentist, and I would never ever go back to a traditional toothbrush... there&#x27;s just no comparison in terms of dental hygiene. These replacement heads are well worth the money, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a B&amp;M store with a better price than Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It allows you to set a timer and will automatically stop after 2 or 2.5 minutes.  It has a quick pause that alerts you to change the area you are brushing.  The head is easy to replace and it cleans thoroughly and completely. My dentist and I are both pleased with how much better my regular checkups are!  Of course, she isnt making as much money off of me any longer!!  hehe!!</li>
            <li> For years my uncle told me this would really make a difference in my dental health.  I didn&#x27;t really beleive him plus Sonicare cost so much more than the brand I was using.  When I had a major dental problem and my dentist told me that the my problem would not have been nearly as bad ( or costly) had I used Sonicare.  The cost for Sonicare is nothing compared to my dental bill.  I am a Sonicare user now and can really tell a difference in the way my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li> I purchased the SonicCare Elite toothbrush in December 2006.  My Dental Hygienist recommended it.  I am a traditional kind of guy and resisted for a while but finally relented and came into the 21st Century of dental care! What an experience.  Since that time my cleanings have been much quicker and easier, and my teeth feel sparkling, fresh, and have that \\&quot;just cleaned feeling\\&quot; all the time. Best of all my teeth and gums are healthier too. To keep the brush working in top form, you have to replace the brush heads every 6 months.  They are quite expensive but worth every penney.  If you want to have healthier teeth and gums and minimize your dental expenses, you will be very pleased with the SonicCare Elite brush and regular refills! Don&#x27;t be stuck in the 20th Century of dental health......Buy a SonicCare Elite and refills today.      In December 2008 I upgraded to a Sonicare Flex-care system. The Elite switch failed and was very poorly designed.  The new Flexcare handle incorporates a new switch design and the who brush head is smaller, attaches more easily to the handle, is less to throw away when used up, and does a better job.</li>
            <li> Although the battery on my sonicare elite doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long anymore, the quality of the brush is very high. Brushing with anything else just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare replacement brushes were great.  but even better was the whole process and how easy it was.  thumbs up.</li>
            <li> the sonicare toothbrush is awesome. I have used one for years. Great checkups, gums in great shape, and my teeth look and just feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, came highly recommended by friends. I love it! I have been using it now for over 6 months and I haven&#x27;t used a regular brush since then! It would be practically impossible to get teeth as clean with a regular brush. GET ONE! It&#x27;s dentist recommended!</li>
            <li> Amazon provides an efficient service to send me the Philips Sonicare replacement brushes at intervals I chose. This is a great service.  Philips Sonicare product helps me maintain good dental hygeine reports.  Using this electric tooth brush helps to keep the tartar buildup under control, thus preventing gum problems.</li>
            <li> I received the sonic toothbrush replacements and immediately put one on my existing toothbrush...what a difference!!  Wish I would have replaced them sooner!!  Love the product and the way my teeth feel after brushing![[ASIN:B00008BFXL Philips Sonicare Elite (E-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]</li>
            <li> The Product (Sonicare Elite) replacement Brush heads, I found to be of good quality and it performs as well as I expected and will repeat the process when the time comes around again fro replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, matches up to model, saves me from hunting for the correct brush-head in stores. My teeth sparkle again! Good job, Amazon.</li>
            <li> TWICE THIS YEAR I HAVE RECEIVED DOUBLE SHIPMENTS OF THE PRODUCT AND HAVE TRIED REPEADTEDLY TO RETURN ONE OF THEM BUT COULD NOT DO SO. PLEASE CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP IN THE AMAZON AUTO RE-ORDER PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT AMAZON BY PHONE OR EMAIL TO CORRECT AN ERROR.[[ASIN:B00008BQVM Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]</li>
            <li> My dental care has been much easier and more fun since I got a Philips Sonicare Elite about two years ago. I know my brushing is longer and more thorough and with less effort.     I use the subscription service to purchase new brush heads.  The subscription service has been great.  I get two new brush heads per month to re-supply 4 toothbrushes - one at home, one at work, one for my husband, and one for my mother, i.e. I start a new brush head at least every two months.                    A new brush head feels so good!       Concerns:   (1)  The rubber on/off switch on my Philips Sonicare Elite toothbrush at home is starting to tear around the edges and cave in.  I am afraid that water will soon leak in and short out the battery.    (2)  The joint where the handle screws into the brush head leaks water into the handle, which if not cleaned daily can produce a foul smell. Thus I clean it daily.       All in all, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Directly out of the package the first issue was that I couldn&#x27;t get the toothbrush head cover off. I finally managed to wrangle it off but then noticed the fit was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; when connected to my base. This results in a very loud vibration / sound, not the standard buzz or hum. Maybe I&#x27;m just unlucky and got duds but I suspect they&#x27;re counterfits from China which is disappointing but the money is already spent and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the time or hassle of sending them back, particularly since my old head was thrown in the trash! Just buyer be warned - have a backup plan or prepare to return yours &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Losing plaque by the minute.  My dentist says my teeth are beautiful and much better than six months ago when I had alot of plaque he had to scrape off.  Barely scrapes anything anymore and my cleanings are a quick fifteen minute in and out.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, and I like it, the price was right, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as you would expect for replacement toothbrush heads.  Came in easy to open packaging (plastic bag), so there was no tricky plastic/boxes to open.  A good deal for the price as well.  Will be ordering my next replacements from the same place next time.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price and will probably buy again. My only complaint is I wish they were a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> The replacement head does not properly fit the toothbrush base. It is the same model as the brushhead I was previously using (e series). However, the metal piece inside where the magnet attaches doesn&#x27;t have a product code (like the brushhead I had been using). The font for &amp;#34;e series&amp;#34; is also slightly different. I suspect that this product is a knockoff.  Buy replacement heads from a more reputable dealer or risk getting brushheads that will not make a good enough connection with the magnet.</li>
            <li> I tried aftermarket and never again. Totally worth the cost of OEM parts that eliminate the vibration and noise of the off brands.</li>
            <li> They work; they fit the advertised model of electric toothbrush. Same quality as the originals that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have written a review on this product in the past.  The product is the best out in the market for my needs.  You can depend on Amazon to get your product to you in the time stated.  Amazon, usually, has the best prices on products if you have the Prime Membership.</li>
            <li> These refills fit my Sonicare perfectly and the price was good.  Will order again when these wear out and need replacement</li>
            <li> Although the bristles are a different color from the original heads, these replacements worked fine in the base unit. I had tried some generic replacements from a local drugstore, but they made a loud noise after being installed. These heads worked quietly.</li>
            <li> One was so loud I tossed it after a couple of days. The other one worked great and was as quiet as a new one.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads were as good as the original. I recommend them highly if you like your Sonicare brush. No complaints from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to order some more, actually!!</li>
            <li> I have an older model Sonicare toothbrush and can&#x27;t be bothered to upgrade to the new, fancy kinds. The trouble with that is these brush heads aren&#x27;t the easiest to find in stores. Thankfully, I can buy two at a time for a great price through Amazon. They work exactly as I expected. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just like recieving exactly as listed! these are the larger brush heads which I prefer over the small ones.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush (which is super reliable and great for my teeth and gums) but don&#x27;t love spending a lot on periodic replacement heads...</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is something I wish I&#x27;d started using 30 years ago. I hope they don&#x27;t change the design like they did after the first one I bought (had to throw away several spare heads, as the new handle/battery holder would not fit).</li>
            <li> AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL we have bought the Phillips Sonicare tooth brush for years and replacements this by far is the absolute worst replacements brush heads.  You get loose strains of tooth brush in your mouth........you can see the tooth brush strains and one is long, some are shorter.  Guess where these were made.....................????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always buy these. No one carries them anymore. The Equate ones are aweful. So I&#x27;m sticking to the Real Deal.</li>
            <li> Philips quality has drop[ed since they moved the production to China. One of these has a loose fitting and buzzes like a ....</li>
            <li> there are no brissels on the brush head  they look like they have been cut off</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for over twenty years.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare replacement heads did not function - in fact, they appeared to be knock-offs of the real deal. So, I was very dissatisfied with the product and had to return it. No idea where I can actually find replacement heads for my Sonicare that will actually work out of the packaging...</li>
            <li> I bought this before and they were great! But this time they horrible!! The brushes were missing off both toothbrushes!! I had to throw them away! I will ever buy them again on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about a toothbrush, but this style is hard to find.  They have changed the model number and it is difficult to match up.  This one works great.</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads... just wish they were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> We were very displeased with these replacement heads. They are made of a thinner plastic and make a lot more noise. They don&#x27;t screw on properly. I contacted Sonicare and they said they had not changed the heads, so I suspect counterfeiting. The Sonicare rep advised against purchasing replacements from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> One of the two heads were defective.  They sent me another set and those both worked.  After reading the reviews, I would not buy these.  Apparently these are either knock offs or seconds - not what you would expect from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> There were no bristles on the toothbrushes that arrived</li>
            <li> bulky to install, but this does a great job on the teeth without ruining the gums</li>
            <li> Fits well on my toothbrush and doesn&#x27;t make an awful noise like the generic brands do. I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the name brand and spent a little more for the quality.</li>
            <li> as always, great product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine - it&#x27;s what it is. I knew what I was buying</li>
            <li> How excited can you get over toothbrush heads??</li>
            <li> Cheap knock off with brush unevenly cut and SHORT! Will post photo if I can.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and quality of these.</li>
            <li> They work, but you might want to order earplugs to go with them. They&#x27;re not made to the same specs as the brush heads you buy with the battery/handle. They are LOUD!! Poor/no quality control.</li>
            <li> One of the heads worked fine; one was defective and did not vibrate when attached to the brush head. Not sure if this is a QA issue or what. I&#x27;m working on the return/refund.</li>
            <li> These fit my Sonicare handle just perfect!</li>
            <li> Keep breaking what did they change?&lt;br /&gt;look the same but don&#x27;t last..</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased these tooth brush heads via internet. I usually purchase them @ a local store.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem with the tooth brush heads before but the first one I used fell apart after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;The metal at the ends that fit in the toothbrush just fell apart. There were not dropped or mis treated in any way.  This most likely is just a defective fluke. However, after years of using the Sonicare and the e series toothbrush heads. I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying these at local supermarkets. Definitely recommend the sonicare toothbush. Yes it might cost more than the regular toothbrush but your teeth and gum will thank you for making the investment on the sonicare brush!</li>
            <li> charger is great and tooth brush are great too.boths item came on time and service was great.i will continue to buy in future.thanks for the great service.tooth brus was great too</li>
            <li> Using it for the past 5 years . It definitely cleaning the teeth much better the mechanical toothbrush, but needed to be changed at least every 3 months ( sometimes less) and it is  a little bit too expensive. But health are first</li>
            <li> The pharmacies and larger outlets near my home have stopped carrying Sonicare products for unknown reasons.  I was relieved to discover that I could order replacement toothbrush heads from Amazon at a decent price and with speedy delivery.  Since I use the Sonicare toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist, I was relieved that I could continue to do so without an interruption in my dental hygiene regimen.</li>
            <li> The product is just exactly what I was looking for.  I later found the heads at Wal-Mart.  The price/unit is cheaper at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, perfect fit and fast shipping</li>
            <li> These brushes were too loud and vibrated through too great a field.  Uncomfortable for  brushing.  I bought 2 more at Target and the Target brushes are working much better.</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed. No complaints. It was cheaper than what I would have purchased in the stores, and it came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the inside of these things becomes coated with mold. The only way I manage it is to either soak the base of the head in mouthwash, or thoroughly clean it out with a q-tip (or both). Either way, the mold just accumulates again pretty quickly. Also, my harsh cleaning methods have caused the metal part at the bottom to rust, which creates a whole new set of problems. Even with all of this, I still can&#x27;t clean every part, so the mold is never completely gone. It is just so disgusting to think that I am putting these things in/near my mouth ever day. I love the Sonicare, but these brushes really need to be designed better.</li>
            <li> If you have the toothbrush you need the replacement heads - no option but these - just buy a bunch so you never run out. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The  first brush tore at the base of the brush shaft after 3 weeks.  I decided to give the second one a try and it sounded like a drill and it also tore after 3 weeks!  I do not believe these were philips sonicare items but confederates.  Horrible.</li>
            <li> If you use the sonicare then you know this is a good deal on these heads. Best price i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for 5 years. I have bought genuine replacements and knock-offs and store brands. Thus far, only genuine replacements have worked 100% properly in our toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These non-genuine replacements buzz and vibrate loudly, yet not much vibration goes into the brush head where it counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These literally are a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should be described as non-oem or non-genuine and not give the impression that they are Philips brand at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am all about buying non-oem when it works as well.</li>
            <li> I have used these replacements before. They are very easy to change and they work very well on my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are not genuine OEM heads.  I got these and have been using them two days now.  There are multiple problems.  First, the head doesn&#x27;t screw on all the way, and there is a gap at the base.  Second, they are loud, they sound like a jet engine going off in your mouth.  It&#x27;s a really high pitched metallic sound.  Third and most important, they don&#x27;t vibrate like a sonicare brush should.  With even the slightest amount of pressure (i.e. touching the bristles to your teeth) they stop vibrating.  Also, the plastic on the insides of the heads seems rough and unfinished.  My base is fully charged and I&#x27;ve tried taking it off and putting it multiple times to make sure that wasn&#x27;t the problem.  Be wary of buying things from Antelope Pharma.</li>
            <li> Thought the brushes were a bit soft.  Nice, unexpected increase in cycle speed. Easy to install.  Delivery speed was great and package arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> We purchased these and found they must be defects because they stopped working after just a few days (no longer oscillated/twisted and made grinding noises).  We have never had this problem with any such brushes from regular retail outlets (incl. the ones we bought subsequent to these).</li>
            <li> It fit my base and works perfectly</li>
            <li> These worked out great but you can also buy these in packs of 6 or more for more cost savings. Keep in mind that there are groups that recycle the toothbrush heads if you feel terrible, like me, when you have to toss one of these out.</li>
            <li> Love these replacement brushes, they are just as great as the original and work perfect with my Sonicare toothbrushes, all of them.</li>
            <li> As many others have already said, what I received appear to be either non-OEM brush heads, or were defective in some way.  In my case, the bristles looked like they had been lopped off with a pair of scissors - they were less than 1/4 of an inch long and cut in a very irregular fashion. Brown cardboard packaging may or may not be from Philips... I will steer clear of these in the future. Thanks Amazon for the refund.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my Philips Sonicare HX7002/62 e-Series Standard Replacement Brush Heads!! And your prompt attention on my order got them to me really fast and that was so nice.  I am enjoying them very much, had been putting off buying them for a long time and finally broke down and got them because you had them at such a great price.  Thanks again for the fast and prompt delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole</li>
            <li> The item was new in the box and shipped very fast. They are good to fit my Philips Sonicare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised. New replacements. Work fine.</li>
            <li> The item I received is obviously counterfeit! It came in without a retail packaging, but rather in a brown box. Like the other reviewers said here, the brush heads were too stiff. It is no where near the real Philips Sonicare quality. It does not vibrate properly on my Sonicare brush handle. I compared these fake heads with my originals and immediately I can tell the differences! Stay away from it!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price for these especially if you still own one of the older model sonicare brushes. This will be the only place I&#x27;ll purchase my replacement heads</li>
            <li> I have diabetes which causes a lot of other problems such as gum disease and rapid tooth decay. These brushes have definitely saved my teeth. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived well packaged &amp; as&lt;br /&gt;advertised.  They are of high quality &amp; very&lt;br /&gt;well made.  Each has a tiny ring color coded&lt;br /&gt;for individual identity.</li>
            <li> Any one who use a Sonicare tooth brush-which my dentist recommended-will be pleased with this replacement and the price is right! All I know is that my teeth are better off with the total product.</li>
            <li> I was worried due to all the negative reviews. However, the two heads we ordered work just fine. We have (wife and I) been using Phillips Sonicare for a number of years and so far have had no problems except you must remove heads periodically and clean the mold that form inside. Every electric toothbrush I have ever used (got my DDS in 1964) has cleaning issues, but the job they do, and Phillips is the best in my experience, make it worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Should I have issues with these new Brush Heads, I will revisit this review.</li>
            <li> Great price. No problems.</li>
            <li> Exceptionally POOR quality. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years and never had a problem with the quality of their toothbrush heads until now. The soft plastic between the head and base ripped within a few uses on every head I purchased in this order. I went through 4 heads in 2 weeks because once the soft plastic isn&#x27;t there to cushion the vibrations and noise, you feel like you have a jackhammer in your mouth. I will be buying them from the store next time. These were clearly a knock off poorly executed. Save your money...do not buy.</li>
            <li> The quality of these heads is top-notch, from the original manufacturer.  Packaging is not for retail display, which is fine.  But the price is about the same as I found at Target, and by the time shipping is added this becomes a more expensive option than buying locally.</li>
            <li> OEM brushes, just in a cardboard box instead of the clamshell packaging that is so hard to open, and cardboard is so much easier to recycle!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all and they are not real Philips brand.  It was some fake product and now we are out $25 bucks.  Shame on you, Amazon - for allowing a fake product like this to be advertised and sold on this site.  What a complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare and have had one for many years. This is my third one and each gets better with new brushes.</li>
            <li> We were so excited to find these, since I don&#x27;t think you can in stores anymore. A little pricey, but they work!</li>
            <li> Have purchased the generic before. Always stick with the oem parts</li>
            <li> works the way hat it should.  It also makes a lot of noise</li>
            <li> Scam...these are replica and not real Sonicare as advertised...not even close to Sonicare quality...generic brands are even better than these.</li>
            <li> It fits my old SoniCare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;It is longer and really has a strong oscillation.&lt;br /&gt;Feels a little too harsh to me, but probably doing a better job.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have purchased a two-pack usually at Walmart for my Sonicare toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t get them at my local Walmart any longer and had previously tried the Equate version which I had to return because they didn&#x27;t work soI searched on-line.  This was a great price for a two-pack so I ordered them thinking that they would not be like the original Sonicare product that came with the toothbrush.  I was greatly surprised.  They arrived quickly and are identical to the original version.  You cannot tell them apart by looking or by performance.  I will certainly use this seller in the future when I buy my next replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Since all toothbrush heads need to be replaced regularly, we&#x27;ve opted to order extra Sonicare brush heads via Amazon. It&#x27;s perhaps possible to beat the price if one catches rebates plus sales; we prefer to order at this low price and not spend extra time looking for &amp;#34;better deals.&amp;#34; Super product for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Quick response and item as advertised.</li>
            <li> What can I say about tooth brush&#x27;s.  They clean teeth!!  No big deal.  So have a nice day.  AJ Kalan</li>
            <li> Do not buy. Brush heads looked like someone cut all the bristles off</li>
            <li> Terrible after market product. Bristles look like they have seen better days.</li>
            <li> These do not give the strong vibration of the full price heads. It honestly makes me think they might be counterfeit, even though they are marked &amp;#34;sonicare&amp;#34; on the heads and the box. Also, I share with my girlfriend so we are constantly swapping heads and I notice the little magnets on the bottom move around. You can actually remove them. I don&#x27;t remember that happening on the full price heads. Maybe you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Have been using my Sonicare for years now, and all I do is replace the heads now and then. Perfect. Can&#x27;t believe anyone would still use a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Worked great and got my sonicare and teeth back into shape!</li>
            <li> You get just what you&#x27;d expect.  Good product with the convenience of availability here.</li>
            <li> These work well, but they have a  serious design flaw. They get all gunked up and it&#x27;s pretty disgusting. Anyone that owns one knows what I&#x27;m talking about. I upgraded to a different model and it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads for my Sonicare work great.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality as previous replacement heads.  When I press harder against my teeth the brush-head stops completely.  There may be some fakes going around... beware.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are a unit in themselves...and cost almost as much! These are recommended to be changed each 3 months, which is 4 X the cost of 15...or $60.00 per year. The gift that keeps on giving!</li>
            <li> repalcements DO make adifference</li>
            <li> One worked the other did not these are not Phillips i believe knock offs ,I  would not order again</li>
            <li> The brush for which is was intended stopped operating.  These would not fit new toothbrush so I cancelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay, okay</li>
            <li> They fit.  They&#x27;re quiet.  And they&#x27;re just like the heads that came with the brush.  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Always better than a manual but this replacement has a thinner narrower head. It also didn&#x27;t seem like it pulses as strongly every 30 seconds like the old series. Still like it but preferred the old style</li>
            <li> I found product to be just as described. I found it to be a good value for replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend</li>
            <li> Sonicare product is the best.</li>
            <li> Ok but overpriced brush refills.  The E series brush heads fit the older style Sonicare toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest disadvantage to this style of brush heads is that the design allows them to get very dirty in the area where the brush head screws onto the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips needs to lower their prices on these refills as the cost too much and you  have to replace too often.</li>
            <li> This itme has met all of my exspectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare since they first came out.  It has made a huge difference in my dentist visits.  Used daily, it helps keep you gums in good shape and little or no cavities.  Reason is, it cleans much better than just a regular toothbrush, and in less time.  The HX7002/62 e-Series happen to be the heads that fit my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Does its job. I love these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> There is no substitute for an electric tooth brush. I&#x27;ve been using one for 14 yrs. Very good brand, I would consider it top of the line. Purchased at a great price.</li>
            <li> This replacement is way different from the original. The brush that came with the original was soft and small, very comfirtable to use. However, this replacement is like a normal cheap brush, large and harsh on your gum. Cause bleeding every single time. It is totally unnecessary to use hard fiber with sonicare. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for many years now. When I go back to my Dentist she usually advices me, &amp;#34;whatever you&#x27;re doing to keep your teeth taken care of, continue doing.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad for this amazing product, they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li> First, the toothbrush heads I received are the green ones, not the ones pictured. That said, I have no complaints. Just like the ones pictured, they work very well with minimal effort. This is great for people who don&#x27;t have normal strength in their hands due to arthritis or a disability. And the average person can do a very thorough job without having to brush too hard, like many people who use a manual toothbrush, which damages the gums. This is a fine product, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by drugstore brand generic replacements so I returned them and bought these. I made sure to buy those listed for sale by Sonicare. Well, one is defective and is louder than the store brand and the other has cracked. I am really dissapointed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in the store. The unit is about 20 years old and works very well yet. So replacement brushes are a must but they are hard to find. Sonicare makes an excellent product so........internet provides the replacement heads. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It meets my satisfaction..It is cheaper than in the store which didn&#x27;t even carry it since i moved. This is a good way to shop.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the original Philips product, but the magnets on the bottom of these brushes actually rust and come a little loose.&lt;br /&gt;This causes them to make a whole lot of noise but hardly vibrate, rendering them useless. This happened to both brushes after the first usage.</li>
            <li> These brushes are much easier to buy online than trying to find them in a store. Fit our vibrating unit perfectly.</li>
            <li> one brush lasted only a week and then started erratically vibrating.  The other brush has been working well.  However, I did pay for two brushes.</li>
            <li> Both toothbrush heads make a really loud noise, no matter how tight they are.  It seems they are not actually made by sonicare or some really cheap version.  I have used sonicare for many years so I know how the heads should work. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> i have used the sonicare for over 12 years the best toothbrush peroid. the replacement heads seam to be after markets. i have brought aftermarket before it was not the as the phillips brand. i liked the fact that had the easy open box they  do not do the same feel as the phillips brand.i will never use a diffrent brand than the sonic care. i will just look for the phillips brand.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush does a good job, but is not my preference. The uneven brush line is hard on the gums. I really meant to get one for sensitive teeth. Maybe next time!</li>
            <li> After having problems with these brush-heads and leaving some feedback about it, these guys called me within 24 hours and offered help.  Wow - seriously good customer service!  Turns out the issue was not with these brush-heads at all, but with a part on the brush base.  In any case, they were helpful and the problem was solved.  Would definitely order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift with no complaints from the recipient.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Nothing much to write home about.  They are good. The Amazon price&lt;br /&gt;is right. But, one should not buy these with the impression that they&lt;br /&gt;will last a long time.  After six months, the effectiveness decreases.&lt;br /&gt;Buy a few as replacment will be needed with frequent use.</li>
            <li> Could not believe what a difference these new brush heads made.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth getting to replace old ones.</li>
            <li> Great price, but took a bit to ship.</li>
            <li> These replacements were clearly counterfeit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in an unmarked plastic bag and didn&#x27;t work at all.  I had to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Prompt Delivery!</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads!</li>
            <li> It filled the need for replacement brush heads for the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> fresh from the dentist clean</li>
            <li> Ordered for my grandma and they worked perfect!</li>
            <li> good price......rapidly delivered</li>
            <li> how easy can it get.  refills on time and right to my door..  Get it on auto refill</li>
            <li> I want a new fancy Sonicare but it just won&#x27;t ware out, great product.</li>
            <li> great item, pleased with seller and with the product</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own a Sonicare Toothbrush system, you should. I can&#x27;t think of a better way to protect your teeth and more importantly your gums.</li>
            <li> Products arrived in timely manner.  Better than expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> good price for this product and saved the shopping!!</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare, and I love these heads for 3 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Great price, can&#x27;t beat Amazon. I usually use many generic products, but you really can&#x27;t skimp with sonicare, the generics don&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Great frustration-free packaging, which is recyclable! No more clamshells!&lt;br /&gt;3. They work great!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for heads not available at local stores.</li>
            <li> one of the attachments didn&#x27;t work.  disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve had bad luck with these or not, but I&#x27;ve ordered four from Amazon. Three were faulty. Two sound like weed wackers (excessively loud). The third brush left all the bristles from one hole my mouth the first time I used it. They all worked, but there is something going on with the manufacturing process. They&#x27;re labeled as coming from Sonicare, and I believe they&#x27;re authentic. Sonicare just needs to work on their Quality Control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Sonicare system though. Definitely the best method I know to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what fits the holder</li>
            <li> Rehabilitated my old portable rechargeable toothbrush and provided the newer action that help eliminate my gingivitis.</li>
            <li> Both brushes were cut to short at the bristles and are defective. It feels like bushing with a wire brush. I ordered these in advance a few months ago and now I am unable to return or exchange them because the return time has expired. Next time I will examine the brush heads more closely. These are obvious knock off brushes and you should STAY AWAY from this product!</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly, and it feels like I have a brand new toothbrush again! I love it! The best part? I didn&#x27;t have to fork out a fortune to buy a whole new Sonic Care toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for over 10 years so I have a really good understanding of brush heads that work, and brush heads that are garbage.  This company must either sell knock offs or illegitimate versions because not one but both heads weren&#x27;t functional after a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is non functional?  Basically its like an old car engine that chugs along and barely makes it up the hill.  These brushes are barely vibrating and they don&#x27;t have the same sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend not buying from this person.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Much better quality than the generic brand, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> OEM quality; excellent fit and utility. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes for my wifes&#x27; Sonicare toothbrush and they fit and work well. She has had no problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, my teeth say thank you.</li>
            <li> I REALLY quite like these!!! Fit great on my handle.&lt;br /&gt;If I have any qualms, bristles are a tad stiffer than the brand, but, not much....</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare and have been an avid user for years.  My dentist both recommends them and can be purchased from him at a discount.&lt;br /&gt;After dental cleaning you can pick up a dental head as opposed to a free toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the most reasonable, price location to purchase!</li>
            <li> This brush always works well for me.</li>
            <li> These Sonicare brush inserts do an excellent job maintaining dental hygiene!</li>
            <li> 1/10 the quality of OE at 1/3 the price</li>
            <li> This would have gotten five stars if both heads worked properly. Unfortunately, once it was time to replace the first head, the second one makes this god awful high pitched buzzing noise (not like the normal buzz). I will be writing to philips to see what they can do for me, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I had an old one that was worn out and these are so much better at cleaning my teeth-much faster and much more thorough.  I hope I get a good report from the dental hygienist at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> LOVE these silly things! There is just no better way to get really clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Great product. I just wish they made it a little bit wider.</li>
            <li> Great replacements..for a good product</li>
            <li> Real Sonicare brush heads are better than the non-Sonicare brands. They fit better and produce less noise than other types.</li>
            <li> Junk, they seem to be offbrand fits for these, about halfway through the first one, the magnet at the bottom came off. It looked superglued on. The 2nd one the magnet was already off and could not use.</li>
            <li> Sure they fit my toothbrush. The packaging was insane. I tried scissors, but had to upgrade to pruners to get the package open. Regular cutting wouldn&#x27;t work so I had to stab the blister pack multiple times so I could at least tear it along the holes. It wasn&#x27;t pretty. Then the packaging had sharp edges on it. Then there was yet more blister pack packaging inside. There&#x27;s really no reason to lock these toothbrush heads up like they&#x27;re made of gold. Well, except that they almost cost as much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these toothbrushes since the late 1990s and my dentist affirms its done me well.  Since the original has become obsolete, I changed to the e-series and the smaller heads, but the recommend change time is 3 months versus 6 months.  Do you have to buy $15 brushes every 3 months?  The older series would look so badly flailed that it clearly didn&#x27;t brush as well.  But the smaller e-series brushes look well after 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to my dental hygienist every 6 months.  About 2008, I experimented with changing the brushes annually, and then used my hygienists comments on my teeth as a guide to the effectiveness of the brush.  At 6 months on the first year, no problems.  At 1 year, still no problems, and the brushes were intact.  5 years later, and 5 brushes, no problems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe I don&#x27;t eat really plaque building foods, but for my use, changing brushes annually works.  That&#x27;s a huge difference, 1 brush a year versus 4 brushes a year.  The brush physically still works except the bristles are softer and at 1 year, more spread out.  Conservatively, you could probably change them in 6 months instead of 3.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as promised. Very happy with the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested this product and I was skeptical but I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for over a year now.  (I feel that twice a day might be too intense for my 50+ year old teeth.)  Recently, I was without it for 3 weeks and I could definitely tell the difference in how my teeth felt with hand-brushing alone.  The brush heads are easy to change but the assembly should be opened and cleaned between changes because material collects inside the mechanism and that&#x27;s unappealing.  I have no hesitation in recommending this as long as your dentist doesn&#x27;t tell you your teeth can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> Not the original. I have had my toothbrush for about 10 years and used many replacement heads. These ones felt cheap and make a loud noise, when pressing on my teeth the movement becomes weak and don&#x27;t clean well. I&#x27;ll never order these again.</li>
            <li> It feels like just coming from the dentist clean!&lt;br /&gt;Best toothbrush Ever!!!</li>
            <li> great for the price and replace for old brush head.  better than getting it at the store and receives it right away.</li>
            <li> Fit my electric toothbrush perfectly</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for the original. Actually this is about the 3rd replacement fir the same power unit an HX 7500.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one did not fit the brush properly and made a loud sound when used.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Horrible. These are not authentic heads... the bristles were uneven and short... the printed series name on them was cheap and chipping off.... terrible. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> These are very poor quality.  Bristles are unevenly trimmed and not installed correctly.  Almost like it is a fake, knock off.  Not worth a single penny.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the prompt service. However, the brush heads were not as pictured. Because this is my elderly mom&#x27;s toothbrush, she was very reluctant to use it, claiming it wont work. I showed her that it fit on the holder, so it will be fine. I also told her they probably dont make the type that she had any more. Once she started using it, she said it was good enough, she just has to get used to it. Thank you again. I will certainly purchase more later</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I needed, priced right, described correctly so that I could make the right purchase for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Gotta have the refills!  I love my Sonicare!  Ordering refills on line is much easier than going into a busy store!</li>
            <li> as always sonicare products are good. I continue to buy their &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; because of how they are made &amp; how they work.</li>
            <li> These are much higher quality than the previous replacement heads I have bought from Walmart.  Well worth the price they ask.</li>
            <li> i must have somehow got &#x27;knock offs&#x27;!?!?&lt;br /&gt;the first one out of the package made a real loud noise but the brush didn&#x27;t move!  the second one in the pack malfunctioned quickly.  the magnet rusted, not something that happens to the real sonicare heads, and the brush didn&#x27;t move much.  how did that happen?!&lt;br /&gt;when i get these at the drug store, i love em, they work well for ages.</li>
            <li> These rust! I don&#x27;t know what I did wrong in ordering these but they didn&#x27;t last a few weeks without a weird smell and the parts are totally rusted. I ordered another set that came in actual Philips packaging and they&#x27;re perfect. These come in a brown box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the issue with these replacement head as they vibrate noisily. The look the same as the other replacement heads, but the tolerances for the this product do not work with the Sonicare base.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes was broken when it arrived. The brushes were not packaged and just laying in the box in a small plastic bag</li>
            <li> Ideal for quality dental care.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  Sent quickly.  Good Price.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit the original base/battery well. Good replacement.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the original brush heads.  Cheaper to order here than buying at the grocery store or Costco.  Reminded me how important it is to replace the brush heads on the electric toothbrush at least once every 6 months, makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My sonicare was out of gas and I thought that I would need to replace the whole unit.  Wrong.  Just pop one of these guys on and it&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my Sonic care and I love them.  Will reorder again when the time comes to change out the heads.</li>
            <li> We ordered these, and they&#x27;re not the authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t attach correctly, and the brush indicator (that&#x27;s supposed to receed as they&#x27;re used so you know when to replace it again) doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> love sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement, bristles a little stiffer than original, works</li>
            <li> At a drug store, I bought a two-pack of the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; version of these that were supposed to fit my Sonicare model.  Hated them.  I tried both of them and they were noisy and rattled no matter how carefully and how many times I tried re-screwing them in.  Then I bought this actual Philips Sonicare version from Amazon, and they are sooo much quiter and smoother-running.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I had tried Walgreens replacement, but it was so noisy I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Received as promised. Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years... Phillips is very reliable</li>
            <li> Love these - I change mine once a month  even though they are supposed to last 3 months.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If you have a Philips Sonicare e-Series toothbrush you know about having to get those replacements.  It&#x27;s one of those things you know you should do more often but don&#x27;t at least I didn&#x27;t.  However, now that I found then at this great price (less than 1/2 of most stores) I&#x27;ll be buying them more often!!</li>
            <li> Does the job and I like them, will continue to use, especially like the Frustration-Free Packaging.  You do not get a choice on the tiny colored ring, but I do not care about that.</li>
            <li> I got these as replacement heads, one of them worked, the other was so loud that I had to end up buying another set. I ended up buying the Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries instead. It was much better and a tighter fit.</li>
            <li> WHEN BRUSHING WITH THE PHILIPS SONICARE TOOTH BRUSH IT FEELS LIKE I JUST HAD MY TEETH CLEANED BY MY DENTIST.  IT IS THE MOST AMAZING TOOTH BRUSH EVER.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and came crushed. Had to return.</li>
            <li> I bought the newer version since after buying the replacement heads my sonicare died.</li>
            <li> Just the right replacement for my Sonicare e-Series toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have been using sonicare toothbrush for years.  Excellent product</li>
            <li> Ive been using sonicare for about a decade and I know what it sounds and feels like. I feel something is off about these replacement heads.  They are really, really loud which is fine but they dont clean the same.  It feels like it&#x27;s two-thirds the power.  I dont respond usually when asked to rate a product, only when it&#x27;s outstanding or bad.  Maybe ive responded 3 times in my life when asked.  No offense to this company, but keep your receipt just in case.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for over five years. Replacement brushes are always necessay and this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> great deal on replacement heads for Sonic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about it, They screwed onto the base backwards.&lt;br /&gt;Most annoying. Now a few more words needed for the minimum.</li>
            <li> Needed the item, EZ to find, Good price, QWik ship, thanks....that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to say...what with this system??? Got other stuff to do</li>
            <li> We have used Sonicare for many years and are very satisfied with the type of cleaning it provides for our teeth.</li>
            <li> They are great,  I tried and off brand before and will never do it again.</li>
            <li> Unscrew the brush from handle and rinse out the inside after each use. Then put it back together or let brush head dry on a towel. Use alcohol to disinfect all parts from time to time.</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush, needed some new brush heads. Great investment in my dental health is how I look at it.</li>
            <li> These pillows are very comfortable, I would or will them buy again.</li>
            <li> these units are as expected, they do the job just as the first did I am happy</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about using a Sonicare toothbrush, but this thing is great! These new heads work perfectly. No complaints.</li>
            <li> same as factory, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since My daughter,a dental hygienist, gave me a sonicare toothbrush as a gift 5years ago! Can&#x27;t live without one!</li>
