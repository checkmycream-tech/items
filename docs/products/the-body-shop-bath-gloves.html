            <li> Give you a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I love these scrubby little gloves. Besides using them every now and again as part of my shower routine I really purchased them to obtain super exfoliation before an airbrush tan (as recommended by a friend.) I hear the tan stays on longer if you exfoliate very well. In the past when I&#x27;ve gotten spray tans I&#x27;ve just used a loofa sponge. I was very pleased with the tan, it looked even, and it did last longer, a whole week &amp; a half. I am attributing it in part to these gloves, but really, I&#x27;m just guessing here.</li>
            <li> I get these all the time, if you haven&#x27;t tried them before then you don&#x27;t know what your missing.</li>
            <li> These gloves have a great texture for exfoliating and don&#x27;t lose elasticity or stretch out too much. The only annoying thing is the fact that those little loops for hanging them aren&#x27;t sewn in so well, so I ended up having to re-sew.</li>
            <li> Only a small child could get their hand  in this glove.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do.They exfoliate my skin. I would purchase them again if necessary. Not sure what else I can say, but they&#x27;re good gloves.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Feels great. Been using for a week. They haven&#x27;t ripped or stretched out. I use mostly on my legs and they are definitely smoother</li>
            <li> Now I am sure these gloves are good as a lot of reviewers indicated, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get use to the roughness against my skin. So if you are looking for a extra coarse exfoliating glove, this is for you. If your skin is a little sensitive to coarse products than you should opt for something a little gentler.</li>
            <li> Love these gloves. They do just what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love these gloves.  They fit, they don&#x27;t snag as bad as others and the best part is the hanger on each glove.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, and I know there is some sort of machismo type stigma associated with using these products as a man. But I don&#x27;t care. After using these, my body feels cleaner than I ever knew possible. It makes washing so much easier, since I&#x27;m basically using my hands and soap, which makes hitting those hard to reach areas a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t buy these for any reason other than trying to get a better shower experience, compared to the old and outdated wash cloth. They work wonders. My skin comes out feeling clean, without the dried out feeling, while making even the coarsest of skin feel smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size isn&#x27;t all that great at first, when using them with large man hands, but after a few washes, they are nice and stretched to fit, without actually impeding the products ability to clean, and without and stretched areas, or the usual holes between the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE THOUGH! If you&#x27;re new to this sort of scrub, these don&#x27;t seem that coarse, but if you scrub a bit too hard, you run the risk of a little sensitive skin.. so be careful how hard you scrub certain areas. My face felt a little raw when I first used these, but there&#x27;s an obvious adjustment period getting used to a product that cleans so much better than a shoddy piece of cloth, or some form of spongy loufa type thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip, put one of these on a back brush.. it&#x27;s amazingly good for that tricky mid back on larger fellows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Version If you&#x27;re a guy, and you work and play hard, but want to feel properly clean without hiring a servant to scrub you down, these are for you!</li>
            <li> Good quality and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like a rough but not scratch of your face rough cloth when exfoliating. These gloves are the perfect in between. I have used them for 4 months (cleaning them regularly) no holes or tears, they have stretched a little. My skin feels smooth after use. I will be buying them again because using stuff any longer in the shower gives me chills.</li>
            <li> I use the gloves once or twice a week to exfoliate while showering.  They fit well, hold product well, and remove dead cells well.  I like how easily they rinse clean and how quickly they dry.  Buy these you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Specifically bought to keep in the shower hanging on my shower rack.  The loop broke after two uses. Now I have to lay it in the rack and it doesn&#x27;t dry as well.</li>
            <li> I use these gloves daily and enjoy how they exfoliate my skin.  The loops on the ends of the gloves make it easy to hang and dry after my shower.</li>
            <li> I like using bath gloves as I feel they clean better than a regular wash cloth (ie. get off dead skin, clean without slipping off of my hands, and I feel cleaner).</li>
            <li> they stretch the first time u use them. u might as well buy the 99 ones.</li>
            <li> awesome but i really needed a white</li>
            <li> I really like these gloves.  They are good for using on your feet for your summer pre peddies.</li>
            <li> The gloves work great, but the loop came undone a few days after I got them.  Now I have to fix it.  I&#x27;d hoped to get a little better quality by spending a bit more than Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn but sensitive &amp;#34;common fishscale&amp;#34; skin which means loofahs do nothing for me. This bath glove works great. I&#x27;ve used it both dry (before showering) and wet (while in the shower) and it works great to remove dead skin without irritation. The gloves come as a pair, but they&#x27;re made so that either will fit on either hand, which is extremely convenient. They dry overnight and don&#x27;t seem to lose their effectiveness over time. Sooo much better than loofahs!</li>
