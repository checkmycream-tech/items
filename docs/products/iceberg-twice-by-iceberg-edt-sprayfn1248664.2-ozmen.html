            <li>and it is right up there with the best.</li>
            <li>and I tried and liked it too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to my brother for referring this perfume and thanks to Amazon for the best product at best Price.</li>
            <li>This composition  of  perfume smells nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe a $20 scent could be as nice as it turned out to be.</li>
            <li>I definitely enjoyed this phase of the scent although I do not know if I liked the smell on me.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quick and met all expectations!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love  this  fragrance  on  my  husband.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing and llight.</li>
            <li>and I still love it...</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, it has a nice retainer and it was super cheap.</li>
            <li>Almost like a musky fruitful scent but light.</li>
            <li>However, even though it is light it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>great manly smell long lasting great sizing and pricing</li>
            <li>It was still in it&#x27;s original packaging too.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you like sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of my favorite cheaper colognes.</li>
            <li>I received my item quickly.</li>
            <li>the best part of the scent was a short middle and</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast great smell,  my fourth bottle</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>The scent  lasted for perhaps 5 hours or more, the nice mid-scent didn&#x27;t last incredibly long and instead gave way to again a powdery and non-descript smell; not bad, but not that interesting either.  </li>
            <li>So I was super excited to get this cologne and all the reviews I read seemed positive.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My son loved it and carries it in his truck to always be able to smell good for all occasions even when least expected.</li>
            <li>Women seem to like it and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Light and masculine, wear it day or night.  </li>
            <li>I always get positive feedback when people smell this cologne.</li>
            <li>This faded pretty fast, \\&quot;thankfully\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy until they discontinue it like they did with all previous ones I liked.</li>
            <li>On me the fragrance started out pretty non-descript, it smelled nice (like most perfume) but totally forgettable.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this cologne is very versatile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a modern perfume for  modern people.</li>
            <li>The next phase was quite nice, it reminded me of a clean jasmine green tea and clover honey.</li>
            <li>The product was brand new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly longer lasting for a cheaper cologne (at least on my skin).</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the smell and strength of this cologne!</li>
            <li>By itself the scent was quite powdery and smelt like something a 40 something year old man would wear, perhaps while taking a business trip on an airplane.  </li>

            <li> iceberg twice has been a sleeper within the fragance industry for a few years now.</li>
            <li> My husband had been using it for over 8 years everyday</li>
            <li> If there is one thing I have learned it is never to blind buy, ALWAYS smell and test a fragrance on yourself before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> This was difficult with Twice though since it isn&#x27;t retailed in America.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it to see if it grows on me, but I am doubtful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> very, very pleased with this purchase !!</li>
            <li> i have several fragrances in my collection but this one happens to be one of my favorites. i get a lot of compliments when i wear it and i don&#x27;t have to worry about someone else wearing the same scent at a funtion or event. iceberg twice has been a sleeper within the fragance industry for a few years now. the price is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I would have to say this cologne is very versatile. I wear it going to work, but its also great to wear when I decide to go to a dance club. I always get positive feedback when people smell this cologne.</li>

            <li> So I was super excited to get this cologne and all the reviews I read seemed positive. If there is one thing I have learned it is never to blind buy, ALWAYS smell and test a fragrance on yourself before purchasing it. This was difficult with Twice though since it isn&#x27;t retailed in America.  REVIEW:  By itself the scent was quite powdery and smelt like something a 40 something year old man would wear, perhaps while taking a business trip on an airplane.  On me the fragrance started out pretty non-descript, it smelled nice (like most perfume) but totally forgettable. It had a very floral/cream soda-like note to start; a close comparison would be the Kilo body wash by Axe, not exactly what I expected from a cologne. This faded pretty fast, \\&quot;thankfully\\&quot;. The next phase was quite nice, it reminded me of a clean jasmine green tea and clover honey. I definitely enjoyed this phase of the scent although I do not know if I liked the smell on me. The scent  lasted for perhaps 5 hours or more, the nice mid-scent didn&#x27;t last incredibly long and instead gave way to again a powdery and non-descript smell; not bad, but not that interesting either.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It&#x27;s a tad too floral and the best part of the scent was a short middle and the dry down was pretty bland. I will keep using it to see if it grows on me, but I am doubtful.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C214BK Iceberg Twice By Iceberg For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces]] is an excellent cologne for work. I used it and received msny compliments asking whar cologne am I wearing. I would suggest buying this cologne.</li>
            <li> Very nice citrus cologne. All you need it two sprays and it last at least 8 to 10 hrs.</li>
            <li> My brother asked me to get this perfume and I was searching all over the shops(Macys, JC penny, Sears and etc) but could not found. Finally, came to the ultimate place Amazon and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came quicker than expected and I tried and liked it too.&lt;br /&gt;So, immediately repeated the order for me. Thanks to my brother for referring this perfume and thanks to Amazon for the best product at best Price.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements. For the price it became a big surprise. i am buying another bottle soon. I recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love  this  fragrance  on  my  husband.  I purchase it all the time, especially when this one is on sale.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell and ladies are truly attracted.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a friend and he was very pleased with the price and fragrance.  Great price, would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked 1/4 in shipment. Fragrance is short lasting and is a bit feminine. Good price but would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Iceberg Twice by Iceberg for men is a excelent toilette spray. parfume is a mixture of nice fragrant and essential oils with a perfect aroma compounds,&amp;#34;a pleasant scent.&amp;#34; Iceberg Twice is a very good perfume.It&#x27;s  a modern perfume for  modern people. This composition  of  perfume smells nice.</li>
            <li> Found this in Paris Framce at 3x the price.  Light and masculine, wear it day or night.  Always smells great.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and llight. Not overbearing. My husband lives this cologone. It smells great. What else can I say? Try it</li>
            <li> My husband had been using it for over 8 years everyday and I still love it... This it a very good morning fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it...the scent last for days and it is not over powering.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast great smell,  my fourth bottle</li>
            <li> An excellent mixture. Almost like a musky fruitful scent but light. However, even though it is light it lasts for hours. I didn&#x27;t believe a $20 scent could be as nice as it turned out to be. I have dozens of fragrances from Hugo to Gucci to this and it is right up there with the best. It may be a step or two below them in quality but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> great manly smell long lasting great sizing and pricing</li>
            <li> The price was good on this product so I thought I would buy it for my hubby. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t care for the scent. It&#x27;s just a little bit too &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; smelling for me.</li>
            <li> Women seem to like it and the price is right. Will continue to buy until they discontinue it like they did with all previous ones I liked.</li>
            <li> I often get compliments of the scent when I wear Iceberg Twice. This is my second bottle. The scent stays with you the entire work day.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the smell and strength of this cologne! A very good buy</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it has a nice retainer and it was super cheap. I would recommend it if you like sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of my favorite cheaper colognes. The smell is great. Its perfect for mid-late spring and summer (depending on your climate of course). It&#x27;s fairly longer lasting for a cheaper cologne (at least on my skin). This is one i will always have in my cologne collection</li>
            <li> A customer where I work had this on and he smelled so good I ask him what he was wearing.  He told me and I immediately told my son and ordered it for him.  It arrived very quick and met all expectations! My son loved it and carries it in his truck to always be able to smell good for all occasions even when least expected.</li>
