            <li>Great product but smallerror than I thought.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these anywhere overseas, so I had to wait till someone was coming to visit me and have them bring them to me, lol.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of medium fine hair and these are the best at staying put.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these for my 2-year-old&#x27;s fine, curly hair and they work great.  </li>
            <li>Non-slip works nicely.  </li>
            <li>I would look all over trying to find this no-slip kind all over.</li>
            <li>cute and kinda durable</li>
            <li>Scunci is a brand I have always been pleased with</li>
            <li>More of a decorative use than functional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a better size representation online.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to use and they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>are easy to lose) but that is not fault of product.</li>
            <li>Worth the price,ships fast and great quality clips..</li>
            <li>Suitable for a child or super fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Removing it from the hair is fine though.</li>
            <li>Jaw clips are jaw clips and for the price these are fine.  </li>
            <li>does the job and is light but solid - good quality</li>
            <li>Plus they are cute, haha.</li>
            <li>these clips are sturdy and have nice clamp action.  </li>
            <li>Really handy for any up-do, but I have lost a couple of them easily because of their tiny size!</li>
            <li>These are pretty cheap and nothing really special.</li>
            <li>worth for the price</li>
            <li>Others I have purchased break too soon and are too &amp;#34;rounded&amp;#34; to work right in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These are the exact ones I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cute tho; good for pinning back small bits of hair for an updo</li>
            <li>They would probably work better for someone with thinner hair that wants to pin their bangs back.</li>
            <li>Price is right, but shipping cost from this seller is too high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>its my own fault, but these clips are so tiny you can barely hold any hair in them.  </li>
            <li>They are seriously tiny but surprisingly strong, I put her hair up and she forgets they are in.</li>
            <li>Pros:  great for thin hair, really hold well.  </li>
            <li>Listing the size in the description really helped me make my decision.</li>
            <li>$3.99 is also too much for this in my opinion.</li>
            <li>These are much tinier than I thought.  </li>
            <li>nice to have they are alittle smaller wish i would have got one size bigger, but they still stay in and hold all the hair I put in it</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I wanted, a quick and easy way to secure the edges of my bun to the surrounding hair, but still small enough to be unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li>One of the only clips to actually stay in my super-fine hair, and the perfect size for small, fly-away sections.</li>
            <li>These work well for securing hair with no pain, but you have to be careful because they do crack easily.  </li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d paid more attention to the detail before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re big enough for, say, a barbie doll.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be the right size, it&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture.  </li>
            <li>First: these are tiny!</li>
            <li>These little clips work well in my hair and they don&#x27;t fall out easily</li>
            <li>Not too small, strong, and I love the colors (especially the clear and black).</li>
            <li>Also, is it just me or does everyone else frequently lose these things?  </li>
            <li>I originally bought these for an older little girl, however, they were too small to look right on her head.</li>
            <li>I have really thick curly hair and these are strong enough to hold up a good chunk of it, but small enough that you don&#x27;t feel the heavy weight of a clip.</li>
            <li>Might as well get them in the store so you&#x27;re clear on what size they are as I thought they would be smaller.</li>
            <li>Holds barely any hair.</li>
            <li>But other than that, they really do hold and grip hair well.</li>
            <li>but with my curly hair, only one could actually hold up an entire bun or pull back a decent amount of hair off my face.</li>
            <li>Much tinier than expected - these are for little girls (the lady on the picture is very misleading)</li>

            <li> Color choices could definitely be better...unless you want to share with other people who do not have the same hair color as you.</li>
            <li> I have long and curly hair</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected, but I ended up using them as a clip to hold me sweater together.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> They are not clear like the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> I would say though that they are only about half an inch in diameter in any dimension.  </li>
            <li> all I can say is I cant return it was bought as add on to larger order and they do not explain these are the baby hair micro small sized clips,</li>
            <li> These are not the teeny tiny clips but rather the small clips.  </li>
            <li> but I have found other uses for them.</li>
            <li> So tiny they will hardly hold up any hair.</li>
            <li> The time was extremely tiny and was hardly useable.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy a card of all white/clear</li>
            <li> Not a defect as such, but these are VERY small.  </li>
            <li> These small clips work well to hold a small pieces of hair to the side or to pull two small pieces of hair up in the middle.</li>
            <li> there is a little grip on them).</li>
            <li> I use about four of these little darlings and my bun</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick hair and although this is a small clip, it grips the hair with ease and holds it in place without slipping.</li>
            <li> WIsh could buy 2 package of all one color (as small</li>
            <li> Beware...these are really small.</li>
            <li> Small,</li>
            <li> Small but holds hair well.</li>
            <li> Would recommend , holds hair in place, they are small but hold quit</li>
            <li> These were a bit small for what I orginally wanted them for</li>
            <li> I have chin-length, curly, very thick hair and like to put just a few strands up in these small clips.  </li>
            <li> what a waste and seems to be false ad</li>
            <li> 8 small clips inside the package , would buy again!</li>
            <li> Too bad they sell the white ones in there.  </li>
            <li> They are a really ugly white.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters curly hair because I was tired of fighting with the hair ties.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them.</li>
            <li> Too bad I keep losing/misplacing them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I originally bought these for an older little girl, however, they were too small to look right on her head.</li>
            <li> My dog, a Lhasa Apso, has beautiful hair that flows in the wind and bounces when he walks. However, the hair falls into his eyes all the time. I have found that the best product for controlling this problem are these scunci clips. They are really easy to use and they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> Pros:  great for thin hair, really hold well.  Came in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  none.  WIsh could buy 2 package of all one color (as small are easy to lose) but that is not fault of product.</li>
            <li> its my own fault, but these clips are so tiny you can barely hold any hair in them.  they&#x27;re cute tho; good for pinning back small bits of hair for an updo</li>
            <li> I ordered theses thinking they were larger but I still like them because of the no-slip feature.  I use them to hold sections of hair while I curl/straighten and they work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Good quality.  Smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would be the right size, it&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture.  I have chin-length, curly, very thick hair and like to put just a few strands up in these small clips.  Well, they&#x27;re perfect! Not too small, strong, and I love the colors (especially the clear and black).</li>
            <li> I have long and curly hair and these get the job done</li>
            <li> In the picture it looks like you could hold a pony tail with these clips, but they would only work if you were a Barbie doll.</li>
            <li> cute and kinda durable</li>
            <li> These work well for securing hair with no pain, but you have to be careful because they do crack easily.  Also, is it just me or does everyone else frequently lose these things?  Maybe I have a long-haired house elf hiding in my closet snatching them up...</li>
            <li> They were smaller than I expected, but I ended up using them as a clip to hold me sweater together. They would probably work better for someone with thinner hair that wants to pin their bangs back.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Color choices could definitely be better...unless you want to share with other people who do not have the same hair color as you. If I could have bought all 8 in the same color, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These small clips work well to hold a small pieces of hair to the side or to pull two small pieces of hair up in the middle. My daughter has very thick hair and although this is a small clip, it grips the hair with ease and holds it in place without slipping. Scunci is a brand I have always been pleased with and I would not hesitate to purchase these clips again. They make great stocking stuffers and/or basket fillers.</li>
            <li> Worth the price,ships fast and great quality clips.. I bought these for my wife for Christmas and it&#x27;s March now and not one is broke. These are great clips</li>
            <li> Great size for me.  Non-slip works nicely.  Price is right, but shipping cost from this seller is too high in my opinion.  Also offered as an add on item.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters curly hair because I was tired of fighting with the hair ties. They are seriously tiny but surprisingly strong, I put her hair up and she forgets they are in. I have really thick curly hair and these are strong enough to hold up a good chunk of it, but small enough that you don&#x27;t feel the heavy weight of a clip.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my 2-year-old&#x27;s fine, curly hair and they work great.  They&#x27;re a perfect size for keeping her hair out of her eyes and they stay in well throughout the day.  Not too small and not too large.  Similar in size to the &amp;#34;Goody Mini Clip, Micro&amp;#34; that we also have.  Comparable quality between the two.  Like that this set has a clear/frosted color. Great neutrals to choose from.</li>
            <li> First: these are tiny! Pay attention to the size listed. But other than that, they really do hold and grip hair well. I have a lot of medium fine hair and these are the best at staying put.</li>
            <li> MUCH smaller than described! So tiny they will hardly hold up any hair. More of a decorative use than functional. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> all I can say is I cant return it was bought as add on to larger order and they do not explain these are the baby hair micro small sized clips, what a waste and seems to be false ad</li>
            <li> The clamp design is strange--impossible to open without prying apart with both hands. Once you get the clip open, you can hold it open with one hand and insert it. Removing it from the hair is fine though.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them.</li>
            <li> Grips well but yet do not pull the hair..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth for the price</li>
            <li> These are pretty cheap and nothing really special. Might as well get them in the store so you&#x27;re clear on what size they are as I thought they would be smaller. $3.99 is also too much for this in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Beware...these are really small. Great product but smallerror than I thought.</li>

I use about four of these little darlings and my bun stays in place all day.  Perfect!  Yes, they are tiny, but they do the job well for me.  I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> One of the only clips to actually stay in my super-fine hair, and the perfect size for small, fly-away sections.</li>
            <li> This product was inadequately described in size. The time was extremely tiny and was hardly useable. Holds barely any hair.</li>
            <li> These are not the teeny tiny clips but rather the small clips.  I like these a lot.  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy a card of all white/clear and so I have to give away 3/4 of the clips.</li>
            <li> These are much tinier than I thought.  Suitable for a child or super fine hair.  Wish there was a better size representation online.</li>
            <li> Scunci clips are the best. Holds every strand with no movement.  Too bad I keep losing/misplacing them. I wish they came in a bulk tub.</li>
            <li> I would look all over trying to find this no-slip kind all over. NOT ANYMORE!! This stays put all day. I&#x27;m so happy now!!</li>
            <li> Really handy for any up-do, but I have lost a couple of them easily because of their tiny size! I recommend them to any girl.</li>
            <li> these clips are sturdy and have nice clamp action.  Others I have purchased break too soon and are too &amp;#34;rounded&amp;#34; to work right in my hair.  get these</li>
            <li> Much tinier than expected - these are for little girls (the lady on the picture is very misleading)</li>
            <li> Small but holds hair well.</li>
            <li> does the job and is light but solid - good quality</li>
            <li> nice to have they are alittle smaller wish i would have got one size bigger, but they still stay in and hold all the hair I put in it</li>
            <li> Would recommend , holds hair in place, they are small but hold quit well. 8 small clips inside the package , would buy again!</li>
            <li> These were a bit small for what I orginally wanted them for but I have found other uses for them.</li>
