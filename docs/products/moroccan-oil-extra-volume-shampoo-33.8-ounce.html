            <li>I love the way my hair feels after a shampoo but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on here shopping to buy more and thought I&#x27;d give my two cents on this product.  </li>

            <li>I love this for volume bounce and fullness.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>but I was able to use the one on the bottle I was recycling.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>An extra shot of shower water loosens it up and it does a wonderful job of volumizing.</li>

            <li>One of the main reasons why people buy this product is the amazing smell.  </li>
            <li>she loved it so bought her this big bottle.</li>
            <li>this will alst a long time and is a great value compared to the smaller bottles</li>

            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>But this shampoo really did what it was reported to do.  </li>

            <li> I have been using Moroccanoil products for over a year now, my hair looks great and has grown longer faster.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper products you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who doesn&#x27;t really think much of the shampoo I use, but my wife asked me to try this and it made a difference that I could actually tell. Really like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for over a year now. I love the way my hair feels after a shampoo but&lt;br /&gt;best of all it has a wonderful clean fresh smell that lasts.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo overall. Does the job, smells amazing. It is one of the brands i would purchase over and over again. Especially now that my husband is hooked on it as well.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve not bought THIS particular item from this particular vendor, I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil Extra Volume Shampoo now since it first appeared on the market.  I have very fine, long blonde hair and I&#x27;m loving this product.  The original made my hair flat, greasy and ugly looking within hours.  I&#x27;m on here shopping to buy more and thought I&#x27;d give my two cents on this product.  To those who post negatively on this product, perhaps they didn&#x27;t actually read the listing that stated it was the Extra Volume Shampoo version?</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom in the smaller size. she loved it so bought her this big bottle. this will alst a long time and is a great value compared to the smaller bottles</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the product seemed off. Maybe it was past its shelf life. Looked for an expiration date but couldn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I purchased this is because I love the moroccan oil smell......the one I received, does NOT smell like moroccan oil shampoo. Very disappointed I paid this much for it</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good service from company. Pump is functional. I highly recommend Moroccan oil hair treatments.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  The smell is nice &amp; it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  I also buy the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> Buyers be cautious.  This is not the same Moroccan Oil that I have used for almost two years. Apparently they came out with this new Extra Volume Shampoo a few weeks ago. I normally get the Moroccan Oil Moisture Repair Shampoo. I had no idea that this was a new product.  It&#x27;s in the same bottle.  The texture and smell of the Volume Shampoo is horrible.  It smells like alcohol.  It does not lather.  One of the main reasons why people buy this product is the amazing smell.  I wish it would of stated this in the details that this is a new product so I would not of spent $10 in shipping.  Even though it is my responsibility to verify what I purchased...I do feel a little mislead.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> When I received the package and opened it, the cap was a bit opened and some shampoo outflow. It&#x27;s very horrible, the whole bottle was covered by the shampoo. But the shampoo itself is great and smell very good.</li>
            <li> I love this for volume bounce and fullness. I switch on and off between this and Bumble and Bumble thickening shampoo and my hair is great. I have thin flat and some waves in my hair. This product is 5 stars! Buy it</li>
            <li> My scalp felt really dried out although I love the oil just not a fan of the shampoo or conditioner. Love the smell</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pump did not work but I was able to use the one on the bottle I was recycling.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have thin hair that looks flat very easily. This shampoo is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp. I have been using only this shampoo for over 6 months, and I still don&#x27;t have build up where my hair starts to look dull.</li>
            <li> My only reservation is that the shampoo is quite thick and hard to lather.  An extra shot of shower water loosens it up and it does a wonderful job of volumizing.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo!  Really adds volume to my fine hair and the scent is wonderful.  I would definately recommend it to others who are looking to add volume to their hair.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a better shampoo out there for me.  I love the smell and I love what it does for my color treated hair.  Very expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This product actually makes my hair thicker.  I had thinning hair due to chemo and was doubtful that anything would be helpful.  But this shampoo really did what it was reported to do.  I&#x27;m very happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizing product I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the extra volume shampoo for 2 years. I generally buy the liter size for cost savings. I have naturally platinum blonde hair (a bit on the fine side) that I was fortunate enough to inherit from my Scottish grandmother. Over the years it has proven difficult to find a product that enhances the body of my hair and keeps the color shining. This product boosted the volume and leaves my hair luminous. Achieving this is difficult for blonde hair. My stylist indicated this product is also color safe for those who may color their hair and for most hair types. The extra volume shampoo is gentle and has no sulfates. It is highly concentrated so requires lots of water and lathers beautifully. As far as smell, I prefer to have none. I find  conditioners weigh down my hair so I use the Moroccanoil Light Oil Treatment to detangle and style. It&#x27;s typically all I need.</li>
            <li> The best Shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The pump on the bottle is broken.  The shampoo is great but obviously it is a big problem when the pump on such a large bottle does not work.  Probably how it was packaged...</li>
            <li> Hair seems healthier, shinier and fuller than with most other shampoos. It costs more, but is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, It smells wonderful. The consistency is nice and thick and it leaves my hair happy and healthy when paired with the conditioner</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was real after using stared to loose more hair . I think just wasted money on it.</li>
            <li> The top was cracked - but it hadn&#x27;t spilled.</li>
