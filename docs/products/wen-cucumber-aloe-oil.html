    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>As a product trial junkie in search of the best, this product is the very best item I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Over all EXCELLENT++</li>
            <li>I was very happy with that, however the Chaz Dean \\&quot;system\\&quot; was pricey</li>
            <li>YOU ARE WONDERFUL, I RECOMMEND ALL CHAZ DEANS PRODUCTS, IF YOU DO NOT RATE IT 5 STARS,</li>
            <li>PERFECT</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and this is a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>I was using Purology products at the time and thought they were the best thing ever</li>
            <li>(again this is the regime that works best for me!)    </li>
            <li>BEST thing you could do for your hair!  </li>
            <li>The price is a bit out of my haircare budget, but I am very happy with the WEN conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as everyone says!  </li>
            <li>I found that the lavander didnt work great on my hair excepts as a leave it.</li>
            <li>, IT LOOKS GREAT, AGAIN, CHAZ DEAN</li>
            <li>Great service, as well, esp.</li>
            <li>It also works great as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and this works great</li>
            <li>It might work great for someone else though.</li>
            <li>Imagine my amazement when I was able to comb through my hair with ease and upon blow-drying it was as if the ends decided to curl themselves under!!  </li>
            <li>It is an inexpensive and very effective foamer.    </li>
            <li>after trying all of them, this was the best for me-left my hair clean, smelling great, non-greasy, managable, body and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>AND TOLD HE TO GIVE IT A GOOD TRIM</li>
            <li>It was a good experiment</li>
            <li>While the product is good</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with the cleansing conditioner, and it&#x27;s just not doing it for me, cleansing wise.</li>
            <li>etc until you get a good result.      </li>
            <li>It is spendy, but good quality if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>My scalp tingles and the cleanser smells great (strong!)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>It makes me love my hair!</li>
            <li>and you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bought Wen!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>but I have to say the cuncumber worked amazing well.</li>
            <li>The almond was nice</li>
            <li>&amp; now buys her own...</li>
            <li>The product smells nice.</li>
            <li>The smell of cucumber aloe is very strong though.</li>
            <li>Works really great, and to be honest, I get the same great results that everyone else is talking about.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very very very fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I really hope that the Cucumber Aloe will continue to keep my hair looking beautiful and not oily.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>This is a return order after being totaly pleased with the product and the vendor.  </li>
            <li>It WILL leave your hair shiney and extremely healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels SO MUCH better then before .</li>
            <li>, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>SURE YOU PICK THE CORRECT ONE, THE CUSTOMOER SERVICE IS EXCELENT ALSO</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>(the longer you leave it in, the better)  </li>
            <li>Then make sure you rinse it out</li>
            <li>Best decision I have ever made---after about 3 weeks of using this product, my hair felt smoother, looked healthier and had that shine back...    </li>
            <li>These substances provide a foaming quality to the product, allowing for better distribution of the product while washing hair or skin and while brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>When rinsed off, the product will have cleaned the area but will have taken moisture from the top layers of skin.</li>
            <li>I love the WEN products.</li>
            <li>I love mine for sure.</li>
            <li>I love WEN.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>if that describes you, you won&#x27;t be able to use it either...</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to figure out how many pumps to use.  </li>
            <li>Love the WEN products - went from losing 20-30 strands each time</li>
            <li>The thing is, you still have to actually STYLE your hair, so don&#x27;t buy this thinking that your hair will magically add volume and be perfect if you don&#x27;t do anything to it.</li>
            <li>I have super, super fine hair and the best product is the Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li>but I have followed the directions EXACTLY as stated in the booklet that comes with the product (and surprisingly</li>
            <li>This product works good at first, but as my daughter continued using it it started drying out her scalp that she ended up with a lot of flakes</li>
            <li>After a month of use, my hair is soft and manageable, with beautifully defined curls.  </li>
            <li>I beleive I like the Cucumber Aloe even BETTER than the Sweet Almond Mint!    </li>
            <li>I am very, very impressed with this product, and intend to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li>Love all of the Chaz Dean products but the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner works best on my hair which is dry and fine.</li>
            <li>By day 2 my hair is still quite clean!</li>
            <li>The first week using Wen my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>, HE IS THE GREATEST, MY HAIR HAS BEEN GROWING OUT FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS NOW AND IS ALMOST DOWN TO MY WAIST</li>
            <li>but it kinda weirds me out since i already have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million salon products for my super-long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this product is for coarser or drier hair, but not for fine, normal-to-oily hair.</li>
            <li>Have tried the Almond/Mint also, the Cucumber/Aloe is lighter and  works well for fine or thinner hair.</li>
            <li>luckily she got some for christmas :-)</li>
            <li>This is an AWESOME product - it absolutely does not have to ability to dry hair out, like many shampoos, and the leave-in factor provides a super-quick cleaning/conditioning one step process.</li>
            <li>It is an amazingly spa like experience every time I use it, and I prefer the cucumber to the almond mint as I have fine silky straight hair.</li>
            <li>This cleanser/conditioner really works for my abundant but fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely softer, and by the end of the day, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Overall, my hair feels great, smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t dried out at the ends.</li>
            <li>If you are interested and can afford it... BUY IT!!</li>
            <li>I sent a note to customer service at Chaz Dean and they were very helpful, re-sent the package at no cost to me, and I was able to enjoy this great product finally.</li>
            <li>When I first tried Wen products, I thought they were ok.  </li>
            <li>Original Review:  </li>
            <li>b/c I associated clean hair with the squeaky clean feeling</li>
            <li>I feel like I could throw away my closet full of salon products and never miss them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wen cleaning conditioner for about 2 weeks, alternating between the Sweet Almond Mint and the Lavender.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair nice an soft.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint, Cucumber Aloe, and Lavender cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I first bought Wen in October of 2008, and it left my hair so healthy and in such great shape, I literally did not have to get a hair cut for 6 months!   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much improved, my hair has definition and feels healthy and is shinier.</li>
            <li>It might be refreshing if you&#x27;re sick...but not a smell I find pleasant for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy, just different than what you&#x27;re used to, and trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a loyal Wen user and have started telling all my friends about it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much (it will cost you more, but it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li>yes, lucky me.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I tried this product last night after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>However, if your hair is thick oily or color teated choosing the right cleanser would be great!</li>
            <li>I tried this one after ordering a set from Guthy-Renker which included a smaller version of the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, plus the intensive conditioner, styling cream and some kind of styling wax.</li>
            <li>Some days it makes my hair full of static and too soft, to the point where I can&#x27;t do a thing with it.</li>
            <li>I got compliments on my hair the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>If anything it leaves my hair TOO healthy, whereas damage gives me a little lift, but regardless, it is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I use the new Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for dry scalp (really great, btw), then use the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner as a \\&quot;full head\\&quot; conditioner (the cucumber aloe didn&#x27;t work as a regular conditioner for me because the Sweet Almond Mint was more moisturizing, but it may work for you), and the intensive conditioner (or someone else&#x27;s) on the ends.</li>
            <li>For me, it was worth the time</li>
            <li>I have very mixed feelings about this product because while it cleanses nicely, I come out smelling medicinal.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the Sweet Almond Mint conditioning shampoo based on the infomercial.  </li>
            <li>At first I ordered the 6oz 3 pack containing the cucumber, lavendar and sweet almond.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, I promise.  </li>
            <li>It has been a pleasure to use, my hair is in gleaming, soft, healthy condition, but the thing that has prompted me to write this review is the fact that I can&#x27;t find any split ends.  </li>
            <li>And believe me, I have just spent a good 10 minutes looking.    </li>
            <li>I tell you, it is worth it</li>
            <li>, it says that if you do indeed follow the directs carefully, you DON&#x27;T need to use the product every day, but rather your hair should be good for 2-3 days without cleansing again).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I like the smell and the feel of the cleanser on my scalp, and initially I didn&#x27;t notice too many hairs falling out, but after several more uses, I felt like more hair was coming out in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for one week and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>but for now I say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>You have to play around with the Wen products to find the one that&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is slightly oily but the ends of my hair are slightly dry and  this Cucumber/Aloe formulation is the perfect treatment for me.  </li>
            <li>I love that I only have to condition my hair and save time in the shower.</li>
            <li>There is only the overwhelming smell of Menthol.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use enough of the product</li>
            <li>This was my first try at this product.</li>
            <li>Sodium laureth sulfate, or sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), is a detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste etc.).</li>
            <li>I have better results with the standard shampoo then condition approach.</li>
            <li>Even if you are slightly interested...</li>
            <li>I first saw the infommercial for this product and was sucked in, but being a savvy buyer, I did some homework.  </li>
            <li>(first used a pick, then a small-toothed comb), tied it up in a bun, took the rest of my shower, then rinsed it out for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency, and tingling sensation due to the menthol it has in it.</li>
            <li>My scalp is generally very oily, and while this does a good job of cleansing it, I&#x27;m just not sure that the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product prior and liked it - don&#x27;t think it was any cheaper ordering it on Amazon than directly from company.  </li>
            <li>I made sure not to put too much product in my stick-straight Asian hair, combed it out evenly in the shower</li>
            <li>Ihad decided go back my old hair care, now shine is back, I feel more clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also grew extremely fast and kept my highlights looking good a lot longer than usual.      </li>
            <li>but it seems like i loose more hair in the shower than before using the product.</li>
            <li>I have fine shoulder lenght color-treated hair that is pretty dry and has that problem</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and, although I have a lot of hair, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body.  </li>
            <li>You to rinse very well.  </li>
            <li>, IT IS A 20 ON A SCALE TO 1 TO 5, BEING A 2 TIME BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR, WEN HAS BEEN A REAL BLESSING, MY HAIR IS IN FANTASIC CONDITION, I HAD CHEMO AND RADIATION, AND I LOST ALL MY HAIR</li>
            <li>work it through really well.  </li>
            <li>REALLY well.    </li>
            <li>VERY.    </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Who wants a product that drives the boys away?</li>
            <li>In addition, my scalp is VERY oily and gets pimples and sebum build up, scaling....</li>
            <li>I have thin,fine straight hair..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>and she followed the directions very well.</li>
            <li>other tip, make sure you rinse your hair well before washing with wen,  </li>
            <li>it gets greasy and was worried that WEN would create a residue feeling that most other products on the market gave me-</li>
            <li>I use it on my toddler as well, it gets rid of the tangles much better than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and baby fine</li>
            <li>I bought the Cucumber Aloe to try out, since my scalp gets oily, but the rest of my straight, fine hair gets dry.</li>
            <li>I use only about 6 pumps and it keeps my hair clean for two or three days.  </li>
            <li>when dry, this product leaves them soft and relaxed, and my hair is already 100% healthy.</li>
            <li>Wen cucumber aloe completely bowled me over with the first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to report that my hair once again looks great--no oil slick on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and it was much better than the Sweet Almond Mint, but only worked for me if I washed my long hair every single day (which I rarely do).</li>
            <li>I have short hair (sits at my shoulders), and six pumps for the crown, each side, and nape of my neck seems to be an appropriate amount (24 pumps total).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner and this makes my hair so much better.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to only use the regular shampoo ONCE.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>so I wish the product would give it a little more body.</li>
            <li>Normal shampoo leaves my ends &#x27;splayed out&#x27;</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS CUCUMBER CLEANSING CONDITIONER, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW YEARS</li>
            <li>So ultimately, I would say, if you don&#x27;t mind the price, then give this a whirl, but if you do, then don&#x27;t bother because I just don&#x27;t think the hype surrounding the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>I went with the Cucumber Aloe due to my oily, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>No longer am I being told by any stylist that I need a special conditioner to take care of my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using wen for 3 months, but I think it&#x27;s long enough to know how amazing it is.</li>
            <li>, I HAD A THICK, BEAUTIFUL BRAID DOWN TO MY KNEES, I BLESS THE DAY I FOUND WEN, BY CHAZ DEAN</li>
            <li>and I was a bit worried that my baby fine, oily hair would be weighed down.  </li>
            <li>And second day hair is not an option for me as my roots normally get very greasy.</li>
            <li>but im willing to try since cutting back on shampoo and conditioner feels so great.</li>
            <li>If it were a little more affordable I would definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more lotion and less; more water and less; leaving in longer and less.</li>
            <li>, SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, DONNA YOU ONLY NEED MAYBLE 1/4 OF A INCH,IF THAT MUCH, SHE SAID MY HAIR IS GROWING OUT</li>
            <li>Sodium Laurel Sulfate-Effects on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In people with sensitive skin (prone to dermatitis, acne, eczema, psoriasis and chemical sensitivity), the drying property of these type of detergents can cause flare-ups of skin conditions or may worsen existing conditions)    </li>
            <li>I have fine, slightly wavy blonde hair that I abuse with highlights, curling irons, and blow dryers, and Wen kept my hair moist and shiny regardless of the styling aids I use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful of times, so I suppose I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any significant improvement...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Wen for anyone looking for a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, color processed, oily scalp hair.</li>
            <li>If my hair is dirtier than normal, I add an extra 5 pumps.  </li>
            <li>MY HAIR IN THE FRONT THINNED OUT A LITTLE, I HAVE BEEN USING WEN TEA TREE OIL FOR ALMOST 9 MONTHS AND MY HAIR FILLED BACK IN</li>
            <li>most dark blondes do - use to little product my hair just lays flat - use to much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry or use styling products, so the products I use in the shower really have to perform.  </li>
            <li>Then before you towel dry, put a pump (more or less depending on your hair) of wen back into your ends (not your scalp).</li>
            <li>My hair does not have much body so if I use too much it appears limp.  </li>
            <li>I use about half the recommended pumps, scrub my scalp and comb it through, and rinse it right away.  </li>
            <li>The cost is a little undesirable, but it is well, well worth it.</li>
            <li>I was recently on vacation and used my old shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only used the Cucumber Aloe.  </li>
            <li>And who knew that hair could be so soft, yet voluminous and bouncy all at the same time!?  </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly relaxed and colored hair -  pretty much the trifecta of haircare issues.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, not having to wash everday as I previously did with other shampoos, and my husband says my hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li>But now... even in the month and half I have used this product, my hair has grown an inch and a half EASY.  </li>
            <li>It really made my dry hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Now I just have to wait about 2 years for all the old split ends that split up the hair shaft (presumably due to my old shampoos) to grow out, and I will have the hair I used to have in my teen years again.  </li>
            <li>This product has made my hair stronger with less breakage, the color is much shiner.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that the different scents each have different ingredients and you may have to try a few before you find the one that works for you.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that you go through it so quickly and you can&#x27;t find it in stores; you must order online.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t horrendous, but my hair was flat, flat, flat and way too soft.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> PERFECT</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and this is a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li> I was using Purology products at the time and thought they were the best thing ever</li>
            <li> (again this is the regime that works best for me!)    </li>
            <li> BEST thing you could do for your hair!  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit out of my haircare budget, but I am very happy with the WEN conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as everyone says!  </li>
            <li> I found that the lavander didnt work great on my hair excepts as a leave it.</li>
            <li> , IT LOOKS GREAT, AGAIN, CHAZ DEAN</li>
            <li> Great service, as well, esp.</li>
            <li> It also works great as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and this works great</li>
            <li> It might work great for someone else though.</li>
            <li> Imagine my amazement when I was able to comb through my hair with ease and upon blow-drying it was as if the ends decided to curl themselves under!!  </li>
            <li> It is an inexpensive and very effective foamer.    </li>
            <li> after trying all of them, this was the best for me-left my hair clean, smelling great, non-greasy, managable, body and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> AND TOLD HE TO GIVE IT A GOOD TRIM</li>
            <li> It was a good experiment</li>
            <li> While the product is good</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with the cleansing conditioner, and it&#x27;s just not doing it for me, cleansing wise.</li>
            <li> etc until you get a good result.      </li>
            <li> It is spendy, but good quality if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> My scalp tingles and the cleanser smells great (strong!)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> It makes me love my hair!</li>
            <li> and you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought Wen!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> but I have to say the cuncumber worked amazing well.</li>
            <li> The almond was nice</li>
            <li> &amp; now buys her own...</li>
            <li> The product smells nice.</li>
            <li> The smell of cucumber aloe is very strong though.</li>
            <li> Works really great, and to be honest, I get the same great results that everyone else is talking about.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very very very fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I really hope that the Cucumber Aloe will continue to keep my hair looking beautiful and not oily.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a return order after being totaly pleased with the product and the vendor.  </li>
            <li> It WILL leave your hair shiney and extremely healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels SO MUCH better then before .</li>
            <li> , I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> SURE YOU PICK THE CORRECT ONE, THE CUSTOMOER SERVICE IS EXCELENT ALSO</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> (the longer you leave it in, the better)  </li>
            <li> Then make sure you rinse it out</li>
            <li> Best decision I have ever made---after about 3 weeks of using this product, my hair felt smoother, looked healthier and had that shine back...    </li>
            <li> These substances provide a foaming quality to the product, allowing for better distribution of the product while washing hair or skin and while brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> When rinsed off, the product will have cleaned the area but will have taken moisture from the top layers of skin.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN products.</li>
            <li> I love mine for sure.</li>
            <li> I love WEN.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> if that describes you, you won&#x27;t be able to use it either...</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to figure out how many pumps to use.  </li>
            <li> Love the WEN products - went from losing 20-30 strands each time</li>
            <li> The thing is, you still have to actually STYLE your hair, so don&#x27;t buy this thinking that your hair will magically add volume and be perfect if you don&#x27;t do anything to it.</li>
            <li> I have super, super fine hair and the best product is the Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li> but I have followed the directions EXACTLY as stated in the booklet that comes with the product (and surprisingly</li>
            <li> This product works good at first, but as my daughter continued using it it started drying out her scalp that she ended up with a lot of flakes</li>
            <li> After a month of use, my hair is soft and manageable, with beautifully defined curls.  </li>
            <li> I beleive I like the Cucumber Aloe even BETTER than the Sweet Almond Mint!    </li>
            <li> I am very, very impressed with this product, and intend to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> Love all of the Chaz Dean products but the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner works best on my hair which is dry and fine.</li>
            <li> By day 2 my hair is still quite clean!</li>
            <li> The first week using Wen my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li> , HE IS THE GREATEST, MY HAIR HAS BEEN GROWING OUT FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS NOW AND IS ALMOST DOWN TO MY WAIST</li>
            <li> but it kinda weirds me out since i already have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million salon products for my super-long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this product is for coarser or drier hair, but not for fine, normal-to-oily hair.</li>
            <li> Have tried the Almond/Mint also, the Cucumber/Aloe is lighter and  works well for fine or thinner hair.</li>
            <li> luckily she got some for christmas :-)</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME product - it absolutely does not have to ability to dry hair out, like many shampoos, and the leave-in factor provides a super-quick cleaning/conditioning one step process.</li>
            <li> It is an amazingly spa like experience every time I use it, and I prefer the cucumber to the almond mint as I have fine silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> This cleanser/conditioner really works for my abundant but fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely softer, and by the end of the day, it smells great.</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair feels great, smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t dried out at the ends.</li>
            <li> If you are interested and can afford it... BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> I sent a note to customer service at Chaz Dean and they were very helpful, re-sent the package at no cost to me, and I was able to enjoy this great product finally.</li>
            <li> When I first tried Wen products, I thought they were ok.  </li>
            <li> Original Review:  </li>
            <li> b/c I associated clean hair with the squeaky clean feeling</li>
            <li> I feel like I could throw away my closet full of salon products and never miss them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen cleaning conditioner for about 2 weeks, alternating between the Sweet Almond Mint and the Lavender.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair nice an soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint, Cucumber Aloe, and Lavender cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I first bought Wen in October of 2008, and it left my hair so healthy and in such great shape, I literally did not have to get a hair cut for 6 months!   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much improved, my hair has definition and feels healthy and is shinier.</li>
            <li> It might be refreshing if you&#x27;re sick...but not a smell I find pleasant for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy, just different than what you&#x27;re used to, and trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a loyal Wen user and have started telling all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use too much (it will cost you more, but it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li> yes, lucky me.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I tried this product last night after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> However, if your hair is thick oily or color teated choosing the right cleanser would be great!</li>
            <li> I tried this one after ordering a set from Guthy-Renker which included a smaller version of the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, plus the intensive conditioner, styling cream and some kind of styling wax.</li>
            <li> Some days it makes my hair full of static and too soft, to the point where I can&#x27;t do a thing with it.</li>
            <li> I got compliments on my hair the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> If anything it leaves my hair TOO healthy, whereas damage gives me a little lift, but regardless, it is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I use the new Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for dry scalp (really great, btw), then use the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner as a \\&quot;full head\\&quot; conditioner (the cucumber aloe didn&#x27;t work as a regular conditioner for me because the Sweet Almond Mint was more moisturizing, but it may work for you), and the intensive conditioner (or someone else&#x27;s) on the ends.</li>
            <li> For me, it was worth the time</li>
            <li> I have very mixed feelings about this product because while it cleanses nicely, I come out smelling medicinal.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the Sweet Almond Mint conditioning shampoo based on the infomercial.  </li>
            <li> At first I ordered the 6oz 3 pack containing the cucumber, lavendar and sweet almond.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, I promise.  </li>
            <li> It has been a pleasure to use, my hair is in gleaming, soft, healthy condition, but the thing that has prompted me to write this review is the fact that I can&#x27;t find any split ends.  </li>
            <li> And believe me, I have just spent a good 10 minutes looking.    </li>
            <li> I tell you, it is worth it</li>
            <li> , it says that if you do indeed follow the directs carefully, you DON&#x27;T need to use the product every day, but rather your hair should be good for 2-3 days without cleansing again).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I like the smell and the feel of the cleanser on my scalp, and initially I didn&#x27;t notice too many hairs falling out, but after several more uses, I felt like more hair was coming out in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one week and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> but for now I say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> You have to play around with the Wen products to find the one that&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is slightly oily but the ends of my hair are slightly dry and  this Cucumber/Aloe formulation is the perfect treatment for me.  </li>
            <li> I love that I only have to condition my hair and save time in the shower.</li>
            <li> There is only the overwhelming smell of Menthol.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use enough of the product</li>
            <li> This was my first try at this product.</li>
            <li> Sodium laureth sulfate, or sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), is a detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste etc.).</li>
            <li> I have better results with the standard shampoo then condition approach.</li>
            <li> Even if you are slightly interested...</li>
            <li> I first saw the infommercial for this product and was sucked in, but being a savvy buyer, I did some homework.  </li>
            <li> (first used a pick, then a small-toothed comb), tied it up in a bun, took the rest of my shower, then rinsed it out for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency, and tingling sensation due to the menthol it has in it.</li>
            <li> My scalp is generally very oily, and while this does a good job of cleansing it, I&#x27;m just not sure that the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product prior and liked it - don&#x27;t think it was any cheaper ordering it on Amazon than directly from company.  </li>
            <li> I made sure not to put too much product in my stick-straight Asian hair, combed it out evenly in the shower</li>
            <li> Ihad decided go back my old hair care, now shine is back, I feel more clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It also grew extremely fast and kept my highlights looking good a lot longer than usual.      </li>
            <li> but it seems like i loose more hair in the shower than before using the product.</li>
            <li> I have fine shoulder lenght color-treated hair that is pretty dry and has that problem</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and, although I have a lot of hair, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body.  </li>
            <li> You to rinse very well.  </li>
            <li> , IT IS A 20 ON A SCALE TO 1 TO 5, BEING A 2 TIME BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR, WEN HAS BEEN A REAL BLESSING, MY HAIR IS IN FANTASIC CONDITION, I HAD CHEMO AND RADIATION, AND I LOST ALL MY HAIR</li>
            <li> work it through really well.  </li>
            <li> REALLY well.    </li>
            <li> VERY.    </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Who wants a product that drives the boys away?</li>
            <li> In addition, my scalp is VERY oily and gets pimples and sebum build up, scaling....</li>
            <li> I have thin,fine straight hair..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> and she followed the directions very well.</li>
            <li> other tip, make sure you rinse your hair well before washing with wen,  </li>
            <li> it gets greasy and was worried that WEN would create a residue feeling that most other products on the market gave me-</li>
            <li> I use it on my toddler as well, it gets rid of the tangles much better than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and baby fine</li>
            <li> I bought the Cucumber Aloe to try out, since my scalp gets oily, but the rest of my straight, fine hair gets dry.</li>
            <li> I use only about 6 pumps and it keeps my hair clean for two or three days.  </li>
            <li> when dry, this product leaves them soft and relaxed, and my hair is already 100% healthy.</li>
            <li> Wen cucumber aloe completely bowled me over with the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to report that my hair once again looks great--no oil slick on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and it was much better than the Sweet Almond Mint, but only worked for me if I washed my long hair every single day (which I rarely do).</li>
            <li> I have short hair (sits at my shoulders), and six pumps for the crown, each side, and nape of my neck seems to be an appropriate amount (24 pumps total).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner and this makes my hair so much better.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to only use the regular shampoo ONCE.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> so I wish the product would give it a little more body.</li>
            <li> Normal shampoo leaves my ends &#x27;splayed out&#x27;</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CUCUMBER CLEANSING CONDITIONER, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A FEW YEARS</li>
            <li> So ultimately, I would say, if you don&#x27;t mind the price, then give this a whirl, but if you do, then don&#x27;t bother because I just don&#x27;t think the hype surrounding the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> I went with the Cucumber Aloe due to my oily, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> No longer am I being told by any stylist that I need a special conditioner to take care of my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using wen for 3 months, but I think it&#x27;s long enough to know how amazing it is.</li>
            <li> , I HAD A THICK, BEAUTIFUL BRAID DOWN TO MY KNEES, I BLESS THE DAY I FOUND WEN, BY CHAZ DEAN</li>
            <li> and I was a bit worried that my baby fine, oily hair would be weighed down.  </li>
            <li> And second day hair is not an option for me as my roots normally get very greasy.</li>
            <li> but im willing to try since cutting back on shampoo and conditioner feels so great.</li>
            <li> If it were a little more affordable I would definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more lotion and less; more water and less; leaving in longer and less.</li>
            <li> , SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, DONNA YOU ONLY NEED MAYBLE 1/4 OF A INCH,IF THAT MUCH, SHE SAID MY HAIR IS GROWING OUT</li>
            <li> Sodium Laurel Sulfate-Effects on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In people with sensitive skin (prone to dermatitis, acne, eczema, psoriasis and chemical sensitivity), the drying property of these type of detergents can cause flare-ups of skin conditions or may worsen existing conditions)    </li>
            <li> I have fine, slightly wavy blonde hair that I abuse with highlights, curling irons, and blow dryers, and Wen kept my hair moist and shiny regardless of the styling aids I use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful of times, so I suppose I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any significant improvement...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Wen for anyone looking for a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, color processed, oily scalp hair.</li>
            <li> If my hair is dirtier than normal, I add an extra 5 pumps.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR IN THE FRONT THINNED OUT A LITTLE, I HAVE BEEN USING WEN TEA TREE OIL FOR ALMOST 9 MONTHS AND MY HAIR FILLED BACK IN</li>
            <li> most dark blondes do - use to little product my hair just lays flat - use to much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry or use styling products, so the products I use in the shower really have to perform.  </li>
            <li> Then before you towel dry, put a pump (more or less depending on your hair) of wen back into your ends (not your scalp).</li>
            <li> My hair does not have much body so if I use too much it appears limp.  </li>
            <li> I use about half the recommended pumps, scrub my scalp and comb it through, and rinse it right away.  </li>
            <li> The cost is a little undesirable, but it is well, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was recently on vacation and used my old shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used the Cucumber Aloe.  </li>
            <li> And who knew that hair could be so soft, yet voluminous and bouncy all at the same time!?  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly relaxed and colored hair -  pretty much the trifecta of haircare issues.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, not having to wash everday as I previously did with other shampoos, and my husband says my hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li> But now... even in the month and half I have used this product, my hair has grown an inch and a half EASY.  </li>
            <li> It really made my dry hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Now I just have to wait about 2 years for all the old split ends that split up the hair shaft (presumably due to my old shampoos) to grow out, and I will have the hair I used to have in my teen years again.  </li>
            <li> This product has made my hair stronger with less breakage, the color is much shiner.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that the different scents each have different ingredients and you may have to try a few before you find the one that works for you.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you go through it so quickly and you can&#x27;t find it in stores; you must order online.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrendous, but my hair was flat, flat, flat and way too soft.</li>
            <li> Remember that you are only skeptical because you are used to the products on the market--the same ingrediant in your shampoo now is the same ingrediant that can wash your clothes or clean your body with-sodium laurel sulfate, every product on the market has that ingrediant except for WEN products!    </li>
            <li> At any rate, treat yourself to this product at least once in your life, I highly recommend the complete starter kit (go to the Chaz Dean site).</li>
            <li> I colour my hair, wear it long (mid back) and have struggled with split ends for years.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and not too thick.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I tried to switch back to a normal, commercial shampoo that I can find locally in a salon rather than having to mail order, but after just a few days of using it, my hair felt like straw and started breaking.  </li>
            <li> My hair does feel soft and looks shinier and less dry</li>
            <li> I could use head and shoulders shampoo/conditioner and it basically cleanses and conditions the scalp in the same way (just minus the \\&quot;dreaded\\&quot; sodium laurel/laureth sulfate).  </li>
            <li> One recommendation- do not leave this product in as long as the instructions tell you to.  </li>
            <li> /how long you leave it in/</li>
            <li> Then tried it again, but rinsed for a long period of time and did not get the rash this time.     </li>
            <li> I use less expensive, store bought products that give my hair more body and keep it healthier.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, thin hair get this Cucumber Aloe version as it isn&#x27;t as heavy on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally I have hair like I&#x27;ve envied on other women.</li>
            <li> It smells very minty, sadly not very almond-y, but at least it doesn&#x27;t wreak of menthol to the same degree all the other varieties do.  </li>
            <li> I hve very long hair</li>
            <li> my hair does not seem so flyaway or dry on the ends.</li>
            <li> whatever the culprit is that supposedly leaves your hair and scalp dry and abused</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have continued to wash my hair everyday, no residue build up, no \\&quot;split ends\\&quot;--i was told by wen product support that the whites on the ends of my hair were actually protein buildup from regular shampoos and conditioners not split ends--couldn&#x27;t be a truer statement...</li>
            <li> have normal, thick, colored, shoulder+ length hair &amp; use 30 pumps per wash.  </li>
            <li> YOU EITHER USING TO LITTLE, AND NOT WORKING IT IN PROPERLY IN YOUR HAIR, OR</li>
            <li> Other shampoos leave my color treated hair feeling stripped and dry.  </li>
            <li> spent making adjustments.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm.... The product is not really for me.</li>
            <li> I think if you have very thin hair or virgin hair (no color) it may be too much conditoning and leave hair flat.</li>
            <li> I use less than necessary in the shower, then add a little after showering as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I also know now its \\&quot;safe\\&quot; to buy other products</li>
            <li> I will be trying the other fragrances as well.</li>
            <li> BUT still didn&#x27;t like the fact that my \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; hair was starting to look and feel drier than usual</li>
            <li> Try any other smell.</li>
            <li> I usually use shampoos for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair, or ocassionally for  \\&quot;extra body\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair shiny, but did not enhance it&#x27;s condition in any other way.  </li>
            <li> When I start using new products I usually give a time at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This weighs my hair down still but with a combination of this and other hair shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t lather like conventional shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m forced to wash it daily, but I do like how the product makes my hair feel on \\&quot;day 1\\&quot;, so I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and fuller, looks healthier, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.  </li>
            <li> That weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, and it takes longer than regular shampoo/conditioner because of application / leave on time, however, when I do integrate it into my regular shampoo week (typically I use Pureology)</li>
            <li> I washed my hair to losing less than 10.</li>
            <li> My hair feels a little heavy on \\&quot;day 2\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Once you buy it, I have a few suggestions</li>
            <li> I actually found the health of my hair seemed worse after using the product for a month.   </li>
            <li> it was much worse than any sudsing shampoo ever left my hair on day 2.</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money on this shampoo.     </li>
            <li> A bottle usually lasts me a month and half.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I had LESS hair, not more.</li>
            <li> But after I towel or blow dry, my hair is flat (albeit shiny) and looks oily / dirty halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> When I used as leave in conditioner, I had a hard time comb my hair after dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its all the massaging and then combing it through</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it will make a difference</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t grow past my shoulders...</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews are definitely fake, but overall I think that people do feel the product does what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> Was greatly disappointed when the shipping amount was $9.00 - especially for such a small box!  </li>
            <li> : USE alot (I think I use 20-25 pumps--I have medium length hair and spread it all over, it&#x27;ll feel like a mask product that you would use to condition your hair) and rub it in (RUB, but not too hard)</li>
            <li> Actually my hair lost shine and always looked dirty.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick, to avoid frizz I put in a Paul Mitchell gel-like glaze</li>
            <li> it sounds complicated or not worth it, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical about the claim that sulfates are bad and drying to the hair, I urge to to try Wen for several weeks, and then use your shampoo just once.  </li>
            <li> she used to hate paying $5 for a bottle of shampoo, but now realizes she can&#x27;t go back to using anything but wen.  </li>
            <li> It is like Vic&#x27;s Vapor Rub but worse.</li>
            <li> :  (Products containing these substances can affect those prone to eczema and other irritants.</li>
            <li> but it is EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the non-suds factor as well,</li>
            <li> But unfortunately miracle didn&#x27;r happen to my hair.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> The ends stay sleek without frizz, and I don&#x27;t get that weird off-color overprocessed look.  </li>
            <li> I shoud say my scapl felt dirty too.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel and look dirty.  </li>
            <li> Amaaazing--I will never use a non-WEN product ever again---you know, I read these comments when I orginally researched WEN products, I was very skeptical...</li>
            <li> :(   </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed but</li>
            <li> the Cucumber Aloe has the WORST smell ever!</li>
            <li> Just steer away from Cucumber Aloe it smells HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I first tried Wen products, I thought they were ok.  I kept trying the different formulas until I got to the Cucumber Aloe.  I absolutely love it!  I have straight hair and, although I have a lot of hair, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body.  Wen Cucumber Aloe gives it fullness, shine, softness and body. I love it.  I was recently on vacation and used my old shampoo and conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt at all.  You have to play around with the Wen products to find the one that&#x27;s right for you.  You also have to play around and adjust the amount you use.  You to rinse very well.  For me, it was worth the time spent making adjustments.  It makes me love my hair!</li>
            <li> As a product trial junkie in search of the best, this product is the very best item I have ever used! It is an amazingly spa like experience every time I use it, and I prefer the cucumber to the almond mint as I have fine silky straight hair. It is expensive, and it takes longer than regular shampoo/conditioner because of application / leave on time, however, when I do integrate it into my regular shampoo week (typically I use Pureology), I say I am taking a &#x27;WEN Shower&#x27; and feel like a million bucks when I am done! Normal shampoo leaves my ends &#x27;splayed out&#x27; when dry, this product leaves them soft and relaxed, and my hair is already 100% healthy. If anything it leaves my hair TOO healthy, whereas damage gives me a little lift, but regardless, it is simply amazing. My dream is to visit the Chaz Dean hair studio in So. California but it is EXPENSIVE. At any rate, treat yourself to this product at least once in your life, I highly recommend the complete starter kit (go to the Chaz Dean site). Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cucumber aloe for a couple of weeks now. I love that I only have to condition my hair and save time in the shower. My hair does feel soft and looks shinier and less dry but it seems like i loose more hair in the shower than before using the product. I&#x27;m not sure if its all the massaging and then combing it through but it kinda weirds me out since i already have baby fine hair. I ordered the lavendar and im awaiting it in the mail. Im not sure if it will make a difference but im willing to try since cutting back on shampoo and conditioner feels so great. anyone else have this same problem??</li>
            <li> This product does work to cleanse your hair.  That being said, it smells nothing like cucumber or Aloe.   There is only the overwhelming smell of Menthol.  It might be refreshing if you&#x27;re sick...but not a smell I find pleasant for everyday use.  The only variety of the Wen cleansing conditioner I can use is the Almond Mint.  It smells very minty, sadly not very almond-y, but at least it doesn&#x27;t wreak of menthol to the same degree all the other varieties do.  I have very mixed feelings about this product because while it cleanses nicely, I come out smelling medicinal.  Often times, the menthol causes quite a burning sensation if I get it at all on my neck or around my face.  :(   Not recommended, until it is reformulated witout menthol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  I&#x27;ve tried a million salon products for my super-long fine hair.  I don&#x27;t blow dry or use styling products, so the products I use in the shower really have to perform.  Wen cucumber aloe completely bowled me over with the first use.  It did everything the infomercial promised.  It was night and day difference.  I feel like I could throw away my closet full of salon products and never miss them.  You owe it to yourself to run, not walk, and buy this product.  I feel like I came out of the shower with a totally different head of hair.  Finally I have hair like I&#x27;ve envied on other women.</li>
            <li> This is a return order after being totaly pleased with the product and the vendor.  The order was shiped and recieved in a very short time. Over all EXCELLENT++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen cleaning conditioner for about 2 weeks, alternating between the Sweet Almond Mint and the Lavender. My hair is long and baby fine and my scalp is oily enough that I&#x27;ve always had to shampoo every day. The first week using Wen my hair looked amazing. It was supersoft and shiny. However about 4 days ago, my hair started looking and feeling oily at the scalp immediately after cleansing. I was so disappointed but after reading the reviews, I decided to try the Cucumber Aloe. I just received my bottle today and I immediately showered and cleansed my hair. I&#x27;m thrilled to report that my hair once again looks great--no oil slick on my scalp. I really hope that the Cucumber Aloe will continue to keep my hair looking beautiful and not oily. Just be aware that the different scents each have different ingredients and you may have to try a few before you find the one that works for you.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Sweet Almond Mint conditioning shampoo based on the infomercial.  I was very happy with that, however the Chaz Dean \\&quot;system\\&quot; was pricey and I always received the styling cream which I never used.  So I started surfing and found that I could get just the shampoo AND there were different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;!  I bought the Cucumber Aloe to try out, since my scalp gets oily, but the rest of my straight, fine hair gets dry. I beleive I like the Cucumber Aloe even BETTER than the Sweet Almond Mint!    Make sure you use enough of the product - I have shoulder length hair and use about 10 pumps.  It won&#x27;t lather like conventional shampoo.  It WILL leave your hair shiney and extremely healthy looking.  No longer am I being told by any stylist that I need a special conditioner to take care of my dry hair. THIS STUFF WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wen cleansing conditioners for 3 weeks now. At first I ordered the 6oz 3 pack containing the cucumber, lavendar and sweet almond. I found that the lavander didnt work great on my hair excepts as a leave it. The almond was nice but I have to say the cuncumber worked amazing well. I have fine shoulder lenght color-treated hair that is pretty dry and has that problem most dark blondes do - use to little product my hair just lays flat - use to much it gets greasy looking and the color appears darker. And second day hair is not an option for me as my roots normally get very greasy. Not the case with this stuff at all. My hair looks and feels SO MUCH better then before . Day 2 my roots arent greasy at all. I&#x27;m now a loyal Wen user and have started telling all my friends about it. I also know now its \\&quot;safe\\&quot; to buy other products so I just bought the styling creme, oil and texture balm. We&#x27;ll see how those work out. But if youre on the fence about buying it - Id go for it.</li>

            <li> This is an AWESOME product - it absolutely does not have to ability to dry hair out, like many shampoos, and the leave-in factor provides a super-quick cleaning/conditioning one step process.</li>
            <li> I like it! It does leave my hair nice an soft. The smell of cucumber aloe is very strong though. I will be trying the other fragrances as well. :) This was my first try at this product.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and this is a wonderful product!  Great service, as well, esp. from Chaz Dean Studio link.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use too much (it will cost you more, but it&#x27;s worth it) &lt;br /&gt;I have normal, thick, colored, shoulder+ length hair &amp; use 30 pumps per wash.  If my hair is dirtier than normal, I add an extra 5 pumps.  It&#x27;s worth it, I promise.  I let a friend use my wen for a couple of days &amp; she almost cried when I took it back.  luckily she got some for christmas :-) &amp; now buys her own...she used to hate paying $5 for a bottle of shampoo, but now realizes she can&#x27;t go back to using anything but wen.  Infact she told me today she used shampoo today because she was running out of wen &amp; her hair felt so gross she had to rewash it with wen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;one other tip, make sure you rinse your hair well before washing with wen,  add a handful or 2 of water to your wen-head, (it won&#x27;t lather...it feels a bit like washing your hair with conditioner) work it through really well.  I even run a rat tail comb through mine (a miracle in and of itself!), putting the wen that comes out on the comb back on my head.  Then I put it up in a clip while I finish my shower. (the longer you leave it in, the better)  Then make sure you rinse it out REALLY well.    Then before you towel dry, put a pump (more or less depending on your hair) of wen back into your ends (not your scalp). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;if it sounds complicated or not worth it, it&#x27;s not.  It is easy, just different than what you&#x27;re used to, and trust me, it&#x27;s worth it!!!  I&#x27;ve only been using wen for 3 months, but I think it&#x27;s long enough to know how amazing it is.</li>
            <li> Amaaazing--I will never use a non-WEN product ever again---you know, I read these comments when I orginally researched WEN products, I was very skeptical...VERY.    I was using Purology products at the time and thought they were the best thing ever BUT still didn&#x27;t like the fact that my \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; hair was starting to look and feel drier than usual...decided to give it a try...    Best decision I have ever made---after about 3 weeks of using this product, my hair felt smoother, looked healthier and had that shine back...    I was skeptical about the non-suds factor as well, b/c I associated clean hair with the squeaky clean feeling--I wash my hair every day b/c it gets greasy and was worried that WEN would create a residue feeling that most other products on the market gave me- not so...    I have continued to wash my hair everyday, no residue build up, no \\&quot;split ends\\&quot;--i was told by wen product support that the whites on the ends of my hair were actually protein buildup from regular shampoos and conditioners not split ends--couldn&#x27;t be a truer statement...don&#x27;t have white dots anymore!  AND it&#x27;s all in one!  Just one bottle and you have your shampoo AND conditioner.    Obviously, each product works for a different person...after trying all of them, this was the best for me-left my hair clean, smelling great, non-greasy, managable, body and beautiful.  Once you buy it, I have a few suggestions: USE alot (I think I use 20-25 pumps--I have medium length hair and spread it all over, it&#x27;ll feel like a mask product that you would use to condition your hair) and rub it in (RUB, but not too hard) your scalp and the rest of your head for 3-5 mins, comb through, then let it sit for 5 mins.  A bottle usually lasts me a month and half.  (again this is the regime that works best for me!)    Remember that you are only skeptical because you are used to the products on the market--the same ingrediant in your shampoo now is the same ingrediant that can wash your clothes or clean your body with-sodium laurel sulfate, every product on the market has that ingrediant except for WEN products!    Check this out-----  Sodium laureth sulfate, or sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), is a detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste etc.). It is an inexpensive and very effective foamer.    Sodium Laurel Sulfate-Effects on sensitive skin:  (Products containing these substances can affect those prone to eczema and other irritants. These substances provide a foaming quality to the product, allowing for better distribution of the product while washing hair or skin and while brushing teeth. When rinsed off, the product will have cleaned the area but will have taken moisture from the top layers of skin. In people with sensitive skin (prone to dermatitis, acne, eczema, psoriasis and chemical sensitivity), the drying property of these type of detergents can cause flare-ups of skin conditions or may worsen existing conditions)    TRY THIS product! BEST thing you could do for your hair!  I promise!  I have been telling all my girls, all the salons, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the WEN products. I think if you have very thin hair or virgin hair (no color) it may be too much conditoning and leave hair flat. However, if your hair is thick oily or color teated choosing the right cleanser would be great! I love mine for sure. I have long, straight, color processed, oily scalp hair. It leaves my hair clean, not having to wash everday as I previously did with other shampoos, and my husband says my hair is silky soft.I love WEN.</li>
            <li> I colour my hair, wear it long (mid back) and have struggled with split ends for years.  Every time I managed to get it to grow another inch, I had to have that inch cut off because of the split ends.    Enter WEN, hero of the hour (and day, and year!)    I have been using this version of Wen for 3 months now, starting just after my hair was trimmed.  It has been a pleasure to use, my hair is in gleaming, soft, healthy condition, but the thing that has prompted me to write this review is the fact that I can&#x27;t find any split ends.  None.  All the ends that were cut by the hairdresser, 3 months ago, are as neat as the day I walked out of the salon.  And believe me, I have just spent a good 10 minutes looking.    Now I just have to wait about 2 years for all the old split ends that split up the hair shaft (presumably due to my old shampoos) to grow out, and I will have the hair I used to have in my teen years again.  And to think, it was my shampoo that was doing all that damage...    I am very, very impressed with this product, and intend to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> December Update:  After using this product for two months, I have reverted back to using regular shampoo.  I still use Wen as a daily conditioner though. It also works great as a leave-in conditioner.  I left the conditioner in overnight and then washed again with Wen in the morning, and my hair looked noticeably thicker and shinier.    Original Review:  I ordered the Sweet Almond Mint, Cucumber Aloe, and Lavender cleansing conditioners.  So far I have only used the Cucumber Aloe.  The product works as advertised.  My hair is softer and fuller, looks healthier, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.  I have short hair (sits at my shoulders), and six pumps for the crown, each side, and nape of my neck seems to be an appropriate amount (24 pumps total).  The Cucumber Aloe smells/feels like it has mint in it--it has a cooling effect, which I don&#x27;t mind.  My hair feels a little heavy on \\&quot;day 2\\&quot; so I&#x27;m forced to wash it daily, but I do like how the product makes my hair feel on \\&quot;day 1\\&quot;, so I will continue to use it.  I highly recommend Wen for anyone looking for a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. I have very fine hair and this works great my hair does not seem so flyaway or dry on the ends. Thank you from pinkbshoes</li>
            <li> This weighs my hair down still but with a combination of this and other hair shampoos.  My hair has went from drab to fab....  highly recommended</li>
            <li> Hmmm.... The product is not really for me. I have better results with the standard shampoo then condition approach. I actually found the health of my hair seemed worse after using the product for a month.   It might work great for someone else though. The product smells nice. It has a nice consistency, and tingling sensation due to the menthol it has in it. It was a good experiment but I plan to try something else.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. I have very very very fine hair so I wish the product would give it a little more body. My hair does feel healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> While the product is good the Cucumber Aloe has the WORST smell ever! It is like Vic&#x27;s Vapor Rub but worse. I have super, super fine hair and the best product is the Sweet Almond Mint. It&#x27;s fantastic. It really made my dry hair soft without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve tried to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner and this makes my hair so much better. Just steer away from Cucumber Aloe it smells HORRIBLE. My boyfriend won&#x27;t even let me have it in the shower. Who wants a product that drives the boys away? Try any other smell. It is a good product. The company needs to rework this Cucumber Aloe scent. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it only works if you use it every day. I tried this one after ordering a set from Guthy-Renker which included a smaller version of the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, plus the intensive conditioner, styling cream and some kind of styling wax. I washed my hair with the cleansing conditioner, and it&#x27;s just not doing it for me, cleansing wise. It wasn&#x27;t horrendous, but my hair was flat, flat, flat and way too soft. I felt like I had LESS hair, not more. In addition, my scalp is VERY oily and gets pimples and sebum build up, scaling....if that describes you, you won&#x27;t be able to use it either...so they said try the Cucumber Aloe and it was much better than the Sweet Almond Mint, but only worked for me if I washed my long hair every single day (which I rarely do). After using only this product, my hair was so oily by day 2 it was much worse than any sudsing shampoo ever left my hair on day 2. Sorry, but I feel better with lather, and there are several lathering shampoos out there that do not contain sodium lauryl sulfate or whatever the culprit is that supposedly leaves your hair and scalp dry and abused (Besides, there is NO WAY I am not going to use a lathering shampoo to wash away the dye when I color my hair!) Anyway, I use the new Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for dry scalp (really great, btw), then use the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner as a \\&quot;full head\\&quot; conditioner (the cucumber aloe didn&#x27;t work as a regular conditioner for me because the Sweet Almond Mint was more moisturizing, but it may work for you), and the intensive conditioner (or someone else&#x27;s) on the ends. Works really great, and to be honest, I get the same great results that everyone else is talking about. By day 2 my hair is still quite clean! Just be sure to only use the regular shampoo ONCE. Do not repeat!</li>
            <li> Love all of the Chaz Dean products but the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner works best on my hair which is dry and fine.</li>
            <li> I was unlucky enough to order my product during the holiday season so my post office delivered it, then returned it when I wasn&#x27;t there to pick it up. I sent a note to customer service at Chaz Dean and they were very helpful, re-sent the package at no cost to me, and I was able to enjoy this great product finally. Thank you.</li>
            <li> When I start using new products I usually give a time at least 2 weeks. I had used this product for almost 4 weeks. But unfortunately miracle didn&#x27;r happen to my hair. Actually my hair lost shine and always looked dirty. I shoud say my scapl felt dirty too. I hve very long hair so I used over 30 pumps. When I used as leave in conditioner, I had a hard time comb my hair after dried. Ihad decided go back my old hair care, now shine is back, I feel more clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as everyone says!  I saw the infomercial, read the reviews and thought... humm... expensive but I will try anything once... Well.. I will use this product forever.  I have thin,fine straight hair.. yes, lucky me.  It won&#x27;t grow past my shoulders... But now... even in the month and half I have used this product, my hair has grown an inch and a half EASY.  Which is a big deal for me &amp; my hair!  I recommend this to everyone!  If you are interested and can afford it... BUY IT!! Even if you are slightly interested... a bit worried about the cost.. TRY IT!  I tell you, it is worth it and you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Have used this product prior and liked it - don&#x27;t think it was any cheaper ordering it on Amazon than directly from company.  I selected regular ground delivery and got product in a couple days.  Was greatly disappointed when the shipping amount was $9.00 - especially for such a small box!  Will probably not order again.</li>
            <li> This cleanser/conditioner really works for my abundant but fine hair.  My scalp is slightly oily but the ends of my hair are slightly dry and  this Cucumber/Aloe formulation is the perfect treatment for me.  I saw an immediated improvement in the fullness and appearance of my  hair.  I can only praise this product for effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and not too thick.  This product makes my hair feel and look dirty.  Some days it makes my hair full of static and too soft, to the point where I can&#x27;t do a thing with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a handful of times, so I suppose I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any significant improvement...but I have followed the directions EXACTLY as stated in the booklet that comes with the product (and surprisingly, it says that if you do indeed follow the directs carefully, you DON&#x27;T need to use the product every day, but rather your hair should be good for 2-3 days without cleansing again).  Anyway, I like the smell and the feel of the cleanser on my scalp, and initially I didn&#x27;t notice too many hairs falling out, but after several more uses, I felt like more hair was coming out in the shower.  My scalp is generally very oily, and while this does a good job of cleansing it, I&#x27;m just not sure that the price is worth it.  I could use head and shoulders shampoo/conditioner and it basically cleanses and conditions the scalp in the same way (just minus the \\&quot;dreaded\\&quot; sodium laurel/laureth sulfate).  So ultimately, I would say, if you don&#x27;t mind the price, then give this a whirl, but if you do, then don&#x27;t bother because I just don&#x27;t think the hype surrounding the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit out of my haircare budget, but I am very happy with the WEN conditioning shampoo. If it were a little more affordable I would definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and and I have a lot of it. I usually use shampoos for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair, or ocassionally for  \\&quot;extra body\\&quot;. Since the birth of my child I&#x27;ve had an ocassional itchy scalp - no flakes, no fungal, just itch. I thought I would try WEN, thinking I might like to eliminate the sodium laurel sulphates - maybe it was an irritant.   &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product patiently and faithfully for over a week (daily cleansing). I&#x27;ve tried more lotion and less; more water and less; leaving in longer and less. My scalp tingles and the cleanser smells great (strong!) while washing. But after I towel or blow dry, my hair is flat (albeit shiny) and looks oily / dirty halfway through the day. And my scalp itches again! &lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product is for coarser or drier hair, but not for fine, normal-to-oily hair.</li>
            <li> I first saw the infommercial for this product and was sucked in, but being a savvy buyer, I did some homework.  Some of the reviews are definitely fake, but overall I think that people do feel the product does what it claims to do.  I went with the Cucumber Aloe due to my oily, baby fine hair.  I got it in the mail and tried it that next day; mind you, I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in two days!  It felt like lotion and I was a bit worried that my baby fine, oily hair would be weighed down.  Imagine my amazement when I was able to comb through my hair with ease and upon blow-drying it was as if the ends decided to curl themselves under!!  This product has made my hair stronger with less breakage, the color is much shiner.  And who knew that hair could be so soft, yet voluminous and bouncy all at the same time!?  Not me.  I am so glad that I bought Wen!  My only complaint is that you go through it so quickly and you can&#x27;t find it in stores; you must order online.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Once you use this you&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.  I use it on my toddler as well, it gets rid of the tangles much better than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  I first bought Wen in October of 2008, and it left my hair so healthy and in such great shape, I literally did not have to get a hair cut for 6 months!   I have fine, slightly wavy blonde hair that I abuse with highlights, curling irons, and blow dryers, and Wen kept my hair moist and shiny regardless of the styling aids I use.  It also grew extremely fast and kept my highlights looking good a lot longer than usual.      A few weeks ago, I tried to switch back to a normal, commercial shampoo that I can find locally in a salon rather than having to mail order, but after just a few days of using it, my hair felt like straw and started breaking.  If you&#x27;re skeptical about the claim that sulfates are bad and drying to the hair, I urge to to try Wen for several weeks, and then use your shampoo just once.  You will definitely feel the difference and will have no desire to use a commercial shampoo again!    One recommendation- do not leave this product in as long as the instructions tell you to.  That weighed my hair down.  I use about half the recommended pumps, scrub my scalp and comb it through, and rinse it right away.  If you&#x27;re disappointed with it at first, I recommend altering how many pumps/how long you leave it in/ etc until you get a good result.      The cost is a little undesirable, but it is well, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I use only about 6 pumps and it keeps my hair clean for two or three days.  My hair does not have much body so if I use too much it appears limp.  I like the way my hair feels when I rinse this product out.  Other shampoos leave my color treated hair feeling stripped and dry.  Not with this product.  It smells okay.  If you have fine, thin hair get this Cucumber Aloe version as it isn&#x27;t as heavy on your hair.  It takes a while to figure out how many pumps to use.  I got compliments on my hair the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> Love the WEN products - went from losing 20-30 strands each time I washed my hair to losing less than 10. It is spendy, but good quality if you can afford it. Have tried the Almond/Mint also, the Cucumber/Aloe is lighter and  works well for fine or thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one week and so far I love it. My hair was dry and frizzy. It&#x27;s much improved, my hair has definition and feels healthy and is shinier. I&#x27;ll give another review after using it longer but for now I say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product works good at first, but as my daughter continued using it it started drying out her scalp that she ended up with a lot of flakes and she followed the directions very well. I do not recommend this product it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly relaxed and colored hair -  pretty much the trifecta of haircare issues.  After using this conditioner just once, my hair looked healthier and shinier than before.  After a month of use, my hair is soft and manageable, with beautifully defined curls.  The ends stay sleek without frizz, and I don&#x27;t get that weird off-color overprocessed look.  I use less than necessary in the shower, then add a little after showering as a leave-in conditioner.  Because my hair is so thick, to avoid frizz I put in a Paul Mitchell gel-like glaze but that&#x27;s it.  I went from using about 5 products a day to just 2.  This product has my highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I tried this product last night after reading many reviews. I made sure not to put too much product in my stick-straight Asian hair, combed it out evenly in the shower (first used a pick, then a small-toothed comb), tied it up in a bun, took the rest of my shower, then rinsed it out for about 3 minutes. The outcome? My hair is definitely softer, and by the end of the day, it smells great. The thing is, you still have to actually STYLE your hair, so don&#x27;t buy this thinking that your hair will magically add volume and be perfect if you don&#x27;t do anything to it. If you choose to not style your hair, then you&#x27;ll have the best-smelling hair that&#x27;s still in a ponytail/bun. Overall, my hair feels great, smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t dried out at the ends.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair shiny, but did not enhance it&#x27;s condition in any other way.  It initially gave me a rash on my neck,ears and side of my face, so I stopped using it for awhile. Then tried it again, but rinsed for a long period of time and did not get the rash this time.     I use less expensive, store bought products that give my hair more body and keep it healthier. I feel I wasted my money on this shampoo.     Lesson learned!</li>
