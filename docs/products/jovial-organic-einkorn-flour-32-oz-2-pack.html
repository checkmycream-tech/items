            <li>This flour makes delicious cookies.</li>
            <li>Wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I have made pizza, bread sticks and banana bread - all delicious!</li>
            <li>To rate the flour excellent.</li>
            <li>Best flour I have cooked with yet!</li>
            <li>Wonderful to bake with and no reaction to the lowered gluten.</li>
            <li>It cooks up beautifully as an all-purpose flour used 1:1 in all my recipes calling for all purpose flour.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soaking flour in an acidic medium (10%) is a great way to eliminate those mineral-binding phytates.</li>
            <li>The books on Einkorn and how to make items are great with the pictures.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Pricy but a great product</li>
            <li>Everything I baked came out tasting great.</li>
            <li>The feedback was amazing!</li>
            <li>Delicious and easy to bake with.</li>
            <li>VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>All I ever use for my healthy bread!</li>
            <li>I also know the health benefits are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and</li>
            <li>Awesome product that replaces modern wheat in all the recipes I have tried.</li>
            <li>To test it&#x27;s reception, I didn&#x27;t mention what kind of flour I used.</li>
            <li>Everyone wanted to know what kind of flour I used.</li>
            <li>- that&#x27;s too warm.</li>
            <li>Let me give you one good reason why I love this wheat:</li>
            <li>I purchase in bulk and store the flour in my freezer as I don&#x27;t grind my own.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it out of curiosity since I make my own bread.</li>
            <li>I made the most amazing sourdough using the no knead sourdough method on breast ilia website and a desem culture from cultures for life website.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Leave out on the counter top or in a warm place overnight.</li>
            <li>Love this flour.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I adore this healthy, tasty flour.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago, a nutritionist warned me to not consume wheat products.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite flour!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this flour it is a cross between a batter and a dough, but the bread is the best I&#x27;ve ever made - all without yeast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Repeat two more times.</li>
            <li>Divide between the loaf pans and bake at 350&#x27;F for 35 minutes, then reduce oven to 300&#x27;F and bake for 10-20 minutes more or until done.</li>
            <li>I stir/beat until my arm gives out, and my breads are nice and light.</li>
            <li>Then check your dough and determine if more liquid is needed.</li>
            <li>- For added nutrition add in 1-2 eggs (they add protein and healthy fats and vitamins as well as working as a binder).</li>

            <li>I love Jovial products.  </li>
            <li>Can finally feel good about having wheat!!!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started from the proportion called by the recipe but had to keep adding more flour because the dough didn&#x27;t come together.</li>
            <li>I used this for baking bread - and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>we love baking bread with it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to bake with and I just love the fact that it is organic and has not been modified or hybridized.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve sought a decent substitute for processed wheat flour in my making, and most gluten free products are not so great either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to do and makes everything baked more nutritious.</li>
            <li>I have now made four loaves of bread and love this rich, flour.  </li>
            <li>Good to have a clean products harvested in a normal way for healthy non-gmo, NON-roundup drenched food.</li>
            <li>It made a moist, finely textured bread, cookie and muffins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine product</li>
            <li>This flour makes a beautiful golden bread that is better than regular flour.  </li>
            <li>light flaky results and a great flour to use instead of white flour</li>
            <li>[Next step - grinding my own grain!</li>
            <li>Cool on cooling racks and enjoy with lots of pasture butter or clotted cream, and jam or curd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cool on cooling racks and enjoy with lots of pasture butter or clotted cream, and jam or curd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This flour is not made from this wheat, allowing me to enjoy all my homemade desserts, quick breads, etc.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sells it in a terrific two pack, so you get a good amount.</li>
            <li>I have a zojirushi breadmaker that is able to work this whole grain flour.</li>
            <li>When I went to use it, it was full of bugs.</li>
            <li>In fact, I ended up using a full pack to make a 2-lb loaf.  </li>
            <li>Use very warm liquid, the same temperature as hot tap water, and either lemon juice or apple cider vinegar for the acid.</li>
            <li>About the temperature of hot tap water is fine.</li>
            <li>This particular flour from Jovial is one I&#x27;ve come to love very much.</li>
            <li>I put my flour in the freezer to keep fresh.</li>
            <li>fresh ground.</li>
            <li>Use parchment, fresh soaked breads will oxidize an aluminum baking sheet, and who needs Al in their bread?</li>
            <li>Use parchment, fresh soaked breads will oxidize an aluminum baking sheet, and who needs Al in their bread?</li>
            <li>I bought the two-pack this time because I used my first one up so quickly.  </li>
            <li>The einkorn flour is a good concept but this is not whole grain!</li>
            <li>I bought this to try out some recipes that I normally make Gluten Free for my daughter who is gluten intolerant.</li>
            <li>I have to use a little more to make the correct consistency batter when baking, but love to know that this wheat has not been sprayed with roundup to make harvest easier like the practices of wheat farmers in the United States.  </li>
            <li>Who would make a healthy alternative to wheat and destroy it by removing the germ and most nutrients?</li>
            <li>It did not rise quite like my bread flour would have and the crumb was a bit more dense as a result, but I am really, really thankful for trying this -- if for no other reason to see what people would have been eating a couple of thousand years ago.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s  still a cross between a dough and a batter, sprinkle 1/3 of the soda-salt mixture on top and fold in about 3-4 times.</li>
            <li>For the first time or two, mix up your liquid and acid in the measuring cup and just don&#x27;t pour it all in until you stir and determine if it&#x27;s all needed - that way you won&#x27;t make the dough too wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first time or two, mix up your liquid and acid in the measuring cup and just don&#x27;t pour it all in until you stir and determine if it&#x27;s all needed - that way you won&#x27;t make the dough too wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Healthy flour - very low gluten.</li>
            <li>It does cost more, but it&#x27;s worth every penny I spent</li>
            <li>Warm the milk slightly in a pan on the stove but do not simmer</li>
            <li>day or the night before, put the flour into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>- I suspect any milk will work fine, possibly even just all water.</li>
            <li>- I suspect any milk will work fine, possibly even just all water.</li>
            <li>The modern day wheat has been hybridized and caused digestive problems for me.  </li>
            <li>reasonably priced...</li>
            <li>My next experiment will be to use it in combination with gluten free  flour.  </li>
            <li>Then pour all into the flour-butter mixture and fold in fast, and let sit to soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whenever you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>Now gently fold and knead the dough about 8 to 10 times.</li>
            <li>When it is too wet, it won&#x27;t cook through so please determine if you need to add a bit more flour to prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>

            <li>When it is too wet, it won&#x27;t cook through so please determine if you need to add a bit more flour to prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>Einkorn is the only non-hybridized wheat that I know of which is available on our planet now.  </li>
            <li>After cutting, shaping and a 1 hour rise, baked and was really impressed with the nutty taste of this flour.</li>
            <li>make a soaked wheat Irish Soda Bread - mainly because my family loves it but also because it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorites is aluminum-free baking powder biscuits made hot in the morning and using this flour.  </li>
            <li>Organic ancient wheat strain does not cause stomach issues for me like most other brands.</li>
            <li>It also makes the gluten proteins more digestible by activating other enzymes and nutrients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pop them in the middle of the oven for about 40-55 minutes, until golden brown on top and bottom, and they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, middle of the loaf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pop them in the middle of the oven for about 40-55 minutes, until golden brown on top and bottom, and they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, middle of the loaf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will be a cross between a dough and a batter, as long as all the flour is moistened, just cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for 12-24 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Einkorn, unlike modern wheat, is a diploid grain meaning it has 2 genes that code for normal proteins.</li>
            <li>With a little experience, I might be able to minimize the &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The vinegar (or lemon juice) will sour the milk, but it will also clabber the milk proteins, so dump it into the warmed milk and mix quick!</li>
            <li>Very good flour, but very expensive.</li>
            <li>the dough in half, and gently form into 6 inch domed circle loaves, place on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, and cut an X on the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>the dough in half, and gently form into 6 inch domed circle loaves, place on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, and cut an X on the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</li>
            <li>The Einkorn flour makes a very crispy crust - instant upgrade to an already satisfactory recipe.  </li>
            <li>I use this flour in an effort to avoid modern hybridized-to-death wheat and get back to basics.</li>
            <li>Soaking activates phytase which almost completely neutralizes phytic acid in wheats, rye, barley and buckwheat.</li>
            <li>doughy batter should be light and fluffy now.</li>
            <li>However, purchase from Jovial Foods directly</li>
            <li>This makes Einkorn by far the healthiest wheat one can eat.</li>
            <li>Research present another fact how quickly flour will loose its vital nutrients and mold. .</li>
            <li>Modern wheat is hexaploid and some of it&#x27;s 23,600 proteins are not normal or natural at all - possibly contributing to the issues people have today with wheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gluten sensitive will benefit if using Wheat berries from the same company.</li>
            <li>Not really cheap, but then again, not really expensive either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with others here that it uses less liquid than modern wheat, that has been my experience as well.</li>
            <li>A healthier wheat with less gluten than the modern hybrid.</li>
            <li>The tops will be dark golden brown and they will be solid but hollow sounding if tapped on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depending on the flour used [emmer, kamut, modern wheat], it may form an actual dough; if so knead carefully with your hands in the bowl until it just comes together to form a moist, slightly sticky dough (if it is really wet, you can add a little more flour, but don’t make it too dry!</li>
            <li>So far this flour has not given me the negative reactions I have had to modern hybridized wheat flour.</li>

            <li> Healthy flour - very low gluten.</li>

            <li> One of my new favorites is aluminum-free baking powder biscuits made hot in the morning and using this flour.  </li>
            <li> Organic ancient wheat strain does not cause stomach issues for me like most other brands.</li>
            <li> It also makes the gluten proteins more digestible by activating other enzymes and nutrients.</li>

            <li> Gluten sensitive will benefit if using Wheat berries from the same company.</li>
            <li> Not really cheap, but then again, not really expensive either.</li>

            <li> The tops will be dark golden brown and they will be solid but hollow sounding if tapped on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on the flour used [emmer, kamut, modern wheat], it may form an actual dough; if so knead carefully with your hands in the bowl until it just comes together to form a moist, slightly sticky dough (if it is really wet, you can add a little more flour, but don’t make it too dry!</li>

            <li> Although this flour is expensive compared to traditional wheat flour, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I found it require less water or liquid compared to regular all-purpose or whole-wheat flour.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product!  Works well with all my recipes and handled well by picky stomachs in our home.</li>
            <li> Love this flour.  My gluten intolerant peeps can eat this without problems because it is an ancient grain and not adulterated.</li>
            <li> Great value! Wonderful flour!</li>
            <li> I made the most amazing sourdough using the no knead sourdough method on breast ilia website and a desem culture from cultures for life website.  I bought the breadth pis kit.  This flour makes a beautiful golden bread that is better than regular flour.  I also know the health benefits are amazing.</li>
            <li> The only all-purpose flour I use. Organic ancient wheat strain does not cause stomach issues for me like most other brands. No pesticides, non GMO.</li>
            <li> I make bread three or four times a week.  I mix in the Einkorn flour with other grains (wheat germ, coarsely ground corn meal, etc.).  The Einkorn flour makes a very crispy crust - instant upgrade to an already satisfactory recipe.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This flour makes delicious cookies. It is easy to bake with and I just love the fact that it is organic and has not been modified or hybridized.</li>
            <li> I adore this healthy, tasty flour.  Many years ago, a nutritionist warned me to not consume wheat products.  The modern day wheat has been hybridized and caused digestive problems for me.  This flour is not made from this wheat, allowing me to enjoy all my homemade desserts, quick breads, etc.  Wonderful!  Amazon sells it in a terrific two pack, so you get a good amount.</li>
            <li> I have now made four loaves of bread and love this rich, flour.  I have a zojirushi breadmaker that is able to work this whole grain flour.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that replaces modern wheat in all the recipes I have tried.</li>
            <li> reasonably priced... works well w/all baking. an &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; wheat... much less gluten!</li>
            <li> light flaky results and a great flour to use instead of white flour</li>
            <li> So far this flour has not given me the negative reactions I have had to modern hybridized wheat flour. I have made pizza, bread sticks and banana bread - all delicious!</li>
            <li> I will no longer buy from this company. I put my flour in the freezer to keep fresh. When I went to use it, it was full of bugs. The date to return has passed. Which shouldn&#x27;t matter, as the bugs had to have been there when it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Baked items are a little crumbly using it, but the health benefits far outweigh the slight inconvenience.  With a little experience, I might be able to minimize the &amp;#34;crumbly&amp;#34; part.</li>
            <li> Gluten sensitive will benefit if using Wheat berries from the same company. fresh ground. To rate the flour excellent. Research present another fact how quickly flour will loose its vital nutrients and mold. .</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve sought a decent substitute for processed wheat flour in my making, and most gluten free products are not so great either.  So when I heard about Einkorn flour and looked online, Jovial was the brand that came up. I used it for holiday baking. To test it&#x27;s reception, I didn&#x27;t mention what kind of flour I used. The feedback was amazing! Everyone wanted to know what kind of flour I used. It made a moist, finely textured bread, cookie and muffins. My next experiment will be to use it in combination with gluten free  flour.  It does cost more, but it&#x27;s worth every penny I spent and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flour!&lt;br /&gt;I make a soaked wheat Irish Soda Bread - mainly because my family loves it but also because it&#x27;s so easy. I use this flour in an effort to avoid modern hybridized-to-death wheat and get back to basics. [Next step - grinding my own grain! Yup, Amazon has grain mills...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with others here that it uses less liquid than modern wheat, that has been my experience as well. I mix my flour and the liquid and a bit of lemon juice for acid content and let it sit, covered with plastic wrap so it doesn&#x27;t dry out, on the counter for 24 hours. After that soak, I mix in my salt and baking soda and any dried fruit I feel like adding. Then I pour it into buttered and floured loaf pans and bake. That&#x27;s all there is to it. With this flour it is a cross between a batter and a dough, but the bread is the best I&#x27;ve ever made - all without yeast, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Einkorn, unlike modern wheat, is a diploid grain meaning it has 2 genes that code for normal proteins. Modern wheat is hexaploid and some of it&#x27;s 23,600 proteins are not normal or natural at all - possibly contributing to the issues people have today with wheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soaking flour in an acidic medium (10%) is a great way to eliminate those mineral-binding phytates. Soaking activates phytase which almost completely neutralizes phytic acid in wheats, rye, barley and buckwheat. It also makes the gluten proteins more digestible by activating other enzymes and nutrients. Use very warm liquid, the same temperature as hot tap water, and either lemon juice or apple cider vinegar for the acid. Soak your bread dough or batters for 12-24 hours and then finish and bake. It&#x27;s easy to do and makes everything baked more nutritious. For me, it&#x27;s easier to do this than not, because it splits the work over two days rather than all in the same day. Here&#x27;s my recipe, mine is always a batter-dough cross, never a true dough so I always use loaf pans. Eat Well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly&#x27;s Irish Soda Bread&lt;br /&gt;Makes 2 loaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Cups organic einkorn flour&lt;br /&gt;3 Tablespoons pasture butter&lt;br /&gt;2 Cups raw milk with 3T removed and 3T organic raw apple cider vinegar added just before adding to flour&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons baking soda&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon Celtic sea salt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day or the night before, put the flour into a large bowl. Rub the butter into the flour with fingers until the biggest pieces of butter are the size of a pea. Warm the milk slightly in a pan on the stove but do not simmer - that&#x27;s too warm. About the temperature of hot tap water is fine. The vinegar (or lemon juice) will sour the milk, but it will also clabber the milk proteins, so dump it into the warmed milk and mix quick! Then pour all into the flour-butter mixture and fold in fast, and let sit to soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a cross between a dough and a batter, as long as all the flour is moistened, just cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for 12-24 hours. Depending on the flour used [emmer, kamut, modern wheat], it may form an actual dough; if so knead carefully with your hands in the bowl until it just comes together to form a moist, slightly sticky dough (if it is really wet, you can add a little more flour, but don’t make it too dry! Also, don’t over knead!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave out on the counter top or in a warm place overnight. Whenever you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together the baking soda and salt in a small separate bowl. Butter and flour 2 glass or ceramic loaf pans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The doughy batter should be light and fluffy now. If it&#x27;s  still a cross between a dough and a batter, sprinkle 1/3 of the soda-salt mixture on top and fold in about 3-4 times. Repeat two more times. Divide between the loaf pans and bake at 350&#x27;F for 35 minutes, then reduce oven to 300&#x27;F and bake for 10-20 minutes more or until done. The tops will be dark golden brown and they will be solid but hollow sounding if tapped on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is a dough, take it out of the bowl and press into a thick circle on a breadboard (use flour to prevent sticking). Pour about half of the soda-salt mixture on the dough And then fold in half, Flatten out a bit again, and then pour the rest on it and fold again. Now gently fold and knead the dough about 8 to 10 times. You will almost feel like it won’t come together and then all of a sudden it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut the dough in half, and gently form into 6 inch domed circle loaves, place on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, and cut an X on the top of the loaf with a sharp knife. Use parchment, fresh soaked breads will oxidize an aluminum baking sheet, and who needs Al in their bread? If you prefer loaf pans, use them instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pop them in the middle of the oven for about 40-55 minutes, until golden brown on top and bottom, and they sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, middle of the loaf. Cool on cooling racks and enjoy with lots of pasture butter or clotted cream, and jam or curd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can add spices with the salt and soda, such as cinnamon and nutmeg and allspice.&lt;br /&gt;You can also add herbs, how about rosemary soda bread?

            <li> Best flour I have cooked with yet!</li>
            <li> Let me give you one good reason why I love this wheat: It&#x27;s DNA hasn&#x27;t been messed with.   Here is the recipe I use for making bread with only four ingredients. Anyway, read about Einkorn wheat and its history and you&#x27;ll want to change to this product too. http://www.simplysogood.com/2010/03/crusty-bread.html  Just read the Einkorn wheat directions about the water amount to use.</li>
            <li> I have to use a little more to make the correct consistency batter when baking, but love to know that this wheat has not been sprayed with roundup to make harvest easier like the practices of wheat farmers in the United States.  Good to have a clean products harvested in a normal way for healthy non-gmo, NON-roundup drenched food.</li>
            <li> I love Jovial products.  I purchase in bulk and store the flour in my freezer as I don&#x27;t grind my own.  However, purchase from Jovial Foods directly and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to bake with and no reaction to the lowered gluten. Can finally feel good about having wheat!!!!</li>
            <li> Einkorn is the only non-hybridized wheat that I know of which is available on our planet now.  This makes Einkorn by far the healthiest wheat one can eat. This particular flour from Jovial is one I&#x27;ve come to love very much. It cooks up beautifully as an all-purpose flour used 1:1 in all my recipes calling for all purpose flour. One of my new favorites is aluminum-free baking powder biscuits made hot in the morning and using this flour.  I bought the two-pack this time because I used my first one up so quickly.  I&#x27;m about to make bread with it and am looking forward already to the results.</li>
            <li> Although this flour is expensive compared to traditional wheat flour, it is well worth it.  I have severe brain fog when I use regular flour.  I do not appear to have any negative effects on my brain with using this flour.</li>
            <li> My order arrived as you said and in tack. I have not had time to use it yet but looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;making bread. The books on Einkorn and how to make items are great with the pictures.</li>
            <li> Very good flour, but very expensive. Too expensive to use on a regular basis, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll look at sourcing it locally.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. A healthier wheat with less gluten than the modern hybrid.</li>
            <li> My family doesn&#x27;t have any gluten sensitivity.  I ordered it out of curiosity since I make my own bread. I used it to make a bread as I usually do with regular flour. I found it require less water or liquid compared to regular all-purpose or whole-wheat flour.  I started from the proportion called by the recipe but had to keep adding more flour because the dough didn&#x27;t come together. In fact, I ended up using a full pack to make a 2-lb loaf.  The taste is similar to regular flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine product but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out some recipes that I normally make Gluten Free for my daughter who is gluten intolerant. I read that many people can eat this without feeling sick. Not so with our experience. Tried cookies and cornbread and both made her ill. So if you are looking for a flour that you can substitute for GF this is not it.</li>
            <li> Pricy but a great product</li>
            <li> Healthy flour - very low gluten.</li>
            <li> Made a rustic loaf of bread with this (flour, salt, yeast and water -- used a wet mix and after two hours of rising, put in fridge to really slow fermentation for a day). After cutting, shaping and a 1 hour rise, baked and was really impressed with the nutty taste of this flour. It did not rise quite like my bread flour would have and the crumb was a bit more dense as a result, but I am really, really thankful for trying this -- if for no other reason to see what people would have been eating a couple of thousand years ago. Not really cheap, but then again, not really expensive either.</li>
            <li> Delicious and easy to bake with. I found it was a bit clumpy as the only downside. Everything I baked came out tasting great.</li>
            <li> I used this for baking bread - and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> All I ever use for my healthy bread!</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this flour and like knowing its from wheat that hasn&#x27;t been altered by hybridization that gives us allergies and &amp;#34;wheat belly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;grain brain&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and we love baking bread with it. We eat a Paleo diet but the only cheat we have is baking a loaf of Einkorn sourdough bread. Wish it was sold in a 5 lb bag!</li>
            <li> The einkorn flour is a good concept but this is not whole grain! Very disappointed! Who would make a healthy alternative to wheat and destroy it by removing the germ and most nutrients? I can&#x27;t imagine.</li>
            <li> VERY pleased with this product.</li>
