            <li>I use normal face wash (acne dote wash) when I am in the shower, but when I&#x27;m out of the shower and don&#x27;t feel like getting my face wet, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>This also smells light and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I found it so mild</li>

            <li>I was excited to start using this because it contained willow bark, which has been an effective ingredient in other products I have used before for acne.</li>
            <li>They seem to be far more willing to stand by the quality of their products and are always very helpful.</li>
            <li>The wipes are a great fast way to clean your face when you know you need to wash your face, but you are too sleepy or tired to go into your bathroom,  turn on the bright lights, wash your face,  and then be wide awake!!</li>

            <li>but I moisturizers right away so not a big deal.</li>
            <li>My skin gets super dry after I wash it...</li>
            <li>Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin overly dry or tight.</li>
            <li>but after reading the reviews, it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>like gag over a scent that I don&#x27;t like sensitive.</li>
            <li>the first few days, my skin got really bumpy</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few weeks and see improvement in my skin. The smell isn&#x27;t nearly as good as their other towelettes, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it bad and I found it so mild, it dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for me because they work and I am lazy. Every time I&#x27;ve ever bought some elaborate several step process, I use it for about two days, then get bored and don&#x27;t keep up with it. With these, one wipe and makeup is gone, skin is cleaned, and acne medication is left. No rinsing needed. I&#x27;ve been using them in conjunction with their Good and Clean towelettes, to help regenerate my skin and it&#x27;s been a nice combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BGVL9HU Good &amp; Clean Dual Textured Exfoliating Towelettes 30 Count]]</li>
            <li> My skin gets super dry after I wash it... even if I just stand under the water in the shower. I have stopped washing my face since I started using these. I use one in the evening and then I use it again in the am. It removes my BB cream great and my acne is almost gone!!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using these, I really noticed a difference in my face. I had less visible acne, and my black heads weren&#x27;t as noticeable either.&lt;br /&gt;During the first few days, my skin got really bumpy and I was afraid I was going to breakout literally all over my face, but that never happened. I kept using them, and my skin smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the smell is that horrid. It isn&#x27;t my favorite smell, but it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel a bit of a burn and tingle when I use them.</li>
            <li> Bought this product just yesterday for my daughter.  Opened up the package and took one out and we, right away, noticed they smelled like a musty basement with a hint of mint. Gross!  She used one, but couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so we washed her face.  I&#x27;ll never know if they work well, because they&#x27;re in our trash now.  Thumbs down to the smell :(</li>
            <li> The wipes had a weird smell, but the main issue I had was my face started stinging immediately after using. I had a similar issue with wipes made by a different company. Both brands used willow bark extract so I think I may have had a reaction to that ingredient. I wouldn&#x27;t say I am sensitive to products as I have never had any other reactions. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Neutrogena Oil-Free Pink Grapefruit wipes and their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know how effective these are at actually cleansing my skin because I had to toss them after one use. They literally smell like a moldy towel! I honestly thought perhaps I got a bad batch but after reading the reviews, it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;m not alone!</li>
            <li> I have acne on my chin. I use this to to take any excess dirt after I have washed my face. Not harsh. Does dry up my face but I moisturizers right away so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I love how convent this is when you dont wanna get up and wash your makeup off. This has salicylic acid in it and willow bark that really helps with breakouts. This also smells light and fresh. This makes my face feel clean and soft. This does not irritate or sting my face at all and takes all my makeup off. I love that this is more natural for your skin then alot of other acne products. Just make sure you close this all the way or it will dry out. I use this in the morning and before bed for about a month and it cleared my skin pretty good. These can be a little expensive but you can find most of these products and TJ maxx and Marshalls. Give this a try it is very helpful to have.</li>
            <li> I was excited to start using this because it contained willow bark, which has been an effective ingredient in other products I have used before for acne. However, when I opened up the pack I immediately noticed that the towelettes smelled moldy.  I too thought it was a bad batch, but I got on here to see if others thought the same and sure enough, I am not the only one who think it smells horrid.  I will never use these towelettes again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these because I have very acne prone skin. But as soon as I opened it I noticed they were barley wet. They were very dry and when I started to take off my makeup, they started to burn my face. One of the worst pains I&#x27;ve ever felt. No matter how many times I washed my face, it still burned. Don&#x27;t like these at all, and I&#x27;m definetly going to throw them away.</li>
            <li> I just used my very first towelette out of the package and within seconds I was gagging from the smell &amp; had to wash off the residue. Really sad I paid for these &amp; am going to have to immediately throw them out :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m so lazy but I never can be bothered to wash my face at night. Well, no problem any more. These get rid of all my makeup and they have totally cleared up my skin. I use it with the treatment gel and it&#x27;s awesome. Yay Alba!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin overly dry or tight. Didn&#x27;t make my acne better or make it go away, but it was refreshing to use when I didn&#x27;t want to wash my face. After consistent use, I did notice that they were stinging my face.</li>
            <li> These wipes were a waste of money.  Not only are they nearly dry to the touch, the product seems far harsher than some of the acne products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I made repeated attempts to give feedback on the Alba Botanica website, they never posted my review.  When I made repeated attempts to contact the Alba Botanica customer service, I never heard back from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy the Alba Botanica products again.  Not only are they not useful or helpful, their customer service is apparently lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase from other companies with good customer service, such as derma e and Mario Badescu.  They seem to be far more willing to stand by the quality of their products and are always very helpful.</li>
            <li> Great natural option acne cleansing towels.  Removes my makeup at night while helping to fight off any acne issues.</li>
            <li> fine for air travel &amp; carry-on bags, but they&#x27;re just ok as a facial cleansing wipes. i won&#x27;t be buying them again. nelson&#x27;s are way better.</li>
            <li> I literally gagged after applying it to my face. I love organic (or semi organic) products but I had to waste this pack by throwing it away. The smell is worse then a dirty towel. It reminds me of vomit with a touch of mint. Who passed these on inspection before hitting the market? Ugh!!!</li>
            <li> bought this to treat my acne, just used it for the first time, it removed my makeup really well!!! I prefer this to Bobbie Brown eye makeup remover</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I could not find any of the alba acne cleanser while traveling. The towelettes clean well but the smell they leave behind on my skin is unbearable. The instructions say to not wash your face off after use but I found this impossible and had to wash my face to clear the smell. I would use these again if the company would work on the smell.</li>
            <li> These leave your face very clean and soft. The wipes are a great fast way to clean your face when you know you need to wash your face, but you are too sleepy or tired to go into your bathroom,  turn on the bright lights, wash your face,  and then be wide awake!! So keep them by the bed and you can always sleep with a very clean and soft face.</li>
            <li> My sister bought these and let me try one. We both have acne prone skin. I pulled one out of the pack and began using it and holy hell! The smell was like a million soggy, mildewy towels on a flooded basement floor! It was such an obnoxious odor-- I almost got sick. My face also started stinging almost immediately. I washed my three times and my hands about five times and the smell is seeming to stick in my sinuses. My stomach is starting to churn again. Throwing these away!</li>
            <li> When you are away or aren&#x27;t near a sink for your makeup removal (which is a must), these are perfect. I was not bothered by the smell that another reviewer spoke about and I am super sensitive to smells...like gag over a scent that I don&#x27;t like sensitive. These are perfect for on the go...or just a lazy night.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. I&#x27;ve had to deal with terrible acne and the wipes are a miracle worker. They&#x27;ve made a huge impact on my skin :)</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and they keep my acne at bay. If I don&#x27;t use them, I&#x27;ll break out. They are gentle on my skin, smell just fine and 2 wipes will clean my face great. I use the acne gel when I do break out and that works great too. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These wipes are great! The salicylic acid really does a number on zits. They&#x27;re practically gone the next day! They also leave my skin super soft and have a nice, light and pleasant scent. Nothing too strong or perfumy. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I use normal face wash (acne dote wash) when I am in the shower, but when I&#x27;m out of the shower and don&#x27;t feel like getting my face wet, these are perfect. They clean well and have cleared up my skin. I use the acne dote astringent following this and then use the alba even advanced night cream and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
