            <li>hairdryer is a good value</li>
            <li>This was bought to replace a Revlon folding dryer that worked I loved.</li>
            <li>(so that is good)  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money I guess.</li>
            <li>I seen this one and loved the color so my experience w/</li>
            <li>its always good to have a back-up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like very hot air, so warm setting are good &amp; perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend.</li>
            <li>I love it!)</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love the comact design and the retractable cord is a must!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this one!</li>
            <li>Nice and compact unit but</li>
            <li>Have had this one for about 6 weeks now, am loving it.</li>
            <li>The cord gets persnickety, sometimes you really have to push on the button to get it to retract, but all-in-all, the blow dryer itself was wonderful</li>
            <li>Not too thrilled about the color</li>
            <li>this is not a compact blow dryer by any stretch, it is a full-size dryer that has some nice space-saving features</li>
            <li>Mind you we own a hair salon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to pack this without the cord taking up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord and the folding handle is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Tiny size with good power &amp; bright color!</li>
            <li>drys hair fast, has a detachable peice to clean and its great!!!</li>
            <li>Very light and compact.</li>
            <li>Warm is barely warm, and Hot is warm.</li>
            <li>This thing is huge!</li>
            <li>and I love the folding handle.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because I was having problems with static in my hair and it seemed frizzy.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a more neutral color.   </li>
            <li>and I do love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>but I LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li>cord retraction is strong--be sure to keep your fingers on the cord as it enters so it doesn&#x27;t twist, and watch out for the plug, which can flip up rather energetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit bulkier than I thought it was going to be, but it also has better air flow.</li>
            <li>Use it daily- very happy!</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this the UK with a converter rated for 10 amps (the blow dryer is 8 amps, so you need any converter with 10 amps or more).</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure which one to buy since there are so many.</li>
            <li>The folding handle is a great bonus for this item as it makes putting it away in the draw much simpler.</li>
            <li>I love that the cord retracts.  </li>
            <li>Love it Love it</li>
            <li>LOVE that the cord retracts and the handle folds.  </li>
            <li>I love retractable cord, and the folding handle.  </li>
            <li>I also love the 2 tools it comes with, such a great value!</li>
            <li>The cord is a bit short, but otherwise, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>But I love the folding and the cord reeling feature.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This unit is heavier for sure, and it was quite noticeable 1st week or two</li>
            <li>Most of the time it will not fully retract the cord.</li>
            <li>Noises,  not quiet&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, not light&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased with setting speeds and heat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be able to use it than have a cord that retracts.  </li>
            <li>, it is an ok dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love the retractable cord</li>
            <li>I love the color, I love the fact that the handle folds, I love that the cord retracts and I love the fact that it comes with a diffuser and concentrator attachments.</li>
            <li>Love the retracting cord.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful kind of electric/metallic blue.</li>
            <li>At first I loved everything about this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and as expected until about a week ago.</li>
            <li>This dryer is awesome for fine hair; it takes about 15 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li>for my wife, a replacement appears to function easily and well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to move them while you are using the dryer and they seem to be counter-intuitive, or it could just be me.</li>
            <li>It was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>easy to handle, the cords doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>, otherwise it is just fine</li>
            <li>While it dries fine, within 3 days the retractable cord would no longer retract all the way.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer in July 2014 and the dryer itself is fine.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair and sometimes have difficulty finding a hair dryer that won&#x27;t fry it in the process of drying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with how quickly this dries my hair.</li>
            <li>The cord retracts which is a huge plus.   </li>
            <li>Great dryer, lightweight and very quiet.  </li>
            <li>Make it more useful for me.</li>
            <li>Was a great Christmas present for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I primarily wanted this dryer for travel with the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Cord winding mechanism is wonderful, but does make unit heavy.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has warm/hot AND low/high setting precisely because of this reason.</li>
            <li>Really cheap dryer.</li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>and of-course my favorite thing about this model is forget the cool shot button this dryer has cool as and option on the switch ..and w/ a toddler</li>
            <li>This version is better, as the reel is not as strong as my first version.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and It drys quick, and has different hair needs!</li>
            <li>Dryer is clean and free from dust.</li>
            <li>and I can even use the high function if I keep it on warm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the Conair brand, but I had never purchased from them before.</li>
            <li>This is the third version of this &amp; I absolutely love how handy it is.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and cools quickly too so it is easy to store in a cupboard.</li>
            <li>Is also very quiet for a blow dryer, which is nice :)</li>
            <li>I quite honestly don&#x27;t use a hairdryer on a daily basis but I love this product.</li>
            <li>the price is definitely right!</li>
            <li>We liked the first one so much, we bought another.</li>
            <li>and it has 3 temps (hot, warm and cool) and is very portable.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a really good dryer.</li>
            <li>And this is a full size hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the hair dryer seems nice so far for day to day usage.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good dryer and gets the job</li>
            <li>The retractable cord is still my absolute favorite feature from this dryer.</li>
            <li>Although the blow dryer works really well (doesn&#x27;t make your hair frizzy) , the cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way most of the time.</li>
            <li>She finds this model light and compact yet powerful and it dries without the frizzes.</li>
            <li>so it takes a little bit for it to warm up when you start using it, once it gets the ceramic warm, then it puts out heat.</li>
            <li>Drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this new dryer.</li>
            <li>They should put a banana in the pictures for scale -- this is a great dryer that folds in half, has a retractable cord, has high/med/</li>
            <li>I found the hottest temperature setting to be too hot!</li>
            <li>Nice idea for the cord, but simply doesn&#x27;t stay extended.   </li>
            <li>The attachments are really useful and I am growing fond of the diffuser.</li>
            <li>It has a button to switch from 110 to 220, which comes in handy for those trips to Europe and such.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>use it now and then by wrapping the cord around the handle and holding it in place, but most of the time, I just use my old dryer, which hasn&#x27;t quit yet.  </li>
            <li>but for an adult, you may find it needs a bit more heat.  </li>
            <li>IT IS POTENT ENOUGH, HAS THE COOL AIR OPTION AND THE FOLDING ARM IS SO USEFUL.</li>
            <li>(yes, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re struggling for suitcase space and staying below weight limits this hairdryer can put you right over the line.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very large in size too.  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries quickly and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>- hope this one is even half as good.</li>
            <li>the color is BEAUTIFUL, not too loud, cord retracts (sometimes requiring a little effort</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it I was hooked.</li>
            <li>This dryer is very similar and I have been pleased with it in the two weeks</li>
            <li>and I had no troubles with it running hot</li>
            <li>and this is my first item with a retractable cord.</li>
            <li>Diffuser is tiny but better than nothing when traveling.</li>
            <li>Really like this dryer!</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Way better than those tiny hair dryers hotels have.</li>
            <li>It would be better smaller and lighter.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>It will take up way more space than a regular dryer, even with the folding handle and retractable cord.</li>
            <li>First off, this is not a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>Even on the highest setting, it is not too hot for him.  </li>
            <li>I typically used Cool or Warm heat on High speed.</li>
            <li>the left side you have HOT, WARM, and COOL, and on the right are LOW, OFF, and HIGH.</li>
            <li>This is my second one to get as I loved my last one</li>
            <li>done pretty fast and it is compact,</li>
            <li>For me the button to retract the cord is in a strange space in the silver part of the dryer and it is fairly fast, so you might want to make sure that you are paying attention when you use the retract function as sometimes it swings the cord and can run into things like arms and faces.</li>
            <li>I chose Conair because it was half the price, and I liked the folding handle and the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works fine, but the medium setting is not as powerful as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, thanks.</li>
            <li>When I purchased the Conair 264XR about a year ago, I appreciated that it had a compact design while still offering an array of temperature and speed settings.</li>
            <li>The handle folds which is a much welcomed feature.   </li>
            <li>The You Reel by Conair dryer dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY NEAT.</li>
            <li>so it is always plugged in and ready to go, as well as a hole in the vanity shelf that it sits in.</li>
            <li>It worked really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the color</li>
            <li>This made my life much easier.</li>
            <li>I like how it folds and stores very neatly in my drawer.</li>
            <li>What I really like about it</li>
            <li>Would not call it an air travel dryer, for that find a simple light wt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also convenient thanks to the retractable cord and the fact it folds, which is helpful if you&#x27;re looking to pack it away for travel.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to store.  </li>
            <li>has really out done there self</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly without using such a hot setting.  </li>
            <li>Most other travel dryers do not have those features separate.  </li>
            <li>The air filter on the back has an improved design that I think will help me keep it clean</li>
            <li>I did check that again when it died this last time, but the filter was clean.  </li>
            <li>the 6 dollar packaging was not worth it, I could of wraped it better for cheaped.</li>
            <li>I had an older one and replaced with this model.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model Conair for about 5 yrs</li>
            <li>Gotta say this dryer packs a decent amount of power for its size.  </li>
            <li>When ran on high, for 20 seconds it overheats.</li>
            <li>Will run on high, medium heat for about 2 minutes before it overheats.</li>
            <li>Having the two sliders next to each other is kind of a pain until you get used to it and can remember which side does which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL</li>
            <li>Makes sense if you just want a little more drawer space at home, but I wouldn&#x27;t travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only criticism is the fact that while it&#x27;s great for normal use within the home I think it&#x27;s a little on the bigger side for travel.</li>
            <li>Cord retracting system and handle folding mechanism are a bit problematic from the very beginning and always end up breaking, but options for a full sized hair dryer with a folding handle are very limited...  </li>
            <li>Works way better than my old Revlon one that also had a cord retracted and folded in half.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box, the cord won&#x27;t retract back into the dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have waist long hair and this doesn&#x27;t cause split ends yet dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>3 different heat settings, different speeds, so this one is pretty fancy compared to what I was used to - really pretty color too!</li>
            <li>The retractable cord works well most of the time, sometimes it needs a little help winding up completely.  </li>
            <li>I live in Asia</li>
            <li>I needed a new blowdryer</li>
            <li>On top of that the cord function doesn&#x27;t work seamlessly and is too gimmicky for me.</li>
            <li>I like this dryer, dries fast without any frizz, retractable cord is very convenient, looks good, it&#x27;s juts a little too bulky and heavy for me, otherwise it would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li>so I have access to the high end professional dryers</li>
            <li>Exactly the same features</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a decent hairdryer at a reasonable price, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling the failure has to do with the retractable cord since I was able to retract the cord a few times and got it to work one more time...</li>
            <li>I do love that it&#x27;s small, folds in half for better storage, multiple settings and the color of course.</li>
            <li>Most hair dryers are bulky and take up too much counter or drawer space in my tiny bathroom, but with a folding handle and retractable cord, this one seemed to pack a lot of features into a small space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted these features, but was also drawn to some higher end, more expensive ones that did not have these features.  </li>
            <li>And the Hot temp does not get as hot as my previous dryer.  </li>
            <li>this line its better than anythg my girls use for half to a third the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the cord has recently become finicky and the hair dryer stops running if I move it in certain directions.</li>
            <li>I noticed it not getting as hot as usual one day, but it was warm enough to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Other retractable cord dryers I have tried have been quieter, but this one dries quickly without leaving my curly hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li>The switches are kind of hard to move back and forward since you have to slide them.  </li>
            <li>The unit itself has a comfortable handle and is not too heavy at 2.4 pounds.</li>
            <li>forbid it come near my hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this dryer as it was the second one I purchased that had a retractable cord and folding handle.</li>
            <li>This ones cord is much shorter, which can present problems at times.</li>
            <li>Conair is the brand my wife looks for simply because it seems to outlast the others and has the features she likes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>We had an identical unit about 5 years old but the connection at the plug became intermittent.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord and folding handle worked fine for the one time I used it before sending back, so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they would last before breaking as I have never owned a hair dryer with these features.</li>
            <li>This was a huge negative for me since those are two of the main selling points of this dryer.</li>
            <li>It is quite heavy but after using it for the first time, it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>So that said, I puttered over a new one for a while when my old was starting to show signs of dying.  </li>
            <li>It lasted longer than my last hair dryer though, and I blow dry my hair every day, so it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>folding handle is fine--I don&#x27;t need to fold it to fit it into my over-the-cabinet-door holder, so I don&#x27;t usually use it--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also powerful enough to dry my thick hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product blows plenty of air and it dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I wanted separate heat controls because our other (much lighter) travel dryer runs too hot to dry my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I have to use the hot setting now every time I use this dryer to blow dry my hair, which I have always been reluctant to do because of the possible hair damage to by the heat.  </li>
            <li>So if I have to give up a little heat to keep my hair nicer - then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li>okay but tired of fighting the cord.  </li>
            <li>I had the same problem a few months ago and the filter was completely full and the dryer was overheating.</li>
            <li>I am a light hair dryer user (2-4 times per week), so it&#x27;s disappointing that the product is failing so quickly.</li>
            <li>that was my first that folded in half &amp; had a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>Which is odd, because several other reviews seem to think the Hot temp is too hot.  </li>
            <li>Hard to keep it out at full length.   </li>
            <li>this hair dryer is a bit heavy but it works and work fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For example,drying my hair with the high blower setting and the high heat setting and  then change it to the low blower setting - no more heat</li>
            <li>BUT: it is large and heavy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> hairdryer is a good value</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace a Revlon folding dryer that worked I loved.</li>
            <li> (so that is good)  </li>
            <li> Good value for the money I guess.</li>
            <li> I seen this one and loved the color so my experience w/</li>
            <li> its always good to have a back-up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like very hot air, so warm setting are good &amp; perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it!)</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love the comact design and the retractable cord is a must!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this one!</li>
            <li> Nice and compact unit but</li>
            <li> Have had this one for about 6 weeks now, am loving it.</li>
            <li> The cord gets persnickety, sometimes you really have to push on the button to get it to retract, but all-in-all, the blow dryer itself was wonderful</li>
            <li> Not too thrilled about the color</li>
            <li> this is not a compact blow dryer by any stretch, it is a full-size dryer that has some nice space-saving features</li>
            <li> Mind you we own a hair salon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to pack this without the cord taking up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord and the folding handle is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Tiny size with good power &amp; bright color!</li>
            <li> drys hair fast, has a detachable peice to clean and its great!!!</li>
            <li> Very light and compact.</li>
            <li> Warm is barely warm, and Hot is warm.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge!</li>
            <li> and I love the folding handle.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was having problems with static in my hair and it seemed frizzy.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a more neutral color.   </li>
            <li> and I do love the retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> but I LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li> cord retraction is strong--be sure to keep your fingers on the cord as it enters so it doesn&#x27;t twist, and watch out for the plug, which can flip up rather energetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit bulkier than I thought it was going to be, but it also has better air flow.</li>
            <li> Use it daily- very happy!</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this the UK with a converter rated for 10 amps (the blow dryer is 8 amps, so you need any converter with 10 amps or more).</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure which one to buy since there are so many.</li>
            <li> The folding handle is a great bonus for this item as it makes putting it away in the draw much simpler.</li>
            <li> I love that the cord retracts.  </li>
            <li> Love it Love it</li>
            <li> LOVE that the cord retracts and the handle folds.  </li>
            <li> I love retractable cord, and the folding handle.  </li>
            <li> I also love the 2 tools it comes with, such a great value!</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit short, but otherwise, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> But I love the folding and the cord reeling feature.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This unit is heavier for sure, and it was quite noticeable 1st week or two</li>
            <li> Most of the time it will not fully retract the cord.</li>
            <li> Noises,  not quiet&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, not light&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased with setting speeds and heat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be able to use it than have a cord that retracts.  </li>
            <li> , it is an ok dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord</li>
            <li> I love the color, I love the fact that the handle folds, I love that the cord retracts and I love the fact that it comes with a diffuser and concentrator attachments.</li>
            <li> Love the retracting cord.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful kind of electric/metallic blue.</li>
            <li> At first I loved everything about this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully and as expected until about a week ago.</li>
            <li> This dryer is awesome for fine hair; it takes about 15 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> for my wife, a replacement appears to function easily and well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to move them while you are using the dryer and they seem to be counter-intuitive, or it could just be me.</li>
            <li> It was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> easy to handle, the cords doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> , otherwise it is just fine</li>
            <li> While it dries fine, within 3 days the retractable cord would no longer retract all the way.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer in July 2014 and the dryer itself is fine.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair and sometimes have difficulty finding a hair dryer that won&#x27;t fry it in the process of drying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with how quickly this dries my hair.</li>
            <li> The cord retracts which is a huge plus.   </li>
            <li> Great dryer, lightweight and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> Make it more useful for me.</li>
            <li> Was a great Christmas present for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I primarily wanted this dryer for travel with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Cord winding mechanism is wonderful, but does make unit heavy.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has warm/hot AND low/high setting precisely because of this reason.</li>
            <li> Really cheap dryer.</li>
            <li> Good so far.</li>
            <li> and of-course my favorite thing about this model is forget the cool shot button this dryer has cool as and option on the switch ..and w/ a toddler</li>
            <li> This version is better, as the reel is not as strong as my first version.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and It drys quick, and has different hair needs!</li>
            <li> Dryer is clean and free from dust.</li>
            <li> and I can even use the high function if I keep it on warm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with the Conair brand, but I had never purchased from them before.</li>
            <li> This is the third version of this &amp; I absolutely love how handy it is.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and cools quickly too so it is easy to store in a cupboard.</li>
            <li> Is also very quiet for a blow dryer, which is nice :)</li>
            <li> I quite honestly don&#x27;t use a hairdryer on a daily basis but I love this product.</li>
            <li> the price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> We liked the first one so much, we bought another.</li>
            <li> and it has 3 temps (hot, warm and cool) and is very portable.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a really good dryer.</li>
            <li> And this is a full size hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the hair dryer seems nice so far for day to day usage.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good dryer and gets the job</li>
            <li> The retractable cord is still my absolute favorite feature from this dryer.</li>
            <li> Although the blow dryer works really well (doesn&#x27;t make your hair frizzy) , the cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way most of the time.</li>
            <li> She finds this model light and compact yet powerful and it dries without the frizzes.</li>
            <li> so it takes a little bit for it to warm up when you start using it, once it gets the ceramic warm, then it puts out heat.</li>
            <li> Drys hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this new dryer.</li>
            <li> They should put a banana in the pictures for scale -- this is a great dryer that folds in half, has a retractable cord, has high/med/</li>
            <li> I found the hottest temperature setting to be too hot!</li>
            <li> Nice idea for the cord, but simply doesn&#x27;t stay extended.   </li>
            <li> The attachments are really useful and I am growing fond of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> It has a button to switch from 110 to 220, which comes in handy for those trips to Europe and such.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> use it now and then by wrapping the cord around the handle and holding it in place, but most of the time, I just use my old dryer, which hasn&#x27;t quit yet.  </li>
            <li> but for an adult, you may find it needs a bit more heat.  </li>
            <li> IT IS POTENT ENOUGH, HAS THE COOL AIR OPTION AND THE FOLDING ARM IS SO USEFUL.</li>
            <li> (yes, that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re struggling for suitcase space and staying below weight limits this hairdryer can put you right over the line.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very large in size too.  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries quickly and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> - hope this one is even half as good.</li>
            <li> the color is BEAUTIFUL, not too loud, cord retracts (sometimes requiring a little effort</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it I was hooked.</li>
            <li> This dryer is very similar and I have been pleased with it in the two weeks</li>
            <li> and I had no troubles with it running hot</li>
            <li> and this is my first item with a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Diffuser is tiny but better than nothing when traveling.</li>
            <li> Really like this dryer!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Way better than those tiny hair dryers hotels have.</li>
            <li> It would be better smaller and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> It will take up way more space than a regular dryer, even with the folding handle and retractable cord.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not a travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> Even on the highest setting, it is not too hot for him.  </li>
            <li> I typically used Cool or Warm heat on High speed.</li>
            <li> the left side you have HOT, WARM, and COOL, and on the right are LOW, OFF, and HIGH.</li>
            <li> This is my second one to get as I loved my last one</li>
            <li> done pretty fast and it is compact,</li>
            <li> For me the button to retract the cord is in a strange space in the silver part of the dryer and it is fairly fast, so you might want to make sure that you are paying attention when you use the retract function as sometimes it swings the cord and can run into things like arms and faces.</li>
            <li> I chose Conair because it was half the price, and I liked the folding handle and the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine, but the medium setting is not as powerful as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, thanks.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the Conair 264XR about a year ago, I appreciated that it had a compact design while still offering an array of temperature and speed settings.</li>
            <li> The handle folds which is a much welcomed feature.   </li>
            <li> The You Reel by Conair dryer dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY NEAT.</li>
            <li> so it is always plugged in and ready to go, as well as a hole in the vanity shelf that it sits in.</li>
            <li> It worked really well.</li>
            <li> I really like the color</li>
            <li> This made my life much easier.</li>
            <li> I like how it folds and stores very neatly in my drawer.</li>
            <li> What I really like about it</li>
            <li> Would not call it an air travel dryer, for that find a simple light wt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also convenient thanks to the retractable cord and the fact it folds, which is helpful if you&#x27;re looking to pack it away for travel.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to store.  </li>
            <li> has really out done there self</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly without using such a hot setting.  </li>
            <li> Most other travel dryers do not have those features separate.  </li>
            <li> The air filter on the back has an improved design that I think will help me keep it clean</li>
            <li> I did check that again when it died this last time, but the filter was clean.  </li>
            <li> the 6 dollar packaging was not worth it, I could of wraped it better for cheaped.</li>
            <li> I had an older one and replaced with this model.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model Conair for about 5 yrs</li>
            <li> Gotta say this dryer packs a decent amount of power for its size.  </li>
            <li> When ran on high, for 20 seconds it overheats.</li>
            <li> Will run on high, medium heat for about 2 minutes before it overheats.</li>
            <li> Having the two sliders next to each other is kind of a pain until you get used to it and can remember which side does which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL</li>
            <li> Makes sense if you just want a little more drawer space at home, but I wouldn&#x27;t travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only criticism is the fact that while it&#x27;s great for normal use within the home I think it&#x27;s a little on the bigger side for travel.</li>
            <li> Cord retracting system and handle folding mechanism are a bit problematic from the very beginning and always end up breaking, but options for a full sized hair dryer with a folding handle are very limited...  </li>
            <li> Works way better than my old Revlon one that also had a cord retracted and folded in half.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, the cord won&#x27;t retract back into the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have waist long hair and this doesn&#x27;t cause split ends yet dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> 3 different heat settings, different speeds, so this one is pretty fancy compared to what I was used to - really pretty color too!</li>
            <li> The retractable cord works well most of the time, sometimes it needs a little help winding up completely.  </li>
            <li> I live in Asia</li>
            <li> I needed a new blowdryer</li>
            <li> On top of that the cord function doesn&#x27;t work seamlessly and is too gimmicky for me.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer, dries fast without any frizz, retractable cord is very convenient, looks good, it&#x27;s juts a little too bulky and heavy for me, otherwise it would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li> so I have access to the high end professional dryers</li>
            <li> Exactly the same features</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a decent hairdryer at a reasonable price, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling the failure has to do with the retractable cord since I was able to retract the cord a few times and got it to work one more time...</li>
            <li> I do love that it&#x27;s small, folds in half for better storage, multiple settings and the color of course.</li>
            <li> Most hair dryers are bulky and take up too much counter or drawer space in my tiny bathroom, but with a folding handle and retractable cord, this one seemed to pack a lot of features into a small space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted these features, but was also drawn to some higher end, more expensive ones that did not have these features.  </li>
            <li> And the Hot temp does not get as hot as my previous dryer.  </li>
            <li> this line its better than anythg my girls use for half to a third the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the cord has recently become finicky and the hair dryer stops running if I move it in certain directions.</li>
            <li> I noticed it not getting as hot as usual one day, but it was warm enough to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Other retractable cord dryers I have tried have been quieter, but this one dries quickly without leaving my curly hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The switches are kind of hard to move back and forward since you have to slide them.  </li>
            <li> The unit itself has a comfortable handle and is not too heavy at 2.4 pounds.</li>
            <li> forbid it come near my hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this dryer as it was the second one I purchased that had a retractable cord and folding handle.</li>
            <li> This ones cord is much shorter, which can present problems at times.</li>
            <li> Conair is the brand my wife looks for simply because it seems to outlast the others and has the features she likes at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> We had an identical unit about 5 years old but the connection at the plug became intermittent.</li>
            <li> The retractable cord and folding handle worked fine for the one time I used it before sending back, so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they would last before breaking as I have never owned a hair dryer with these features.</li>
            <li> This was a huge negative for me since those are two of the main selling points of this dryer.</li>
            <li> It is quite heavy but after using it for the first time, it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> So that said, I puttered over a new one for a while when my old was starting to show signs of dying.  </li>
            <li> It lasted longer than my last hair dryer though, and I blow dry my hair every day, so it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> folding handle is fine--I don&#x27;t need to fold it to fit it into my over-the-cabinet-door holder, so I don&#x27;t usually use it--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also powerful enough to dry my thick hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product blows plenty of air and it dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted separate heat controls because our other (much lighter) travel dryer runs too hot to dry my son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to use the hot setting now every time I use this dryer to blow dry my hair, which I have always been reluctant to do because of the possible hair damage to by the heat.  </li>
            <li> So if I have to give up a little heat to keep my hair nicer - then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> okay but tired of fighting the cord.  </li>
            <li> I had the same problem a few months ago and the filter was completely full and the dryer was overheating.</li>
            <li> I am a light hair dryer user (2-4 times per week), so it&#x27;s disappointing that the product is failing so quickly.</li>
            <li> that was my first that folded in half &amp; had a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li> Which is odd, because several other reviews seem to think the Hot temp is too hot.  </li>
            <li> Hard to keep it out at full length.   </li>
            <li> this hair dryer is a bit heavy but it works and work fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For example,drying my hair with the high blower setting and the high heat setting and  then change it to the low blower setting - no more heat</li>
            <li> BUT: it is large and heavy.</li>
            <li> I expected the &amp;#34;hight&amp;#34; button to be up and the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting to be down, for me that would be logical, but it has the reverse.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough for my hard to dry hair.</li>
            <li> My old blowdryer shot out sparks, which was very alarming.</li>
            <li> AND A WEEK LATER CUT MY HAIR VERY SHORT, BUT IT DID WORK WELL WITH LONG HAIR.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than my last dryer and has a shorter cord -- if you bend over at the waist to dry your hair, you can forget it.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to move around and switch hands with ease.</li>
            <li> As long as the cord doesn&#x27;t pull out any further and twist/tangle, I will keep it.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need to retract and/or fold every day like I do, this should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although it was relatively inexpensive, I still expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> use my hair dryer daily and have limited space for storage</li>
            <li> I like it very much except it seems a little heavy</li>
            <li> but I think it will be convenient in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that one lasted me a really long time (4 years?)</li>
            <li> Minor dissapointments, but not complaints.</li>
            <li> It is a tad larger than expected, though.  </li>
            <li> The only other thing that took some getting used to were the control settings.  </li>
            <li> though is that the detachable diffuser does not fall off easily; a big difference from other dryers.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand find it to be standard &amp; nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> Also, the real color of this dryer is a little darker than pictured online, which is not a huge deal</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to burn your hair to get it dry</li>
            <li> It makes me think that it takes longer to dry my medium length hair -</li>
            <li> What I do know is that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as damaged when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> but at the end it does seems to dry the hair faster.  </li>
            <li> It also takes forever to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> only comment is that the High setting doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as previous dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no big deal) , handle folds down making it compact.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it has less power than my prior dryer</li>
            <li> Very quiet compared to my previous Conair.</li>
            <li> The You Reel by Conair dryer is a little big.</li>
            <li> and I expect it to last me for at least the next couple years.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer is twice as heavy as my last one -- unacceptable for a compact/travel dryer!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer lasted only a few months.</li>
            <li> One day I picked it up and the sliding power and speed buttons had simply jammed.</li>
            <li> This dryer is extremely large and heavy, so if you have longer hair your arms will be tired before your hair is halfway dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is less dry using it</li>
            <li> My hair has no static and is definitely shinier.</li>
            <li> and I prefer this one due to</li>
            <li> : Purchased the other Conair reel blowdryer (you, by Conair)&lt;br /&gt;Model</li>
            <li> Airflow is weaker than any other blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I guess due to the device to retract the cord.</li>
            <li> It holds up well under daily use, usually twice a day.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Overall, I do not recommend this dryer unless you have short, thin hair.</li>
            <li> -Only one setting seems to generate heat even for short hair, so if you have longer hair not great</li>
            <li> So it may as well be completely broken, since the Low setting is only a small jump beyond letting my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> Have owned this product for less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> Dryer reel breaks in less then 3 months...</li>
            <li> purchased 2in1 Reel Hair Dryer less then 3 months and already reel does not fully extent nor does the cord fully wind up.</li>
            <li> bought it less than 30 days ago</li>
            <li> I used this product approximately every other day for the past 15 months and it stopped working last week.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit heavy for her.</li>
            <li> Not great for styling on the low blower setting, no</li>
            <li> it is not light weight.</li>
            <li> but it is really heavy to handle.  </li>
            <li> A few hours after it arrived, I saw a similar and less expensive (by about $5) one in Target.</li>
            <li> I was very carefully from the beginning of keeping cord flat and not to have it twisted when winding it up.</li>
            <li> BUT it was made of flimsy material so, even if I could return this and get the less expensive one, I&#x27;m definitely keeping this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one the first time????</li>
            <li> (Although I find the &#x27;folding&#x27; feature to be kinda stiff &amp; hard to bend, 1st few times almost felt like I was breaking it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> Who cares about the short, snappy cord?&amp;#34; I thought that too, but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Cons I have are quite noticeable from my last hair dryer &amp; are a bit dissapointing (although not deal breakers).  </li>
            <li> past dryers</li>
            <li> And the cord snaps in so hard when retracting that it knocks things around - heaven</li>
            <li> I think maybe my unit may be an anomoly, but it still feels kinda hard to bend, even after owning for a month or so);  </li>
            <li> However, the handle is hard to fold.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not too crazy about is the color.</li>
            <li> NOTHING is mentioned - at least in the manual I found;.</li>
            <li> The folding handle is stiff and difficult to fold.</li>
            <li> I tried getting a hair dryer recently that didn&#x27;t reel in the cord and didn&#x27;t fold in half, and I hated it!</li>
            <li> Conair return center does not cover any shipping costs (neither way, which is bad costumer service in today&#x27;s times.&lt;br /&gt;Model</li>
            <li> Not happy with quality, will not purchase again and will think twice before purchasing Conair.</li>
            <li> So tired of fighting every time to keep it extended.  </li>
            <li> But, alas, that did not work, either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also made the false assumption that the hair dryer is compact.</li>
            <li> Less than 90 days and broken makes for a bad product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a YEAR and 4 months later the retractable chord STILL works (maybe I&#x27;ve just had horrible hair dryers before, but this is unheard of for me).</li>
            <li> I also have an expensive Elchim</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yes, the handle folds, but you&#x27;d be stupid to try and travel with this unless space and weight was of no issue.  </li>
            <li> Haters gonna hate</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the third version of this &amp; I absolutely love how handy it is. Bought it for my daughter this time &amp; she likes it, but it&#x27;s a bit heavy for her. I&#x27;m assuming she will get used to that as I have. This version is better, as the reel is not as strong as my first version.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact unit but Warm is barely warm, and Hot is warm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for over a year and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The color is so pretty and I love the folding handle.  The retractable cord works well most of the time, sometimes it needs a little help winding up completely.  I&#x27;ve bought another for when this one gives out, but it&#x27;s proving to be quite durable.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great dryer, lightweight and very quiet.  Arrived quickly, thanks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was having problems with static in my hair and it seemed frizzy. This blow dryer has corrected those issues for me. My hair has no static and is definitely shinier. The cord reel works great! I do not fold the handle because I have no need to at this time. So I can&#x27;t comment on that. Overall I am happy with this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I had this for 3, years in which I traveled a lot and would take it with me. From the first time I used it I was hooked. It dried my hair fast and added a shine and softness. although mine just died I&#x27;ve  already got another one on the way.</li>
            <li> Great price for this item.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. I bought it for a Europe trip for its voltage switch and ended up using it when I got back to the States as well. The retractable chord still works after backpacking for 4 months (yes, that&#x27;s right, I backpack with a hairdryer) plus a year after that, so a YEAR and 4 months later the retractable chord STILL works (maybe I&#x27;ve just had horrible hair dryers before, but this is unheard of for me). This definitely gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the Conair 264XR about a year ago, I appreciated that it had a compact design while still offering an array of temperature and speed settings. Most hair dryers are bulky and take up too much counter or drawer space in my tiny bathroom, but with a folding handle and retractable cord, this one seemed to pack a lot of features into a small space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer has 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings. I typically used Cool or Warm heat on High speed. I found the hottest temperature setting to be too hot! The unit itself has a comfortable handle and is not too heavy at 2.4 pounds. I used the concentrator attachment. The cord is long enough to move around and switch hands with ease. At the push of a button, the cord will retract into the hair dryer, but it does get stuck occasionally. The folding handle is ideal for those who travel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the cord has recently become finicky and the hair dryer stops running if I move it in certain directions. I suspect this is from the corn being pulled, retracted, and folded into the unit over and over. I am a light hair dryer user (2-4 times per week), so it&#x27;s disappointing that the product is failing so quickly. I would not recommend this product to someone who uses their hair dryer daily.</li>
            <li> I live in Asia so I need a 220v/dual voltage appliance. This one is just that but you have to switch the voltage manually; it is NOT auto volt.  The cord retracts which is a huge plus.   The handle folds which is a much welcomed feature.   The only thing I&#x27;m not too crazy about is the color. It&#x27;s a beautiful kind of electric/metallic blue. I just wish it came in a more neutral color.   I ordered it Tuesday night. It shipped by Wednesday. I received it by Thursday noon.  A few hours after it arrived, I saw a similar and less expensive (by about $5) one in Target. Exactly the same features BUT it was made of flimsy material so, even if I could return this and get the less expensive one, I&#x27;m definitely keeping this.</li>
            <li> Have owned this product for less than 6 months. When ran on high, for 20 seconds it overheats. Will run on high, medium heat for about 2 minutes before it overheats. Dryer is clean and free from dust. Not happy with quality, will not purchase again and will think twice before purchasing Conair.</li>
            <li> I bought the You Reel by Conair for a travel hair dryer. I like the folding handle and retracting cord. The You Reel by Conair dryer is a little big. The You Reel by Conair dryer dries my hair fast. I would recommend the You Reel by Conair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Not great for styling on the low blower setting, no heat.&lt;br /&gt;For example,drying my hair with the high blower setting and the high heat setting and  then change it to the low blower setting - no more heat</li>
            <li> Retractor cord did not retract on attempts 1-10.</li>
            <li> I like it very much except it seems a little heavy, otherwise it is just fine and I do love the retractable cord.  It heats quickly and cools quickly too so it is easy to store in a cupboard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the complainers are all complaining about!  This is a great dryer -- the color is BEAUTIFUL, not too loud, cord retracts (sometimes requiring a little effort but it&#x27;s no big deal) , handle folds down making it compact.  Haters gonna hate but I LOVE this dryer.</li>
            <li> I quiet like it. Its have 3 settings. Make it more useful for me. I don&#x27;t like very hot air, so warm setting are good &amp; perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE HAIR DRYER. IT IS POTENT ENOUGH, HAS THE COOL AIR OPTION AND THE FOLDING ARM IS SO USEFUL. ALSO THE WIRE.. SINCE IS RETRACTABLE IT IS VERY NEAT. I HAD IT AND A WEEK LATER CUT MY HAIR VERY SHORT, BUT IT DID WORK WELL WITH LONG HAIR.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Conair retractable cord dryer, which gave up the ghost after several years of use. This dryer is very similar and I have been pleased with it in the two weeks I&#x27;ve owned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORD RETRACTION&lt;br /&gt;The cord retraction is strong--be sure to keep your fingers on the cord as it enters so it doesn&#x27;t twist, and watch out for the plug, which can flip up rather energetically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLDING HANDLE&lt;br /&gt;The folding handle is fine--I don&#x27;t need to fold it to fit it into my over-the-cabinet-door holder, so I don&#x27;t usually use it--but I think it will be convenient in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLOWDRYING CAPABILITY&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with how quickly this dries my hair. The air filter on the back has an improved design that I think will help me keep it clean more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SETTINGS&lt;br /&gt;On the left side you have HOT, WARM, and COOL, and on the right are LOW, OFF, and HIGH. Having the two sliders next to each other is kind of a pain until you get used to it and can remember which side does which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is a good value and I expect it to last me for at least the next couple years.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine, but the medium setting is not as powerful as I expected.  I have to use the hot setting now every time I use this dryer to blow dry my hair, which I have always been reluctant to do because of the possible hair damage to by the heat.  Also, the real color of this dryer is a little darker than pictured online, which is not a huge deal but I prefer the lighter color I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> for my wife, a replacement appears to function easily and well. I installed an outlet inside her vanity so it is always plugged in and ready to go, as well as a hole in the vanity shelf that it sits in. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
            <li> Was a great Christmas present for my daughter. She travels and says it folds and works great.</li>
            <li> Have had this one for about 6 weeks now, am loving it. It is a bit bulkier than I thought it was going to be, but it also has better air flow. Great price, great blowdryer. I also have an expensive Elchim and I prefer this one due to it&#x27;s wider mouth and folding cord and handle</li>
            <li> Works great!  The air blows out with a lot of pressure so you don&#x27;t have to burn your hair to get it dry and it has 3 temps (hot, warm and cool) and is very portable.</li>
            <li> Great dryer.....  My second one of these.  I had an older one and replaced with this model.  Use it daily- very happy!</li>
            <li> Great color! Great handle! Great retractable cord. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;(it is a teeny bit louder than I&#x27;m used to and a teeny bit heavier...but I&#x27;m not complaining...the retractable cord is such a bonus..I love it!)</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  Right out of the box, the cord won&#x27;t retract back into the dryer.  That is definitely an issue for me, but not enough for me to return the item.  As long as the cord doesn&#x27;t pull out any further and twist/tangle, I will keep it.  I do love that it&#x27;s small, folds in half for better storage, multiple settings and the color of course.</li>
            <li> Works okay but tired of fighting the cord.  Hard to keep it out at full length.   I have given up.     Cannot continue fighting the cord.    It is going to the goodwill.    Nice idea for the cord, but simply doesn&#x27;t stay extended.   So tired of fighting every time to keep it extended.  I found the manual and looked for instructions on how to perhaps handle this.   NOTHING is mentioned - at least in the manual I found;.</li>
            <li> lots of power my wife loves it</li>
            <li> This product blows plenty of air and it dried my hair quickly. I used this product approximately every other day for the past 15 months and it stopped working last week. Although it was relatively inexpensive, I still expected it to last longer. I have a feeling the failure has to do with the retractable cord since I was able to retract the cord a few times and got it to work one more time...now nothing.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works way better than my old Revlon one that also had a cord retracted and folded in half.  Is also very quiet for a blow dryer, which is nice :)</li>
            <li> 03/2014: Do not purchase this product! Dryer reel breaks in less then 3 months...&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 2in1 Reel Hair Dryer less then 3 months and already reel does not fully extent nor does the cord fully wind up. I was very carefully from the beginning of keeping cord flat and not to have it twisted when winding it up. Less than 90 days and broken makes for a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not cover return of item because over 30 days since purchase. Conair return center does not cover any shipping costs (neither way, which is bad costumer service in today&#x27;s times.&lt;br /&gt;Model No. 264NP, Serial No. 0813SR&lt;br /&gt;Update 05/2014: Purchased the other Conair reel blowdryer (you, by Conair)&lt;br /&gt;Model No. 223NP, Serial No. 1013SR.&lt;br /&gt;It stopped extending the cord after 2 months.(Since its already a short cord to begin with, with a shorter cord dryer is useless)&lt;br /&gt;When will Conair stop this fraud?</li>
            <li> I used this the UK with a converter rated for 10 amps (the blow dryer is 8 amps, so you need any converter with 10 amps or more). It worked really well. The cord gets persnickety, sometimes you really have to push on the button to get it to retract, but all-in-all, the blow dryer itself was wonderful and I had no troubles with it running hot</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this item, now I am very happy that I did. My old blowdryer shot out sparks, which was very alarming. I needed a new blowdryer but I wasn&#x27;t sure which one to buy since there are so many. I&#x27;m familiar with the Conair brand, but I had never purchased from them before. It took me a moment to get used to the way it works.  It is a ceramic dryer so it takes a little bit for it to warm up when you start using it, once it gets the ceramic warm, then it puts out heat. I really like the color and this is my first item with a retractable cord. For me the button to retract the cord is in a strange space in the silver part of the dryer and it is fairly fast, so you might want to make sure that you are paying attention when you use the retract function as sometimes it swings the cord and can run into things like arms and faces. The folding handle is a great bonus for this item as it makes putting it away in the draw much simpler. The attachments are really useful and I am growing fond of the diffuser. The only other thing that took some getting used to were the control settings.  It is easy to move them while you are using the dryer and they seem to be counter-intuitive, or it could just be me. I expected the &amp;#34;hight&amp;#34; button to be up and the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting to be down, for me that would be logical, but it has the reverse. It isn&#x27;t a deal breaker, I just adapted. Overall it is a really good dryer.</li>
            <li> I love that the cord retracts.  And this is a full size hair dryer.  Makes sense if you just want a little more drawer space at home, but I wouldn&#x27;t travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment is that the High setting doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as previous dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  It makes me think that it takes longer to dry my medium length hair - but I&#x27;m not sure.  What I do know is that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as damaged when it&#x27;s dry.  So if I have to give up a little heat to keep my hair nicer - then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Color is perfect, size is perfect, does its job :) Great buy, so happy</li>
            <li> Love it Love it Love it!  This is the 3rd I&#x27;ve purchased so I have one at home, at the cabin and in our RV.  I have waist long hair and this doesn&#x27;t cause split ends yet dries my hair quickly.  LOVE that the cord retracts and the handle folds.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is TERRIBLE. Airflow is weaker than any other blow dryer I have ever owned. Blow dryer is twice as heavy as my last one -- unacceptable for a compact/travel dryer! It&#x27;s bigger than my last dryer and has a shorter cord -- if you bend over at the waist to dry your hair, you can forget it. And the cord snaps in so hard when retracting that it knocks things around - heaven forbid it come near my hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re thinking &amp;#34;but it looks so good on paper -- all the bells and whistles and settings I want! Who cares about the short, snappy cord?&amp;#34; I thought that too, but I was so wrong. This is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it less than 30 days ago but I don&#x27;t have the option to return it  in Amazon...shame. It&#x27;s going to be a hideous shiny blue paperweight from now in.</li>
            <li> I primarily wanted this dryer for travel with the diffuser. Diffuser is tiny but better than nothing when traveling. Tiny size with good power &amp; bright color!</li>
            <li> Love the comact design and the retractable cord is a must! I use this one for traveling for work since it folds and I have the non-folding one at home. Great dryer! Dries my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> I love retractable cord, and the folding handle.  Great for travel.  Dries my hair quickly without using such a hot setting.  Really like this dryer!</li>
            <li> Bought this for travel purposes - it weighs a ton!!  And it&#x27;s very large in size too.  Yes, the handle folds, but you&#x27;d be stupid to try and travel with this unless space and weight was of no issue.  Otherwise the hair dryer seems nice so far for day to day usage.  Just hoping the cord winder isn&#x27;t a gimmick and actually lasts!!  Good so far.</li>
            <li> *****UPDATED********* I bought this hair dryer in July of 2014. It worked wonderfully and as expected until about a week ago. I noticed it not getting as hot as usual one day, but it was warm enough to dry my hair. Then the next day it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I reset it several times, still didn&#x27;t work. I tried different outlets, still nothing. It lasted longer than my last hair dryer though, and I blow dry my hair every day, so it was worth the money.  I noticed some people complaining that the dryer just died for no reason - check the filter on the back of the dryer. I had the same problem a few months ago and the filter was completely full and the dryer was overheating. It was an easy fix. I did check that again when it died this last time, but the filter was clean.  I really like this hair dryer! I like the compact size when the cord is reeled in and the handle folded in. I tried getting a hair dryer recently that didn&#x27;t reel in the cord and didn&#x27;t fold in half, and I hated it! This made my life much easier. It&#x27;s also powerful enough to dry my thick hair very quickly. I will buy this again (if this one ever dies!)</li>
            <li> easy to handle, the cords doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> Love this new dryer. Drys hair quickly. Lots of power.  Reason not giving it 5 stars is some times the retractable cord gets stuck.</li>
            <li> Very light and compact. This is my second one to get as I loved my last one</li>
            <li> it works.  My hair is less dry using it</li>
            <li> Disappointed. While it dries fine, within 3 days the retractable cord would no longer retract all the way. The folding handle is stiff and difficult to fold.</li>
            <li> Took it to Vegas in my carry on. Folded up great and works great. Way better than those tiny hair dryers hotels have.</li>
            <li> the 6 dollar packaging was not worth it, I could of wraped it better for cheaped. The package came all riped up so I have to rewrap it.</li>
            <li> This dryer is awesome! The color is beautiful and It drys quick, and has different hair needs! I also love the 2 tools it comes with, such a great value! And best of all I have so much more space when I put it away, with the awesome retractable cord and folding handle!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for someone who wanted a retractable cord and a folding dryer. She loves it and says it&#x27;s the best dryer she&#x27;s ever owned!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to pack this without the cord taking up a lot of space.  It is powerful enough for my hard to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortuntately the hair dryer didn&#x27;t work at all. On top of that the cord function doesn&#x27;t work seamlessly and is too gimmicky for me.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier than I expected. I guess due to the device to retract the cord. It would be better smaller and lighter.  Performance is great.</li>
            <li> I was comparing this product with Babyliss Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 prior to my purchase. The 2 seemed comparable in their specs except that Conair was about 1.5lb heavier. I chose Conair because it was half the price, and I liked the folding handle and the retractable cord. It is quite heavy but after using it for the first time, it doesn&#x27;t bother me much. I like how it folds and stores very neatly in my drawer.</li>
            <li> this is a really good hair dryer and is just beautiful. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle is really nice too.</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit short, but otherwise, this is perfect.  Other retractable cord dryers I have tried have been quieter, but this one dries quickly without leaving my curly hair frizzy.  What I really like about it though is that the detachable diffuser does not fall off easily; a big difference from other dryers.</li>
            <li> Not too thrilled about the color lol.  But I love the folding and the cord reeling feature.  It seems like it has less power than my prior dryer but at the end it does seems to dry the hair faster.  The switches are kind of hard to move back and forward since you have to slide them.  I would have preferred it had one of those flip switches.  Overall a good dryer and gets the job done pretty fast and it is compact, oh let&#x27;s not forget dual voltage.  It has a button to switch from 110 to 220, which comes in handy for those trips to Europe and such.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today. LOVE IT! The cord is longer than the one I had before - and I had a different Conair - that one lasted me a really long time (4 years?) - hope this one is even half as good. Very quiet compared to my previous Conair. Love this one! 3 different heat settings, different speeds, so this one is pretty fancy compared to what I was used to - really pretty color too!</li>
            <li> Works great and folds up for packing.  Dries hair well.  Cord winding mechanism is wonderful, but does make unit heavy.  If you need to conserve weight, get one that does fold, but not self-winding.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Conair for about 5 yrs that was my first that folded in half &amp; had a retractable cord.  It hooked me for life!  I never want another hairdryer that doesn&#x27;t have those features! :)  I don&#x27;t even travel with my hairdryer, but just the compactness of these features is a God-send!  So that said, I puttered over a new one for a while when my old was starting to show signs of dying.  I really wanted these features, but was also drawn to some higher end, more expensive ones that did not have these features.  Finally in the end, I figured I didn&#x27;t need a $100 hair dryer &amp; the simple pleasure and convenience of these creature comforts won me over.  I knew I would like those features, so it&#x27;s no surprise that those are my Pros.  (Although I find the &#x27;folding&#x27; feature to be kinda stiff &amp; hard to bend, 1st few times almost felt like I was breaking it.  I haven&#x27;t read anyone else mention this, so I think maybe my unit may be an anomoly, but it still feels kinda hard to bend, even after owning for a month or so);  Unfortunately the Cons I have are quite noticeable from my last hair dryer &amp; are a bit dissapointing (although not deal breakers).  This unit is heavier for sure, and it was quite noticeable 1st week or two I used it.  And the Hot temp does not get as hot as my previous dryer.  Which is odd, because several other reviews seem to think the Hot temp is too hot.  I on the other hand find it to be standard &amp; nothing to write home about.  Anyway, for the price, and to get the features I wanted, this one is doing the job.  Minor dissapointments, but not complaints.</li>
            <li> the cord retracts - so its great.</li>
            <li> They should put a banana in the pictures for scale -- this is a great dryer that folds in half, has a retractable cord, has high/med/low // cool/warm/hot -- but it is a full-size dryer. I searched for travel blow dryer and got here -- this is not a compact blow dryer by any stretch, it is a full-size dryer that has some nice space-saving features</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works just fine.  It is a tad larger than expected, though.  I appreciate the protective cord.  It works quite well.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer in July 2014 and the dryer itself is fine. By December the retractable cord no longer fully retracts (my estimation is that its retracting about 1/2 of the cord).&lt;br /&gt;I use my hair dryer daily and have limited space for storage so the retractable cord and folding handle were priority requirements for my purchase. Because the cord no longer fully retracts I will be looking for something else.</li>
            <li> At first I loved everything about this dryer.  After 3 uses the cord would not retract at all.  That was one reason for purchasing this dryer, if traveling the cord would not be an issue.  Or even for storing at home.  I returned it and ordered another dryer which does not have a retracting cord, not wanting to maybe deal with that issue again.  Maybe I just got a bad one the first time????</li>
            <li> The low setting is too low.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair and sometimes have difficulty finding a hair dryer that won&#x27;t fry it in the process of drying it. This dryer is awesome for fine hair; it takes about 15 minutes to dry my hair and I can even use the high function if I keep it on warm. I like that it has warm/hot AND low/high setting precisely because of this reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for years now and it still works perfectly. The retractable cord is still my absolute favorite feature from this dryer.</li>
            <li> Although the blow dryer works really well (doesn&#x27;t make your hair frizzy) , the cord doesn&#x27;t retract all the way most of the time. I bought 2 of these. One for travel and one for home.</li>
            <li> Does a great job drying hair, cord is out of the way. Fairly quiet and since it is well made and sturdy it is not light weight. Would not call it an air travel dryer, for that find a simple light wt. unit.</li>
            <li> This dryer dries quickly and gets pretty hot. However, the handle is hard to fold. You feel as if you are going to break it when you fold it and it sounds like it will break as well. The retractable cord isn&#x27;t that great either. Most of the time it will not fully retract the cord. This was a huge negative for me since those are two of the main selling points of this dryer. I also made the false assumption that the hair dryer is compact. It isn&#x27;t. This thing is huge!</li>
            <li> drys hair fast, has a detachable peice to clean and its great!!!</li>
            <li> Had to find a replacement for an existing Conair hairdryer that died, so I opted for this one which also featured the retractable cord.  Gotta say this dryer packs a decent amount of power for its size.  It&#x27;s also convenient thanks to the retractable cord and the fact it folds, which is helpful if you&#x27;re looking to pack it away for travel.  If you&#x27;re looking for a decent hairdryer at a reasonable price, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this dryer as it was the second one I purchased that had a retractable cord and folding handle. Neither of them worked out, so I guess those features in a hair dryer just aren&#x27;t meant to be for me. This dryer is extremely large and heavy, so if you have longer hair your arms will be tired before your hair is halfway dry. It also takes forever to dry your hair. After spending over 20 minutes drying my hair it was still damp, there wasn&#x27;t enough heat or power. The retractable cord and folding handle worked fine for the one time I used it before sending back, so I can&#x27;t comment on how long they would last before breaking as I have never owned a hair dryer with these features. Overall, I do not recommend this dryer unless you have short, thin hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a travel dryer, this is not it. It will take up way more space than a regular dryer, even with the folding handle and retractable cord. I ended up purchasing the Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer and it works great.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer, dries fast without any frizz, retractable cord is very convenient, looks good, it&#x27;s juts a little too bulky and heavy for me, otherwise it would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li> 2nd or 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased.  Cord retracting system and handle folding mechanism are a bit problematic from the very beginning and always end up breaking, but options for a full sized hair dryer with a folding handle are very limited...  If you don&#x27;t need to retract and/or fold every day like I do, this should last a long time.  The dryer itself is very good.</li>
            <li> the price is definitely right! this hair dryer is a bit heavy but it works and work fast! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Noises,  not quiet&lt;br /&gt;Heavy, not light&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased with setting speeds and heat -Only one setting seems to generate heat even for short hair, so if you have longer hair not great&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord is only plus, not compact even though folds</li>
            <li> This review concerns the physical body of the hair dryer rather than the heating/dying aspect.&lt;br /&gt;I use this dryer infrequently.  That&#x27;s because the cord is a pain in the ass.  It will not lock in to place when it&#x27;s pulled from the dryer.  I even tried to break the mechanism to keep the cord extended.  I&#x27;d rather be able to use it than have a cord that retracts.  But, alas, that did not work, either.&lt;br /&gt;I use it now and then by wrapping the cord around the handle and holding it in place, but most of the time, I just use my old dryer, which hasn&#x27;t quit yet.  It&#x27;s a Conair too but without a retractable cord, and it&#x27;s worked well.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace a Revlon folding dryer that worked I loved. This ones cord is much shorter, which can present problems at times. Otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> Conair is the brand my wife looks for simply because it seems to outlast the others and has the features she likes at a reasonable price. It holds up well under daily use, usually twice a day. She finds this model light and compact yet powerful and it dries without the frizzes.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer lasted only a few months. We used it basically as a back up, so it did not see a lot of use. One day I picked it up and the sliding power and speed buttons had simply jammed. Now it will only operate on Low. So it may as well be completely broken, since the Low setting is only a small jump beyond letting my hair air dry. Really cheap dryer. Save your money.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not a travel dryer.  It is a dryer that folds up and has a retractable cord BUT: it is large and heavy. (think luggage allowance impacting)  The reason I bought it was for the separate heat and fan controls.  Most other travel dryers do not have those features separate.  Saying that, it does what it advertises.  Heat and fan are separate.  It is also not the hottest dryer I have ever used.  I wanted separate heat controls because our other (much lighter) travel dryer runs too hot to dry my son&#x27;s hair.  Even on the highest setting, it is not too hot for him.  (so that is good)  but for an adult, you may find it needs a bit more heat.  Other than that, it is an ok dryer.  Good value for the money I guess.</li>
            <li> Love the retractable cord but it is really heavy to handle.  Wish is lighter.</li>
            <li> I quite honestly don&#x27;t use a hairdryer on a daily basis but I love this product. I love the color, I love the fact that the handle folds, I love that the cord retracts and I love the fact that it comes with a diffuser and concentrator attachments. My only criticism is the fact that while it&#x27;s great for normal use within the home I think it&#x27;s a little on the bigger side for travel. When you&#x27;re struggling for suitcase space and staying below weight limits this hairdryer can put you right over the line.</li>
            <li> We had an identical unit about 5 years old but the connection at the plug became intermittent. We liked the first one so much, we bought another. This one is slightly different in appearance but seems to work as well. Folding handle and retractible cord are great for travel.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Love the retracting cord.  Makes it much easier to store.  Recommend to anyone wanting a great dryer at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have had the conair infiniti for 3-4yrs now and its still working like the day I bought it ..I seen this one and loved the color so my experience w/past dryers its always good to have a back-up plus we travel alot and I loved the idea of it folding for storage ! ..and once u&#x27;ve owned a retractable cord dryer u&#x27;ll nvr wanna revert back !! ..Mind you we own a hair salon so I have access to the high end professional dryers and I&#x27;m telling you conair has really out done there self w/this line its better than anythg my girls use for half to a third the price. ..and of-course my favorite thing about this model is forget the cool shot button this dryer has cool as and option on the switch ..and w/ a toddler that&#x27;s a lil piece of heaven !!! Just buy it ..u&#x27;ll be glad you did !! ..and I might add my box was in mint condition I feel those reviews w/damaged boxes was probably from the handler !</li>
