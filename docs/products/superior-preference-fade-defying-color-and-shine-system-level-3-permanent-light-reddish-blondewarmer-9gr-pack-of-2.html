            <li>Amazon&#x27;s auto ship is awesome.</li>
            <li>I tried this shade and it is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I am happy with results,  </li>
            <li>I will stick with Nice &amp; Easy Perfect 10 for now.</li>
            <li>The conditioner that comes with the package leaves my hair glossy and full of body and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>I have accepted that I look best if I stay in the blonde zone, and that my hair responds best to those colors because it&#x27;s already in the family, and that golden tones make my skin look best.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product and with subscribe and save my hair color appears on my door at just the right moment.</li>
            <li>I have used this many years...</li>
            <li>love them..</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>My favorite color and</li>
            <li>The color came out OK but not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>its my color and was sent quick and easy!</li>
            <li>The color seems to match my pale skin tone perfectly that most people don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s colored.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast and I am very pleased with this seller.</li>
            <li>The ordering and receipt of the product was fine.  </li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t good for me and likely wouldn&#x27;t be for most people.  </li>
            <li>The light golden reddish blonde is perfect and I will be ordering much of this product from you</li>
            <li>Love this color so much...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this particular shade for a while in the stores and have never been able to find it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>short version, it is worth a try if you really love the shade but for me it wasn&#x27;t the right fit.  </li>
            <li>My hair was a very light washed out,  bleached out reddish blonde when I applied the color.  </li>
            <li>but the prices were getting higher than I could afford</li>
            <li>and I wanted more red in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I did the first step it came out</li>
            <li>The color I saw on this box matched exactly what it was.</li>
            <li>I would recommend doing the strand test first and timing it.  </li>
            <li>what color you want, what color your hair will respond properly to, and what color actually looks good on your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I ordered light golden reddish blonde and received light reddish blonde!  </li>
            <li>I just colored my hair with L&#x27;oreal hair color dye in the shade  9 GR Light Reddish  blonde.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lighten your hair, it just makes it more red, so if you want to lighten, first use a blonde dye for 30 min, then add this for 5 min or so at the end.</li>
            <li>I am deeply in love with the 9GR Light Golden Reddish Blonde for my dark blonde self.  </li>
            <li>You will *not* come out looking like a Jolly Rancher; it manages to look pretty natural yet still has an element of surprise.  </li>
            <li>I live in Japan so it just doesn&#x27;t exist!</li>
            <li>I quickly switched back.</li>
            <li>So if you want a luminous golden red, instead of looking like a fire engine, you must try this color!</li>
            <li>, it dried my hair out quite a bit more than my normal brand and the smell is STRONG.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making a specific recommendation for those who have the sort of dull, no-man&#x27;s-land non-color you get after being blonde as a kid--the strawberry tones in the 9GR work sooo beautifully on this type of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a new color for me.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I shall quote my sister upon seeing my new strawberry hair:  &amp;#34;OH MY GOD OBSESSED.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color but fades very quickly :(</li>
            <li>Unlike other red shades, the color lasts and lasts and is just as fresh and natural looking as the first day that I applied it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to find; love it.</li>
            <li>After cancer, experiment with your colors in hair, nails, clothes and feel the freedom you have when you are alive.</li>
            <li>But THIS reddish blonde looks unique in a sea of boringness without looking like you&#x27;re trying too hard, is deeply flattering, and seems idiot-proof, which is important for me.  </li>
            <li>Leaving it even longer may have made a difference but the normal 25 minutes definitely didn&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li>a very pretty strawberry blonde on my dark hair.</li>
            <li>I was born a redhead and this color is the only one that matches my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>Prime members get free 2 day shipping on everything,,and having auto ship means I don&#x27;t need to shop in a busy store,,stand in long lines,,deal with rude cashier&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Strawberry Blonde is my natural color but after chemo and radiation it came back in a darker color</li>
            <li>As a former hair stylist, I can say that one of the most difficult colors to achieve and maintain is a soft, natural looking red shade.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go back to my blonde days but because of my natural color,,,medium ash brown,,going blonde is a 2 step for me.</li>
            <li>With other red shades I&#x27;ve tried, the grey in my hair turned orange, but with 9GRLT, the grey strands become a glistening golden red blonde hightlights....</li>

            <li> With my rosy complexion and hazel green eyes, I was &amp;#34;born to be a redhead.&amp;#34; My natural color is a boring dishwater blond, now peppered with grey.</li>
            <li> so please keep it in stock as it is difficult to find in any other store online.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a BAD color, just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Reds tend to be garish and fake looking.</li>
            <li> no need for expensive highlight jobs at the salon.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A little too red, not really reddish blonde.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this particular shade for a while in the stores and have never been able to find it. I have only been dying my hair for 3 times, once at a salon but the prices were getting higher than I could afford so I said...I can do this at home and I did. Strawberry Blonde is my natural color but after chemo and radiation it came back in a darker color and I wanted more red in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and I am very pleased with this seller. I hope they continue to carry this shade but who knows, I might go platinum blonde next time. After cancer, experiment with your colors in hair, nails, clothes and feel the freedom you have when you are alive.</li>
            <li> i get compliments on my hair color ALL THE TIME.  my hairdresser is always amazed that i do it myself. this is a great product and with subscribe and save my hair color appears on my door at just the right moment.</li>
            <li> One time i tried a different brand. I quickly switched back.</li>
            <li> I have used this many years...but as of late it was not available in my area.  Thank goodness I found it here.</li>
            <li> As a former hair stylist, I can say that one of the most difficult colors to achieve and maintain is a soft, natural looking red shade. Reds tend to be garish and fake looking. Subtle reds fade out shortly after coloring. With my rosy complexion and hazel green eyes, I was &amp;#34;born to be a redhead.&amp;#34; My natural color is a boring dishwater blond, now peppered with grey. I have tried so may reds, and looked like Woody Woopecker, or like I dumped my head into a henna vat!  I tried this shade and it is gorgeous! My hair is a soft, reddish blond &amp; my friends can&#x27;t believe it when they learn I am not a real redhead. The conditioner that comes with the package leaves my hair glossy and full of body and smells awesome. Unlike other red shades, the color lasts and lasts and is just as fresh and natural looking as the first day that I applied it. With other red shades I&#x27;ve tried, the grey in my hair turned orange, but with 9GRLT, the grey strands become a glistening golden red blonde hightlights....no need for expensive highlight jobs at the salon. So if you want a luminous golden red, instead of looking like a fire engine, you must try this color!</li>
            <li> Love this color so much... a very pretty strawberry blonde on my dark hair.</li>
            <li> love them.. its my color and was sent quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I saw this in an Urbanette Magazine article about hair color and bought it. It doesn&#x27;t lighten your hair, it just makes it more red, so if you want to lighten, first use a blonde dye for 30 min, then add this for 5 min or so at the end.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color but fades very quickly :(</li>
            <li> I just colored my hair with L&#x27;oreal hair color dye in the shade  9 GR Light Reddish  blonde.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results. They recommend using this color  on blonde to dark blonde hair. My hair was a very light washed out,  bleached out reddish blonde when I applied the color.  My natural color is dark blonde.  I am happy with results,  the color and  the shine. I will use this product again. Pictures enclosed with the product on my hair ( to show color ) and after it&#x27;s washed and dried. I&#x27;m very happy with the results .</li>
            <li> Love this color. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> My favorite color and it&#x27;s hard to find; love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered light golden reddish blonde and received light reddish blonde!  Totally misrepresented this as a different color and not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s auto ship is awesome. I can find everything I need and have it sent to my front door. Prime members get free 2 day shipping on everything,,and having auto ship means I don&#x27;t need to shop in a busy store,,stand in long lines,,deal with rude cashier&#x27;s. This is a new color for me. I wanted to go back to my blonde days but because of my natural color,,,medium ash brown,,going blonde is a 2 step for me. After I did the first step it came out Strawberry blonde and I received tons of compliments. The color seems to match my pale skin tone perfectly that most people don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s colored. The color I saw on this box matched exactly what it was. If you color your hair then try these color&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am deeply in love with the 9GR Light Golden Reddish Blonde for my dark blonde self.  I&#x27;m making a specific recommendation for those who have the sort of dull, no-man&#x27;s-land non-color you get after being blonde as a kid--the strawberry tones in the 9GR work sooo beautifully on this type of hair.  You will *not* come out looking like a Jolly Rancher; it manages to look pretty natural yet still has an element of surprise.  The deal with hair color is that you have to marry three things:  what color you want, what color your hair will respond properly to, and what color actually looks good on your skin tone.  I have accepted that I look best if I stay in the blonde zone, and that my hair responds best to those colors because it&#x27;s already in the family, and that golden tones make my skin look best.  I would say that I have pale, peaches &#x27;n cream skin, but we all know it&#x27;s really just sallow.  This strawberry blonde dye actually makes my skin look peachy.  Years of regular blonde gets really, really boring, and darker reds are like learning to harness fire and make it cook a shrimp to perfection in one attempt--that analogy is really struggling but I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s hard to get right.  But THIS reddish blonde looks unique in a sea of boringness without looking like you&#x27;re trying too hard, is deeply flattering, and seems idiot-proof, which is important for me.  In conclusion, I shall quote my sister upon seeing my new strawberry hair:  &amp;#34;OH MY GOD OBSESSED.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was born a redhead and this color is the only one that matches my natural hair color. I won&#x27;t try to dye it any other color. I have tired just light reddish blonde but that was still too dark. The light golden reddish blonde is perfect and I will be ordering much of this product from you so please keep it in stock as it is difficult to find in any other store online. I live in Japan so it just doesn&#x27;t exist! Thank you for carrying it in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now I understand why I could not find it in the stores and had to come to Amazon to order it. The color wasn&#x27;t good for me and likely wouldn&#x27;t be for most people.  The ordering and receipt of the product was fine.  I just don&#x27;t recommend the color. My mistake.</li>
            <li> The color came out OK but not what I wanted.  I left on for 35 minutes instead of 25 on accident and it STILL came out too dark.  In fact, people remarked that my hair looked darker than when I started.  It wasn&#x27;t a BAD color, just not what I expected.  I would recommend doing the strand test first and timing it.  Leaving it even longer may have made a difference but the normal 25 minutes definitely didn&#x27;t do it.  A couple other remarks, it dried my hair out quite a bit more than my normal brand and the smell is STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short version, it is worth a try if you really love the shade but for me it wasn&#x27;t the right fit.  I will stick with Nice &amp; Easy Perfect 10 for now.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this color &amp; brand from my local Wal-Mart for three years and have had to settle for different colors.  Amazon had just what I needed. Thank you</li>
