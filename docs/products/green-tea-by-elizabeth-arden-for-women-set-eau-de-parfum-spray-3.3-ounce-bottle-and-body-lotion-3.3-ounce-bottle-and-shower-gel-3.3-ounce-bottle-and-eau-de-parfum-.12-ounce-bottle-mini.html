            <li>I love this suttle but lovely smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this set was lovely.</li>
            <li>The cologne is light and not overpowering, and especially enjoy being able to layer the fragrance by using the body lotion on my bare legs in spring/summer.</li>

            <li>My search for a light, fresh, not overpowering perfume that actually lasts and is noticeable to others (in a good way) goes on!</li>
            <li>Fresh,very pleasant, however, it did not last AT ALL.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume in the Department stores(Elizabeth Arden counters) before, and I can assure that the quality of the product that I bought in Amazon is the same good quality.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance so much.</li>
            <li>It is refresing and cool to the skin.</li>

            <li>It arrived quickly and was wrapped just as fast.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Three stars was generous, it really doesn&#x27;t even deserves that much, but if it were the normal fresh and light scent it&#x27;s supposed to be</li>
            <li>This gift set was well packaged, arrived quickley and was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>The lotions has like little beads in it which feels nice when you&#x27;re rubbing it onto your skin.  </li>
            <li>The perfume arrived as promised, and the bottle was much larger than I was expecting...3.5 ounces doesn&#x27;t sound like much.</li>
            <li>Instead of leaving a fresh scent, it left me wanting to wash it off.</li>
            <li>and I love the small bottle for my purse.</li>
            <li>or if it was actually an old set.  </li>
            <li>Use it for myself frequently and for gifts as well.</li>

            <li> Purchased this set as a gift for someone who loves this scent.  Great selection and great value.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The delivered was very fast( actually it arrive in 3 days), and the package was in perfect conditions.The product was exactly what I wanted. I will order my perfumes or any other products that they offer. I am very happy with their service. They also sent to me a 10% off coupon in my next purchase.Before to buy the product I read one review that said that the smell didn&#x27;t last. I bought this perfume in the Department stores(Elizabeth Arden counters) before, and I can assure that the quality of the product that I bought in Amazon is the same good quality.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, my Mother loved it.  It smells delicious and the price was great.  Very nice gift set and would also be great for personal use.</li>
            <li> After all the glowing reviews on this scent and having a coworker that uses it, I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy it.  When I received it, I have to say I was very disappointed.  The product smelled like it was old, especially the lotion.  Instead of leaving a fresh scent, it left me wanting to wash it off. The product isn&#x27;t dated so I have no idea if it was a defective batch or if it was actually an old set.  Three stars was generous, it really doesn&#x27;t even deserves that much, but if it were the normal fresh and light scent it&#x27;s supposed to be I would have given it five.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for over 20 years so is my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; perfume. It&#x27;s very light. This is a great price and I love the small bottle for my purse.</li>
            <li> My son picked this gift for wife. It arrived quickly and was wrapped just as fast. It turned out to be a great choice, since my wife loved it. Seems I need to have my son make the selections from here on out.</li>
            <li> This gift set was well packaged, arrived quickley and was exactly what I ordered.  The pricing was exceptional and I always love the scent of Green Tea.&lt;br /&gt;Bea</li>
            <li> Used to find this eau de parfum at TJ Maxx or Ross (but not as a set except before Christmas) and then they stopped stocking it. Looked it up on Amazon and to my delight they are offering the whole set at a great price...please don&#x27;t stop providing it. Use it for myself frequently and for gifts as well. Can&#x27;t stop praising it. :)</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years. I love how fresh it smells! It is a perfect summer scent. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other perfumes, but it&#x27;s also considerably less expensive. Layering the scent by using the lotion, body wash and perfume all at once definitely helps it to last longer.</li>
            <li> I used to love this perfume but now it seems weak. It has no lasting scent. I&#x27;m surprised because its Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. Plus I can&#x27;t find this fragrance in store anymore. It&#x27;s a great scent for summer. It&#x27;s got the tones I usually go for, but it seems lighter.</li>
            <li> Good value and I love the scent.  It&#x27;s light but pretty.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume!  Its like a fresh spring day, just a bright and cheery scent.&lt;br /&gt;Its light and wonderful to wear everyday.  The lotions has like little beads in it which feels nice when you&#x27;re rubbing it onto your skin.  Just beware of using the body wash, lotion and perfume together because then it is overpowering.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived as promised, and the bottle was much larger than I was expecting...3.5 ounces doesn&#x27;t sound like much.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance so much. Love this gift set that gives you (3) items that I use often for body care.</li>
            <li> fresh clean scent excellent price</li>
            <li> love it. I send it to Cuba for a dear friend and she loves it. It is refresing and cool to the skin.</li>
            <li> nice set,, i love this perfume</li>
            <li> Very good perfume. I love their fragrance. excellent presentation</li>
            <li> I love this suttle but lovely smelling perfume. I have been wearing it for a few years now and always get such wonderful commits on how lovely it smells.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this set was lovely. Fresh,very pleasant, however, it did not last AT ALL. Even with layering of the shower gel, lotion and the spray, it did not last. I used the entire bottle in 2 weeks!! Respraying often hoping it would last even a short time, didn&#x27;t work! My search for a light, fresh, not overpowering perfume that actually lasts and is noticeable to others (in a good way) goes on!</li>
            <li> Ran across a sample of this in the bottom of a bathroom drawer and was pleasantly surprised by the light, clean scent.  Found this set containing several products and snapped it up immediately.  The cologne is light and not overpowering, and especially enjoy being able to layer the fragrance by using the body lotion on my bare legs in spring/summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, nice gift box and very good price</li>
