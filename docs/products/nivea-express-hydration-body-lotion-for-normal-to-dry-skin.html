            <li>nivea products are wonderful</li>
            <li>Best leg lotion and skin softening lotion there is out there today.</li>
            <li>Smells and works great!</li>
            <li>aftermath lol.</li>
            <li>-  Nivea is very popular in Europe too.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft yet not greasy with a very pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Love the cream.</li>
            <li>The lotus scent is also light, not interfering with your own perfume or body spray, but disappearing inoffensively if used</li>
            <li>And unlike another popular brand beginning with V, it is free of petrolatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>He hates the smell of most lotions, but likes this one</li>
            <li>One of Nivea&#x27;s better products</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion, quick absorption and no residue</li>
            <li>Light weight, non greasy hydration that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried the Nivea Express Hydration and it is a very light lotion that quickly gets absorbed and leaves my skin feeling moist, not greasy.</li>
            <li>The scent is somewhat nondescript and quickly dissipates and just leaves a very light fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and soaks in quickly, hence the name Express Hydration.</li>
            <li>works great for my dry hands</li>
            <li>This product is true to its title.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean....</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This has be one my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this lotion as it is full of petrochemicals and artificial fragrances, but my elderly mother loves it and swears it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>Rarely do I repeat buy a lotion, but this is my summer go-to.</li>
            <li>By far, one of my favorite lotions for</li>
            <li>This is a nice light lotion that absorbs quickly (no petroleum ingredients) and really lasts!</li>
            <li>main reason I first bought this is because, unlike the original Nivea, it contains no mineral oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light scent and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I use any more.</li>
            <li>The second ingredient in the Nivea lotion is glycerin, the chemical backbone of triglycerides and found in normal healthy skin.</li>
            <li>My first experience was the classic Nivea Creme produced in Europe.</li>
            <li>It really does have extended moisture.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of lotions on my elbows (which are so dry they have actually worn holes in my shirts) and most do little, if any, good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly scented.</li>
            <li>We will see how it helps over the course of time, but so far, it seems to be soothing and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will always live on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this product to Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion, the lotion I was using.</li>
            <li>But the Nivea Creme can be a little too rich for all the areas of the body.</li>

            <li> This product is true to its title. It really does have extended moisture. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. It also has a pleasant, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love the cream. works great for my dry hands</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion, quick absorption and no residue so I can put it on and go.</li>
            <li> This has be one my new favorite lotion. It leaves my skin soft yet not greasy with a very pleasant scent.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Rarely do I repeat buy a lotion, but this is my summer go-to. It&#x27;s easy to apply and soaks in quickly, hence the name Express Hydration. Once on, you feel protected and not sticky. The lotus scent is also light, not interfering with your own perfume or body spray, but disappearing inoffensively if used alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I first bought this is because, unlike the original Nivea, it contains no mineral oil. And unlike another popular brand beginning with V, it is free of petrolatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will always live on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that has intentionally been restocked over and over in our home.  Light weight, non greasy hydration that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I like the Lotus Flower scent.  Fresh and clean....</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion primarily for use by my husband who suffers from psoriasis. It is very hydrating. We will see how it helps over the course of time, but so far, it seems to be soothing and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I feel it working. It seems oily when I put it on my skin but really it is just the hydration lotion working on my dried up hands.</li>
            <li> By far, one of my favorite lotions for it&#x27;s light scent and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> product as described--</li>
            <li> This lotion does its job as described, however if you have a problem with scented products, avoid this one. It&#x27;s highly scented.</li>
            <li> Nivea is a brand that I learned about in Italy. My first experience was the classic Nivea Creme produced in Europe. But the Nivea Creme can be a little too rich for all the areas of the body. I tried the Nivea Express Hydration and it is a very light lotion that quickly gets absorbed and leaves my skin feeling moist, not greasy. The scent is somewhat nondescript and quickly dissipates and just leaves a very light fresh smell. I much prefer this product to Lubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion, the lotion I was using. The second ingredient in Lubriderm is mineral oil which is not a biological product. The second ingredient in the Nivea lotion is glycerin, the chemical backbone of triglycerides and found in normal healthy skin. There isn&#x27;t any mineral oil listed among the ingredients of the Nivea Express Hydration Lotion.</li>
            <li> gret stuff! absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin in the winter and this lotion helps with that.  This is lighter lotion that doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feel that a heavier lotion will.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad and is rather mild.</li>
            <li> nivea products are wonderful</li>
            <li> Best leg lotion and skin softening lotion there is out there today. No slimy skin or funky perfume aftermath lol.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite lotion.  He hates the smell of most lotions, but likes this one so I order it all the time for him.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> One of Nivea&#x27;s better products</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions on my elbows (which are so dry they have actually worn holes in my shirts) and most do little, if any, good. This is a nice light lotion that absorbs quickly (no petroleum ingredients) and really lasts! The added bonus is NO PARABENS!!! This is the only lotion I use any more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this lotion as it is full of petrochemicals and artificial fragrances, but my elderly mother loves it and swears it&#x27;s the best. So, if you are like me and sensitive to artificial ingredients, check out the organic and non-allergenic stuff. If you can use anything you want, then go for this -  Nivea is very popular in Europe too.</li>
