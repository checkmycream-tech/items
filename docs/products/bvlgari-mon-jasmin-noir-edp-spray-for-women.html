            <li>omg, I love this smell!</li>
            <li>This scent is even better than I remember from the magazine insert!</li>
            <li>I love jasmin!</li>
            <li>My daughter wears this and it smell so nice on her</li>
            <li>Nice when you get both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It got here on time and it was a nice discount, but I dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked musky, oriental scents.</li>
            <li>So sweet, light and lovely!!!</li>
            <li>lol this is so so cool.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to see that Amazon was offering it for such a great price!</li>
            <li>More spicy than I was hoping for, it&#x27;s more of a winter perfume, but it smells good.</li>
            <li>Authentic one I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume I have come across.</li>
            <li>Shipped qucik, would have been nice if it came in a more descreet box.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a wonderful soft and refreshing parfum spray.</li>
            <li>Perfect present wrapped nicely</li>
            <li>This would be a good choice for a more unique office scent.</li>
            <li>The price was indeed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>if you are buying from a third-party seller or the price seems too good to be true, check out the seller feedback before completing the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I had never bought perfume for my wife, and wanted to be sure to buy something that she would like for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>sincerely Kay Trammell</li>
            <li>Love it and will recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>but  the bottle itself is also stunning.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much I love this scent</li>
            <li>The headline says it all, one of my favorite scents acquired for a steal.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I thought from the description that I would just LOVE this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I am sure someone will love it and perhaps have a more compatible chemistry.  </li>
            <li>But also use Jadore, Dolce &amp; Cabbana &#x27;the one&#x27; and Pleaser from CK (many in between)...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Have always ordered my favorite scent from this dealer.</li>
            <li>because the packaging and bottle look authentic, however, this is where the similarities end....  </li>
            <li>It lasts for most of the day without reapplication.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love love it</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Smells more like alcohol.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume and couldn&#x27;t be more Happier with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>Wore it and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this perfume.  </li>
            <li>She loves it, she has received many compliment on her purfume.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Mon Jasmin Noir&amp;#34; is more feminine that  &amp;#34;Jasmin Noir.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Jasmin Noir&amp;#34; is stronger and more animal.</li>
            <li>I originally got this for my mom, but really liked it and ordered one for me too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has pretty good staying power, too.</li>
            <li>What I received is real, the box was perfect and pristine, and the outer shipping packaging well done (unusual).</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the free shipping</li>
            <li>it has such a unique smell perfect for a girl of any age.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also gorgeous and looks very luxe.</li>
            <li>This is a rip off, smells nothing like the true fragrance and is a scheme!  </li>
            <li>Was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and just as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>but I think it is too strong.</li>
            <li>:) Anyway, I received a sample of this perfume from Sephora a while ago but could never justify the price tag of a full bottle.</li>
            <li>I suppose I was hoping for something more sweet in a milky way.</li>
            <li>It did arrive quickly and was a much better price then buying it from a retail store.</li>
            <li>It is light, but it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>wishes are justified, not by the number of words.</li>
            <li>I had a free sample of this perfume.</li>
            <li>If you like smelling like a cheap wh*</li>
            <li>If not, it is a darn good counterfeit that smells exactly like the real thing!</li>
            <li>My 7 year old girl just loved it</li>
            <li>I especially loved the price - it was about half of what they were asking at the department store!</li>
            <li>This one was ok but not the right one.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>I thought this bottle would be an immitation since the price is significantly lower than that in department stores.  </li>
            <li>I was excited for the nougat note, but to me it&#x27;s not at all gourmand.</li>
            <li>It has stronger notes of patchouli/spices than the original Jasmin Noir does.</li>
            <li>i am ver familiar with knock offs, ive lived in la.</li>
            <li>I read the great reviews and took a chance on this item since I have wanted this perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Bvlgari fragrance!</li>
            <li>The price is great but not unrealistic as Beauty Boutique sells it for $52 and Fragrance.net sells it for approx the same.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any Jasmin and it is full of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I like it for a change and to try something different it smell good to.</li>
            <li>and that seems to be a good indication that the price isn&#x27;t too low.  </li>
            <li>I love the perfume so much</li>
            <li>My sweet darling husband bought this for me as a gift when he was on a business trip</li>
            <li>My favorite, very feminine</li>
            <li>i cant belive how lucky i was to find this deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and pretty.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s new favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the original version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classy scent, not too young or old, and great for any occasion.</li>
            <li>Very pretty scent and MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li>kind of a strange request, write a certain number of words?&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is real!</li>
            <li>Only smells sort of ok when it dries out.</li>
            <li>It was the exact thing I had in mind..  </li>
            <li>I wear perfumes like Ellen Tracy (day wear-conservative) to Issey MiYake (evening-seductive)&amp;lt;--most favorite perfumes I use on daily basis.</li>
            <li>and  I just couldn&#x27;t make that leap without trying it out first...</li>
            <li>It looks real and if it isn&#x27;t, than it still was worth</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Excellent perfume, very Inteso without being sweet, fresh choice for cold climates because in the summer is lost.</li>
            <li>this is not a fake</li>
            <li>Packaging and scent exactly like Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My young adult daughters love it also.</li>
            <li>A Bvlgari with a clean fresh Asian inspired scent.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical, too good to be true, right?  </li>
            <li>than expected thank you love it</li>
            <li>for me the test number one, the scent are real is when you put it&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>This is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper because it isn&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li>was a bit much</li>
            <li>AS to if it is the real product?</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery quality item</li>
            <li>This is how I could tell that this perfume was not the real deal.</li>
            <li>This soft eau de parfum will last more than eight hours on your clothing or skin.</li>
            <li>She has used most of the other scents from this brand and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li>So we went through at least 20 fragrances at a major department store and selected Mon Jasmin Noir as the most elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have many perfumes and this is my current favorite, despite the long lasting scent,  </li>
            <li>definitely the original ..</li>
            <li>I imagine that I am one of the younger wearers (it is a mature scent), but I love it - so classy!</li>
            <li>The larger sizes of fragrances are the ones most likely to be counterfeited and the seller feedback should clue you in as to whether a seller is legitimate and will send you real product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong and long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is not at all overbearing, but I sort of love the heaviness of Jasmin Noir (black bottle).</li>
            <li>You have to spray a little bit more often than I thought it should do.</li>
            <li>Surprised it was so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely unique but not really for use on a normal basis.</li>
            <li>On me this smells like strong black pepper and heady flowers.</li>
            <li>Buy this for your wife, girlfriend, sister, mom, or any significant other</li>
            <li>An elegant styli classic for serious Ladies decent and not impudent like some wannabee fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells similar but it does not react the same way the original does with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Contrary to several other reviews, I am fairly certain that my product is genuine.</li>
            <li>This parfum spray smells really good, and not very strong, but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>sure enough I found it for less.</li>
            <li>The scent is fairly strong and lasting, and I am definitely not one to spritz perfume constantly.</li>
            <li>This scent is a bit too masculine, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I can smell it myself with some direct sniffs.  </li>
            <li>Even by complete strangers.</li>
            <li>It looks authentic but it is Not Authentic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok &amp; not worth the hassle of trying to return it, but just what I expected.</li>
            <li>No other will do.</li>
            <li>If you are at all sensitive to floral scents (like I am), definitely try this one on before you buy it!</li>
            <li>Not even a close imitation compared to the sample from a high end department store!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray on too much or you&#x27;ll be smelling yourself for half the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of all the perfumes I&#x27;ve tried lately, this is hands down my favorite.</li>

            <li> I love the scent of this perfume and couldn&#x27;t be more Happier with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wore it and enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this perfume.  </li>
            <li> She loves it, she has received many compliment on her purfume.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Mon Jasmin Noir&amp;#34; is more feminine that  &amp;#34;Jasmin Noir.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Jasmin Noir&amp;#34; is stronger and more animal.</li>
            <li> I originally got this for my mom, but really liked it and ordered one for me too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has pretty good staying power, too.</li>
            <li> What I received is real, the box was perfect and pristine, and the outer shipping packaging well done (unusual).</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the free shipping</li>
            <li> it has such a unique smell perfect for a girl of any age.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also gorgeous and looks very luxe.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off, smells nothing like the true fragrance and is a scheme!  </li>
            <li> Was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and just as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> but I think it is too strong.</li>
            <li> :) Anyway, I received a sample of this perfume from Sephora a while ago but could never justify the price tag of a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I suppose I was hoping for something more sweet in a milky way.</li>
            <li> It did arrive quickly and was a much better price then buying it from a retail store.</li>
            <li> It is light, but it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> wishes are justified, not by the number of words.</li>
            <li> I had a free sample of this perfume.</li>
            <li> If you like smelling like a cheap wh*</li>
            <li> If not, it is a darn good counterfeit that smells exactly like the real thing!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old girl just loved it</li>
            <li> I especially loved the price - it was about half of what they were asking at the department store!</li>
            <li> This one was ok but not the right one.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent!</li>
            <li> I thought this bottle would be an immitation since the price is significantly lower than that in department stores.  </li>
            <li> I was excited for the nougat note, but to me it&#x27;s not at all gourmand.</li>
            <li> It has stronger notes of patchouli/spices than the original Jasmin Noir does.</li>
            <li> i am ver familiar with knock offs, ive lived in la.</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews and took a chance on this item since I have wanted this perfume for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Bvlgari fragrance!</li>
            <li> The price is great but not unrealistic as Beauty Boutique sells it for $52 and Fragrance.net sells it for approx the same.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any Jasmin and it is full of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I like it for a change and to try something different it smell good to.</li>
            <li> and that seems to be a good indication that the price isn&#x27;t too low.  </li>
            <li> I love the perfume so much</li>
            <li> My sweet darling husband bought this for me as a gift when he was on a business trip</li>
            <li> My favorite, very feminine</li>
            <li> i cant belive how lucky i was to find this deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and pretty.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s new favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the original version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classy scent, not too young or old, and great for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Very pretty scent and MUCH cheaper</li>
            <li> kind of a strange request, write a certain number of words?&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is real!</li>
            <li> Only smells sort of ok when it dries out.</li>
            <li> It was the exact thing I had in mind..  </li>
            <li> I wear perfumes like Ellen Tracy (day wear-conservative) to Issey MiYake (evening-seductive)&amp;lt;--most favorite perfumes I use on daily basis.</li>
            <li> and  I just couldn&#x27;t make that leap without trying it out first...</li>
            <li> It looks real and if it isn&#x27;t, than it still was worth</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, very Inteso without being sweet, fresh choice for cold climates because in the summer is lost.</li>
            <li> this is not a fake</li>
            <li> Packaging and scent exactly like Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My young adult daughters love it also.</li>
            <li> A Bvlgari with a clean fresh Asian inspired scent.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, too good to be true, right?  </li>
            <li> than expected thank you love it</li>
            <li> for me the test number one, the scent are real is when you put it&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> This is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper because it isn&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li> was a bit much</li>
            <li> AS to if it is the real product?</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery quality item</li>
            <li> This is how I could tell that this perfume was not the real deal.</li>
            <li> This soft eau de parfum will last more than eight hours on your clothing or skin.</li>
            <li> She has used most of the other scents from this brand and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li> So we went through at least 20 fragrances at a major department store and selected Mon Jasmin Noir as the most elegant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have many perfumes and this is my current favorite, despite the long lasting scent,  </li>
            <li> definitely the original ..</li>
            <li> I imagine that I am one of the younger wearers (it is a mature scent), but I love it - so classy!</li>
            <li> The larger sizes of fragrances are the ones most likely to be counterfeited and the seller feedback should clue you in as to whether a seller is legitimate and will send you real product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong and long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is not at all overbearing, but I sort of love the heaviness of Jasmin Noir (black bottle).</li>
            <li> You have to spray a little bit more often than I thought it should do.</li>
            <li> Surprised it was so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely unique but not really for use on a normal basis.</li>
            <li> On me this smells like strong black pepper and heady flowers.</li>
            <li> Buy this for your wife, girlfriend, sister, mom, or any significant other</li>
            <li> An elegant styli classic for serious Ladies decent and not impudent like some wannabee fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells similar but it does not react the same way the original does with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Contrary to several other reviews, I am fairly certain that my product is genuine.</li>
            <li> This parfum spray smells really good, and not very strong, but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> sure enough I found it for less.</li>
            <li> The scent is fairly strong and lasting, and I am definitely not one to spritz perfume constantly.</li>
            <li> This scent is a bit too masculine, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I can smell it myself with some direct sniffs.  </li>
            <li> Even by complete strangers.</li>
            <li> It looks authentic but it is Not Authentic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok &amp; not worth the hassle of trying to return it, but just what I expected.</li>
            <li> No other will do.</li>
            <li> If you are at all sensitive to floral scents (like I am), definitely try this one on before you buy it!</li>
            <li> Not even a close imitation compared to the sample from a high end department store!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spray on too much or you&#x27;ll be smelling yourself for half the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the perfumes I&#x27;ve tried lately, this is hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li> The perfume was brand new, in sealed box for half the selling price of a department store.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to find elsewhere, so I am thrilled I can still get it here.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing with the real smell for half the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was the large size bottle and for less than half the cost.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stay long on</li>
            <li> It lasts long on clothes and body..</li>
            <li> Glad I found it here, and less expensive than the department stores I might add.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for the holidays to buy it, but I saw this same fragrance for $40 less on Amazon and bought it immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one smell all day , very soft and delicate , from now one of my favorites</li>
            <li> I find my self spraying a little on the back of my hand</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, though.</li>
            <li> It smells just like what I found in the stores but for much less.  </li>
            <li> Someone said that this was counterfeit, not true</li>
            <li> I found this product a number of years ago and love it...but hated the retail store price.  </li>
            <li> There are floral notes, as well, but this is not primarily a floral fragrance, I think, despite the jasmine in the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> read all the reviews particularly the negative ones and always fear what will I do if I get a fake?</li>
            <li> Its rather a fancy dress smell, not so much as an everyday smell like I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It really sucks because I literally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and unpleasant and instantly gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I was also fearful that maybe the seller wasn&#x27;t selling the true product... despite the fear and with the guarantee from amazon, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It was hard to understand the Bvlgari line</li>
            <li> Subtly balanced fragrance that is neither too floral nor too musky.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and flowery.</li>
            <li> But this time they mailed me a fake one, waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Delicate but with a bam!</li>
            <li> This by far is the worst imposter perfume ever....</li>
            <li> My wife hates overly expensive gifts, so I got her this</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I won&#x27;t bear wearing it.</li>
            <li> so i ordered the wrong perfume.</li>
            <li> that could of gone really wrong.</li>
            <li> It is a FAKE parfum!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy this fragrance for quite some time but perfume can be very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!!  </li>
            <li> For now, i give this 3 stars, because I can&#x27;t say that I dislike or hate it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> . I have requested a refund for this perfume the day i received it! It doesn&#x27;t have any Jasmin and it is full of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;It smells just like (Thierry Mugler - Angel ) perfume. It is a FAKE parfum!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume. The price was indeed too good to be true. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay long on you considered it is Eau de parfum. The packaging is awesome, I always love AmaZon&#x27;s service.</li>
            <li> One of her favorites.</li>
            <li> Authentic one I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Bvlgari fragrance! It is light, but it lasts all day.  When I wear it people do not ask me \\&quot;What perfume are you wearing?\\&quot; The instead say, \\&quot;You smell great!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had never bought perfume for my wife, and wanted to be sure to buy something that she would like for Christmas. So we went through at least 20 fragrances at a major department store and selected Mon Jasmin Noir as the most elegant fragrance. I was waiting for the holidays to buy it, but I saw this same fragrance for $40 less on Amazon and bought it immediately.</li>
            <li> item as described and arrived earlier than expected thank you love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like the one at sephora</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is nearly impossible to find elsewhere, so I am thrilled I can still get it here.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and always get compliments when I wear this perfume! I will buy it again. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this and it smell so nice on her so I thought I might try it I like it for a change and to try something different it smell good to. sincerely Kay Trammell</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> This parfum spray smells really good, and not very strong, but it does not last very long. You have to spray a little bit more often than I thought it should do.</li>
            <li> My wife hates overly expensive gifts, so I got her this and she was ecstatic!!! Buy this for your wife, girlfriend, sister, mom, or any significant other and they will love it!</li>
            <li> I thought this bottle would be an immitation since the price is significantly lower than that in department stores.  NOT!!!!!!  This is the real thing with the real smell for half the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not even a close imitation compared to the sample from a high end department store! If it sounds too good to be true...don&#x27;t fall for it.</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely unique but not really for use on a normal basis. Its rather a fancy dress smell, not so much as an everyday smell like I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I have come across. Delicate but with a bam! Love it and will recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> What I received is real, the box was perfect and pristine, and the outer shipping packaging well done (unusual). This is a gorgeous perfume as we all know but  the bottle itself is also stunning. Nice when you get both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews particularly the negative ones and always fear what will I do if I get a fake? Ah! But the price is about the same for ebay testers and fragrancenet  as here and that seems to be a good indication that the price isn&#x27;t too low.  Anyway, this is real!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy this fragrance for quite some time but perfume can be very expensive.  This was a great deal!!  It was the large size bottle and for less than half the cost.  I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume so much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love this scent this smells sooooo good and I will be buying this again and again!!!!</li>
            <li> Subtly balanced fragrance that is neither too floral nor too musky. I get lots of compliments on it when I get close to people. (It doesn&#x27;t get places before I do!)</li>
            <li> The headline says it all, one of my favorite scents acquired for a steal. I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> It got here on time and it was a nice discount, but I dislike the smell. Only smells sort of ok when it dries out. I have no idea what I&#x27;m gonna do with the perfume now.</li>
            <li> I used to use the body lotion and I fell in love with the smell. It lasts long on clothes and body.. It was the exact thing I had in mind..  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> The box/labeling looks the same as what I already have, but the scent isn&#x27;t the same. It&#x27;s ok &amp; not worth the hassle of trying to return it, but just what I expected.</li>
            <li> My wife has to have this BVLGARI Mon Jasmin Noir Eau De Parfum.  No other will do.</li>
            <li> On me this smells like strong black pepper and heady flowers. It is very sharp and unpleasant and instantly gives me a headache. I got this as a gift and unfortunately I won&#x27;t bear wearing it. If you are at all sensitive to floral scents (like I am), definitely try this one on before you buy it!</li>
            <li> definitely the original .. for me the test number one, the scent are real is when you put it&lt;br /&gt;in the morning and several hours later , you feel the scent&lt;br /&gt;this one smell all day , very soft and delicate , from now one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Contrary to several other reviews, I am fairly certain that my product is genuine. If not, it is a darn good counterfeit that smells exactly like the real thing! :) Anyway, I received a sample of this perfume from Sephora a while ago but could never justify the price tag of a full bottle. I was delighted to see that Amazon was offering it for such a great price! The scent is fairly strong and lasting, and I am definitely not one to spritz perfume constantly. The scent is subtle and flowery. I imagine that I am one of the younger wearers (it is a mature scent), but I love it - so classy! The bottle is also gorgeous and looks very luxe.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I found this product a number of years ago and love it...but hated the retail store price.  I found it here and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt giving it a try.  It smells just like what I found in the stores but for much less.  This is the second bottle I have purchased...both were great.</li>
            <li> I thought from the description that I would just LOVE this perfume.  As it is, it is Alright.  I am sure someone will love it and perhaps have a more compatible chemistry.  For now, i give this 3 stars, because I can&#x27;t say that I dislike or hate it.</li>
            <li> Is great for Christmas</li>
            <li> Very good product, good seller, I recommend</li>
            <li> I think this is a wonderful soft and refreshing parfum spray. This soft eau de parfum will last more than eight hours on your clothing or skin. It is worth the expense.</li>
            <li> This is not the real perfume. Beware. It&#x27;s cheaper because it isn&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li> More spicy than I was hoping for, it&#x27;s more of a winter perfume, but it smells good.</li>
            <li> I wear perfumes like Ellen Tracy (day wear-conservative) to Issey MiYake (evening-seductive)&amp;lt;--most favorite perfumes I use on daily basis. But also use Jadore, Dolce &amp; Cabbana &#x27;the one&#x27; and Pleaser from CK (many in between)... I was looking through a magazine and smelled this scent and just HAD to immediately go online to purchase it. I&#x27;m used to buying $85 Issey Miyake but $105 for this perfume at department stores was a bit much and  I just couldn&#x27;t make that leap without trying it out first...so I thought about amazon and sure enough I found it for less. I was also fearful that maybe the seller wasn&#x27;t selling the true product... despite the fear and with the guarantee from amazon, I ordered it. I am ridiculously happy with it. I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying 2 different scents depending on when and where Im going. It goes well with any event or time of day/night! IM HOOKED FOR LIFE! AS to if it is the real product? It looks real and if it isn&#x27;t, than it still was worth the price b/c omg, I love this smell! My young adult daughters love it also.</li>
            <li> Parfume match photos, description and my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;What kind of a strange request, write a certain number of words?&lt;br /&gt;Your wishes are justified, not by the number of words.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying it in the store. Shipped qucik, would have been nice if it came in a more descreet box.  Gave it away as a christmas present.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and pretty. I was excited for the nougat note, but to me it&#x27;s not at all gourmand. I suppose I was hoping for something more sweet in a milky way. A good choice if you want a daytime jasmine scent. It is not at all overbearing, but I sort of love the heaviness of Jasmin Noir (black bottle). This would be a good choice for a more unique office scent. I could not see it offending anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it</li>
            <li> It was hard to understand the Bvlgari line so i ordered the wrong perfume. This one was ok but not the right one.</li>
            <li> Bought the perfume as a Christmas present for my wife ans she loves it.  It smells great and it was priced well.</li>
            <li> This scent is even better than I remember from the magazine insert! So sweet, light and lovely!!! The price is great, for the size bottle received.</li>
            <li> I love this!! the smell is wonderful...I get compliments all the time and I&#x27;m always being told I smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> For my wife.It does something to me when she wears it</li>
            <li> This was not what we thought it would be.  We had to return the product.</li>
            <li> I had a free sample of this perfume. My 7 year old girl just loved it so I bought it for her this Christmas. Was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Have always ordered my favorite scent from this dealer. Fast delivery quality item</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. The perfume was brand new, in sealed box for half the selling price of a department store.</li>
            <li> I originally got this for my mom, but really liked it and ordered one for me too. It&#x27;s a classy scent, not too young or old, and great for any occasion. I especially loved the price - it was about half of what they were asking at the department store!</li>
            <li> Do not take a chance on a great price for this product.  It is in no way Bvlgari, I think they bottled rubbing alcohol.  Surprising because the packaging and bottle look authentic, however, this is where the similarities end....  Not the fragrance it&#x27;s supposed to be at all!</li>
            <li> Of all the perfumes I&#x27;ve tried lately, this is hands down my favorite. I&#x27;ve always liked musky, oriental scents. There are floral notes, as well, but this is not primarily a floral fragrance, I think, despite the jasmine in the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has pretty good staying power, too. It lasts for most of the day without reapplication. A little goes a long way, though. Don&#x27;t spray on too much or you&#x27;ll be smelling yourself for half the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution -- if you are buying from a third-party seller or the price seems too good to be true, check out the seller feedback before completing the purchase. The larger sizes of fragrances are the ones most likely to be counterfeited and the seller feedback should clue you in as to whether a seller is legitimate and will send you real product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Excellent scent and wonderful speedy service</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite scent! I love jasmin! My package was delivered within a week and came with a goody bag of samples. I am very happy with the product and Perfumania!</li>
            <li> i smelled this in a magazine and immediately went on amazon to order it. the price was great and it was shipped promptly. it has such a unique smell perfect for a girl of any age.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!  Go to a department store!  This is a rip off, smells nothing like the true fragrance and is a scheme!  If you like smelling like a cheap wh*** and want to reek of floral alcohol, go ahead.  Check the no return policy, you&#x27;re screwed.  Purchase only from legitimate department stores. This seller should be reprimanded.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the Mon Jasmin Noir Exquisite fragrance. It&#x27;s a very strong and long lasting fragrance. Definitely a night time fragrance. Just not for me...</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, very Inteso without being sweet, fresh choice for cold climates because in the summer is lost. It is a brand whose fragrances remain quietly from morning to afternoon. I wear it for work and everyone loves</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Smell doesn&#x27;t last for an hour. Very disappointed. I bought one a year ago in Amazon, that was good. But this time they mailed me a fake one, waste of my money. Never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This scent is a bit too masculine, in my opinion. It has stronger notes of patchouli/spices than the original Jasmin Noir does. I much prefer the original version.</li>
            <li> i cant belive how lucky i was to find this deal. i had held on to this tiny sample for a year cause i couldnt afford it. this is not a fake i am ver familiar with knock offs, ive lived in la. lol this is so so cool. love love it</li>
            <li> Very pretty scent and MUCH cheaper then Sephora</li>
            <li> My sweet darling husband bought this for me as a gift when he was on a business trip and I absolutely love it. Yes, I&#x27;m blessed to have a man with good taste...that could of gone really wrong. Anyways, It&#x27;s my winter fragrance along with Flower Bomb. During the summer I prefer a lighter scent like Dolce and Gabbana Blue. Glad I found it here, and less expensive than the department stores I might add.</li>
            <li> Smell is not quite what I remember. Smells more like alcohol. Next time I will try the perfume instead of  toilette</li>
            <li> Finest BVLGARI essence ! An elegant styli classic for serious Ladies decent and not impudent like some wannabee fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A&amp;#62;R&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Someone said that this was counterfeit, not true I have a sample and it&#x27;s the same. i was worried it wasn&#x27;t the eau de parfum but it is (just as pictured) The price is great but not unrealistic as Beauty Boutique sells it for $52 and Fragrance.net sells it for approx the same.  The scent is gorgeous described as Jasmine, Lily of the valley and woods.  I have many perfumes and this is my current favorite, despite the long lasting scent,  I find my self spraying a little on the back of my hand so I can smell it myself with some direct sniffs.  Overall very happy with the free shipping</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume and couldn&#x27;t be more Happier with my purchase.  That&#x27;s why this is my 2nd Purchase, Awesome Buy and Great Choice!</li>
            <li> My friends ask me whether I had alcohol when I wear this perfume. I like it the smell though!</li>
            <li> A Bvlgari with a clean fresh Asian inspired scent.  My wife&#x27;s new favorite.  She has used most of the other scents from this brand and this one really stands out.</li>
            <li> Well done received quickly great product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, too good to be true, right?  Wrong!!  Packaging and scent exactly like Macy&#x27;s.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a wife requested Christmas gift. She like&#x27;s the scent as well as I do. Having a sensative nose, I don&#x27;t have the involuntary act of sneezing snot all over her when she is wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and just as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars I would! I read the great reviews and took a chance on this item since I have wanted this perfume for a long time. It looks authentic but it is Not Authentic! The fragrance smells similar but it does not react the same way the original does with my body chemistry. The smell also fades after about two hours. This is how I could tell that this perfume was not the real deal. Even the smallest spray of bvlgari will last all day into the evening. It really sucks because I literally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Perfect present wrapped nicely</li>
            <li> Good price.Lovely fragrance.Beautifully packaged.This was  sample when I bought perfume at the department store. Wore it and enjoyed it. Surprised it was so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this but I think it is too strong. If he is happy then I am too. It did arrive quickly and was a much better price then buying it from a retail store.</li>
            <li> This by far is the worst imposter perfume ever....beware!!!!</li>
            <li> The product came OPEN, and consequently, did not qualify for return.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance - very sophisticated aroma. A great bargain through Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this perfume.  My favorite, very feminine</li>
            <li> I purchased this purfume for my girlfriend for Valentines day. She loves it, she has received many compliment on her purfume. Even by complete strangers. Great deal for price, perfect shipping... Thank you</li>
            <li> I like it.  This &amp;#34;Mon Jasmin Noir&amp;#34; is more feminine that  &amp;#34;Jasmin Noir.&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Jasmin Noir&amp;#34; is stronger and more animal.</li>
