    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best thing is...</li>
            <li>Excellent for massing between teeth and tones and invigorates while dislodging the gook.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>For under six dollars I think the value is great!</li>
            <li>The picks are not that great either and you will end up spending a lot of money buying refills.  </li>
            <li>I will now be PROUD to visit my dentist.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive, it has a great name</li>
            <li>The picks are great too.</li>
            <li>This is really a great device.  </li>
            <li>While the flossing part is good, the machine itself vibrates a great deal.  </li>
            <li>found it a good buy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and my oral hygenist has remarked on how healthy my gums are.  </li>
            <li>and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>she is thrilled.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so effective</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with both the flosser and the pick.</li>
            <li>I agree, the flosser may not be all that great, but I really like the job the picks do, and its fairly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I floss more with this device than before.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use, its extremely effective, I gotta give it what it deserves.</li>
            <li>This device, especially using the pick attachment, is the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I sincerely hope the bird isn&#x27;t given the bird there too.</li>
            <li>I am not a consistant flosser, but since I purchased the Hummingbird I have been flossing more often.  </li>
            <li>so I can reuse them for a week or more.</li>
            <li>Gets out more gunk than I did with the floss &lt;</li>
            <li>They try to make it cute and stuff with the minty picks and protective cover and all.  </li>
            <li>Flossing has never been more pleasurable or productive, and I want to do it again and again.</li>
            <li>The picks and flosser heads are better used without the hummingbird if anything.  </li>
            <li>The ultasonic toothbrush is outstanding, but this thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used to have the greatest difficulty getting floss between my teeth -especially</li>
            <li>When I thought more about it, it made sense.</li>
            <li>I find it more wasteful because of the addition.</li>
            <li>To get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The vibrating is very soothing to the gums and does a very effective job of cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are very tight and flossing has never been a joy of any kind, so I often don&#x27;t do it!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use (yes, pressing and holding</li>
            <li>If you are sore after using this stop using it, the pressure is too strong.</li>
            <li>The old Dr. Flosser sold at Brookstone (not the new one from Flightek Ltd.) was the best.</li>
            <li>I think its fantastic.</li>
            <li>(It is cheap to try.)</li>
            <li>Each application results in surprising excretions of decayed meals that would never have surrendered to manual manipulation of my old flossing twine.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast, inexpensive and far more effective.  </li>
            <li>It would be a shame because it really can make a difference for healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>I currently use, and it&#x27;s not even close to be a good alternative.  </li>
            <li>First, the waste is still incredible, especially if it really isn&#x27;t recyclable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s backed by an extraordinary brand.  </li>
            <li>While the flossing attachments still have some room for improvement, I am optimistic that Oral B will solve that problem and we will be able to buy better refills in the future.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a clear protector that keeps the pick safe and clean.  </li>
            <li>The flossing isn&#x27;t as useful with the lack of power from the device.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a fun gadget to use.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the Reach is at least as good and more durable.</li>
            <li>Regular floss just didn&#x27;t seem as effective.  </li>
            <li>Your dental and heart health is worth it.</li>
            <li>Works fine that way, it&#x27;s good for reaching the back teeth compared to regular dental floss.</li>
            <li>This small flosses is great.</li>
            <li>Even though I still have trouble getting the floss between my teeth, once it is in there, I can feel it is doing a superb job of getting the tiny bits and goo off my teeth in areas</li>
            <li>Totally safe, as it can be used diluted with an equal amount of water as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for years and love it.</li>
            <li>If you have tight teeth, this gadget takes a bit of experimenting to get it down (seems to work better without wibrating), but it really feels better and seems to clean better.</li>
            <li>the other hand, the Reach flosser is about the size of an electric toothbrush, and very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I now use the pick daily, as I&#x27;ve found it is most effective at getting everything out from between my very tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll get use to it), and it fits nicely between my tight teeth.    </li>
            <li>All I can say is just stick to the simple flossing because you will end up spending a lot of money in the long run while not getting that much better of a clean.</li>
            <li>If your teeth are very tight/close together, I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser.</li>
            <li>I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB</li>
            <li>This item does not vibrate as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Also, I think that even if your teeth are perfectly straight (which I doubt everyones is)</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>I really regret buying this product.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the Hummingbird floss-head refills cost almost twice as much as the Reach refills.</li>
            <li>I am fairly religious about using my Hummingbird--I only use the pick attachment--and it is easy and quick to use as well as portable.  </li>
            <li>This is so much more convenient, and I have had none of the problems other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>If you purchase this item you will simply be recieve a device with a \\&quot;cute\\&quot; appearance that vibrates like a pager but does nothing to help clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Causes less damage to the gum, because (once you get the hang of it) one can control it better than the floss &lt;</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the floss, although very good, still shreds a tiny bit, due to my tight</li>
            <li>My fingers are starting to stiffen from my arthritis, so the battery power really helps me to perform this important grooming function without asking for assistance from my younger wife.</li>
            <li>But this one massages your gums and is a pleasurable adjunct to normal flossing.</li>
            <li>One of life&#x27;s surprising pleasures in such a small sleek package.</li>
            <li>, overall the Hummingbird is worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to buy a new one every three months.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>a huge waste of money... don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>He likes this really well and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li>Sorry guys; you usually do a good job, but not this time.</li>
            <li>And the little hummer is thinner in the middle than at either end, so it should remain lodged snugly in the pocket even during vigorous activity, I can be sure I will not loose it when I go on outings.</li>
            <li>Second, I don&#x27;t find the use of the vibrating particularly helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half-way done, mostly because of the odd placement of the button -- you need to hold it down for the vibrating action to work.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I think it works better than regular floss and the non-moving floss kits in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>At first glance the whole idea of a vibrating flosser may seem a little over the top and silly but guess what, it works.</li>
            <li>I doubt you still will be able to use this product properly because of just how weak the floss and your control over the product is.</li>
            <li>Over all, this is well worth the price and the very slight learning curve.</li>
            <li>say they just recycle the plastic of the flosser, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s recyclable, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the try.  </li>

            <li> say they just recycle the plastic of the flosser, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s recyclable, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the try.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the vibrations don&#x27;t do as much as proper manual flossing action to clean the spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about a \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; flosser, but this really makes a difference for someone with gum issues.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing, and this little device is very good.</li>
            <li> The cartridges they have set up don&#x27;t work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won&#x27;t vibrate - it only vibrates if it&#x27;s taut.</li>
            <li> and once you do get it in between your teeth you can hardly move the floss up and down or left to right because there is no power in just holding the device with one hand.  </li>
            <li> Unless your teeth are perfectly straight you can hardly get the floss</li>
            <li> The vibration is considerably weaker than on the Reach model, making it harder to insert between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> The product is innovative, the flosser makes it easier to floss hard to reach areas but is ergonomically quite poor.</li>
            <li> Also, you have to hold the button down the entire time to use it.</li>
            <li> The floss tips are too tight, and the tiny flosser is a nightmare to hold.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;d say the Hummingbird  will make my next trip to the dentist a little easier.</li>
            <li> But now, with the latest one, I just think it&#x27;s a bad design.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I didnt let all these bad reviews of this product keep me from buying it.</li>
            <li> the floss is just too wide.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is getting harder to find, so</li>
            <li> I expected a carry case that would hold both the flosser and the attachments.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting with other ones...</li>
            <li> Finally, the handle is just too tiny, making it uncomfortable to use, especially when you have to keep pressing the darn button.    </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to be critical.  </li>
            <li> but, I have go through at least 6-8 of them in the last year.  </li>

            <li> I bought this Hummingbird Flosser kit thinking that it could do the same work that my tired and circulation restricted fingers do.  It failed in getting between even my not-so-tightly spaced teeth.  I guess I&#x27;ll stick with Oral B Ultra Floss since it works.  If your teeth are very tight/close together, I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser.</li>
            <li> I agree, the flosser may not be all that great, but I really like the job the picks do, and its fairly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I found it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too. However, it just doesn&#x27;t work. The cartridges they have set up don&#x27;t work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won&#x27;t vibrate - it only vibrates if it&#x27;s taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to make flossing easier and faster but that&#x27;s not the case.  The flossing isn&#x27;t as useful with the lack of power from the device.  The picks are not that great either and you will end up spending a lot of money buying refills.  At least it comes with a AAA battery.    All I can say is just stick to the simple flossing because you will end up spending a lot of money in the long run while not getting that much better of a clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight and flossing has never been a joy of any kind, so I often don&#x27;t do it!  Then I got this little buzzer thingy and things have changed.  Even though I still have trouble getting the floss between my teeth, once it is in there, I can feel it is doing a superb job of getting the tiny bits and goo off my teeth in areas regular flossing just doesn&#x27;t go, and it does it in a third of the time regular flossing takes.  I thought having a battery powered tooth pick was the height of arrogance, stupidity, and conspicuous consumption to the Nth degree, but I have changed my mind.  The toothpick also gets into others spots the flosser can&#x27;t reach.  I will now be PROUD to visit my dentist.    I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the floss, although very good, still shreds a tiny bit, due to my tight teeth;however it DOES last an entire flossing session, unlike regular floss.  Over all, this is well worth the price and the very slight learning curve.</li>
            <li> To help with the use situation, I keep the flosser part in household (3% strength) hydrogen peroxide between uses. My daughter and I each have a small container. The life of the brushes can likewise be extended with hydrogen peroxide. Totally safe, as it can be used diluted with an equal amount of water as a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I bought one for me and one for my wife. We both feel it is too hard to get in between the teeth...the floss is just too wide. The floss is probably twice the thickness of the reach flosser or even string floss. Also, you have to hold the button down the entire time to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s attractive, it has a great name and it&#x27;s backed by an extraordinary brand.  Once you get beyond that, it&#x27;s just hype.  My mother loves hummingbirds and I hate flossing, so I thought this would be a fun gadget to use.  Unfortunately, the vibrations don&#x27;t do as much as proper manual flossing action to clean the spaces between teeth.  And if you need/prefer tape-style floss, you&#x27;re out of luck with this product, which just uses string.  It sat on my shelf for months and was used only 3 or 4 times before I gave up.  Now I use OralB silk tape or Tom&#x27;s of Maine tape.  Easy, fast, inexpensive and far more effective.  Sorry guys; you usually do a good job, but not this time.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing, and this little device is very good. It is easy to use (yes, pressing and holding that button is a pain but you&#x27;ll get use to it), and it fits nicely between my tight teeth.    BUT, and this is one big but, I have go through at least 6-8 of them in the last year.  It somehow stops working after about 1 or 2 months. I use to think it&#x27;s the moisture as it may not be totally waterproof. But now, with the latest one, I just think it&#x27;s a bad design.  Still, I am hostage to this device as this is the only flosser that I would use.      I am experimenting with other ones... Hopefully the Reach is at least as good and more durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything out there for flossing... from the manual stuff like the string and tape you wrap around your finger to those separate floss holding plastic thingys... and all of them are a pain.  This device, especially using the pick attachment, is the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  I now use the pick daily, as I&#x27;ve found it is most effective at getting everything out from between my very tight teeth.  The vibrating is very soothing to the gums and does a very effective job of cleaning between the teeth.  I have two hummingbirds - one is for home, and one is kept in my purse for work and travel.  After months and months of daily use, I haven&#x27;t needed to replace the batteries yet.  The best thing is... I use them...daily... something I never did with the manual floss.  This is so much more convenient, and I have had none of the problems other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> This item does not vibrate as much as I thought it would. The vibrations may be beneficial once it gets between the teeth, but they do not help at all in getting the floss into the space between the teeth if your teeth are as close as mine.</li>
            <li> Im glad I didnt let all these bad reviews of this product keep me from buying it. I think its fantastic. At first glance the whole idea of a vibrating flosser may seem a little over the top and silly but guess what, it works. I can totally feel it cleaning out all the nasty grime inbetween my teeth. Its easy to use, its extremely effective, I gotta give it what it deserves. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my elderly aunt who lost hers - she is thrilled.</li>
            <li> I floss twice a day and was hoping this would make it easier to do.  No such luck, it&#x27;s very awkward.  The floss it uses is crappy.  And at twice a day, it would cost me a fortune to keep buying refills for it.  &lt;br /&gt;What a huge waste of money... don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Purchased thinking it would be supperior to manual flossing and it is actually worse!  Not worth the time, effort and definetly money.</li>
            <li> The old Dr. Flosser sold at Brookstone (not the new one from Flightek Ltd.) was the best. But this one massages your gums and is a pleasurable adjunct to normal flossing. The picks are great too. Excellent for massing between teeth and tones and invigorates while dislodging the gook. And it is so well made, like all of the Oral B / Braun products. I&#x27;m planning to keep one of these in my pocket for all occasions. And to keep one in my wife&#x27;s pocket too!</li>
            <li> After using this I found out from the dentist it was making my gums red and sore.  He told me to stop using it, and get a water pik instead.  If you are sore after using this stop using it, the pressure is too strong. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a great product and my oral hygenist has remarked on how healthy my gums are.  I&#x27;ve been using the hummingbird (the flossers, not the picks) for two years now and I was dismayed to discover that it has been discontinued in Australia.  I&#x27;m now buying the flosser refills from America.  I sincerely hope the bird isn&#x27;t given the bird there too.</li>
            <li> I am not a consistant flosser, but since I purchased the Hummingbird I have been flossing more often.  I use both the floss and the picks.  The picks work well on the back teeth, especially.&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time finding fault with a product that encourages me to floss.  While the flossing attachments still have some room for improvement, I am optimistic that Oral B will solve that problem and we will be able to buy better refills in the future.  In the meantime, I&#x27;d say the Hummingbird  will make my next trip to the dentist a little easier.</li>
            <li> This product is somewhat of a waste of time depending on your teeth.  Unless your teeth are perfectly straight you can hardly get the floss/pick in between your teeth and once you do get it in between your teeth you can hardly move the floss up and down or left to right because there is no power in just holding the device with one hand.  Also, I think that even if your teeth are perfectly straight (which I doubt everyones is) I doubt you still will be able to use this product properly because of just how weak the floss and your control over the product is.</li>
            <li> We bought the hummingbird flosser, I took the head off of it and used it. Works fine that way, it&#x27;s good for reaching the back teeth compared to regular dental floss. But I will not buy again. I will just stretch the fingers with regular floss for now on. I am not sure why anyone would say it hurts though it hardly moves.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at what this little flosser found between my teeth.  Regular floss just didn&#x27;t seem as effective.  I&#x27;d like a waxier floss, but it&#x27;s so effective, it&#x27;s hard to be critical.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace by gum stimulator, because I could not get replacement tips for it. I was thrilled with both the flosser and the pick. They work very well. The only problem is after about 3 months the unit stopped working. I replaced the battery - it wasn&#x27;t that. Thinking I just got a bad unit I bought another one. Now after about 3 months this one is doing the same thing! Sometimes when you press the button it doesn&#x27;t run. I have to tap it on the countertop or shake it to get it started. I don&#x27;t want to buy a new one every three months. &lt;br /&gt;PS. I soak the flosser and the pick in antiseptic mouthwash overnight so I can reuse them for a week or more.</li>
            <li> 1. Eliminates that looping the string around your fingers stuff &lt;br /&gt;2. Causes less damage to the gum, because (once you get the hang of it) one can control it better than the floss &lt;br /&gt;3. Gets out more gunk than I did with the floss &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of flossing, but I can do it properly, but it has always been stressful. If you have tight teeth, this gadget takes a bit of experimenting to get it down (seems to work better without wibrating), but it really feels better and seems to clean better. Try it, and take the time to learn to \\&quot;drive\\&quot; it. (It is cheap to try.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I rinse the string after every tooth (you will want to), and it is reusable until it breaks or you feel like replacing it.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly thought I could attach this to my oral b electric toothbrush.  Nope.  It is just a little thing that you hold in your hand and it vibrates a little.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst oral hygene products I have ever used.  They try to make it cute and stuff with the minty picks and protective cover and all.  I really regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, this flosser will save me from the ravages of inflammed peridontal ligaments. Flossing has never been more pleasurable or productive, and I want to do it again and again. Each application results in surprising excretions of decayed meals that would never have surrendered to manual manipulation of my old flossing twine. My fingers are starting to stiffen from my arthritis, so the battery power really helps me to perform this important grooming function without asking for assistance from my younger wife. And the little hummer is thinner in the middle than at either end, so it should remain lodged snugly in the pocket even during vigorous activity, I can be sure I will not loose it when I go on outings. One of life&#x27;s surprising pleasures in such a small sleek package. Thank you Oral Braun!</li>
            <li> The Oral B Hummingbird is completely useless as a floss or toothpick replacement.  The picks and flosser heads are better used without the hummingbird if anything.  If you purchase this item you will simply be recieve a device with a \\&quot;cute\\&quot; appearance that vibrates like a pager but does nothing to help clean your teeth.  Honestly, I do not recommend anyone purchasing this product unless they want to use it as a display item on your desk.</li>
            <li> I bought this to fill a purchase requirement for Oral B products.  The ultasonic toothbrush is outstanding, but this thing is a joke.  Unless you have gaps in your teeth big enough to allow eating corn on the cob through a tennis racket, the tips stick and pull off.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this and I didn&#x27;t want to have to go out and fight the crowds before Christmas so I got it from you and it&#x27;s great! It got her within days and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is really a great device.  At first I was skeptical about a \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; flosser, but this really makes a difference for someone with gum issues.  I carry the Hummingbird around with a \\&quot;pick\\&quot; installed instead of the flosser.  It comes with a clear protector that keeps the pick safe and clean.  You can carry it in your pocket and you will have it whenever your need it.  I have found that it is getting harder to find, so I think I am going to stock up in case it is discontinued.  It would be a shame because it really can make a difference for healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> The product is innovative, the flosser makes it easier to floss hard to reach areas but is ergonomically quite poor. My hand starts to cramp by the time I&#x27;m half-way done, mostly because of the odd placement of the button -- you need to hold it down for the vibrating action to work.    I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I think it works better than regular floss and the non-moving floss kits in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> While the flossing part is good, the machine itself vibrates a great deal.  It hurts my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Hummingbird since it came out, and am only on my second unit.  I LOVE this!  I was someone who detested flossing (my teeth are very tightly packed) and I would avoid it like the plague.  I am fairly religious about using my Hummingbird--I only use the pick attachment--and it is easy and quick to use as well as portable.  My checkups are a breeze!  I also re-use the picks for several days, just rinse them off.  I panicked when I was unable to find refills in the stores; I hope this product is never discontinued.  For under six dollars I think the value is great!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I floss more with this device than before.  Probably because it is easier to do a thorough job.  I recommend this product.  Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> If you are considering the Hummingbird flosser, don&#x27;t!  I tried it, and it practically pulled a crown out. The floss tips are too tight, and the tiny flosser is a nightmare to hold. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the Reach flosser is about the size of an electric toothbrush, and very easy to hold. Moreover, the Hummingbird floss-head refills cost almost twice as much as the Reach refills.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Hummingbird flosser to try it as a replacement for the [[ASIN:B000I24BR8 Reach Access Power Flosser]] I currently use, and it&#x27;s not even close to be a good alternative.  The vibration is considerably weaker than on the Reach model, making it harder to insert between tight teeth. Unlike the Reach, which stays on when turned on, you have to continually press the button on the Oral B to keep it running. Finally, the handle is just too tiny, making it uncomfortable to use, especially when you have to keep pressing the darn button.    The description is misleading: when I read \\&quot;Durable carrying case holds Oral B Flosser and Pick attachments for convenience\\&quot; I expected a carry case that would hold both the flosser and the attachments. But it&#x27;s just a little case that holds the attachments (flosser and pick), not the flosser itself.    If you&#x27;re considering this product, or if you&#x27;ve already used it and are disappointed because it&#x27;s uncomfortable to use, take a look at the Reach model instead. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who just doesn&#x27;t spend enough time on himself.  He likes this really well and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> I have always  had a hard time flossing. But with the Humming Bird I find flossing a breeze. I love it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten the Hummingbird, flossing has become less of a chore. I used to have the greatest difficulty getting floss between my teeth -especially in the back of my mouth where floss would start hurting my fingers. With the Hummingbird, it&#x27;s a breeze (or close enough anyhow).  &lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I was worried about the waste created by the disposable flosser units. I actually spoke to a hygienist about it. She suggested reusing it, it&#x27;s what she does! When I thought more about it, it made sense. I mean, we reuse the same toothbrush head for three months. Because the floss starts to fall apart sooner, I just rinse and use till replacement is needed. I read a reviewer for the replacements say they just recycle the plastic of the flosser, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s recyclable, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the try.  &lt;br /&gt;The reason I only give 4 stars is twofold. First, the waste is still incredible, especially if it really isn&#x27;t recyclable. Second, I don&#x27;t find the use of the vibrating particularly helpful. I just don&#x27;t use it, but some people think it works wonders. I find it more wasteful because of the addition. Why did I get this instead of a unit used just for its \\&quot;reaching\\&quot; capabilities? Why, the Hummingbird is so compact and ergonomic! I can take it anywhere!  &lt;br /&gt;Really, overall the Hummingbird is worth it. Your dental and heart health is worth it. Just stick to the three R&#x27;s (that would be reduce, reuse, and recycle) to try and help what effects you have on our planet. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This terrific product was discontinued some years ago.  There&#x27;s nothing like it on the market currently.    Please ask Oral B to bring back this product.  Please sign my petition on [...].    [...]</li>
            <li> This small flosses is great. To get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The little plastic floss can break and get stuck between your teeth. Happened at least couple of times so I switch to the string floss.</li>
