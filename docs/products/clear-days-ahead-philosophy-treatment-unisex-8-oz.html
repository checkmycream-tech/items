            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>

            <li>I have already recommended this product to many friends.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and light.</li>
            <li>Love Philosophy.  </li>
            <li>All of their product are of amazing quality and (for me) worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, light and orangy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calming, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I still love how clean it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Most acne cleansers make my skin red after use, but this one works great.</li>
            <li>It is strong, my daughter used it on her face and the places where she didn&#x27;t rinse well</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years for mild acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and oily--not a good combo.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different face washes and this one is my all-time favorite!</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, yet effective cleanser for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Two of my neices also use this with the same great results.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is so light</li>
            <li>all of philosophy products are fantastic, this is no exception</li>
            <li>Not from Amazon for quality issues but from Sephora as its such a GREAT facewash.</li>
            <li>It  cleans the face very well and washes off nicely .</li>
            <li>A fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The craziest thing happened right after I made this purchase, which doesn&#x27;t change how I feel about the product, I love the pump and the consistency of the gel.  </li>
            <li>I could see results after 2 days, her breakouts are minimal and her skin looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>He likes it a lot, which makes him use it more consistently.</li>
            <li>But otherwise the scent is great and the cleanser is not irritating for my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>but you feel so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Just clean.</li>
            <li>wanted to try this because I heard that Salicylic acid is more gentle benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>nice thing about this was is the fact that I don&#x27;t have to complete 3 steps to treat my face.</li>
            <li>Wierd, but true</li>
            <li>Good product for oily acne prone skin, cleared up my mild back acne in 3 days.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s pretty easy to tell when he hasn&#x27;t because his nose starts to bloom again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned with my son, it&#x27;s all about how much he likes the product and how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very VERY oily skin and this wash leaves my skin feeling matte and clean.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash, my skin is sensitive but prone to breakouts and this works wonders for my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it works $20 better, but until I find something better, it is better than anything I can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>but when it stopped working I tried this product based on many other user reviews for adult breakouts and this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I use their Amazing Grace body care and perfume, and it&#x27;s equally fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleared my skin very quickly and it does the job without making my face super dry like many washes do.  </li>
            <li>It feels baby soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>But what happened was I learned by doing some basic internet research that you can make your own salicylic acid with ASPIRIN...  </li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer from this line, Id highly recommend using an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is a great cleanser and usually clears up my blemishes in about 48 hours.</li>
            <li>My sister actually commented on how smooth and pimple free my face looked.</li>
            <li>Also the sender worked very well with me and reshipped it quickly after I realized I somehow missed USPS.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for awhile.like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have used many different acne products over the years.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really refreshing smell for a morning facial wash.</li>
            <li>Within the first two days, I noticed my skin clearing up and softer skin than I have had in years.  </li>
            <li>Although I still have occasional breakouts, since I&#x27;ve started using this product (3 months now), my skin just looks and feels better in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>gives a very deep clean clean without over drying..</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely oily, I needed a cleanser not only cleans but smells great as well.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for keeping your small acne problems under control.</li>
            <li>As long as you was your face, your golden :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Philosophy products are more expensive than many others, the benefits are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I have used Neutrogena, proactiv, clearasil, clean and clear, biore, loreal and probably many other cleansers.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Philosophy has been a real breakthrough for me.</li>
            <li>It has really cleared up my skin and even my skin texture has changed.</li>
            <li>It works really well on my acne.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li>LEAVES SKIN FEELING VERY CLEAN,I WI BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li>I really like this product if you use it along with the spot treatment and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My acne is moderate to light acne, so if you have severe</li>
            <li>Like VERY itchy.</li>
            <li>and my face is still very flaky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well but still seems like it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t do much to control my breakouts, even though I have been using it together with the overnight repairs pads for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and in the time I used it, I noticed fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is not seeming to work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>like it does with many other face washes.</li>
            <li>Decent cleanser.</li>
            <li>i think it is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new face wash since I feel like the cheaper brands I was buying from the grocery store weren&#x27;t working really well at keeping my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more expensive prescription products, but they weren&#x27;t as easy for him to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little drying, but that can be easily corrected with an intensive, oil-free night time moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful because this dries out your skin really quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this along with any other products (astringents, serums, special moisturizers, etc).</li>
            <li>I still suffer from mild to moderate acne even in my mid 40s.  </li>
            <li>The Philosophy Clear Days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see things clear up.</li>
            <li>Philosophy clear days has cleared up my skin with out drying it out.</li>
            <li>keeps my complexion clear.</li>
            <li>It is not drying and keeps my face clear and glowing  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product clears up my skin without drying it out completely.  </li>
            <li>She loves the way her skin feels soft after washing &amp; she said she&#x27;s staying with Philosophy</li>
            <li>Even my old spots are fading.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants clearer skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry/combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how sensitive until using this product.</li>
            <li>I did notice that they would subside and even clear completely when he remembered to use it.</li>
            <li>I read the back of the bottle the next day which has a warning about that that I just didn&#x27;t read when I first started the product.</li>
            <li>It does tend to dry the skin out a little, so make sure to use moisturizer after using.</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;m 80% back to normal.</li>
            <li>Not only is it gentle on the skin but it clears breakouts and prevents future ones.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;4/7 - organic shea butter and aveda exfoliant liquid (which i used to gently remove the dead skin) really did wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I had a zit when I first tried it, and it&#x27;s just now going away, &amp; I got one the other day that also seems defiant.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing I have recommended to a few other people all of whom love this as well.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past with good results, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working my second round of using.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly need to alternate between products.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because when I first started using this product, I was also using the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit face wash in the morning and the combination of the two citrus face washes made my skin dry out a lot.</li>

            <li> I could see results after 2 days, her breakouts are minimal and her skin looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> He likes it a lot, which makes him use it more consistently.</li>
            <li> But otherwise the scent is great and the cleanser is not irritating for my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> but you feel so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Just clean.</li>
            <li> wanted to try this because I heard that Salicylic acid is more gentle benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> nice thing about this was is the fact that I don&#x27;t have to complete 3 steps to treat my face.</li>
            <li> Wierd, but true</li>
            <li> Good product for oily acne prone skin, cleared up my mild back acne in 3 days.</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s pretty easy to tell when he hasn&#x27;t because his nose starts to bloom again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned with my son, it&#x27;s all about how much he likes the product and how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very VERY oily skin and this wash leaves my skin feeling matte and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, my skin is sensitive but prone to breakouts and this works wonders for my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works $20 better, but until I find something better, it is better than anything I can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> but when it stopped working I tried this product based on many other user reviews for adult breakouts and this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I use their Amazing Grace body care and perfume, and it&#x27;s equally fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleared my skin very quickly and it does the job without making my face super dry like many washes do.  </li>
            <li> It feels baby soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> But what happened was I learned by doing some basic internet research that you can make your own salicylic acid with ASPIRIN...  </li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer from this line, Id highly recommend using an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is a great cleanser and usually clears up my blemishes in about 48 hours.</li>
            <li> My sister actually commented on how smooth and pimple free my face looked.</li>
            <li> Also the sender worked very well with me and reshipped it quickly after I realized I somehow missed USPS.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile.like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have used many different acne products over the years.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really refreshing smell for a morning facial wash.</li>
            <li> Within the first two days, I noticed my skin clearing up and softer skin than I have had in years.  </li>
            <li> Although I still have occasional breakouts, since I&#x27;ve started using this product (3 months now), my skin just looks and feels better in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> gives a very deep clean clean without over drying..</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily, I needed a cleanser not only cleans but smells great as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for keeping your small acne problems under control.</li>
            <li> As long as you was your face, your golden :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Philosophy products are more expensive than many others, the benefits are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena, proactiv, clearasil, clean and clear, biore, loreal and probably many other cleansers.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Philosophy has been a real breakthrough for me.</li>
            <li> It has really cleared up my skin and even my skin texture has changed.</li>
            <li> It works really well on my acne.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> LEAVES SKIN FEELING VERY CLEAN,I WI BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I really like this product if you use it along with the spot treatment and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My acne is moderate to light acne, so if you have severe</li>
            <li> Like VERY itchy.</li>
            <li> and my face is still very flaky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well but still seems like it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t do much to control my breakouts, even though I have been using it together with the overnight repairs pads for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and in the time I used it, I noticed fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is not seeming to work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> like it does with many other face washes.</li>
            <li> Decent cleanser.</li>
            <li> i think it is definitely worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new face wash since I feel like the cheaper brands I was buying from the grocery store weren&#x27;t working really well at keeping my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive prescription products, but they weren&#x27;t as easy for him to use.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying, but that can be easily corrected with an intensive, oil-free night time moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful because this dries out your skin really quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this along with any other products (astringents, serums, special moisturizers, etc).</li>
            <li> I still suffer from mild to moderate acne even in my mid 40s.  </li>
            <li> The Philosophy Clear Days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see things clear up.</li>
            <li> Philosophy clear days has cleared up my skin with out drying it out.</li>
            <li> keeps my complexion clear.</li>
            <li> It is not drying and keeps my face clear and glowing  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product clears up my skin without drying it out completely.  </li>
            <li> She loves the way her skin feels soft after washing &amp; she said she&#x27;s staying with Philosophy</li>
            <li> Even my old spots are fading.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry/combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how sensitive until using this product.</li>
            <li> I did notice that they would subside and even clear completely when he remembered to use it.</li>
            <li> I read the back of the bottle the next day which has a warning about that that I just didn&#x27;t read when I first started the product.</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry the skin out a little, so make sure to use moisturizer after using.</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;m 80% back to normal.</li>
            <li> Not only is it gentle on the skin but it clears breakouts and prevents future ones.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;4/7 - organic shea butter and aveda exfoliant liquid (which i used to gently remove the dead skin) really did wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a zit when I first tried it, and it&#x27;s just now going away, &amp; I got one the other day that also seems defiant.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing I have recommended to a few other people all of whom love this as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past with good results, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working my second round of using.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly need to alternate between products.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because when I first started using this product, I was also using the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit face wash in the morning and the combination of the two citrus face washes made my skin dry out a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week now, &amp; my already dry skin has become so much more dry, I&#x27;ve got visible dryness around my lips and my nose that is itchy, irritating and embarrassing, no amount of moisturizer is helping.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin and this wash does not dry out my skin like others have.</li>
            <li> although it is a liiiiiiittle bit more expensive than your average facial cleanser (something of the cvs/wallgreens variety)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel dry after</li>
            <li> When used continuously, it caused my skin to be too dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> The only negative about it is the price, which is a bit high compared to your average drug store cleansers.</li>
            <li> It does dry out the face but that is expected with the ingredients is possesses.</li>
            <li> Disappointed but will continue to use until I find a different product that hopefully works better.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it does make my skin a little dry, but nothing face lotion doesn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It did help prevent breakouts, but makes my skin very dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> Have only been using a few days, no drastic improvement in my acne yet</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> Other products have irritated my face or done nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> I have small red bumps all over my cheeks now, which has never been a problem area for me before.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I try to use once a day in conjunction with my other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> Tried Pro Active for years</li>
            <li> too so if you&#x27;re not willing to shell for this get Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or as if there&#x27;s a residue left on it.</li>
            <li> This product cleared my skin in less then two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 13 year old that was starting to get those horrible red bumps somewhere between pimples and leprosy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive in the past &amp; evey over the counter face wash.</li>
            <li> I find that I am unable to use this product as a part of my daily morning and evening cleansing routine.  </li>
            <li> While it does not seem to be making matters worse it certainly is not correcting.  </li>
            <li> I hardly break out anymore.</li>
            <li> i wash my face at least 3 times a day &amp; the bottle lasted me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> is kinda subtle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out badly, but enough to be annoyed with it.</li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend this if you have very serious acne.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> This is the worst reaction I&#x27;ve ever had :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone who has real bad acne problems.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing! This is a gentle, yet effective cleanser for my daughter. The Philosophy Clear Days Ahead line has been the only thing to work for her moderate acne. I recommend trying all their acne products.  I could see results after 2 days, her breakouts are minimal and her skin looks beautiful. Two of my neices also use this with the same great results. Don&#x27;t let the price be a deterrent...It will last for months, even using twice a day. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Tried Pro Active for years but when it stopped working I tried this product based on many other user reviews for adult breakouts and this stuff is AMAZING! Not only is it gentle on the skin but it clears breakouts and prevents future ones. Since purchasing I have recommended to a few other people all of whom love this as well. Must buy!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used proactive in the past &amp; evey over the counter face wash. I don&#x27;t break out badly, but enough to be annoyed with it. This makes my face flawless. The only downside is it does make my skin a little dry, but nothing face lotion doesn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My teen son&#x27;s face was breaking out and he uses this now and what a difference</li>
            <li> Helps to keep my face from breaking out!</li>
            <li> My son has been using this product for about 6 months, maybe longer.  I put it in the shower and he uses it daily.  It seems to help his complexion stay clearer than just regular facial soap.  He likes it a lot, which makes him use it more consistently. I&#x27;ve learned with my son, it&#x27;s all about how much he likes the product and how easy it is to use.  I&#x27;ve bought more expensive prescription products, but they weren&#x27;t as easy for him to use.  If he doesn&#x27;t use the product, it won&#x27;t help and it&#x27;s wasting my money.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for a while and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Really love the smell of this product. Citrusy, very nice in the morniwhen waking up.I have very VERY oily skin and this wash leaves my skin feeling matte and clean. Have only been using a few days, no drastic improvement in my acne yet but I am confident with a bit more use I&#x27;ll see things clear up.</li>
            <li> This is the 100th time i buy this and I still love how clean it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> This has been pertinent in improving my skin! Love it! My skin was struggling for a while and until I started using this with the lotion and overnight treatment, nothing was working. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash.. My skin has never looked better. I use this with the the Foreo Luna mini facial brush I got from sephora as my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile.like it very much.</li>
            <li> This product clears up my skin without drying it out completely.  I have tried other brands but they don&#x27;t work as well.  Absolutely love this face wash!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past with good results, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be working my second round of using.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly need to alternate between products.</li>
            <li> This face wash is absolutely amazing! I have tried many, many different face washes and this one is my all-time favorite! It cleared my skin very quickly and it does the job without making my face super dry like many washes do.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Best acne facewash I have found! And I&#x27;ve used a lot, including Proactive. I don&#x27;t use this along with any other products (astringents, serums, special moisturizers, etc). It&#x27;s good on its own. It clears up your face without overly drying you out.</li>
            <li> This product cleared my skin in less then two weeks.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I use strictly Philosophy for all my skin care and makeup.  All of their product are of amazing quality and (for me) worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I will definately order it again. My whole family uses it. It has a wonderful refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who has been using Murad, but I use Philosophy &amp; wanted her to try from their line.  She loves the way her skin feels soft after washing &amp; she said she&#x27;s staying with Philosophy</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash in the history of face washes. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, light and orangy. Good product for oily acne prone skin, cleared up my mild back acne in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and still suffer from occasional breakouts. This is amazing! I hardly break out anymore. I also have dry skin and this wash does not dry out my skin like others have. I have been using this for years and love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena, proactiv, clearasil, clean and clear, biore, loreal and probably many other cleansers. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and it&#x27;s smell is kinda subtle but it&#x27;s honestly the best scent I&#x27;ve had in a cleanser, and very well balanced. After just one pump, it removes most of my make up which is always a shock to me. The cleanser is so light but you feel so clean afterwards. I&#x27;m on a couple dermatologist prescribed meds for my acne, so I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this helps with acne but it definitely seems to assist since I don&#x27;t have breakouts anymore. I am definitely going to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used many different acne products over the years. I was treated with accutane twice in my 20s.  I still suffer from mild to moderate acne even in my mid 40s.  I have tried proactiv and murad which both worked for periods if time but then stopped working. Philosophy has been a real breakthrough for me. It has really cleared up my skin and even my skin texture has changed. It feels baby soft and healthy. I still have one or two pimples around my period, but my favs is not covered with acne like it used to be. Love the product.</li>
            <li> My sister actually commented on how smooth and pimple free my face looked. Even my old spots are fading. I&#x27;m using it along with the overnight repair and  lotion from the same range.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, my skin is sensitive but prone to breakouts and this works wonders for my face! Also the sender worked very well with me and reshipped it quickly after I realized I somehow missed USPS.</li>
            <li> all of philosophy products are fantastic, this is no exception</li>
            <li> Love this face wash. It does dry out the face but that is expected with the ingredients is possesses. It works really well on my acne.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! Smells really nice and cleans your skin without drying your skin out... I use many of the Philosophy&lt;br /&gt;Products and they are all wonderful</li>
            <li> I like this facial cleanser. It&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight or as if there&#x27;s a residue left on it. Just clean.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. LEAVES SKIN FEELING VERY CLEAN,I WI BUY IT AGAIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years! It is a great cleanser and usually clears up my blemishes in about 48 hours. I knocked off a star because it does leave my skin very red. Though I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer from this line, Id highly recommend using an oil free moisturizer. This product also smells great - very citrusy.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> Be careful because this dries out your skin really quickly. but deffinitely works</li>
            <li> Love love love. My skin can be tricky as I have combination skin. Philosophy clear days has cleared up my skin with out drying it out. I use the Toilet-tree facial brush with this and my skin has never been smoother.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.  I still have the occasional breakout but it helps keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> I really like this product if you use it along with the spot treatment and the moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week and I already see some difference in my skin. It is very gentle and it smells wonderful.

I read the back of the bottle the next day which has a warning about that that I just didn&#x27;t read when I first started the product. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants clearer skin. However, I would not recommend this if you have very serious acne. My acne is moderate to light acne, so if you have severe this might not work for you</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, works great! Expensive BUT would buy AGAIN! Not from Amazon for quality issues but from Sephora as its such a GREAT facewash. Cetaphil used to work really good too so if you&#x27;re not willing to shell for this get Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Great smell cleans my skin well. My skin is extremely oily, I needed a cleanser not only cleans but smells great as well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new face wash since I feel like the cheaper brands I was buying from the grocery store weren&#x27;t working really well at keeping my skin clear.  I feel like this face wash does work better than most of the cheaper brands I have tried.  I&#x27;m not sure if it works $20 better, but until I find something better, it is better than anything I can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Smells great and very helpful for my teenagers skin!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, it has a pleasant citrusy smell. It is strong, my daughter used it on her face and the places where she didn&#x27;t rinse well got irritated, so be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  This is not seeming to work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  While it does not seem to be making matters worse it certainly is not correcting.  I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now.  Disappointed but will continue to use until I find a different product that hopefully works better.</li>
            <li> I have dry/combination sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t realize how sensitive until using this product. After using this once during the day and at night, I woke up with itchy peeling skin. Like VERY itchy. I was also starting to develop red spots (rash?). This is the worst reaction I&#x27;ve ever had :(&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try this because I heard that Salicylic acid is more gentle benzoyl peroxide. Day 3 and my face is still very flaky. Tonight, I&#x27;m nursing my face with Jojoba oil, it seems to be helping a lot. We shall see...&lt;br /&gt;4/7 - organic shea butter and aveda exfoliant liquid (which i used to gently remove the dead skin) really did wonders for my skin. I would say I&#x27;m 80% back to normal.</li>
            <li> Face wash is good keeps my complexion clear. It doesn&#x27;t lather up very well but still seems like it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> great face wash! smells wonderful &amp; foams up nicely.. gives a very deep clean clean without over drying.. although it is a liiiiiiittle bit more expensive than your average facial cleanser (something of the cvs/wallgreens variety) i think it is definitely worth the extra money! i wash my face at least 3 times a day &amp; the bottle lasted me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cleanser which I use in the morning . It  cleans the face very well and washes off nicely . A fabulous product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can not believe the difference in my skin after only a week.  I have had problem skin for a while now and this is huge!  I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I bought it for my 13 year old that was starting to get those horrible red bumps somewhere between pimples and leprosy. I did notice that they would subside and even clear completely when he remembered to use it. In fact it&#x27;s pretty easy to tell when he hasn&#x27;t because his nose starts to bloom again. Now if we only has something for the gym locker smell growing in his room...</li>
            <li> Really refreshing smell for a morning facial wash.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for acne I have ever bought.  Other products have irritated my face or done nothing at all.  Within the first two days, I noticed my skin clearing up and softer skin than I have had in years.  I have already recommended this product to many friends.  Love, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week now, &amp; my already dry skin has become so much more dry, I&#x27;ve got visible dryness around my lips and my nose that is itchy, irritating and embarrassing, no amount of moisturizer is helping. I have small red bumps all over my cheeks now, which has never been a problem area for me before. I had a zit when I first tried it, and it&#x27;s just now going away, &amp; I got one the other day that also seems defiant. I really wanted this to work. Now I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do with it all, I have to be wasteful but I imagine I&#x27;ll be dumping it soon. Back to clearasil.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and oily--not a good combo.  I have regular visits to my dermatologist and do have prescribed products that I use. I alternate those products with the Philosophy cleanser. It makes my skin feel very soft and clean. I find if I use every day, it dries my skin out. Therefore, I try to use once a day in conjunction with my other products. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.  However, it doesn&#x27;t do much to control my breakouts, even though I have been using it together with the overnight repairs pads for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash, smells fresh and feels great. My skin does not feel dry after like it does with many other face washes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Just smells good. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne. If you use benzyl peroxide then this wouldn&#x27;t help your acne .</li>
            <li> I use this every day as part of my acne treatment. I feel like a princess every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Cleans off all my makeup and feels great.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> This wash cleared my face up in a matter of days. I will definitely be buying again. Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Really wonderful product! It&#x27;s helping my acne after only two days of use. It does tend to dry the skin out a little, so make sure to use moisturizer after using. But otherwise the scent is great and the cleanser is not irritating for my sensitive skin!  Most acne cleansers make my skin red after use, but this one works great.</li>
            <li> I find that I am unable to use this product as a part of my daily morning and evening cleansing routine.  When used continuously, it caused my skin to be too dry and irritated. Perhaps they need to add some of the emollient properties of their signature cleansing liquid - &#x27;purity made simple&#x27;.  I now use this twice or three times a week.</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and this works great to get rid of blemishes that us adults get from time to time. I would not recommend using this everyday multiple times as it can be very drying.</li>
            <li> Decent cleanser. Does what it says it does. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for someone who has real bad acne problems. Good before bed and morning cleanser. Smells nice and light.</li>
            <li> It did help prevent breakouts, but makes my skin very dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy.  A good wash whether you have breakouts or not.  Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and in the time I used it, I noticed fewer breakouts. It&#x27;s calming, smells great, and doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction with my sensitive skin. The only negative about it is the price, which is a bit high compared to your average drug store cleansers. The bottle did last me for quite a while, and I&#x27;ll consider purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> As described. I have been using as a cleanser for years. It is not drying and keeps my face clear and glowing  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great product for dance prone skin</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years for mild acne. Although I still have occasional breakouts, since I&#x27;ve started using this product (3 months now), my skin just looks and feels better in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle has lasted 6 weeks for me, and I use it day and night. I leave it on for several minutes in the shower. It&#x27;s extremely refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of faith in Philosophy products. I use their Amazing Grace body care and perfume, and it&#x27;s equally fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this was is the fact that I don&#x27;t have to complete 3 steps to treat my face. It takes no commitment. As long as you was your face, your golden :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Philosophy products are more expensive than many others, the benefits are well worth the investment. I find them to be some of the best face and body products I have ever used. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for keeping your small acne problems under control. It&#x27;s a little drying, but that can be easily corrected with an intensive, oil-free night time moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as part of a daily routine for 3 months and saw improvements in my acne. I only used this product at night, and the Purity Made Simple during the day. Worked well for my combination/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am a Philosophy fan.  The craziest thing happened right after I made this purchase, which doesn&#x27;t change how I feel about the product, I love the pump and the consistency of the gel.  But what happened was I learned by doing some basic internet research that you can make your own salicylic acid with ASPIRIN...  Wierd, but true, check it out!</li>
