            <li>good nails, thanks so much so fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fit nicely and dont purchase if looking for a dramatic flare but look good!</li>
            <li>it sure is mines i love how they end up looking like white tips at the end.</li>
            <li>More to do more butterful design and put on some big bling blings</li>
            <li>Good tips but too long for me.</li>
            <li>thanks to my free 2 day shipping with amazon prime.</li>
            <li>cant wait to try them, they even gave me  a sample of guide line stickers i will be ordering them again;)</li>
            <li>A five stars for fast delivery in that part.i love my duck tips they are different from my other clear duck tips which i also love they are different and that is what i love about them.their not to wide which it is ok for me.i will.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a straight square shape.</li>
            <li>Very please with it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is they flair closer to the free edge because when you trim them to a shorter length the flair isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>Really thin....poor quality.</li>
            <li>I have paid as high as $35 for duck feet tips</li>
            <li>no one likes them they are real skinny at top like regular nails than flare a little only at bottom</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get what I ordered.......got clear pointy nails instead.</li>
            <li>but that on my end not the product as far as them being duck feet , that they are</li>
            <li>Extremely thin and break very easily.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t cut them down either without them sitting funny.</li>
            <li>The nails are too thin, and they break easily and frequently.  </li>

            <li> I live by duck feet nails and have been wearing them since before they became a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; so I am extremely picky when it comes quality and quantity  (sizing)!  </li>
            <li> They were less clear than I thought as well.</li>
            <li> When I got these they lasted so long, I must say I worked it.</li>
            <li> and it took to long to arrive.</li>
            <li> This product was not as expected.  </li>
            <li> No it was not what i expected.</li>
            <li> The nails look nothing like what you see here online, and the quality overall sucks.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble of returning.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even waste my money or time on this product.</li>
            <li> They were flat thin pieces of plastic</li>
            <li> hard to shape</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I got something Elsa that I did not want I am not happy at all</li>
            <li> Not satisfied :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst duck nails</li>
            <li> What I received is horrible!</li>

            <li> Extremely thin and break very easily. I like the shape though. They were less clear than I thought as well.</li>
            <li> Okay, where do I start? The nails look nothing like what you see here online, and the quality overall sucks. In this case, you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t even waste my money or time on this product. On to the next honey.</li>

They arrived promptly (they are in a amazon wear house in the usa not china) thanks to my free 2 day shipping with amazon prime. They were very nicely packaged by size and I even got a free gift! These are amazing quality and I encourage others to order!</li>
