            <li> WHO WOULD PAY THAT MUCH FOR A SMALL BOTTLE OF LOTION-that use to be $6?</li>
            <li> IT EVEN LASTS LONG.</li>
            <li> I am so crazy about the berry vanilla, and I was wanting something sweet and coconut.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little heavier than I remembered.  </li>
            <li> The coconut is hardly there</li>
            <li> Sad it is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about this product; but decided to buy it because I LLLOVE vanilla.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Smelling it, I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very boring scent.  </li>

            <li> Love it smells great and moisterizes well.</li>
            <li> Like the scent, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
            <li> I was happy to have seen this signature collection online as they stopped selling it at bath and body works. It smells fresh and summery. I received the product in a timely manner. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about this product; but decided to buy it because I LLLOVE vanilla. I was also worried that the lotion would just feel like water but actually the smell is AMAZING and it actually moisturizes and I don&#x27;t have to cake my body with it to work. GREAT SMELL~this is NOW my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> For more years than I care to remember, I have tried every coconut scented body lotion that I&#x27;ve come across.  This was not the Coconut scent I was hoping for.  Fiji is the truest to that sweet, warm, tropical scent.</li>
            <li> Very Pleasant scent-- makes you think of the tropics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and leaves me skin feeling very soft! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I loved it I mixed it with vanilla smells great!!</li>
            <li> Great smell that lasts!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to get it. It was actually given as a gift for a friend. I am very satisfied with the purchase. Thank you, Nancy Mowbray</li>
            <li> Really nice and and creamy with the great scent of coconut.  Not to sweet smelling either.  Great price too. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, in good condition. Love the creamy feeling on my skin. Leaves skin smooth and  feeling great. really great</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE COCONUT SMELL OF THIS LOTION.... IT EVEN LASTS LONG. I CAN&#x27;T GET ENOUGH OF THIS SMELL!!!! SMELLS BETTER THAN OTHER COCONUT LOTION I HAVE EVER HAD...</li>
            <li> Best scent. I love this lotion. Sad it is hard to come by.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion from bath and body works!! I love coconut and so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Loved this Product! I normally buy Plumeria...which is my FAVORITE, but it&#x27;s prices jumped up to over $30!!!!! WHO WOULD PAY THAT MUCH FOR A SMALL BOTTLE OF LOTION-that use to be $6? Come on bath n body...You are better then that!! I want my Plumeria back to it&#x27;s normal price!!!!...:(</li>
            <li> Just as I hoped for. Thanks for the prompt delivery! :)</li>
            <li> Bath and Body is always great needed an add on gift</li>
            <li> I get compliments all well</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and as described. It was direct shipped as a gift.</li>

The Aruba coconut currently in stores isn&#x27;t really sweet like I wanted, so I thought this would be perfect.  Smelling it, I am disappointed.
