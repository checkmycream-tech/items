            <li>It worked so good</li>
            <li>It made me feel good to see that the company took time to protectively wrap the bottle before sending it.  </li>
            <li>I find the quality of Poppy Austin argan oil to be just as good</li>
            <li>Good product and I have had good results since I began using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try this for another month and if the results are still as good</li>
            <li>seems good.  </li>
            <li>I started to bald a year or two ago, and I figured now was a good time to start doing something about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it  and paying the price for the Josie Maran a  proven good quality product.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything else this good at moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>i heard that argan oil can be found cheaper but just as good through online methods like amazon....</li>
            <li>Argan oil is good.</li>
            <li>, its good for your hair, I apply it to my ends and it helps stops</li>
            <li>That stuff changed my hair - I loved it...</li>
            <li>I have not used Organ oil before but giving it a good try.</li>

            <li>and this is good argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I had bought Pre de Provence argan oil in a body shop and loved it, I think it may be a blend</li>
            <li>I thought since I already loved Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;ll give Poppy Austin a try.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, what is good for my family and me, it must be for you too.</li>

            <li>it works like a cleanser and its really good too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Received the product promptly from Poppy Austin and she is delighted with it.</li>
            <li>Also works good on my hair, makes it look shiny.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&#x27;Amazing&#x27; is truly an understatement when it comes to Argan oil; it moisturizes, protects, soothes, and nourishes all over, without creating an oily texture on my skin or hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how this oil works for everything.</li>
            <li>The benefits sounded amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair (been amazing for my curly hair) as well as my face</li>
            <li>I had a shipping problem and the Customer service was simply amazing..</li>

            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>

            <li>It really does feel exquisite!</li>
            <li>This product leaves a nice silky finish with plenty of shine.</li>
            <li>I liked it because it was organic</li>
            <li>and he kept rubbing the baby&#x27;s cheeks to compare them to my own skin.  </li>
            <li>but I was instantly impressed with how truly lightweight and fast-absorbing this Argan oil really</li>
            <li>It feels stronger, thicker, and it has a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nicEly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>the products, I ordered their argan oil again plus their rose water which I use as face toner.</li>
            <li>What more can you wish from a skin care product that is good for your skin, the environment and the people who produce it?  </li>
            <li>i got two ounces of argan for $25 in comparison to JM $48 dollar argan oil...and honestly...</li>
            <li>It is a nice complement to my homemade pomade.  </li>
            <li>and my friends keep saying how nice my complexion is.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your attention to detail and providing an excellent item!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of rancid quite frankly.</li>
            <li>Nice for my hair too.</li>
            <li>Thanks Poppy Austin, for a nice product, excellent packaging, and speedy shipping!</li>
            <li>I watched her video and liked what I heard and saw.  </li>
            <li>My husband liked my results</li>
            <li>so I tried this and am loving it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom as Argan oil is so popular for use on the hair.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on the skin as well and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and can honestly say that it leaves my skin feeling moisturized without being sticky or oily...  </li>
            <li>most every day so do need a good moisturizer...  </li>

            <li>No breakout noted and the subtlety of the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Fast shipping and a great product!</li>
            <li>This aragon oil never looks too gresy, but gives my skin a nice glow and feel even when I am not applying make up over it.</li>
            <li>amazon does an amazingly fast delivery and I&#x27;m very impressed by that.  </li>
            <li>something nice for your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice oil.</li>
            <li>but when I apply oils to my face, my face doesn&#x27;t oil up on its own.</li>
            <li>You will be so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So nice to find an organic product that I like and believe in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still moisturizes the skin nicely, and for the price I can overlook the smell.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately,  there is a very strong odor that just smells \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, my skin feels hydrated and looks healthy -- I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it,  I have used Argan Oil for 2 yrs &amp; this is my favorite!  </li>

            <li>&amp;#34;The Poppy Austin Argan Oil is the best product that I have ever used on my natural, kinky, curly hair ( Hair type 3c/4a).</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or oily and is wonderful on my face too!  </li>
            <li>So far I am extremely happy!</li>
            <li>Oil is effective, potent, but not pungent.</li>

            <li>I need more time to know if it helps wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s better than my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>My hair became a bit softer, and more pliable.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feels so much better now.</li>
            <li>Compared to Josie Maran, this product is a better deal.  </li>
            <li>Try the products they are lovely.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad I saw the u-tube info about yours.  </li>
            <li>but the Argan Oil absorbs into the skin, so I am able to put it on during the day and not have to worry about getting the oil on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will post again after using this for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin was noticeably softer and it had a more even tone.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil for my hair and face.</li>
            <li>by morning it had mostly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I like it but not so sure what all the hype is about.  </li>
            <li>but I like Poppy Austins&#x27; better.  </li>
            <li>I have replaced my moisturizer and have referred many friends who have complimented me on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Try this, you will love it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>So love how the Argon oil is working on my skin.</li>
            <li>poppy austin is so much better in my opinion...</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it ....</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil was OK</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be buying this again! :)</li>
            <li>This works better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>, MY HAIR LOOKS MORE SHINE</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that I am trying to figure the best way to apply it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried this</li>
            <li>and I am sure that will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if my hair was longer or damaged, I would need more.</li>
            <li>Just something to keep in mind! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s authentic like u get in Morocco.  </li>
            <li>I still have some experamenting to do with this as I have not fallen in love with it yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s just ok for hair.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever shopped for argan oil, you&#x27;ll see that most of them are no longer at its purest form.</li>
            <li>and I find I need more moisturizer</li>
            <li>I feel it moisturizes my skin better than the cream.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>glad I decided to order it.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, healthy, and no signs of split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;With just one use i could see more shine and moisture in my hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I am going to say that I love this product because it does make my hair fuller and just makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li>I learned a lot watching Poppy Austin videos on YouTube, and am even more convinced in the quality of their product after using it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with results and product quality.</li>
            <li>request i have is that there should be a more convenient way to use it besides the dropper.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>But while the oil itself is lovely, it smells *</li>
            <li>Simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin!</li>
            <li>My friends maybe getting this for Christmas! :-)</li>
            <li>just better overall.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is okay, not all that as they made it seem on the amazon website and you tube for this oil.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this oil.  </li>
            <li>it does the job on my skin and under my eyes and that&#x27;s all that matters :)</li>

            <li>I am completely satisfied with Poppy Austin Argan Oil.</li>

            <li>hair will benefit even more from Argan oil in the summer months, once the sun begins to take its toll</li>
            <li>I cant say it was much better at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have a body lotion with coconut oil that leaves me needing more moisture</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works better than any conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>My cuticles look great and it really tames frizz (just don&#x27;t use a lot of it as it can make your hair oily).</li>
            <li>Being extremely satisfied with this brand, I will no longer search for a &#x27;better&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased that it arrived sooner than the projected delivery date.</li>
            <li>my hair feels better and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Great quality oil that does absolute wonders for the hair, replacing &amp; locking in lost moisture.</li>
            <li>Love this product my skin is feeling softer after just one week</li>
            <li>but my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li>and I think that this one is even better the one from Sephora (which I&#x27;ve tried as well).</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Also,  I love the dropper/ bottle.</li>
            <li>Better than the celebrity brand I was using.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love Argan oil.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks on my face and hair and it&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Moroccan Oil, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I order this, having ordered from this company before, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Who wouldn’t love something like that?</li>

            <li>Argan oil is supposed to be excellent for the hair (especially if it is brittle, or thinning.  </li>

            <li>My scalp feels much better after applying this oil.  </li>

            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for more than a year now, and plan to continue.</li>
            <li>to try it more to see benefits</li>
            <li>I have noticed that everywhere it is touted that Argan oil is the best oil to use on facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I used Josie Maran Argan oil and this is much better priced.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this brand.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>

            <li>maybe I put to many drops.</li>
            <li>and it should work even better.</li>
            <li>I opted for this 100% argon oil and love it.</li>
            <li>For me Argan oil smooths , tightens , hydrates , gives my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li>and it also keeps skin hydraded while I work out :)</li>
            <li>I should know better-</li>
            <li>and I was really hoping that I found a great argan product.  </li>
            <li>feels better.</li>
            <li>Thanks Works Great ...</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for gifts for my daughters.</li>

            <li>Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li>Great product and the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased .Miriam Mays</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and a great product.</li>
            <li>After trying several brands of Argan oil, I would say that Poppy Austin is the best oil for the money value and quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>I need to give it more time to see if I will stay with the product once I&#x27;ve completed the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love it for overnight use and for the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping it would work better than it did.</li>
            <li>fact that this &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oil does not absorb as an authentic one should immediately confirms that it is 99% fillers.</li>
            <li>Their lavishing, convincing wording and ads.</li>
            <li>Basically, I&#x27;ve tried so many and nothing improved my skin.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can use it as a healthy conditioner and rinse it out</li>
            <li>and when I did my hair this morning it&#x27;s never felt or looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased just make</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil and it just sits on top of my face.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love Argan oil for hair and skin by Poppy Austin .</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Finding many ways to use it.</li>
            <li>I have come to the conclusion as many others also, that, it is one of the top organic carrier oils in the world (if it is not diluted or anything added or taken away from it) for its healing, health, and conditioning properties.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, thought it would work but haven&#x27;t seen results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m repurchasing for sure.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Poppy Austin for such an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Not terrible acne, but still sucky acne.  </li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s so dramatically reduced that I feel confident saying this stuff helped.  </li>
            <li>I love the Argan Oil and use it for my curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my hair.</li>

            <li>Makes my skin and hair feel wonderful I will purchase it again with no doubt, doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin or weigh my hair down :)</li>
            <li>I apply argan oil to my scalp for dandruff and dry scalp control, to my face and skin to moisturize, and of course to my hair to eliminate frizz and give me flawless celebrity smooth hair.</li>
            <li>It comes in a large size and the quality of the product is exceptional.</li>
            <li>It made them very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I went home and did some research and found that the important ingredient is argan oil and since I don&#x27;t want the perfume I found this pure argan oil for a really good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially happy that I bought my Argan oil from Poppy Austin because it is guaranteed 100% pure, natural, and undiluted.</li>
            <li>At night, I use this on top of my retinol products to calm any irritation I might have!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase, it was worth every dime!</li>
            <li>The included dropper makes it easy to not over do it.  </li>
            <li>The product is extremely easy to use and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly and was well packaged well.</li>
            <li>I believe that is because it absorbs very quickly into my hair.  </li>
            <li>and they shi very quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and is none greasy.</li>
            <li>i also think its a great value because the same oil from josie maran costs a lot more.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to put a couple drops in your favorite moisturizer for an extra boost.</li>
            <li>Your hair can get greasy looking very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ised it at night for a week now and every morning I look in the mirror and am so surprised at how even the tone is and bright and healthy it looks.</li>
            <li>the smell is quite strong to my nose.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not to strong</li>
            <li>And the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all, I know some people don&#x27;t like it but trust me,</li>
            <li>Would love if provided some special discounts.</li>
            <li>and it left me feeling beautiful.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Argan Oil by my hairdresser, I really liked it</li>
            <li>.it also helps save the trees, that produce this wonderful product, from being cut down.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is extremely mild, which is more than fine.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair, but it seemed to  disappear into my fine, fine hair</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Poppy Austin Argan Oil, but I had such a wonderful experience I will continue to purchase from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li>I was fine with that while on vacation, we were at the beach and pool, so</li>
            <li>This is a fine Argan oil.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this particular brand of Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve liked competing argan oils better, but since this is half the price, I think that&#x27;s a fair trade.</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure argan oil, which is nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many oil products in a search to find one that works exactly like this one does!  </li>

            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>If it is in a clear or plastic bottle it will not be good.</li>
            <li>So far so good worked well on my hair</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I find this product is better and more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This product is far superior to anything I could find.</li>
            <li>Hoping it will work for me in the heat as well, but for now, so far so good.</li>

            <li>I was mostly worried about a greasy feel but it soaked right in with no problems.</li>
            <li>Most of the cleaners had some sort of salicylic acid treatment in them because I was trying to stick it to my acne - because acne hates salicylic acid, right?  </li>
            <li>I will get tiny bumps very easily if it doesn&#x27;t agree with the product, which is why I have tried many many products.</li>
            <li>The is a different formulation than I&#x27;ve used before, and it is very nice.</li>

            <li>Thank you for making such a good product, its worth every cent!!</li>
            <li>After VERY lightly misting my hair with water first, I then applied the oil.</li>
            <li>I love Poppy Austin&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>However, as it is this good, I am sure I will use it all long before then..</li>
            <li>However, as it is this good, I am sure I will use it all long before then.</li>
            <li>This product is a wonderful little Gem!  </li>
            <li>This bottle of 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil has been the single best purchase I&#x27;ve made all year!  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Argan Oil is my new favorite cosmetic!</li>
            <li>After restarting use of this oil, my face is now restoring back to its new great look!</li>
            <li>It had a really mild scent and left my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>(some Argan oil can have a less than lovely fragrance) and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>the fine print.&lt;br /&gt;The pure stuff is so much better...</li>
            <li>This essential oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted more than six months.</li>
            <li>I have been using this as a face moisturizer for about 2 months and was really excited.</li>
            <li>excellent quality, excellent price, works as well as any other, and more expensive oils.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive the argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a different brand of Argan Oil before, but this one is definitely a better deal and more potent.</li>
            <li>The smell does seem to fade significantly after wearing it for a while, but I just got grossed out every time I tried to put it on my face.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been very satisfied with the Argan oil I received.</li>
            <li>It may just be my hair (it&#x27;s already very healthy and soft, and shoulder length).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited yo continue use and see it helps over time.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency and best of all, no strange odor like other brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to buy from JM on home shopping</li>
            <li>Not as excited about it for use on hair.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, I can confidently go without make up.</li>
            <li>A small amount is all that is needed for excellent results.</li>
            <li>My skin looked very healthy and felt soft.</li>
            <li>(they both are in kindergarten and first grade), and they love it because I&#x27;d apply it to help with brushing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased the Oil to put in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am excited about using this product for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li>The best Argan oil, I&#x27;ve tried several brands, this one leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>To remedy the issues, I tried switching to gentler face washes, making sure to moisturize consistently, etc., and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>After the first day of use I noticed her curls looked much more defined and moisurized.</li>
            <li>I have very irritated patches in my scalp which feel fine and much better after applying this oil.  </li>
            <li>I consider this a great buy since it last for 2-3 months, perhaps even longer if your skin is more normal than mine!</li>
            <li>Finding Poppy Austin, and obviously the real thing as it is identical to the oil she brought from Morocco, is a very good thing.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every product out there, and the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is by far the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever had!  </li>
            <li>A really great product well worth the money, especially with all the care given into making</li>
            <li>Also great for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I can assure you my hair is damaged from years of perms, but the argan oil gives it a natural healthy sheen that makes me appear to have healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Also I have heard that it is great for dry feet and elbows also.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>But this product works great for frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you Poppy Austin for your truthful information and very informative and cheerful you tube on this oil.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, easily absorbed and virtually no scent.</li>
            <li>but I now just use one drop mixed with my gel and today is the most humid day of the summer at 100% humidity and my hair is not frizzy and looks nice and clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>At night, I&#x27;d clean with the cleansing oil and add 4 drops to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a mix of fish and manure, definitely does not smell pleasant like Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will see the positive results soon.</li>
            <li>And at 58 years old, she never looked better!</li>
            <li>So far I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few argon oil products before finding the right product and this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>This product does way more then you would expect, it offers your hair the perfect shine without weighing your hair down or making it greesy.</li>
            <li>This Pure Organic Argan Oil is a top notch product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THE FACT THat this oil is pure Argan.  </li>
            <li>For me, the 100% pure Argan oil is the most practical conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever found.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has only a very light pleasant fragrance, unlike many commercial products.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels amazing and a lot of my dryness issues are beginning to clear up.</li>
            <li>I started out with a pricey oil combination that I loved but was setting me back $60/oz.</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil so much that I have shared it with my mom and sister.</li>
            <li>Love it fast shipping</li>
            <li>It makes so much sense that 100% would be so much better.</li>
            <li>I can localize where to apply the oil based on need, and better control how much</li>
            <li>I also make my own skincare products from natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Love the argan oil, had spine surgery aND it took a toll on my whole body, skin and hair included.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it adds anything to the sweet almond oil I already use</li>
            <li>Good quality and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I cannot really explain it better then that.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, it feels different in a good way.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>MAKES ME FEEL GOOD TO GIVE BACK.</li>
            <li>and I still have a good amount left.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very well moisturized and has better color tone to it after using this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li>I love the fast shipping, I received it in about a week after ordering it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>She likes it so much we ordered 2 more</li>
            <li>sure you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was fast and the price was better than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I know that must seem too good to be true - but this time it actually is!</li>
            <li>I began noticing her hair was becoming more and more dry with the products I used to detangle and style.</li>
            <li>The consistency is rich (and works even in the hot and humid South!)</li>
            <li>so right now I am primarily using this product on my face before bed.</li>
            <li>Poppy Austin provided important upfront information about the harvesting and processing of their oils as well as conveniently placed batch numbers and bottling dates right on the label.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First impression: Despite the claims that this product is \\&quot;odourless\\&quot;, I did detect a very mild nutty fragrance when I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it over a few weeks and my skin is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>With just one use I have received so many compliments on my hair with this product, this is a new staple for me!  </li>
            <li>Love my new find!</li>
            <li>My hair was feeling like straw, yet after only a couple of uses my hair feels great, soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>skin feels tremendous after about a couple of weeks use</li>
            <li>I can wear this even during the day, as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy look or feel to my face.  </li>
            <li>It Is odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>sandalwood aftershave, which I dislike tremendously.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and with no fuss.  </li>
            <li>The oil is clear like canola oil instead of the nice golden hue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a mild smell that you will forget you have it on.</li>
            <li>is so mild</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily &amp; quickly with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>You officially now have a loyal customer. ^_^.</li>
            <li>I have seen a great difference in my hair since using this product, i would totally reccommend  it thanks a lot</li>
            <li>It Arrived quickly and matches the picture on amazon.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>so it absords quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>I would hope that this company would gladly replace the product if an older bottle inadvertently made it to customer.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and was to the quality described in the description.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so quickly into my hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell or anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, it arrived quickly and neatly packaged with no spills.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin quickly, and my face doesn’t feel greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep ordering Argan oil from Poppy Austin - it ships quickly and has an expiration date.  </li>
            <li>I love this as it leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; soft, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>sure enough, many people do.</li>
            <li>The oil is clear like canola oil instead of the nice golden hue</li>
            <li>So happy that Poppy Austin stays 100% natural because natural is the way to go in my book.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick service also.</li>
            <li>Was excited when I read the reviews and decided to order, once I recieved the oil I used it right away</li>
            <li>highly recommend Poppy Austin, it is Organic and most Argan Oil in the stores is not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34; I highly recommend this seller, as the customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li>, it absorbed too quick, so i decided to apply right after washing my face and a light application just before bed, which helped.</li>
            <li>My normal moisturizer (about $20 more than Argan Oil), I won&#x27;t mention the name, takes about 20 - 30 minutes before the greasy feeling goes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other oil products before and so far this meets my needs and expectations the best.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available at such a good price...  </li>
            <li>After the first application it turned smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>no unpleasant smell ..</li>
            <li>The oil also has a slightly musky / pleasant smell which I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for something that will make your hair gorgeous and your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying my new face skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought this would be a great product for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>The oil is light,  smooth as silk, subtlety fragrant and the best of all, with a soft massage, it totally disappears, leaving no residue or &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34;, just totally velvet skin.  </li>
            <li>This is in a glass bottle, dark so the light doesn&#x27;t penetrate (it&#x27;s a good thing).</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this oil is real.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is good for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>A couple of drops of this and my hair is shiny, healthy and without static, even in the desert of Arizona, all day long without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Luckily the smell goes away after it&#x27;s been absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the ease of the pump dispenser so it always ready to use easily.</li>
            <li>It has a neutral fragrance, pleasant enough, and seems to be as pure as the description states.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin that&#x27;s very fair and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making outstanding, affordable, and natural products!</li>
            <li>I got compliments on my hair and have purchased several more as gifts!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>only thing is that it has a kind of funny light smell that goes away after a while, or maybe I just get used to the smell.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll definitely go back &amp; order my argan oil, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>finally decided to shell out for Argan oil and am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Over all if you can&#x27;t tell I really, really like Poppy Austin Argan Oil and will continue to order it to use!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft and healthy skin!</li>
            <li>Fine for hair and skin but not so much for the face.</li>
            <li>They must be 100% Pure and Organic, and be Ecologically Certified and approved.   </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>To be honest, it has more body to it and takes a little longer to absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is 100% pure Argan Oil which was very important to me in ordering this particular brand.  </li>
            <li>This oil is amazing, i have used it on my face as a moisturizer and it wows my features enormously.</li>
            <li>I received the product  very promptly, and I enjoy using it every day.</li>
            <li>Seems very hydrating and light on the skin.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks great after a visit to my hairdresser, but after I shampoo it looks damaged with dead ends.</li>
            <li>The product is very hydrating and light weight.</li>
            <li>as an added bonus, I oiled my hair with this and not only does my scalp feel amazing</li>
            <li>Of course with the help of coconut oil but either way this argan oil Is amazing especially on the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li>Simplemente asombroso, puedes notar la diferencia al instante, it&#x27;s amazing, you can notice result instantly in your skin, soft and non greasy, love it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair to give it some much needed moisture, smooth it out, and add shine to it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this product available.</li>
            <li>I am grateful that the scent is light to non-existent, and I also appreciated that the product was well sealed and didn&#x27;t leak during shipping.</li>
            <li>Feels light and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped to make my hair silky smooth and my skin as well.</li>
            <li>It really is helping my facial skin look good without any additional product.  </li>
            <li>I have completely fallen in love with the Organic Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my face overnight and had really nice results the next day.  </li>
            <li>You can tell this product is worth its weight in gold and is of the highest quality to be found.  </li>
            <li>I love to know I&#x27;m putting a natural oil in my hair and</li>
            <li>made my hair soft, shiny, moist and more controllable and on my face its helped keep my acne at bay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter and I are thrilled and use the oil daily.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>Both my and my husband use it and like the way it feels and that it is absorbed so well that we don&#x27;t feel oily after using it.</li>
            <li>I cant say it was worth 26 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, light facial oil, but really hasn&#x27;t improved my skin.</li>
            <li>As far as a \\&quot;healing\\&quot; type product, using this on my feet for one week has made them look better</li>
            <li>This is worth having as a staple beauty product.</li>
            <li>I have researched how to tell genuine quality product since there are so many imitations and mixed products on the market now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Finally, something this is all natural and works great.</li>
            <li>Really worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>The product is absorbed by your hair and although I wouldn&#x27;t go out on the town while going through this process you won&#x27;t even realize you have a treatment in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Give it a chance too; trust me, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If they want to show 3 bottles it should be more clear that the price is for 1 bottle.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more thanks a lot :)</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a product that I could add to my bag of natural healing</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and hands, a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Hey, anything was worth a try by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a low-tech but for me highly effective basic.</li>
            <li>I switched to this after trying coconut oil, which I really liked, but it seemed to make my pores bigger.</li>
            <li>I use the &amp;#34;Finest Rose Water Facial Toner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; and finish with the Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price-</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I thought that it was too good to be true, but as my hair completely dried, it stayed full, not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I originally learned about Argan oil when Sephora gave me a large sample of Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>First and foremost the delivery came even faster than expected; so that was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer, leaves skin so soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li>After trying other Essential Oils I am convinced this product is one of the best ones I have used to date.  </li>
            <li>different(better), more like what it is, because the other brand smelled more like oil, just plan oil.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>They are supposed to have a mild nutty smell, but this one is pretty pungent.</li>
            <li>you apply a few drops and your skin absorbs it very nicely</li>
            <li>but this one is superior to the other.</li>
            <li>I placed the oil on the right side of my face in the morning, and again before I went to bed.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in with no after greasy feel or look.</li>
            <li>almost right away I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I put it on heavily right after a shower and put socks on right away.</li>
            <li>The consistency was just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right (compared to others out there) and it was also organic.</li>
            <li>Since it is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin right away</li>
            <li>I have never reviewed a product right after I have used one, but this one I had too.  </li>
            <li>right in, didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>I put it to the test right on the spot.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived in amber bottles with stoppers to help with dispensing the right amount.</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s on, it soaks right in and disappears.  </li>
            <li>and you feel right away that you are</li>
            <li>I started with another brand name of this oil, but noticed right away this one smelled</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the right amount to use on it yet.</li>
            <li>like it did me, I am positive it will!</li>
            <li>Makes skin look and feel so smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I normally have fine frizz prone hair and have tried Moroccan Oil and Living Proof products to control the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, especially considering the more than reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This is very pure, 100% Argan oil</li>
            <li>This product seems very pure to me.  </li>
            <li>Great for my dry heals on my feet, never been so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having read the reviews my next use for the oil is going to be to try it on my hair, and if it works even half as well as it did on my skin, I will be a very happy person.</li>
            <li>My dry, brittle, frizzy hair became soft, shiny, bouncy happy hair since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>when first applied but dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting that Argan oil seems to act to super charge products so that drug store products (I like Cetaphil) now work well enough</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use on barely moistened skin, wherever you put it.</li>
            <li>So I started adding a couple of drops to my usual moisturizer and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I have heard great things about Poppy Austin in the past</li>
            <li>After the hair is completely dried and styled, I put an even tinier amount on one finger tip, rub that in among all five finger tips and lightly touch to hair ends to smooth and then rake fingers through top of hair and bangs to add texture.</li>
            <li>Good product at an average price</li>
            <li>This would be an ideal everyday product for thick hair and is a good treatment for thinner hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the complaint with the scent is about, it has a nice organic very light scent</li>
            <li>I have such soft flowing hair and it is not greasy, it is very lightweight and very effective for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I did a extensive research on line to really know what I needed in order to get a genuine product I chose this brand, and so far I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will be a very good product for the cold months.  </li>
            <li>just Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li>Pure Argan!</li>
            <li>The product arrived right away and exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice leave-in at night to those dry ends</li>
            <li>My son used it on some dry spots, too, and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It is not a real heavy oil and seems to be absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this oil - it&#x27;s amazing how my hair just sucks it up, but there is no greasiness.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Poppy Austin, you can definitely tell the distinct difference between Poppy&#x27;s and Josie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped Super Fast</li>
            <li>My face really does feel smooth which allows my makeup to go on much easier</li>
            <li>The bottle was packeged very well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is much thicker to apply than my sweet almond oil I&#x27;ve been using which goes on the skin like silk, it also has a slightly funny smell, I wouldn&#x27;t say hot garbage, but theres nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I live in the south and the humidity normally gives me a lot of frizz on top.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this product arrived quickly and the bottle is very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, shipping with this seller was very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Got my product very fast.....</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for prompt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>I do like the Argan Oil very much.  </li>
            <li>It really helped my dry and tangle prone hair to look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 more bottles few minutes earlier but noticed that it is from another supplier as in Ipad didn&#x27;t know how to search for same supplier in amazon, but I need the product which works perfect not the seller ;)</li>
            <li>I also applied some of the oil to my Daughters hair this morning ( she has thick hair that knots easily) and her hair was so smooth and manageable after a minute or two and when she came home from school today, her hair was tangle free!</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful on face (little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>First time user&lt;br /&gt;Looked</li>
            <li>I feel it is misleading to show more than you will actually receive in the photo.</li>
            <li>This was the first Poppy Austin product I used.  </li>
            <li>This oil is the real deal!</li>
            <li>(the more chemicals, usually, the more my hair protests).  </li>
            <li>The first thing I decided to give it a try on was my hands.  </li>
            <li>As a person who normally uses organic coconut oil as an overall body moisturizer, I liked the idea of trying a lighter weight oil for two persistent problem areas: my elbows and the heels of my feet.  </li>
            <li>I first started using Argan oil because my sister-in-law (who is a hair stylist) recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li>My cheeks and face are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I had a rough patch of eczema on my hand that was catching on my clohthes, but after only one night of rubbing the oil on it, that spot is smooth!  </li>
            <li>I applied it to my arms at first just to test it out.</li>
            <li>First time I used this in my hair it made it silkier</li>
            <li>I love it as a face moisturizer alone or a carrier oil with an Essential oil(s) for perfume.</li>
            <li>At first I used this by itself, but found it too oily.  </li>
            <li>I probably should have exfoliated first.  </li>
            <li>really does the job!</li>
            <li>It gained some strength, and I can now style my short hair a bit more</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried it</li>
            <li>it absorbs pretty fast!), root to tip.</li>
            <li>have tried many different products that have not helped, and the oils I have tried have been so greasy I would have to put the oil on before bedtime and wear a long-sleeve shirt</li>
            <li>I recently visited with family that I had not seen for many years.  </li>
            <li>It is first time I use argan oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely purchase this product again! :)</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s exactly what happened to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair care products with Argan oil since about 2010 when I was first introduced to a conditioner with Argan oil by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(I know it&#x27;s not advertised as such but my vet said it seemed okay to him.)</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the $$ to stop the chemical contamination and support companies who are committed to fair trade and sustainability.</li>
            <li>I did get a first time buyer discount from Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li>Its really helping my hair!</li>
            <li>I could tell after the first use the change in my hair.</li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks my skin feels so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>exactly* like kalamata olives, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write more later after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li>The Poppy Austin brand moisturizers just as well as my &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product at a much more afordable price in a bigger bottle too.</li>
            <li>gonna keep coming back because I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle of Poppy Austin about 8 months ago, used it up,&lt;br /&gt;then</li>
            <li>first time trying argan oil</li>
            <li>When I put it in my hair it gives it much more volume and overall</li>
            <li>So it should smell nutty if its 100% real!</li>
            <li>I love it, my skin loves it, and I will definitely continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li>WILL BE BACK FOR MORE ITEMS.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The first word that comes to mind when using this product.  </li>
            <li>The package came intact, the glass bottle (which is the only way to bottle this oil) was wrapped in protective wrap and arrived safely.</li>
            <li>Product sealed and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Sketchy at first glance</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I ordered this product... but had heard that it is an awesome moisturizer for your face...  </li>
            <li>I love it especially on my face.</li>
            <li>I love the way it softens my skin and lays the foundation for my daily moisterizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to deal with my hair, and it always made me feel as if my hair is not that pretty.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel soft and smooth and soaked</li>
            <li>First of all it</li>
            <li>This oil did exactly what they said it can do.  </li>
            <li>At first I was using it on my thirsty skin 2 or 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li>Only using the one drop as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Any more than</li>
            <li>My skin sometimes bumps up and gets rough from the littlest things, and this was a nice relief.</li>
            <li>I also love that they give back to the womens cooperatives in Morocco.</li>
            <li>I think this is my go-to for soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>As a first time user/buyer of argan oil</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and smooth after hear styling.</li>
            <li>I was delivered a product that states exactly what it really is 100% argan oil!  </li>
            <li>First off, I have not tried it yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many traditional hair products and wished I had purchased this sooner.</li>
            <li>Josie maran Argan oil would be my first choice.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommended!</li>
            <li>I also realized my hair wasn&#x27;t feel silky smooth or soft</li>
            <li>and it did exactly what my morracon oil does for my hair.</li>
            <li>The improvement in my hair texture and shine was evident from the first applications.</li>
            <li>First rate product.</li>
            <li>but this oil left the skin feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li>Purchased the first bottle for my wife after reading up on the oil.  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase from Poppy Austin and the oil is not greasy feeling but silky to touch.</li>
            <li>First off, I think everyone should pay attention to the &#x27;foul smell&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li>So poppy austin should explain the reason for clear (cheap, canola like) oil color. .... ??</li>
            <li>Highly recommended Poppy Austin Argan oil!!  </li>
            <li>Hey if it works, I&#x27;m willing to be friends with any smell.</li>
            <li>lather my whole body in this stuff but with 2 oz!</li>
            <li>I know it is a rip off and that I am paying for the brand, but i think it would cost more to ship it back....</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE FROM POPPYAUSTIN</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>My wife likes the oil and it makes her skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Josie Maran does something to the oil that takes away most of its smell, but that&#x27;s the only brand of Argan Oil</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and am excited to try other products by Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s freshness and purity and will make it part of my daily beauty routine for face, skin and nails.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Poppy Austin Argan Oil for Hair!!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as described which is why I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.  </li>
            <li>face and body, I use more Argan oil (several drops in palm).</li>
            <li>The price is right, I know how much pure organic oils can be.  </li>
            <li>It really brings out the highlights!  </li>
            <li>I imagine I&#x27;ll appreciate it even more next winter when I&#x27;m running the heater</li>
            <li>I love them, I&#x27;m thinking of ordering additional product&#x27;s in the future from them</li>
            <li>Thanks poppy Austin!</li>
            <li>If you are remotely interested in argan oil and its benefits, this is the product to try.</li>
            <li>However, on the hair it&#x27;s been nothing short of phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I have been using the oil for a few days now and am amazed at how good this product is.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are dramatically less, but the thing that I have loved is that my face looks much smoother.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>I am happy I heard about it and tried it because the difference is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>and after about a week of constant use, my skin looks just great, not one single \\&quot;pimple\\&quot; has shown itself.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable when usually it is dry &amp; brittle; My skin which is combination between dry &amp; oily is now almost flawless</li>
            <li>Anyone reading this should sence this for themselves, so if you are able to, obtain this PURE ARGAN OIL, and learn how to use it for your specific needs, and you will be blessed.</li>
            <li>Smooth a little on my ends to give them a more polished finish.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is I can add a bit to other lotions too</li>
            <li>I only need to use a few drops so this is a very good &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>that you are getting a high quality product when you purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Poppy Austin&#x27;s site and was excited to see that it not only helped with mild acne but eczema as well.</li>
            <li>Now I use about 3 drops max with wet hands and rub it on my face and the breakouts stopped and my skin is bright and soft.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product is just as good as the most expensive argan oil sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, I only used 3 drops and that seemed to be a good amount for me.</li>
            <li>Poppy&#x27;s is a golden liquid with a slight nutty scent that I think smells so good whereas Josie&#x27;s is clear and smelled like cooking oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product so far after a few days application.</li>
            <li>It came as pure product which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know much about it, but it does absorb very fast.</li>
            <li>It brushed through my long hair just marvelously, and the ends dried just as smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind</li>
            <li>At first it just did not rub around well, however I found out that if I wet my face and put a drop on my wet forehead, top of each cheek, nose and chin - then rubbed it around, it spread nicely.</li>
            <li>I first opened the bottle I was very put off by the smell, but when it&#x27;s actually on my skin it is a much warmer and more bearable scent</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised that the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; of argan oil wasn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;pretty smelling&amp;#34;, so I was very pleased that the odor went away quickly  -- and believe meI know, because I rub this on my face every night.  </li>
            <li>I really felt difference on my skin the first time I tried.</li>
            <li>This was the first Argan oilI tried, but it seems to have a reasonable price for the purity, and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I love that the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is cruelty-free, organic and doesn&#x27;t have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients that I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used to much oil and didn&#x27;t like the way it worked...</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li>I use it for pretty much anything.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Far superior in every way to other so called Argan oils.</li>
            <li>It really does make your skin feel soft and CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the Josie Maran brand from Sephora to try, however, after watching Poppy Austin&#x27;s videos of what pure argan oil really is I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li>And it’s also great to bring my hair back to life after using many different harsh products and blow drying.</li>
            <li>When I bought this, right on the 2nd day I received a very touchy email from the seller very polity asking for a review stating its important for them.</li>
            <li>first 1 oz bottle lasted me about 6 months, so I expect this 2 oz bottle to last about a year, used primarily on my face.</li>
            <li>I needed something easy to put on and would actually work.</li>
            <li>I am using it on a recent surgical scar and the oil is keeping it supple so that I can bend my knee easily.  </li>
            <li>I love to put this in my hair for dry hair relief.</li>
            <li>/&gt;makeup or am I pregnant because my face is so clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>and my hair is dry from so many hair dyes.</li>
            <li>I seriously have never had good skin and Tried so many different creams</li>
            <li>Easy to mix into my night cream for extra moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>With this product I am now able to use my dandruff shampoo and apply the oil to eliminate the dry irritated parts.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is more dry at times than oily.</li>
            <li>I love how it is improving my dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>My diet is rich in organic veggies, fish etc 75% of the time and is less than perfect the other quarter, but I have yet to break out using this product and have been using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li>I have that doesn&#x27;t have a strong nut smell (I have purchased 2 bottles and both exhibit the same smell and absorption characteristics.)</li>
            <li>Then I found Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil which is 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure Argon Oil and processed in the USA.  </li>
            <li>Compare product labels - this is 100% pure Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I asked her what she uses and she told me 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>my hands, I use pure lanolin.</li>
            <li>Will certainly order again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I use on my face in certain areas, elbows, nails....</li>
            <li>Lets be transparent- after buying josie marans 100% pure organic argan oil...</li>
            <li>So searched for a pure product online and found Poppy on youtube.  </li>
            <li>this product is pure .</li>
            <li>Totally pure product that seems to have nothing added.</li>
            <li>But I learned that it is not as pure as Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil for Hair and Skin, so</li>
            <li>This is pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>One exemption though it does not have the seal of authenticity that it must heve to be certified as % pure.</li>
            <li>IT IS 100% PURE.</li>
            <li>Example: Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl.</li>
            <li>so I appreciate that it&#x27;s a pure oil with no chemicals or gluten.  </li>
            <li>I waited about a month to leave a review to see how it got along with my skin around the time of my period, and it has certainly passed the test.</li>
            <li>It is a pure Argan Oil, but it is not greasy on your face.</li>
            <li>From just a few days of use I found my ends looking so much better!</li>
            <li>I see they have a new one that has a better price point which I&#x27;ll try next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has always been sensitive to new products, but the moment I started using this Poppy Austin Argon Oil, my skin has been smooth, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and didn&#x27;t get super greasy like you would expect from putting straight oil on your face.</li>
            <li>Such a good value and my cuticles and feet are no longer dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, you cannot buy a child&#x27;s confidence, but by investing in Poppy Austin, we&#x27;ve sure put down a healthy deposit on his future.  </li>
            <li>I have used other oils in the past and have to say this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>My fine lines on my forehead are starting to fade and the redness on my cheeks is almost gone!  </li>
            <li>After washing my face with warm water and drying it off, I applied the Argan Oil to it by rubbing a little in.</li>
            <li>I am a very big fan of Poppy Austin now that I have my 100% pure argan oil, my hair is liking fabulous, I put this on my face, my body,</li>
            <li>I have ordered two lanolin products from Amazon and been happy with both, but one is no longer available and the other used to come in a four pack but is now only sold singly, and it&#x27;s pricey and has shipping costs.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful that this product was available or I would be wearing a hat right now to cover my dry, brittle hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to argan oil last year after watching a presentation on TV by Josie M, and bought a huge 6 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>Does help frizzy hair, but don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
            <li>Got it really fast</li>
            <li>The oil stays with you much longer, is thicker, and doesn&#x27;t smell of fragrances that have been added.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast and no damages.</li>
            <li>Capable of treating damaged skin and acne&lt;</li>
            <li>Capable of repairing damaged nails&lt;</li>
            <li>I really feel like</li>
            <li>I do need to try it though because my hair stylist claims that argan oil really helped her hair when she overprocessed it.</li>
            <li>I towel-dried my hair and gently worked fingertip-sized portions over some of my problems areas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dispensed with a dropper so you control how much you want to use and where you&#x27;d like it to be placed.</li>
            <li>The lighter weight and fast absorption keeps my feet from sliding around in my shoes and my elbows from sliding across my desk at work.</li>
            <li>It also arrived very promptly after I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it for a reasonable price and also specials if you purchase two items.</li>
            <li>Really, this is not an issue.  </li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair.</li>
            <li>the real stuff has.</li>
            <li>Also, I could not believe how fast the product got to me.  </li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li>It is hydrating and gentle on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for what you do in helping others</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I like the dropper applicator as well, which keeps you from getting too much oil on your hands or hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product ladies, and the trio together works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>my next fabulous treat.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Having grown up in sun and from a time when we did not know how much damage the sun could cause I have what we call leathery</li>
            <li>and my feet felt so much nicer than they did yesterday.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and have a very heightened sense of smell, then you&#x27;ll notice the foul odor coming from this oil.</li>
            <li>really did&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with Poppy Austin since it was reasonable and where I&#x27;d learned the info.</li>
            <li>It is really all you need as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and I use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>THANKS POPPY AUSTIN</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I can spread it out evenly very well..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work like the real oil .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li>It has really helped my skin.  </li>
            <li>be carful not to use too much or else</li>
            <li>I checked around &amp; this is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>oil is not deodorized, but it does contain a very foul scent.</li>
            <li>Bought this twice and ready to buy again.</li>
            <li>No worries about pouring out too much, just a drop or two will do for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it for my skin, my hair after the shower and notice how much fuller it is reducing split ends giving your haircut a longer life.</li>
            <li>Really helps sun damage.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is also very versatile.  </li>
            <li>It came in a glass tinted bottle which I really appreciated for purity and to keep it from degrading.</li>
            <li>the Keratin treatment and this combined makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about a month or so and don&#x27;t really see any changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Found Poppy Austin on youtube w/a very informative video about Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my face really responds.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t really have any odor and 2-3 drops</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it absorbs so well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for running specials.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I  really wanted to like this, since it&#x27;s an affordable Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really made the difference this winter with my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I am really liking it.</li>
            <li>It is completely absorbed within about 15 minutes and my face is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Nothing was included to prove it is real</li>
            <li>It does not even absorb into my skin like real argan oil does.</li>
            <li>I will use this for oil scalp massages here really soon.</li>
            <li>Santa clause is real too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li>I told my Doctor about it yesterday and she told me my face looks much healthier.  </li>
            <li>that is too much for my hair (I rub it through AFTER putting on face and neck).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>put a drop in the palm of my hand and rub my hands together and gently pat over face and neck, then rub gently in.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li>You know you are getting the real thing</li>
            <li>shipping was fast .and</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend and purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I would had thought twice about paying so much for just 1 bottle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Plus, delivery  was fast and my product was well protected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very greasy like I&#x27;ve put veggie oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>It is very hydrating to my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>You can certanly purchase chemicals in a bottle for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the real stuff has.</li>
            <li>Bottom line try another brand that&#x27;s organic and cold pressed, Savannah&#x27;s was the best imo</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
            <li>The care in producing the oil is appreciated.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>i tried this product and didn&#x27;t really see any effects for what it is suppose to do for your hair.</li>
            <li>My wife and I were starting to get genuinely concerned about our son.  </li>
            <li>I have got very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working very well, and I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My skin was left smooth and did not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it daily for a week now, and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Poppy Austin argan oil!</li>
            <li>I also like the batch number information posted on bottle, so you know you are getting real Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>This really is the oil of gold.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommed this to anyone, with any skin issue, please don&#x27;t be scared to put this oil on your face!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the only thing I can say is that this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had in my life and at a much higher frequency than normal</li>
            <li>It also has added a very gleaming shine to my beard, and is very manageable now, as well as the hair on my head.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>The trick is finding how much to use and when.</li>
            <li>I chose the 5 star rating because my skin absolutely loves this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>did research and went with this brand because they really explained stuff, on youtube and on their website, about the oil, that others did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can tell,  I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on the type of skin you have.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so much easier to maintain.  </li>
            <li>She has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>As gentle as I was before, and with all the detangler i used, it still pulled.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and as advertised</li>
            <li>The anti-itch and anti-inflamitory properties help them heal up really quick.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I will buy more when my supply is empty.</li>
            <li>: Don&#x27;t use too much at one time, your hair WILL look greasy.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands of Argan oil and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>But I am enjoying the simplicity of my routine and there is something to be said for using a basic, natural product instead of a lotion with lots of unpronounceable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It only takes 5 or 6 drops to moisturize my skin, and it works far better than my L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, keeps skin hydrated, and has a subtle, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>far as Argan Oil goes...........compared to the other &amp;#34;famous&amp;#34; brand; you cannot get much better than this!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful on my face and hair, too!  </li>
            <li>Work carefully, and preferably with a good bristle brush that works properly with your hair.</li>
            <li>I apply a few drops to my fingers rub them to warm the oil and apply.</li>
            <li>Quite clear, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>We both love the Poppy Austin Pure Argan Oil and now I am ready to try some of there other products.</li>
            <li>A little goes a very long way, so the price is definitely worth it; and as most people say, it is very lightweight and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>That is how they look so young!!!  </li>
            <li>It soaks right into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I confess that, I’ve tried other brands that claims the similar purity and that didn’t turn out as good as I was hoping for then.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid user of all natural health and beauty products, yet find that in many instances they do not live up to their claim, however this product exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with it&#x27;s cosmetic uses until recently, nor that it could help my achy pains</li>
            <li>It does help the dryness on my arms and legs, but so do many other lotions and creams for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I must have applied more to one side because it was extremely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Next day, no signs of a pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for a facial skin moisturizer</li>
            <li>I also want to add that like many other products,  They may have a scent that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I originally was looking for coconut oil for a facial moisturizer when I stumbled across a reviewer on another site</li>
            <li>There are some other bottles of Argan oil on Amazon that have better prices.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless I will keep buying it from Poppy Austin as they charge a decent price for a decent size bottle!</li>
            <li>But, since purchasing and trying Poppy Austin&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil, I&#x27;m excited to say that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and adds just enough shine to intensify the healthiness in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried argan oil before from other brands and believe that this oil definitely achieves what I was looking for in my search for the best argan oil, plus more:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have been doing lots and lots of research on Argan oil and this is hands down the most pure I have found.</li>
            <li>Autumn was coming, my favorite time of year, and I wanted one last shot to let my hair down and enjoy myself.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how CLEAN this product feels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, even though it may smell a bit weird at first.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d put oil on my hair...but a few drops does a wonderful job of fluffing, shining and defining my slightly dry blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I have used similar types of product (although most are not 100% pure) and have had minimal success.</li>
            <li>(By the way, I love the way my hair looks when my stylist uses a Moroccan oil product with silicone for the sheen it adds, but I find it is terribly difficult to wash out the residue which tends to weigh the hair down for a week following the first delightful effects of the application).  </li>
            <li>I was worried it would weigh my hair down or make it oily, but if I use it when my hair is damp it dries nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the real benefits of it , but so far I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks far better than it has in a long time!</li>
            <li>Amazing, I live in Florida and the humidity here kills your hair and makes you look dead but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m putting on my skin right now...highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Also a little back ground on my skin, I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and this argan oil works great</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone looking for a high quality, pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes use the argan oil to smooth my hair and take the frizz out (when it&#x27;s dry) and it works very well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair - I have short hair, about collarbone length, and I rub three drops of oil into my hands and then quickly apply it to my hair (so it doesn&#x27;t soak too much into my hands -</li>
            <li>As well, if you are dry, your skin will naturally produce more oil.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle and seems to be absorbed by the skin rather quickly compared to other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This oil works perfectly fine with damp or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Use it on wet skin (before you towel off after a shower) then towel as usual and your skin will feel like skin again -- skin on a good day!</li>
            <li>Easy to order and gr8 for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>I am a 60+ yo male with thinning gray hair that was somewhat brittle and full of split or unruly ends.</li>
            <li>I will return at a later date to give a full review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to finally have found something that really keeps my skin nourished and moisturized &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; and I definitely recommend it to others to give it a try!</li>
            <li>Poppy Austin obviously takes pride in their line and delivers true argan oil.</li>
            <li>It works similarly, makes my hair soft and smooth, but you have to be mindful of how much you use.  </li>
            <li>It is concentrated, so please be conscious when you try it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with Argan Oil was with Josie Moran and I was surprised with how well it worked on my already oily</li>
            <li>I bought more expensive brand last time and this is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>first product to make my hands feel soft</li>
            <li>Before bedtime, it was a little scarey applying &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;  to my face after I washed it clean, but the oil absorbed into my skin quickly leaving a smooth and more radiant looking complexion.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hands from working with paper all day and they are so dry and rough, I&#x27;ve used this product every day, and my hands feel amazing!!</li>
            <li>And now I cant live without my Argan oil!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I value pure, safe products with limited or no chemical processing.  </li>
            <li>I use less in the summer, since the air is more humid, but I put it on my hands and lips and use it as a hair treatment.</li>
            <li>Received shipment in less than 48 hours--that is better than I could ever hope for.  </li>
            <li>I then checked out several argon oils and found that all of them were not the same, many were diluted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be ordering more bottles, especially since I finally did try it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Found on Amazon of course, and at decent price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been a regular user of Josie Maran for a good few years</li>
            <li>Light, unscented (key for me) and absorbs in just a moment.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I only had a couple of bumps, but since they cleared up so quickly, I would think if someone had a lot of acne, it would work just as well.  </li>
            <li>feels better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, even the most expensive cream...</li>
            <li>and back I use more since its a larger area.  </li>
            <li>My facial skin is super supple and hydrated as well.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my face</li>
            <li>Argan oil is most effective when it is not mixed with other products and chemicals and packaged in a dark bottle.</li>
            <li>It sealed in the moisture, added shine and definition, eliminated ANY frizz, and really brought out my natural curl pattern!</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to grease and smell and this product is neither greasy or smelly!</li>
            <li>My beard is about 12 inches long now and still growing, and the Argan oil has significantly increased the health and thickness, fullness, and ultra softness of my beard.</li>
            <li>I used it right away on my wind and sun tortured hands and it really helped immediately and later.</li>
            <li>The argan oil from Poppy Austin is perfect for smoothing the ends of the layers, and can be applied lightly to smooth overall frizziness, without looking greasy or feeling heavy (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>It is a high quality oil</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>- then I HIGHLY Recommend Poppy Austin&#x27;s Products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have the driest processed hair and dry skin, The product really make my hair soft and skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and it was listed as one of the popular uses, so I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, and it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- Natural, organic and pure</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure and it makes my hair and face feel so silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>If I give it some soak in-time, I can use a little foundation over top.  </li>
            <li>Just got this little bottle of Argan Oil yesterday, and I am already in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Hair - wow!!  </li>
            <li>it and can see it vital to skin replenishing care!!</li>
            <li>love the little dropper that is provided in the glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I am still hoping to find something to help with the breakouts a little bit more.</li>
            <li>It is for sure what helped bring my skin back to its original state--if not better.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and my normally dry hands are soft again.  </li>
            <li>I use argan oil as a general moisturizer as well as for my face and hair, and while this brand is probably fine for the latter two uses, it just won&#x27;t do for the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li>Very good when one has a cold and a tissue-sore nose.  </li>
            <li>I put a little extra on my ends and the very top of my head.  </li>
            <li>It is a very high quality that absorbs completely into my hair, which leaves it thoroughly moisturized</li>
            <li>This combo really did the trick and though I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed it, being a lotion snob, I&#x27;m a complete convert.</li>
            <li>The oil did not have any type of weird odor to it at all which was great</li>
            <li>I should state that I naturally have very oily skin, but I use it on my face after I have showered to replace some of the oil.</li>
            <li>No real smell, just a light oil smell in the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great oil and not too too expensive.</li>
            <li>also, just mix 1-2 drops in your normal styling product</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily scalp but frizzy split ends.  </li>
            <li>After I shower (shampoo and condition like normal)</li>
            <li>I saw improvement in my laugh lines on the second day of use.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and trying to find something that actually works and isn&#x27;t full of chemicals rare.</li>
            <li>I have used a few drops on my hair before drying and truthfully, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking for there, but I bought it for the skin</li>
            <li>I was finally able to clear out my medicine cabinet and get rid of numerous bottles of hair toner, facial moisturizer, and wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bit of oil on my hair before straightening it and found my hair stays soft and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>I also put a few drops on the ends of my hair and it makes the ends look healthy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, but it seems to have completely cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>I normally use Jose Moran&#x27;s Argon Oil and saw this and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write a review etc.</li>
            <li>Okay, it didn&#x27;t clear all of his acne up in a fortnight, but the difference in such a short time frame was remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal skin, but with a somewhat oily t-zone.</li>
            <li>The only warning I have is to be aware of how much you are using.</li>
            <li>For my hair, which is almost down to my chest and relatively thick, I use three drops for my whole head and then apply just a bit more to the area closest to my face where I can see the most heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this oil absorbed into my skin and healed some rough red patches on my fingers and elbows very quickly.</li>
            <li>May not look different, but there are significantly less effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing less brown spots on my skin where I use Poppy Austin Argan Oil and my skin feels considerably more soft.  </li>
            <li>Love the waves and curls, just needed to tame them to a manageable shape and style.</li>
            <li>you, I am only a week into using my Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan oil, but I can&#x27;t say enough how quickly I noticed the positive changes.</li>
            <li>you, I am only a week into using my Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan oil, but I can&#x27;t say enough how quickly I noticed the positive changes.</li>
            <li>It instantly made my skin super soft and cleared my face completely in like 3 days!</li>
            <li>I have been using josie maran&#x27;s argan oil for years yet wanted to look for an equally pure and organic argan oil that will work just as good but wont be as expensive.</li>
            <li>It certainly added shine to the surface area of my hair when I added a few drops to my hands and applied it with the palms of my hand to smooth the flyaway ends.  </li>
            <li>I then started using all of their other fabulous products.</li>
            <li>Other than the smell, this was a fantastic Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I would feel envious of other women&#x27;s hair that looked so smooth and shiny,</li>
            <li>I decided to make my own concoction and started with argan oil mixed with a little rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have a new baby</li>
            <li>and I seem to keep finding new uses for it.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona now</li>
            <li>I live at altitude</li>
            <li>I just made a new order for another two bottles.</li>
            <li>LIVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>but I can live with the dropper.</li>
            <li>Live the purity of this&lt;br /&gt;argan oil.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without my Argan Oil from Poppy</li>
            <li>WOW, this oil is amazing to say the least.  </li>
            <li>It;s a lovey base for my light application of makeup and it makes a great night treatment.</li>
            <li>Intended to use it primarily as a facial moisturizer but find I am equally pleased with it on my hair &amp; cuticles as well as the rough skin areas of my feet.  </li>
            <li>My main purpose in ordering these products was to have a natural organic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, one thing thought i think it works too well because it kinda got my hair color back to almost my natural color, kinda odd but nice for me</li>
            <li>It seems ironic that oil would clear skin up, but I think it is the purity of what you are putting on your skin that makes the difference, along with the quality, and vitamins/antioxidants naturally within the product.  </li>
            <li>Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff, and having spent more than $3,500 on cosmetics this year alone</li>
            <li>For the last several months, I have honestly worn my hair up every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After cleaning my face for the evening I apply a couple of pure Argan oil drops to my face, then add my pure emu oil over than, and finally apply a natural herbal cream moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of girl who has tried COUNTLESS of amours of different brands ranging from chemical products (basically in all beauty facial cleansers/serums/moisturizers now&lt;br /&gt;W), to topicals recommended by a dermatologist, I&#x27;ve tried many brands high end</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Calmed the frizzies and made my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is course and heat damaged from my regular blow drying and hot iron habits, and I needed something that would be light enough, help with heat protection, and LAST--</li>
            <li>have to say that I was hesitant to use it on my skin to begin with, as I am VERY sensitive to things on it</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy, and with a very soft scent.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my face and neck, and chest area feel very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it worked really well for my consistently irritated and dry skin.</li>
            <li>first, I simply applied it to my cheek, my elbow,</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone especially since you have so many different options of using it!!!</li>
            <li>I first got the Argan Oil, I put it on my left arm so that I could check to see if it was working and</li>
            <li>and I must say I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly gotten used to it, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Using this product makes your skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair sticky instead of soft! .</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that there are fewer fine lines around my eyes and my skin texture appears finer, the pores less visible.</li>
            <li>I noticed a BIG difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>it is even argan oil because it smells exactly like rancid Kalamata olives, plus I am not seeing the same results.  </li>
            <li>I usually bought Josie Maran Argan Oil but for the 1.7oz from Sephora for $48.00 &amp; I was so pleased with the brand &amp; the product, that it is my go to brand from now on.</li>
            <li>None so far!</li>
            <li>This has helped her skin during this time better than the hydrocortisone that she usually has to use.</li>
            <li>So overall, this product is just a miracle moisturizer and has many other uses.</li>
            <li>I normally use this as a skin care product and can&#x27;t even put it near my face.</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell more like Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;m trying it on just one arm daily and another product on the other arm to see if I can tell any difference</li>
            <li>How I first used it is different how I use it now</li>
            <li>What can I say other then I love this stuff and have ordered several bottles over the year.</li>
            <li>She used the first bottle and it lasted several months.  </li>
            <li>Ordered first the smaller bottle, fell in love and just received the big bottle for daily use (saving the smaller as a travel bottle - it lasts 30 months, so no worries it will change composition or effectiveness.)  </li>
            <li>Instead, after using argan oil twice a day for two weeks, my pores have nearly disappeared and I haven&#x27;t had acne yet!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Makes me naturally glow!</li>
            <li>Light oil packaged in dark brown glass bottle.</li>
            <li>first night I used it I woke up the next day</li>
            <li>Tames the frizz from my natural curl!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my hair rather than my skin, as I add a half dropper-full amount into my developer when I bleached my hair in hopes that I could reduce the damage to my processed, fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I was introduced to it was in a big box cosmetic store</li>
            <li>love how it made my hair feel, i placed it on towel dry hair and let it dry naturally to a very soft touch</li>
            <li>It works on my hair, but be aware that if you use too much on your hair, you hair will become very oily, and weighted down.</li>
            <li>My breakouts slowed down, my skin cleared up, it is so moisturizing and so smooth and applies effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin is dry, it makes me uneasy to think of adding pure oil to it, but since I&#x27;ve tried this Pure Argan Oil, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li>AND the best part is a little goes a long way, for my eyes I only need about half a drop and for my face about 3 drops, if I use it on my neck then maybe 4 drops.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and between the humidity where I live and the blow dryer, etc that I use, my hair often has a frizzy or brittle look around the ends.</li>
            <li>- I am really old (79 yrs) and I still live in hope that I can help fight the aging battle.  </li>
            <li>This oil works wonder specially on my hair, I put small amount on my hair and sculp before I dry my hair and my hair haven&#x27;t felt this nice for a really really long time.</li>
            <li>My nails have greatly improved over the past few months since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but a decent face moisturizer works just as well and is less hassle.</li>
            <li>I mixed several droppers full of oil with water in a 3 oz spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like heavy oils or strong fragrances, and this oil is neither...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally perfect as a moisturizer, without a bunch of chemicals that may have weird side-effects down the road.</li>
            <li>Organic, less expensive than the famous brand and perhaps even better!</li>
            <li>Where I live the weather is changing already and my skin is getting dry and with just a few times using this my skin is soft and healing up nicely.</li>
            <li>My face has seemed to even out with it&#x27;s color too, in fact I am very pale and it seems like I have a bit more color in my face.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and with so little going such a long way, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Pricing was very reasonable and much cheaper that other brands.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, like all the other bottles of Argan oil that I have purchased, so the smell goes away pretty quickly and it absorbs at the same rate as the other bottles.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure, especially for those who have such dry skin like myself.</li>
            <li>Well, I decided to try this specific one out because it&#x27;s 100% pure organic and EcoCert approved</li>
            <li>&quot; facial skin and this oil does not clog my large pores or leave my complexion greasy.  </li>
            <li>After I purchased this 100% pure product, I did some local shopping to see what I could find in comparison.</li>
            <li>I saw this was on sale by ten dollars and saw a picture of a large bottle with no size besides \\&quot;shipping weight is 4.8 oz\\&quot;</li>
            <li>which isn&#x27;t even high compared to medium to high end creams and serums that give similar results</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good packaging and the oil does lovely things to my very dry skin in this very cold weather.</li>
            <li>but I am sensitive to cents and the Moroccan Oil not only is not pure but has a strong cent</li>
            <li>I also use a little bit on my hair to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>WELL I USE IT ON MY FACE AND HANDS AND SMOOTH A LITTLE ON MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>It sits on top of my skin and stays wet and oily until you just have to wipe it off, and my skin was still very dry after a couple days of using it.</li>
            <li>Without exception, no other company or individual is licensed to sale, replicate, reproduce, or manufacture any Poppy Austin branded product.&amp;#34; I am considering to buy but decided to check on poppyaustin.com first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the big name brand before, this is as good if not better!!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have tried this highly recommended oil - I was always a bit skeptical of the claims - and I am so glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and my hair seems to stay nice as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>fact that Poppy Austin® only uses oil made by local Moroccan woman, to help support a fair wage, for their hard work, makes this the product to go to.&lt;br /&gt;Know</li>
            <li>I have been using every night after cleansing my face and found it to make my face smoother and my complexion has remained clear.</li>
            <li>My skin felt and stayed so soft the whole entire day!</li>
            <li>I have used it on my hands and body and it softened my rough hands immediately and left them smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hope was that these products would help clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I use us 3&#x3D;4 times daily and can really see changes in my face.  </li>
            <li>Smells natural.</li>
            <li>I got it from a highly-revered natural foods store, so didn&#x27;t even question the product.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using it ever sense I am 86 years old and</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, goes lightly onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair.  </li>
            <li>which is something I look for as an extra assurance that it is real, diluted argan oil.</li>
            <li>Then they felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs in almost immediately leaving soft waves and manageable soft to the touch hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my hair for 7-10 days, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>now use it daily on both my elbows and feet straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>I use a few drops after blowing out my hair, and the oil leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on my color-treated hair....extremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I received the Poppy Austin oil 2 days early as well.</li>
            <li>It has made my face so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was weary about purchasing yet another product to help keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s natural too.</li>
            <li>I swim nearly 3 times a week, and the chlorine destroys my hair.</li>
            <li>And for use on sensitive skin like mine, I rate it with the highest mark.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets really frizzy, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li>After a week of using this oil the dryness around my nose was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put an extra drop on my palm and use a finger to gently dab a bit directly onto the blemish/spot (letting it sink in naturally rather than rubbing it in).</li>
            <li>Works fantastic underneath makeup (I like to wait a few minutes to let the skin soak it up before applying makeup)</li>
            <li>and she went into this really lengthy description about where it comes from, all the different ways you can use it etc etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to mix with Castor Oil for a mixture in clearing up, and to keep clear of adult acne.  </li>
            <li>So far working well on my natural hair and keeps my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil controls the frizz and keeps my hair soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>There is no greasiness and my hair is soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily since and really like it.  </li>
            <li>A couple of drops is enough for your whole face.  </li>
            <li>My skin wasn\\&quot;t as smooth as it was a few years ago.</li>
            <li>It was soft and didn&#x27;t look damaged.</li>
            <li>While my favorite use for this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin will be for my hair, I have to start out by saying that I&#x27;m amazed at how well a few drops of this oil will keep my hands, knees, and elbows soft for an entire day!</li>
            <li>was looking for a solution to help replenish my hair and return some of it&#x27;s natural strength and shine to the ends.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>I know that argan oil supposedly has a nutty scent to it, but this is far from that.</li>
            <li>However,  since is a natural product it does take time getting used to it.</li>
            <li>Poppy offers a discount too that you can apply on Amazon)-</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair moist and soft, without a greasy build up.  </li>
            <li>all things natural.</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old.</li>
            <li>My friend (a different one) REALLY noticed a difference to her sun/wind damaged skin and asked about buying a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
            <li>It feels like it does when I get it professionally done at the salon.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and  manageable.</li>
            <li>I can put this oil directly on my face and there are no issues.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and moisturizes my curls.</li>
            <li>I got mine early this spring...</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>You rub it in and within minutes you have soft skin, but not with an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No doubt about that because this a 100% natural product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it to my children-- teenagers and young adults-- to start using now.</li>
            <li>The issue with spraying it in my hair is it made it look oily, which is completely understandable, it is oil.</li>
            <li>It soaks directly into your skin -  not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has course hair and he uses it for his hair, said he&#x27;s never had his hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>the way, I am 60 years old with a combination skin type.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t anticipate a miracle - - just something to soften these old age annoyances.  </li>
            <li>So far after a week of using PoppyAustin Argan Oil</li>
            <li>But after I used this, my hair is soft n tangle-free( which I can never imagine).</li>
            <li>This is the same Argan Oil I paid twice as much for from another brand.  </li>
            <li>And, I have extremely sensitive</li>
            <li>This has made a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I used  to have adult acne, and since using Argan oil, all acne has cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put near my eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural kinky hair girl;  argan oil  brings my hair alive.</li>
            <li>I use this day and night and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>, it matters to me how the workers are treated who produce the products, and if the products are farmed in a conscious, sustainable way.  </li>
            <li>and this product seems to help considerably.  </li>
            <li>My  hair feels so soft without  feeling greasy</li>
            <li>We were at a loss, complete and utter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is 60 years young and the Aragon oil helps it look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt or looked this soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This oil made both my hair and skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I am surprised with the effect it had ... really soft conditioning..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it to my hair, face, hands and body, and makes my skin feel so soft and</li>
            <li>It keeps my face soft but not oily.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference from extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>and my face is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Poppy Austin® Argan Oil seems to be the ticket so far.  </li>
            <li>There was a very prompt, noticeable, change in my facial complexion.</li>
            <li>Makes it soft and shiny</li>
            <li>put all of my old cleansers under my sink and started solely using the Poppy Austin Argan Oil and a Josie Maran cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>leave hair soft and shinny</li>
            <li>so much I intend to have it delivered regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on my face since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I purchased the Argon oil to use on my 3 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Prompt professional service.</li>
            <li>My skin is insanely sensitive for a guy.  </li>
            <li>Sent all the way to India completely intact.  </li>
            <li>The wrinkles are not as noticeable and my face to touch is so soft.</li>
            <li>After my daily swim I shower and add a few drops and my  hair is shiny and healthy looking again.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t particularly bother me as the smell isn&#x27;t strong, nor does it last any longer than a few</li>
            <li>and it does not leave a scent of any kind behind.</li>
            <li>I have white heads from extreme sebum production, but I am noticing fine lines around my mouth and eyes, and the natural signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who has dry skin and nothing has really helped...</li>
            <li>The multiple 5 star reviews left by the manufacturer can&#x27;t cover the truth of other authentic reviews.</li>
            <li>I am of Norwegian descent and living in the Midwest and different locales in Wisconsin, even near Lake Michigan where high humidity is always and issue, I&#x27;ve had very frizzy, uncontrollably wavy hair.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to share how dry my skin is.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I know exactly how much or how little I am using when I add it to my hair care products or directly upon the hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little different, not terrible, however it dissipates quickly and is not noticeable within a few moments of application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin is less dry and more plump.  </li>
            <li>I have been pretty blessed with clear skin throughout my teenage years and beyond, but recently started developing zits on areas of my face</li>
            <li>I would say that it can be a bit pricey compared to other products but its worth it.</li>
            <li>If you want your face, neck and/or other parts of your body to look fresh and radiant +</li>
            <li>my skin it not necessarily dry, I did notice a new \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin.  </li>
            <li>have dry patchy skin but only in various places such as my right cheek, my right elbow where my arm rests on my desk 15 hours a day, and my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a shower on my entire body, mainly focusing on my elbows, knees, shoulders, hands, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;-Daily, after cleansing &amp; exfoliating my face.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li>mainly wanted to use it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Concerned about smell at first but seems to be just like my more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I now use it as my main ingredient in my personal BEARD OIL.</li>
            <li>For my short, color treated (and older) hair</li>
            <li>I love the oil, but when I received it the lid was cracked and most the oil was in the pkg :(</li>
            <li>If you research why argan oil would smell this way its due to the fact that it was Over-processed &amp; extracted at a really high temperature that kills the valuable properties at which the pure gold liquid is known for.</li>
            <li>My little daughter has light dry and damaged hair before we use Poppy Austin® 100% PURE ARGAN OIL  since the last 3 months her hair became magically thick ,shiny ,soft and healthy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product....and the thanking Poppy Austin for such a prompt shipment.  </li>
            <li>After using this as described above, twice a day (morning and night) I was able to leave off my makeup, put on just a little cover up in just a couple places and only put on some blush and my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>finally something natural and organic that works!!</li>
            <li>Yet, as dry as my hands were, the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is so rich, that it only took one drop on the back of my hand to do both hands.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and was worried this would weigh it down and it did the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I was using Moroccan oil, but it has so many added ingredients that are not good for my hair and my husband could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li>and the dryness is gone and the skin is going back to normal texture.  </li>
            <li>(My hair is a mixture of normal and coarse hairs)</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, occasional acne, clogged pores, dryness, now dealing with some uneven tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li>it for about a couple of weeks now, I am down to 3 drops which is the golden number for me.</li>
            <li>This argan oil is a live saver for my skin - - it somehow &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; my facial skin and erases years.</li>
            <li>It is also very, very oily and does not absorb like other 100% organic argan oil that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that it is helping with dry skin very well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add drops to my lotion and this really seems to quench dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it feels very balanced.</li>
            <li>No dry patches, just supple, soft skin.</li>
            <li>A second thing is that the bottle came very oily on the outside.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight nutty, warm scent that is natural to the product, but is not overwhelming nor barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I had bleached hair for over four years and have used &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; products to help smooth out the fried ends and frizz the harsh bleach left my hair with.</li>
            <li>Given that I have very oily skin, this only makes it extra oily.</li>
            <li>AT NIGHT, THE PRICE IS REASONABLE SINCE YOU CAN FIND IT MORE EXPENSIVE FROM OTHERS SELLERS</li>
            <li>Unlike other Argan Oils I have purchased this one is pretty stinky.  </li>
            <li>I barely even have to wash my face anymore, and no break outs or anything!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t my research about these other first 4 ingredient in the morracon oil</li>
            <li>I have spent more money that I would like to admit on products that promised to \\&quot;tame my mane\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>At first, i decided to use it only on my face overnight, but my skin is so dry</li>
            <li>A few drops on my fingertips helps tame my hair and provides a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Most of the other products I have used leave my hair heavy or oily looking, this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It really does help bring some life to split ends and is slowly making my hair feel more hydrated and less brittle.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and hydrated as I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>I have body aches from getting older, especially from physical labor. </li>
            <li>I mean, she could have easily passed for a woman in her early to mid 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Has a very delicate scent, love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and keeps my skin quite moisturized, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>You can use this as a face moisturizer by adding a few drops on your face and neck, you can add a few drops to your favorite facial toner, you can add a few drops to a face mask, you can use to moisturize your lips or by adding vanilla extract to fine brown sugar you can use a lip scrub.</li>
            <li>I was in the middle of my breakout time, I used the oil all over my face and in two days my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li>I used it overnight as a facial moisturizer and was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of drops used on each area is enough to keep them soft all day.  </li>
            <li>The product itself arrived on time from Poppy Austin, and I was pleasantly surprised at the generous quantity given the relatively low price.</li>
            <li>There are cheaper oils out there, but you definitely get what you pay for as far as nutraceuticals are concerned.</li>
            <li>It is a vital part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched about it and a lot of people are saying it actually does work, plus it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and strangely enough, fuller.  </li>
            <li>a small amount needed for hair and face,  so bottle is sure to last long.</li>
            <li>have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I was searching a an all natural facial moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li>The redness on my cheeks (partially adult acne, with a bit of rosacea as well) is starting to fade.</li>
            <li>I have read raving reviews about its benefits to dry hair, particularly then ends.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that they have cleared my acne completely, but I can say that I have noticed a big change.</li>
            <li>only thing it isn&#x27;t doing is helping my hair as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extra soft and also my skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used this product as a daily moisturizer on my face and nightly on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered the one product I was using had silicone in it and looked for a 100% natural oil.</li>
            <li>It actually smoothens them leaving them soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It really works well when I put in the oil when hair is wet.</li>
            <li>I will only use all natural products on my face.</li>
            <li>Well, lets just say that my hair has never felt so soft, shiny and above all,</li>
            <li>It is surprisingly economical because a few drops is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li>YSL does the same doesn&#x27;t mean they are selling a better product if it all comes from the same source.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for others looking to treat their dry skin or scalp.  </li>
            <li>I saw this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin and thought I would give it a try because its pure Argan oil and none of the other stuff.  </li>
            <li>And, not a SINGLE zit!</li>
            <li>A few drops in the hair and she has less frizz and just healthy looking shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Her face was completely free of wrinkles, age spots, crows feet etc etc, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>It took me a few days to figure out the right amount</li>
            <li>I must use dandruff shampoo which often leaves my scalp dry and itchy but normal moisturizing shampoos do not deal with the dandruff.  </li>
            <li>find that many commercial shampoos and other soaps are often too rough and leave my hair, face, and skin on the dry side.</li>
            <li>Even and lighter skintone with less pores are the first results I am seeing, since I started using it 1 week ago.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase from Poppy Austin, and I will definitely look at some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li>just a few drops worked in really makes hair soft and silky!  </li>
            <li>so I have seen a significant improvement in both only after using a few times!</li>
            <li>I have used expensive salon products and find this is much longer lasting - I don&#x27;t have to use ti daily - and does a better job.</li>
            <li>From the split ends of my hair, to my rough and dried out cuticles, to the fine lines around my lips and eyes...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say, other than I can&#x27;t really use this because it smells like cheese.</li>
            <li>Product is as as stated, oil is thick and rich, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and skin</li>
            <li>Fabulous product at half of the price of other Argan oils.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate</li>
            <li>What makes this product worth every penny is the fact that it is 100 percent raw organic oil.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and pleasing, the oil is silky and light.</li>
            <li>It only takes three drops to cover my entire face (one for forehead, two for the rest - gently massaged into the skin), and when I have breakouts or dry spots</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is to be careful not to use too much of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We got similar teenage angst from our 15-year old lad, but he knew that the brand products weren&#x27;t working and he needed to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can use the argan oil daily on my sensitive skin and it helps keep my eyes from being red and wrinkly.</li>
            <li>i fell in love (almost in an unhealthy way) to argan oil... however upon further research...</li>
            <li>I watched a TV special on how they get the product going, they work hard.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to use on my face, but since my skin is extremely sensitive The Argan Oil caused it to break out, (not surprising, as almost every moisturizer causes the same)</li>
            <li>so when I used up my first bottle and got another, I used the empty bottle to put half of new product  to keep it from oxidizing and spoiling, and kept it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>My hair was no longer frizzy and dry, but instead was soft and radiant!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, just be careful to only put a few drops on the ends and not the roots, otherwise it can make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>It also does not smell like real argan, it has a foul smell that is not right.</li>
            <li>I finally found out the right amount for my hair after trying a few times.</li>
            <li>I have a rough spot on my ankle that I have to apply lotion to a few times a day if I don&#x27;t want it getting scaly and super rough, but putting a few drops of this after a hot shower seems to do the trick for the whole day.</li>
            <li>had a blister on my finger that had accidentally been peeled off and left a deep gap in the skin - after a week of rubbing one drop of this oil into my hands it was nearly completely healed, not even a trace of a scar left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feet, I do apply Argan oil, but I usually feel that I need more firepower for the poor neglected dears and add higher tech creams that give me an immediate sense of nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last for some time &amp; it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin is easily irritated, and has been so dry lately.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the investment in this product is well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>tried it on my face but didn&#x27;t particularly care for the results, but will trust it for it&#x27;s other uses.  </li>
            <li>I rub a small amount into the ends of my hair right after the shower.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and look forward to trying it in other ways.</li>
            <li>For someone who absolutely did not believe I could live without a facial serum and THEN moisturizer, because my skin is SO dry, especially in the winter with the heater on constantly, all I need to do is dab on a few drops of this tremendous product on my face and brush a small quantity through my hair</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to help clear up the dry skin caused by my beard.</li>
            <li>Hair is naturally curly and dry.</li>
            <li>It has transformed my extremely dry, brittle, color treated hair, to soft touchable hair.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and in winter, it gets quite itchy and scaly.  </li>
            <li>The product must last, and not dry up in the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first about using some oil, but I love this product because of its versatility and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I received my little brown bottle of 100% pure organic argan oil.</li>
            <li>Anybody who has purchased a quality product will notice immediately -- it smells terrible, does not absorb properly, and frankly is too good to be true at this price.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this Argan Oil, I had been previously used the common Sephora brand Josie Maran</li>
            <li>Argan oil has nearly cured my dry skin which facilitates treating and controlling the psoriasis (especially on the soles of my feet).  </li>
            <li>I suffered from sensitive really dry red skin that felt like sandpaper !  </li>
            <li>I bought this after using Josie Maran argan oil for a while because it was less expensive and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very heavy and greasy, but I put it on as the last thing I do before going to bed and by morning it&#x27;s been well absorbed and on the back of my hands lasts well into the day.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money because you only need a few drops at a time, so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have shopped around for other essential oil products at high end department store cosmetics counters and have seen such products sell for $60 to $75 for a bottle this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way so it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I am 68 year  old lady with very dry skin...  </li>
            <li>I put a little too much on my damp hair after towel drying it</li>
            <li>Maybe I used a little too much.</li>

            <li> seems good.  </li>
            <li> I started to bald a year or two ago, and I figured now was a good time to start doing something about</li>

            <li> I have never used anything else this good at moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> i heard that argan oil can be found cheaper but just as good through online methods like amazon....</li>
            <li> Argan oil is good.</li>
            <li> , its good for your hair, I apply it to my ends and it helps stops</li>
            <li> That stuff changed my hair - I loved it...</li>
            <li> I have not used Organ oil before but giving it a good try.</li>

            <li> and this is good argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I had bought Pre de Provence argan oil in a body shop and loved it, I think it may be a blend</li>
            <li> I thought since I already loved Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;ll give Poppy Austin a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, what is good for my family and me, it must be for you too.</li>

            <li> This is a good one for the price.  </li>
            <li> which is also a good sign.</li>
            <li> it works like a cleanser and its really good too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Received the product promptly from Poppy Austin and she is delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Also works good on my hair, makes it look shiny.</li>
            <li> But, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It is that darned good.</li>
            <li> I received the product as stated in the description, a good size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> So I started using it and loved it.</li>
            <li> The price is good.  </li>
            <li> works good</li>
            <li> , that did not work as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and he kept rubbing the baby&#x27;s cheeks to compare them to my own skin.  </li>
            <li> but I was instantly impressed with how truly lightweight and fast-absorbing this Argan oil really</li>

            <li> It leaves my skin nicEly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> the products, I ordered their argan oil again plus their rose water which I use as face toner.</li>

            <li> i got two ounces of argan for $25 in comparison to JM $48 dollar argan oil...and honestly...</li>

            <li> and my friends keep saying how nice my complexion is.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your attention to detail and providing an excellent item!</li>

            <li> Nice for my hair too.</li>
            <li> Thanks Poppy Austin, for a nice product, excellent packaging, and speedy shipping!</li>

            <li> My husband liked my results</li>
            <li> so I tried this and am loving it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as Argan oil is so popular for use on the hair.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on the skin as well and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and can honestly say that it leaves my skin feeling moisturized without being sticky or oily...  </li>

            <li> This aragon oil never looks too gresy, but gives my skin a nice glow and feel even when I am not applying make up over it.</li>
            <li> amazon does an amazingly fast delivery and I&#x27;m very impressed by that.  </li>
            <li> something nice for your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice oil.</li>
            <li> but when I apply oils to my face, my face doesn&#x27;t oil up on its own.</li>
            <li> You will be so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So nice to find an organic product that I like and believe in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still moisturizes the skin nicely, and for the price I can overlook the smell.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately,  there is a very strong odor that just smells \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, my skin feels hydrated and looks healthy -- I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it,  I have used Argan Oil for 2 yrs &amp; this is my favorite!  </li>

            <li> It also gives a nice healthy glow to my face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using so many moisturizers and I have yet to find one that lasts longer than a couple of hours to keep my skin looking nice and radiant.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like it but not so sure what all the hype is about.  </li>
            <li> but I like Poppy Austins&#x27; better.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced my moisturizer and have referred many friends who have complimented me on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Try this, you will love it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> So love how the Argon oil is working on my skin.</li>
            <li> poppy austin is so much better in my opinion...</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it ....</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil was OK</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be buying this again! :)</li>
            <li> This works better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> , MY HAIR LOOKS MORE SHINE</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that I am trying to figure the best way to apply it.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried this</li>
            <li> and I am sure that will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if my hair was longer or damaged, I would need more.</li>
            <li> Just something to keep in mind! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s authentic like u get in Morocco.  </li>
            <li> I still have some experamenting to do with this as I have not fallen in love with it yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s just ok for hair.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever shopped for argan oil, you&#x27;ll see that most of them are no longer at its purest form.</li>
            <li> and I find I need more moisturizer</li>
            <li> I feel it moisturizes my skin better than the cream.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> glad I decided to order it.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, healthy, and no signs of split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;With just one use i could see more shine and moisture in my hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am going to say that I love this product because it does make my hair fuller and just makes it look healthy.</li>
            <li> I learned a lot watching Poppy Austin videos on YouTube, and am even more convinced in the quality of their product after using it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with results and product quality.</li>
            <li> request i have is that there should be a more convenient way to use it besides the dropper.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> But while the oil itself is lovely, it smells *</li>
            <li> Simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin!</li>
            <li> My friends maybe getting this for Christmas! :-)</li>
            <li> just better overall.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is okay, not all that as they made it seem on the amazon website and you tube for this oil.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil.  </li>
            <li> it does the job on my skin and under my eyes and that&#x27;s all that matters :)</li>

            <li> Overall, a great product!!</li>
            <li> I love the Argan Oil because it is so versatile.  </li>
            <li> I love the look of my skin now.  </li>

            <li> I am completely satisfied with Poppy Austin Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love Poppy Austins Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> hair will benefit even more from Argan oil in the summer months, once the sun begins to take its toll</li>
            <li> I cant say it was much better at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have a body lotion with coconut oil that leaves me needing more moisture</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works better than any conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My cuticles look great and it really tames frizz (just don&#x27;t use a lot of it as it can make your hair oily).</li>
            <li> Being extremely satisfied with this brand, I will no longer search for a &#x27;better&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased that it arrived sooner than the projected delivery date.</li>
            <li> my hair feels better and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil that does absolute wonders for the hair, replacing &amp; locking in lost moisture.</li>
            <li> Love this product my skin is feeling softer after just one week</li>
            <li> but my hair looks healthy.</li>
            <li> and I think that this one is even better the one from Sephora (which I&#x27;ve tried as well).</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Also,  I love the dropper/ bottle.</li>
            <li> Better than the celebrity brand I was using.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It helps with hair to restore healthy ends and helps with styling,too.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I looked online for more argan oil since the shop was in NJ</li>
            <li> Use on my face every night and love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> This product seems OK  </li>
            <li> I WILL KNOW MORE IN A MONTH</li>
            <li> Love this oil</li>
            <li> I love it as a face moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make you greasy at all</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks on my face and hair and it&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Moroccan Oil, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I order this, having ordered from this company before, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn’t love something like that?</li>
            <li> plan to order more for myself and give out a couple of bottles as gifts for this upcoming Christmas season.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> It just feels so light and nice.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Then also my hair started looking better  .</li>
            <li> My face looks smoother and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is supposed to be excellent for the hair (especially if it is brittle, or thinning.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this Argan Oil after hearing A LOT of wonderful things about not only the product, but this company as well.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels much better after applying this oil.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had a pump top</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for more than a year now, and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> to try it more to see benefits</li>
            <li> I have noticed that everywhere it is touted that Argan oil is the best oil to use on facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I used Josie Maran Argan oil and this is much better priced.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE this brand.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>

            <li> they sent me another bottle for free!</li>
            <li> maybe I put to many drops.</li>
            <li> and it should work even better.</li>
            <li> I opted for this 100% argon oil and love it.</li>
            <li> For me Argan oil smooths , tightens , hydrates , gives my skin a healthy glow</li>
            <li> and it also keeps skin hydraded while I work out :)</li>
            <li> I should know better-</li>
            <li> and I was really hoping that I found a great argan product.  </li>
            <li> feels better.</li>
            <li> Thanks Works Great ...</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for gifts for my daughters.</li>
            <li> and I look and feel better than I have</li>
            <li> Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li> Great product and the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased .Miriam Mays</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands of Argan oil, I would say that Poppy Austin is the best oil for the money value and quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> I need to give it more time to see if I will stay with the product once I&#x27;ve completed the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love it for overnight use and for the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping it would work better than it did.</li>
            <li> fact that this &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oil does not absorb as an authentic one should immediately confirms that it is 99% fillers.</li>
            <li> Their lavishing, convincing wording and ads.</li>
            <li> Basically, I&#x27;ve tried so many and nothing improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I can use it as a healthy conditioner and rinse it out</li>
            <li> and when I did my hair this morning it&#x27;s never felt or looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased just make</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I heard about argan oil somewhere, went on Google, read a lot of the information and ads and determined that the most trustworthy product and company was the Poppy Austin Company.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil and it just sits on top of my face.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>

            <li> Finding many ways to use it.</li>
            <li> I have come to the conclusion as many others also, that, it is one of the top organic carrier oils in the world (if it is not diluted or anything added or taken away from it) for its healing, health, and conditioning properties.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, thought it would work but haven&#x27;t seen results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m repurchasing for sure.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Poppy Austin for such an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Not terrible acne, but still sucky acne.  </li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s so dramatically reduced that I feel confident saying this stuff helped.  </li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s safe to say that I know what works for me and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: In truth, this product is extremely good and well worth the hefty price tag.</li>
            <li> Having been a fan of the Josie Maran argan oil for a while now, I was excited to get my order of Poppy Austin, since it&#x27;s much more cost effective.</li>

            <li> , I find it works best when I apply the Argan oil when I&#x27;m about 3/4 through a blow dry.</li>

            <li> Works great at making my hair and skin soft and healthy.</li>

            <li> So far the Argan Oil seems to be working great.</li>

            <li> I even signed up on the website and was really hoping for good results from this product</li>
            <li> I have used rosehip oil, bio-oil, emu oil (do not use straight emu oil, it made me break out), so I know a good oil when I use</li>
            <li> Makes my skin and hair feel wonderful I will purchase it again with no doubt, doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin or weigh my hair down :)</li>
            <li> I apply argan oil to my scalp for dandruff and dry scalp control, to my face and skin to moisturize, and of course to my hair to eliminate frizz and give me flawless celebrity smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It comes in a large size and the quality of the product is exceptional.</li>
            <li> It made them very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I went home and did some research and found that the important ingredient is argan oil and since I don&#x27;t want the perfume I found this pure argan oil for a really good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m especially happy that I bought my Argan oil from Poppy Austin because it is guaranteed 100% pure, natural, and undiluted.</li>
            <li> At night, I use this on top of my retinol products to calm any irritation I might have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase, it was worth every dime!</li>
            <li> The included dropper makes it easy to not over do it.  </li>
            <li> The product is extremely easy to use and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly and was well packaged well.</li>
            <li> I believe that is because it absorbs very quickly into my hair.  </li>
            <li> and they shi very quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and is none greasy.</li>
            <li> i also think its a great value because the same oil from josie maran costs a lot more.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to put a couple drops in your favorite moisturizer for an extra boost.</li>
            <li> Your hair can get greasy looking very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ised it at night for a week now and every morning I look in the mirror and am so surprised at how even the tone is and bright and healthy it looks.</li>
            <li> the smell is quite strong to my nose.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not to strong</li>
            <li> And the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all, I know some people don&#x27;t like it but trust me,</li>
            <li> Would love if provided some special discounts.</li>
            <li> and it left me feeling beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Argan Oil by my hairdresser, I really liked it</li>
            <li> .it also helps save the trees, that produce this wonderful product, from being cut down.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is extremely mild, which is more than fine.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair, but it seemed to  disappear into my fine, fine hair</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Poppy Austin Argan Oil, but I had such a wonderful experience I will continue to purchase from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I was fine with that while on vacation, we were at the beach and pool, so</li>
            <li> This is a fine Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I will reorder this fine product again.</li>
            <li> Light weight &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quick and my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> It is the very first product I have ever found that leaves my hair frizz free, shiny and not flat/greasy!  </li>
            <li> ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sincerely grateful to Poppy Austin and their tremendous team who works together to make their products available.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this particular brand of Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve liked competing argan oils better, but since this is half the price, I think that&#x27;s a fair trade.</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure argan oil, which is nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many oil products in a search to find one that works exactly like this one does!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic that it could live up to everything I had heard, but surprisingly it did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and have noticed a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making it available so that I do not have to fly back to Morocco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> light, not too oily</li>
            <li> and it is always silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I cant say enough how great of a product this is.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> My skins feels so hydrated and unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li> skin  hydrated and comfortable, but use of the argon oil has reduced the dryness.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily (light patting all over the face).</li>
            <li> also have important prerequisites for any product</li>
            <li> The product arrived on schedule and it was securely wrapped in bubble paper.</li>

            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>

            <li> I use it daily on my face, and it feels great.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to take off make-up</li>
            <li> and I think does a fantastic job of keeping things moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use it on my skin also and it keeps it moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s fragrance free -</li>

            <li> I use this fantastic oil on everything.</li>
            <li> No frizzes, incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li> I did have someone comment on how nice my skin looked this week, so hopefully this product is for real.</li>
            <li> I used it to replace gel in my hair, and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil Softens and moisturizes your hair and is light weight with no additive or preservatives according to the label ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I notices a great difference instantly.  </li>
            <li> enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Argan Oil for my skin after showering.</li>
            <li> so I can understand why this product gave me silky, smooth hair and this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been wonderful for my skin with the harsh winter conditions we have in the Northeast.</li>
            <li> Of course, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this is what I have experienced.  </li>
            <li> IT IS LIGHT AND ABSORBS</li>
            <li> A drop or two rubbed on your hands then lightly, sparingly through your hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to find a produce that really works.</li>
            <li> It made the skin smooth and youthful.</li>
            <li> oh and tangle free</li>
            <li> Feels light and smells light.</li>
            <li> and this leaves my hair smooth and luxurious looking.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny. :-)</li>
            <li> Customer service was great and I will continue to order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil gives it a nice shine, my scalp is not as flaky and it feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;KDAD</li>
            <li> Baby Smooth</li>
            <li> It feels light and smooth when it is applied.</li>
            <li> only was I impressed with how fast it arrived (4 days from order to door...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> If it is in a clear or plastic bottle it will not be good.</li>
            <li> So far so good worked well on my hair</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I find this product is better and more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This product is far superior to anything I could find.</li>
            <li> Hoping it will work for me in the heat as well, but for now, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used Argan oil before, but this is by far a superior oil to the others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this Argan oil, my hair is more cooperative, my skin is looking better, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> So far so good and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> A fair wage and protecting the natural resources matters to me.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome and you only need a drop or two to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> Good product so far.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my new oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such silky, soft wavy hair that feels wonderful to the touch and looks great, not even reacting to running a brush through it with frizz and less static electricity!</li>
            <li> I was mostly worried about a greasy feel but it soaked right in with no problems.</li>
            <li> Most of the cleaners had some sort of salicylic acid treatment in them because I was trying to stick it to my acne - because acne hates salicylic acid, right?  </li>
            <li> I will get tiny bumps very easily if it doesn&#x27;t agree with the product, which is why I have tried many many products.</li>
            <li> The is a different formulation than I&#x27;ve used before, and it is very nice.</li>
            <li> It is also very useful for fly-aways.</li>
            <li> It is very economical too --A</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a good product, its worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> After VERY lightly misting my hair with water first, I then applied the oil.</li>
            <li> I love Poppy Austin&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> However, as it is this good, I am sure I will use it all long before then..</li>
            <li> However, as it is this good, I am sure I will use it all long before then.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful little Gem!  </li>
            <li> This bottle of 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil has been the single best purchase I&#x27;ve made all year!  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Argan Oil is my new favorite cosmetic!</li>
            <li> After restarting use of this oil, my face is now restoring back to its new great look!</li>
            <li> It had a really mild scent and left my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> (some Argan oil can have a less than lovely fragrance) and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> the fine print.&lt;br /&gt;The pure stuff is so much better...</li>
            <li> This essential oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted more than six months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a face moisturizer for about 2 months and was really excited.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, excellent price, works as well as any other, and more expensive oils.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different brand of Argan Oil before, but this one is definitely a better deal and more potent.</li>
            <li> The smell does seem to fade significantly after wearing it for a while, but I just got grossed out every time I tried to put it on my face.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been very satisfied with the Argan oil I received.</li>
            <li> It may just be my hair (it&#x27;s already very healthy and soft, and shoulder length).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited yo continue use and see it helps over time.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency and best of all, no strange odor like other brands I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I was originally going to buy from JM on home shopping</li>
            <li> Not as excited about it for use on hair.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, I can confidently go without make up.</li>
            <li> A small amount is all that is needed for excellent results.</li>
            <li> My skin looked very healthy and felt soft.</li>
            <li> (they both are in kindergarten and first grade), and they love it because I&#x27;d apply it to help with brushing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased the Oil to put in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am excited about using this product for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li> The best Argan oil, I&#x27;ve tried several brands, this one leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> To remedy the issues, I tried switching to gentler face washes, making sure to moisturize consistently, etc., and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> After the first day of use I noticed her curls looked much more defined and moisurized.</li>
            <li> I have very irritated patches in my scalp which feel fine and much better after applying this oil.  </li>
            <li> I consider this a great buy since it last for 2-3 months, perhaps even longer if your skin is more normal than mine!</li>
            <li> Finding Poppy Austin, and obviously the real thing as it is identical to the oil she brought from Morocco, is a very good thing.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every product out there, and the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is by far the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever had!  </li>
            <li> A really great product well worth the money, especially with all the care given into making</li>
            <li> Also great for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I can assure you my hair is damaged from years of perms, but the argan oil gives it a natural healthy sheen that makes me appear to have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Also I have heard that it is great for dry feet and elbows also.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> But this product works great for frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you Poppy Austin for your truthful information and very informative and cheerful you tube on this oil.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, easily absorbed and virtually no scent.</li>
            <li> but I now just use one drop mixed with my gel and today is the most humid day of the summer at 100% humidity and my hair is not frizzy and looks nice and clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> At night, I&#x27;d clean with the cleansing oil and add 4 drops to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mix of fish and manure, definitely does not smell pleasant like Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will see the positive results soon.</li>
            <li> And at 58 years old, she never looked better!</li>
            <li> So far I love it!  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few argon oil products before finding the right product and this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> This product does way more then you would expect, it offers your hair the perfect shine without weighing your hair down or making it greesy.</li>
            <li> This Pure Organic Argan Oil is a top notch product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THE FACT THat this oil is pure Argan.  </li>
            <li> For me, the 100% pure Argan oil is the most practical conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever found.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has only a very light pleasant fragrance, unlike many commercial products.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels amazing and a lot of my dryness issues are beginning to clear up.</li>
            <li> I started out with a pricey oil combination that I loved but was setting me back $60/oz.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil so much that I have shared it with my mom and sister.</li>
            <li> Love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> It makes so much sense that 100% would be so much better.</li>
            <li> I can localize where to apply the oil based on need, and better control how much</li>
            <li> I also make my own skincare products from natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Love the argan oil, had spine surgery aND it took a toll on my whole body, skin and hair included.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it adds anything to the sweet almond oil I already use</li>
            <li> Good quality and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I cannot really explain it better then that.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, it feels different in a good way.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> MAKES ME FEEL GOOD TO GIVE BACK.</li>
            <li> and I still have a good amount left.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very well moisturized and has better color tone to it after using this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li> I love the fast shipping, I received it in about a week after ordering it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> She likes it so much we ordered 2 more</li>
            <li> sure you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Also, shipping was fast and the price was better than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I know that must seem too good to be true - but this time it actually is!</li>
            <li> I began noticing her hair was becoming more and more dry with the products I used to detangle and style.</li>
            <li> The consistency is rich (and works even in the hot and humid South!)</li>
            <li> so right now I am primarily using this product on my face before bed.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin provided important upfront information about the harvesting and processing of their oils as well as conveniently placed batch numbers and bottling dates right on the label.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First impression: Despite the claims that this product is \\&quot;odourless\\&quot;, I did detect a very mild nutty fragrance when I first opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a few weeks and my skin is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> With just one use I have received so many compliments on my hair with this product, this is a new staple for me!  </li>
            <li> Love my new find!</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling like straw, yet after only a couple of uses my hair feels great, soft and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> skin feels tremendous after about a couple of weeks use</li>
            <li> I can wear this even during the day, as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy look or feel to my face.  </li>
            <li> It Is odorless and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> sandalwood aftershave, which I dislike tremendously.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and with no fuss.  </li>
            <li> The oil is clear like canola oil instead of the nice golden hue</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a mild smell that you will forget you have it on.</li>
            <li> is so mild</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily &amp; quickly with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> You officially now have a loyal customer. ^_^.</li>
            <li> I have seen a great difference in my hair since using this product, i would totally reccommend  it thanks a lot</li>
            <li> It Arrived quickly and matches the picture on amazon.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> so it absords quickly.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> I would hope that this company would gladly replace the product if an older bottle inadvertently made it to customer.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and was to the quality described in the description.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so quickly into my hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell or anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it arrived quickly and neatly packaged with no spills.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin quickly, and my face doesn’t feel greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep ordering Argan oil from Poppy Austin - it ships quickly and has an expiration date.  </li>
            <li> I love this as it leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; soft, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> sure enough, many people do.</li>
            <li> The oil is clear like canola oil instead of the nice golden hue</li>
            <li> So happy that Poppy Austin stays 100% natural because natural is the way to go in my book.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick service also.</li>
            <li> Was excited when I read the reviews and decided to order, once I recieved the oil I used it right away</li>
            <li> highly recommend Poppy Austin, it is Organic and most Argan Oil in the stores is not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34; I highly recommend this seller, as the customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li> , it absorbed too quick, so i decided to apply right after washing my face and a light application just before bed, which helped.</li>
            <li> My normal moisturizer (about $20 more than Argan Oil), I won&#x27;t mention the name, takes about 20 - 30 minutes before the greasy feeling goes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other oil products before and so far this meets my needs and expectations the best.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available at such a good price...  </li>
            <li> After the first application it turned smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> no unpleasant smell ..</li>
            <li> The oil also has a slightly musky / pleasant smell which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for something that will make your hair gorgeous and your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my new face skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought this would be a great product for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> The oil is light,  smooth as silk, subtlety fragrant and the best of all, with a soft massage, it totally disappears, leaving no residue or &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34;, just totally velvet skin.  </li>
            <li> This is in a glass bottle, dark so the light doesn&#x27;t penetrate (it&#x27;s a good thing).</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this oil is real.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is good for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> A couple of drops of this and my hair is shiny, healthy and without static, even in the desert of Arizona, all day long without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Luckily the smell goes away after it&#x27;s been absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the ease of the pump dispenser so it always ready to use easily.</li>
            <li> It has a neutral fragrance, pleasant enough, and seems to be as pure as the description states.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin that&#x27;s very fair and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making outstanding, affordable, and natural products!</li>
            <li> I got compliments on my hair and have purchased several more as gifts!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> only thing is that it has a kind of funny light smell that goes away after a while, or maybe I just get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll definitely go back &amp; order my argan oil, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> finally decided to shell out for Argan oil and am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> Over all if you can&#x27;t tell I really, really like Poppy Austin Argan Oil and will continue to order it to use!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft and healthy skin!</li>
            <li> Fine for hair and skin but not so much for the face.</li>
            <li> They must be 100% Pure and Organic, and be Ecologically Certified and approved.   </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> To be honest, it has more body to it and takes a little longer to absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is 100% pure Argan Oil which was very important to me in ordering this particular brand.  </li>
            <li> This oil is amazing, i have used it on my face as a moisturizer and it wows my features enormously.</li>
            <li> I received the product  very promptly, and I enjoy using it every day.</li>
            <li> Seems very hydrating and light on the skin.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks great after a visit to my hairdresser, but after I shampoo it looks damaged with dead ends.</li>
            <li> The product is very hydrating and light weight.</li>
            <li> as an added bonus, I oiled my hair with this and not only does my scalp feel amazing</li>
            <li> Of course with the help of coconut oil but either way this argan oil Is amazing especially on the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li> Simplemente asombroso, puedes notar la diferencia al instante, it&#x27;s amazing, you can notice result instantly in your skin, soft and non greasy, love it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair to give it some much needed moisture, smooth it out, and add shine to it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this product available.</li>
            <li> I am grateful that the scent is light to non-existent, and I also appreciated that the product was well sealed and didn&#x27;t leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> Feels light and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped to make my hair silky smooth and my skin as well.</li>
            <li> It really is helping my facial skin look good without any additional product.  </li>
            <li> I have completely fallen in love with the Organic Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face overnight and had really nice results the next day.  </li>
            <li> You can tell this product is worth its weight in gold and is of the highest quality to be found.  </li>
            <li> I love to know I&#x27;m putting a natural oil in my hair and</li>
            <li> made my hair soft, shiny, moist and more controllable and on my face its helped keep my acne at bay.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are thrilled and use the oil daily.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Both my and my husband use it and like the way it feels and that it is absorbed so well that we don&#x27;t feel oily after using it.</li>
            <li> I cant say it was worth 26 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, light facial oil, but really hasn&#x27;t improved my skin.</li>
            <li> As far as a \\&quot;healing\\&quot; type product, using this on my feet for one week has made them look better</li>
            <li> This is worth having as a staple beauty product.</li>
            <li> I have researched how to tell genuine quality product since there are so many imitations and mixed products on the market now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Finally, something this is all natural and works great.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> The product is absorbed by your hair and although I wouldn&#x27;t go out on the town while going through this process you won&#x27;t even realize you have a treatment in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Give it a chance too; trust me, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If they want to show 3 bottles it should be more clear that the price is for 1 bottle.  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more thanks a lot :)</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I was glad to find a product that I could add to my bag of natural healing</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and hands, a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Hey, anything was worth a try by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a low-tech but for me highly effective basic.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after trying coconut oil, which I really liked, but it seemed to make my pores bigger.</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;Finest Rose Water Facial Toner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; and finish with the Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price-</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was too good to be true, but as my hair completely dried, it stayed full, not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I originally learned about Argan oil when Sephora gave me a large sample of Josie Maran Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> First and foremost the delivery came even faster than expected; so that was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, leaves skin so soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li> After trying other Essential Oils I am convinced this product is one of the best ones I have used to date.  </li>
            <li> different(better), more like what it is, because the other brand smelled more like oil, just plan oil.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> They are supposed to have a mild nutty smell, but this one is pretty pungent.</li>
            <li> you apply a few drops and your skin absorbs it very nicely</li>
            <li> but this one is superior to the other.</li>
            <li> I placed the oil on the right side of my face in the morning, and again before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in with no after greasy feel or look.</li>
            <li> almost right away I could see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I put it on heavily right after a shower and put socks on right away.</li>
            <li> The consistency was just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right (compared to others out there) and it was also organic.</li>
            <li> Since it is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin right away</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product right after I have used one, but this one I had too.  </li>
            <li> right in, didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I put it to the test right on the spot.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived in amber bottles with stoppers to help with dispensing the right amount.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s on, it soaks right in and disappears.  </li>
            <li> and you feel right away that you are</li>
            <li> I started with another brand name of this oil, but noticed right away this one smelled</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the right amount to use on it yet.</li>
            <li> like it did me, I am positive it will!</li>
            <li> Makes skin look and feel so smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I normally have fine frizz prone hair and have tried Moroccan Oil and Living Proof products to control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, especially considering the more than reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This is very pure, 100% Argan oil</li>
            <li> This product seems very pure to me.  </li>
            <li> Great for my dry heals on my feet, never been so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read the reviews my next use for the oil is going to be to try it on my hair, and if it works even half as well as it did on my skin, I will be a very happy person.</li>
            <li> My dry, brittle, frizzy hair became soft, shiny, bouncy happy hair since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> when first applied but dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting that Argan oil seems to act to super charge products so that drug store products (I like Cetaphil) now work well enough</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use on barely moistened skin, wherever you put it.</li>
            <li> So I started adding a couple of drops to my usual moisturizer and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I have heard great things about Poppy Austin in the past</li>
            <li> After the hair is completely dried and styled, I put an even tinier amount on one finger tip, rub that in among all five finger tips and lightly touch to hair ends to smooth and then rake fingers through top of hair and bangs to add texture.</li>
            <li> Good product at an average price</li>
            <li> This would be an ideal everyday product for thick hair and is a good treatment for thinner hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the complaint with the scent is about, it has a nice organic very light scent</li>
            <li> I have such soft flowing hair and it is not greasy, it is very lightweight and very effective for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I did a extensive research on line to really know what I needed in order to get a genuine product I chose this brand, and so far I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will be a very good product for the cold months.  </li>
            <li> just Pure Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li> Pure Argan!</li>
            <li> The product arrived right away and exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice leave-in at night to those dry ends</li>
            <li> My son used it on some dry spots, too, and liked it.  </li>
            <li> It is not a real heavy oil and seems to be absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love this oil - it&#x27;s amazing how my hair just sucks it up, but there is no greasiness.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Poppy Austin, you can definitely tell the distinct difference between Poppy&#x27;s and Josie&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped Super Fast</li>
            <li> My face really does feel smooth which allows my makeup to go on much easier</li>
            <li> The bottle was packeged very well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It is much thicker to apply than my sweet almond oil I&#x27;ve been using which goes on the skin like silk, it also has a slightly funny smell, I wouldn&#x27;t say hot garbage, but theres nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I live in the south and the humidity normally gives me a lot of frizz on top.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this product arrived quickly and the bottle is very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, shipping with this seller was very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Got my product very fast.....</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for prompt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li> I do like the Argan Oil very much.  </li>
            <li> It really helped my dry and tangle prone hair to look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 more bottles few minutes earlier but noticed that it is from another supplier as in Ipad didn&#x27;t know how to search for same supplier in amazon, but I need the product which works perfect not the seller ;)</li>
            <li> I also applied some of the oil to my Daughters hair this morning ( she has thick hair that knots easily) and her hair was so smooth and manageable after a minute or two and when she came home from school today, her hair was tangle free!</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on face (little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> First time user&lt;br /&gt;Looked</li>
            <li> I feel it is misleading to show more than you will actually receive in the photo.</li>
            <li> This was the first Poppy Austin product I used.  </li>
            <li> This oil is the real deal!</li>
            <li> (the more chemicals, usually, the more my hair protests).  </li>
            <li> The first thing I decided to give it a try on was my hands.  </li>
            <li> As a person who normally uses organic coconut oil as an overall body moisturizer, I liked the idea of trying a lighter weight oil for two persistent problem areas: my elbows and the heels of my feet.  </li>
            <li> I first started using Argan oil because my sister-in-law (who is a hair stylist) recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks and face are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I had a rough patch of eczema on my hand that was catching on my clohthes, but after only one night of rubbing the oil on it, that spot is smooth!  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my arms at first just to test it out.</li>
            <li> First time I used this in my hair it made it silkier</li>
            <li> I love it as a face moisturizer alone or a carrier oil with an Essential oil(s) for perfume.</li>
            <li> At first I used this by itself, but found it too oily.  </li>
            <li> I probably should have exfoliated first.  </li>
            <li> really does the job!</li>
            <li> It gained some strength, and I can now style my short hair a bit more</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried it</li>
            <li> it absorbs pretty fast!), root to tip.</li>
            <li> have tried many different products that have not helped, and the oils I have tried have been so greasy I would have to put the oil on before bedtime and wear a long-sleeve shirt</li>
            <li> I recently visited with family that I had not seen for many years.  </li>
            <li> It is first time I use argan oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product again! :)</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s exactly what happened to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair care products with Argan oil since about 2010 when I was first introduced to a conditioner with Argan oil by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> (I know it&#x27;s not advertised as such but my vet said it seemed okay to him.)</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the $$ to stop the chemical contamination and support companies who are committed to fair trade and sustainability.</li>
            <li> I did get a first time buyer discount from Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li> Its really helping my hair!</li>
            <li> I could tell after the first use the change in my hair.</li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks my skin feels so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> exactly* like kalamata olives, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write more later after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li> The Poppy Austin brand moisturizers just as well as my &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product at a much more afordable price in a bigger bottle too.</li>
            <li> gonna keep coming back because I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle of Poppy Austin about 8 months ago, used it up,&lt;br /&gt;then</li>
            <li> first time trying argan oil</li>
            <li> When I put it in my hair it gives it much more volume and overall</li>
            <li> So it should smell nutty if its 100% real!</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin loves it, and I will definitely continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> WILL BE BACK FOR MORE ITEMS.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The first word that comes to mind when using this product.  </li>
            <li> The package came intact, the glass bottle (which is the only way to bottle this oil) was wrapped in protective wrap and arrived safely.</li>
            <li> Product sealed and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Sketchy at first glance</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product... but had heard that it is an awesome moisturizer for your face...  </li>
            <li> I love it especially on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the way it softens my skin and lays the foundation for my daily moisterizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to deal with my hair, and it always made me feel as if my hair is not that pretty.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel soft and smooth and soaked</li>
            <li> First of all it</li>
            <li> This oil did exactly what they said it can do.  </li>
            <li> At first I was using it on my thirsty skin 2 or 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Only using the one drop as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Any more than</li>
            <li> My skin sometimes bumps up and gets rough from the littlest things, and this was a nice relief.</li>
            <li> I also love that they give back to the womens cooperatives in Morocco.</li>
            <li> I think this is my go-to for soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> As a first time user/buyer of argan oil</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and smooth after hear styling.</li>
            <li> I was delivered a product that states exactly what it really is 100% argan oil!  </li>
            <li> First off, I have not tried it yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many traditional hair products and wished I had purchased this sooner.</li>
            <li> Josie maran Argan oil would be my first choice.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommended!</li>
            <li> I also realized my hair wasn&#x27;t feel silky smooth or soft</li>
            <li> and it did exactly what my morracon oil does for my hair.</li>
            <li> The improvement in my hair texture and shine was evident from the first applications.</li>
            <li> First rate product.</li>
            <li> but this oil left the skin feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> Purchased the first bottle for my wife after reading up on the oil.  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase from Poppy Austin and the oil is not greasy feeling but silky to touch.</li>
            <li> First off, I think everyone should pay attention to the &#x27;foul smell&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> So poppy austin should explain the reason for clear (cheap, canola like) oil color. .... ??</li>
            <li> Highly recommended Poppy Austin Argan oil!!  </li>
            <li> Hey if it works, I&#x27;m willing to be friends with any smell.</li>
            <li> lather my whole body in this stuff but with 2 oz!</li>
            <li> I know it is a rip off and that I am paying for the brand, but i think it would cost more to ship it back....</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE FROM POPPYAUSTIN</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> My wife likes the oil and it makes her skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Josie Maran does something to the oil that takes away most of its smell, but that&#x27;s the only brand of Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and am excited to try other products by Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s freshness and purity and will make it part of my daily beauty routine for face, skin and nails.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Poppy Austin Argan Oil for Hair!!  </li>
            <li> It was exactly as described which is why I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.  </li>
            <li> face and body, I use more Argan oil (several drops in palm).</li>
            <li> The price is right, I know how much pure organic oils can be.  </li>
            <li> It really brings out the highlights!  </li>
            <li> I imagine I&#x27;ll appreciate it even more next winter when I&#x27;m running the heater</li>
            <li> I love them, I&#x27;m thinking of ordering additional product&#x27;s in the future from them</li>
            <li> Thanks poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> If you are remotely interested in argan oil and its benefits, this is the product to try.</li>
            <li> However, on the hair it&#x27;s been nothing short of phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil for a few days now and am amazed at how good this product is.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are dramatically less, but the thing that I have loved is that my face looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am happy I heard about it and tried it because the difference is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> and after about a week of constant use, my skin looks just great, not one single \\&quot;pimple\\&quot; has shown itself.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable when usually it is dry &amp; brittle; My skin which is combination between dry &amp; oily is now almost flawless</li>
            <li> Anyone reading this should sence this for themselves, so if you are able to, obtain this PURE ARGAN OIL, and learn how to use it for your specific needs, and you will be blessed.</li>
            <li> Smooth a little on my ends to give them a more polished finish.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is I can add a bit to other lotions too</li>
            <li> I only need to use a few drops so this is a very good &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> that you are getting a high quality product when you purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Poppy Austin&#x27;s site and was excited to see that it not only helped with mild acne but eczema as well.</li>
            <li> Now I use about 3 drops max with wet hands and rub it on my face and the breakouts stopped and my skin is bright and soft.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product is just as good as the most expensive argan oil sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it, I only used 3 drops and that seemed to be a good amount for me.</li>
            <li> Poppy&#x27;s is a golden liquid with a slight nutty scent that I think smells so good whereas Josie&#x27;s is clear and smelled like cooking oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product so far after a few days application.</li>
            <li> It came as pure product which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know much about it, but it does absorb very fast.</li>
            <li> It brushed through my long hair just marvelously, and the ends dried just as smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind</li>
            <li> At first it just did not rub around well, however I found out that if I wet my face and put a drop on my wet forehead, top of each cheek, nose and chin - then rubbed it around, it spread nicely.</li>
            <li> I first opened the bottle I was very put off by the smell, but when it&#x27;s actually on my skin it is a much warmer and more bearable scent</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; of argan oil wasn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;pretty smelling&amp;#34;, so I was very pleased that the odor went away quickly  -- and believe meI know, because I rub this on my face every night.  </li>
            <li> I really felt difference on my skin the first time I tried.</li>
            <li> This was the first Argan oilI tried, but it seems to have a reasonable price for the purity, and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I love that the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is cruelty-free, organic and doesn&#x27;t have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients that I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used to much oil and didn&#x27;t like the way it worked...</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> I use it for pretty much anything.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Far superior in every way to other so called Argan oils.</li>
            <li> It really does make your skin feel soft and CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> I first bought the Josie Maran brand from Sephora to try, however, after watching Poppy Austin&#x27;s videos of what pure argan oil really is I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> And it’s also great to bring my hair back to life after using many different harsh products and blow drying.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, right on the 2nd day I received a very touchy email from the seller very polity asking for a review stating its important for them.</li>
            <li> first 1 oz bottle lasted me about 6 months, so I expect this 2 oz bottle to last about a year, used primarily on my face.</li>
            <li> I needed something easy to put on and would actually work.</li>
            <li> I am using it on a recent surgical scar and the oil is keeping it supple so that I can bend my knee easily.  </li>
            <li> I love to put this in my hair for dry hair relief.</li>
            <li> /&gt;makeup or am I pregnant because my face is so clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> and my hair is dry from so many hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I seriously have never had good skin and Tried so many different creams</li>
            <li> Easy to mix into my night cream for extra moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> With this product I am now able to use my dandruff shampoo and apply the oil to eliminate the dry irritated parts.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is more dry at times than oily.</li>
            <li> I love how it is improving my dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My diet is rich in organic veggies, fish etc 75% of the time and is less than perfect the other quarter, but I have yet to break out using this product and have been using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I have that doesn&#x27;t have a strong nut smell (I have purchased 2 bottles and both exhibit the same smell and absorption characteristics.)</li>
            <li> Then I found Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil which is 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure Argon Oil and processed in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Compare product labels - this is 100% pure Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I asked her what she uses and she told me 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> my hands, I use pure lanolin.</li>
            <li> Will certainly order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I use on my face in certain areas, elbows, nails....</li>
            <li> Lets be transparent- after buying josie marans 100% pure organic argan oil...</li>
            <li> So searched for a pure product online and found Poppy on youtube.  </li>
            <li> this product is pure .</li>
            <li> Totally pure product that seems to have nothing added.</li>
            <li> But I learned that it is not as pure as Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil for Hair and Skin, so</li>
            <li> This is pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> One exemption though it does not have the seal of authenticity that it must heve to be certified as % pure.</li>
            <li> IT IS 100% PURE.</li>
            <li> Example: Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl.</li>
            <li> so I appreciate that it&#x27;s a pure oil with no chemicals or gluten.  </li>
            <li> I waited about a month to leave a review to see how it got along with my skin around the time of my period, and it has certainly passed the test.</li>
            <li> It is a pure Argan Oil, but it is not greasy on your face.</li>
            <li> From just a few days of use I found my ends looking so much better!</li>
            <li> I see they have a new one that has a better price point which I&#x27;ll try next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has always been sensitive to new products, but the moment I started using this Poppy Austin Argon Oil, my skin has been smooth, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and didn&#x27;t get super greasy like you would expect from putting straight oil on your face.</li>
            <li> Such a good value and my cuticles and feet are no longer dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, you cannot buy a child&#x27;s confidence, but by investing in Poppy Austin, we&#x27;ve sure put down a healthy deposit on his future.  </li>
            <li> I have used other oils in the past and have to say this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My fine lines on my forehead are starting to fade and the redness on my cheeks is almost gone!  </li>
            <li> After washing my face with warm water and drying it off, I applied the Argan Oil to it by rubbing a little in.</li>
            <li> I am a very big fan of Poppy Austin now that I have my 100% pure argan oil, my hair is liking fabulous, I put this on my face, my body,</li>
            <li> I have ordered two lanolin products from Amazon and been happy with both, but one is no longer available and the other used to come in a four pack but is now only sold singly, and it&#x27;s pricey and has shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful that this product was available or I would be wearing a hat right now to cover my dry, brittle hair!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to argan oil last year after watching a presentation on TV by Josie M, and bought a huge 6 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> Does help frizzy hair, but don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
            <li> Got it really fast</li>
            <li> The oil stays with you much longer, is thicker, and doesn&#x27;t smell of fragrances that have been added.  </li>
            <li> It arrived fast and no damages.</li>
            <li> Capable of treating damaged skin and acne&lt;</li>
            <li> Capable of repairing damaged nails&lt;</li>
            <li> I really feel like</li>
            <li> I do need to try it though because my hair stylist claims that argan oil really helped her hair when she overprocessed it.</li>
            <li> I towel-dried my hair and gently worked fingertip-sized portions over some of my problems areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dispensed with a dropper so you control how much you want to use and where you&#x27;d like it to be placed.</li>
            <li> The lighter weight and fast absorption keeps my feet from sliding around in my shoes and my elbows from sliding across my desk at work.</li>
            <li> It also arrived very promptly after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Amazon has it for a reasonable price and also specials if you purchase two items.</li>
            <li> Really, this is not an issue.  </li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> the real stuff has.</li>
            <li> Also, I could not believe how fast the product got to me.  </li>
            <li> And it really doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> It is hydrating and gentle on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for what you do in helping others</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I like the dropper applicator as well, which keeps you from getting too much oil on your hands or hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product ladies, and the trio together works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> my next fabulous treat.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Having grown up in sun and from a time when we did not know how much damage the sun could cause I have what we call leathery</li>
            <li> and my feet felt so much nicer than they did yesterday.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have a very heightened sense of smell, then you&#x27;ll notice the foul odor coming from this oil.</li>
            <li> really did&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with Poppy Austin since it was reasonable and where I&#x27;d learned the info.</li>
            <li> It is really all you need as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and I use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> THANKS POPPY AUSTIN</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I can spread it out evenly very well..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like the real oil .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin.  </li>
            <li> be carful not to use too much or else</li>
            <li> I checked around &amp; this is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> oil is not deodorized, but it does contain a very foul scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this twice and ready to buy again.</li>
            <li> No worries about pouring out too much, just a drop or two will do for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for my skin, my hair after the shower and notice how much fuller it is reducing split ends giving your haircut a longer life.</li>
            <li> Really helps sun damage.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is also very versatile.  </li>
            <li> It came in a glass tinted bottle which I really appreciated for purity and to keep it from degrading.</li>
            <li> the Keratin treatment and this combined makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month or so and don&#x27;t really see any changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Found Poppy Austin on youtube w/a very informative video about Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my face really responds.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t really have any odor and 2-3 drops</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it absorbs so well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for running specials.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I  really wanted to like this, since it&#x27;s an affordable Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really made the difference this winter with my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I am really liking it.</li>
            <li> It is completely absorbed within about 15 minutes and my face is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Nothing was included to prove it is real</li>
            <li> It does not even absorb into my skin like real argan oil does.</li>
            <li> I will use this for oil scalp massages here really soon.</li>
            <li> Santa clause is real too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> I told my Doctor about it yesterday and she told me my face looks much healthier.  </li>
            <li> that is too much for my hair (I rub it through AFTER putting on face and neck).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> put a drop in the palm of my hand and rub my hands together and gently pat over face and neck, then rub gently in.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> You know you are getting the real thing</li>
            <li> shipping was fast .and</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend and purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I would had thought twice about paying so much for just 1 bottle.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Plus, delivery  was fast and my product was well protected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very greasy like I&#x27;ve put veggie oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> It is very hydrating to my skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> You can certanly purchase chemicals in a bottle for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the real stuff has.</li>
            <li> Bottom line try another brand that&#x27;s organic and cold pressed, Savannah&#x27;s was the best imo</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well into my skin.</li>
            <li> The care in producing the oil is appreciated.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> i tried this product and didn&#x27;t really see any effects for what it is suppose to do for your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I were starting to get genuinely concerned about our son.  </li>
            <li> I have got very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working very well, and I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My skin was left smooth and did not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it daily for a week now, and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Poppy Austin argan oil!</li>
            <li> I also like the batch number information posted on bottle, so you know you are getting real Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This really is the oil of gold.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommed this to anyone, with any skin issue, please don&#x27;t be scared to put this oil on your face!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the only thing I can say is that this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never had in my life and at a much higher frequency than normal</li>
            <li> It also has added a very gleaming shine to my beard, and is very manageable now, as well as the hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair</li>
            <li> The trick is finding how much to use and when.</li>
            <li> I chose the 5 star rating because my skin absolutely loves this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> did research and went with this brand because they really explained stuff, on youtube and on their website, about the oil, that others did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can tell,  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I think it really depends on the type of skin you have.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so much easier to maintain.  </li>
            <li> She has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> As gentle as I was before, and with all the detangler i used, it still pulled.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and as advertised</li>
            <li> The anti-itch and anti-inflamitory properties help them heal up really quick.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I will buy more when my supply is empty.</li>
            <li> : Don&#x27;t use too much at one time, your hair WILL look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of Argan oil and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> But I am enjoying the simplicity of my routine and there is something to be said for using a basic, natural product instead of a lotion with lots of unpronounceable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It only takes 5 or 6 drops to moisturize my skin, and it works far better than my L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, keeps skin hydrated, and has a subtle, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> far as Argan Oil goes...........compared to the other &amp;#34;famous&amp;#34; brand; you cannot get much better than this!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful on my face and hair, too!  </li>
            <li> Work carefully, and preferably with a good bristle brush that works properly with your hair.</li>
            <li> I apply a few drops to my fingers rub them to warm the oil and apply.</li>
            <li> Quite clear, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> We both love the Poppy Austin Pure Argan Oil and now I am ready to try some of there other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, so the price is definitely worth it; and as most people say, it is very lightweight and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> That is how they look so young!!!  </li>
            <li> It soaks right into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> I confess that, I’ve tried other brands that claims the similar purity and that didn’t turn out as good as I was hoping for then.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid user of all natural health and beauty products, yet find that in many instances they do not live up to their claim, however this product exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with it&#x27;s cosmetic uses until recently, nor that it could help my achy pains</li>
            <li> It does help the dryness on my arms and legs, but so do many other lotions and creams for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I must have applied more to one side because it was extremely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Next day, no signs of a pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for a facial skin moisturizer</li>
            <li> I also want to add that like many other products,  They may have a scent that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I originally was looking for coconut oil for a facial moisturizer when I stumbled across a reviewer on another site</li>
            <li> There are some other bottles of Argan oil on Amazon that have better prices.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless I will keep buying it from Poppy Austin as they charge a decent price for a decent size bottle!</li>
            <li> But, since purchasing and trying Poppy Austin&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil, I&#x27;m excited to say that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and adds just enough shine to intensify the healthiness in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried argan oil before from other brands and believe that this oil definitely achieves what I was looking for in my search for the best argan oil, plus more:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have been doing lots and lots of research on Argan oil and this is hands down the most pure I have found.</li>
            <li> Autumn was coming, my favorite time of year, and I wanted one last shot to let my hair down and enjoy myself.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how CLEAN this product feels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, even though it may smell a bit weird at first.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d put oil on my hair...but a few drops does a wonderful job of fluffing, shining and defining my slightly dry blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have used similar types of product (although most are not 100% pure) and have had minimal success.</li>
            <li> (By the way, I love the way my hair looks when my stylist uses a Moroccan oil product with silicone for the sheen it adds, but I find it is terribly difficult to wash out the residue which tends to weigh the hair down for a week following the first delightful effects of the application).  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would weigh my hair down or make it oily, but if I use it when my hair is damp it dries nice and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the real benefits of it , but so far I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks far better than it has in a long time!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I live in Florida and the humidity here kills your hair and makes you look dead but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m putting on my skin right now...highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Also a little back ground on my skin, I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and this argan oil works great</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone looking for a high quality, pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes use the argan oil to smooth my hair and take the frizz out (when it&#x27;s dry) and it works very well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair - I have short hair, about collarbone length, and I rub three drops of oil into my hands and then quickly apply it to my hair (so it doesn&#x27;t soak too much into my hands -</li>
            <li> As well, if you are dry, your skin will naturally produce more oil.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle and seems to be absorbed by the skin rather quickly compared to other oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This oil works perfectly fine with damp or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Use it on wet skin (before you towel off after a shower) then towel as usual and your skin will feel like skin again -- skin on a good day!</li>
            <li> Easy to order and gr8 for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I am a 60+ yo male with thinning gray hair that was somewhat brittle and full of split or unruly ends.</li>
            <li> I will return at a later date to give a full review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to finally have found something that really keeps my skin nourished and moisturized &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; and I definitely recommend it to others to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin obviously takes pride in their line and delivers true argan oil.</li>
            <li> It works similarly, makes my hair soft and smooth, but you have to be mindful of how much you use.  </li>
            <li> It is concentrated, so please be conscious when you try it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My first experience with Argan Oil was with Josie Moran and I was surprised with how well it worked on my already oily</li>
            <li> I bought more expensive brand last time and this is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> first product to make my hands feel soft</li>
            <li> Before bedtime, it was a little scarey applying &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;  to my face after I washed it clean, but the oil absorbed into my skin quickly leaving a smooth and more radiant looking complexion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands from working with paper all day and they are so dry and rough, I&#x27;ve used this product every day, and my hands feel amazing!!</li>
            <li> And now I cant live without my Argan oil!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I value pure, safe products with limited or no chemical processing.  </li>
            <li> I use less in the summer, since the air is more humid, but I put it on my hands and lips and use it as a hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Received shipment in less than 48 hours--that is better than I could ever hope for.  </li>
            <li> I then checked out several argon oils and found that all of them were not the same, many were diluted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be ordering more bottles, especially since I finally did try it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Found on Amazon of course, and at decent price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a regular user of Josie Maran for a good few years</li>
            <li> Light, unscented (key for me) and absorbs in just a moment.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I only had a couple of bumps, but since they cleared up so quickly, I would think if someone had a lot of acne, it would work just as well.  </li>
            <li> feels better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, even the most expensive cream...</li>
            <li> and back I use more since its a larger area.  </li>
            <li> My facial skin is super supple and hydrated as well.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my face</li>
            <li> Argan oil is most effective when it is not mixed with other products and chemicals and packaged in a dark bottle.</li>
            <li> It sealed in the moisture, added shine and definition, eliminated ANY frizz, and really brought out my natural curl pattern!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to grease and smell and this product is neither greasy or smelly!</li>
            <li> My beard is about 12 inches long now and still growing, and the Argan oil has significantly increased the health and thickness, fullness, and ultra softness of my beard.</li>
            <li> I used it right away on my wind and sun tortured hands and it really helped immediately and later.</li>
            <li> The argan oil from Poppy Austin is perfect for smoothing the ends of the layers, and can be applied lightly to smooth overall frizziness, without looking greasy or feeling heavy (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> It is a high quality oil</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> - then I HIGHLY Recommend Poppy Austin&#x27;s Products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have the driest processed hair and dry skin, The product really make my hair soft and skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and it was listed as one of the popular uses, so I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, and it leaves my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- Natural, organic and pure</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure and it makes my hair and face feel so silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> If I give it some soak in-time, I can use a little foundation over top.  </li>
            <li> Just got this little bottle of Argan Oil yesterday, and I am already in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Hair - wow!!  </li>
            <li> it and can see it vital to skin replenishing care!!</li>
            <li> love the little dropper that is provided in the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I am still hoping to find something to help with the breakouts a little bit more.</li>
            <li> It is for sure what helped bring my skin back to its original state--if not better.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and my normally dry hands are soft again.  </li>
            <li> I use argan oil as a general moisturizer as well as for my face and hair, and while this brand is probably fine for the latter two uses, it just won&#x27;t do for the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good when one has a cold and a tissue-sore nose.  </li>
            <li> I put a little extra on my ends and the very top of my head.  </li>
            <li> It is a very high quality that absorbs completely into my hair, which leaves it thoroughly moisturized</li>
            <li> This combo really did the trick and though I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed it, being a lotion snob, I&#x27;m a complete convert.</li>
            <li> The oil did not have any type of weird odor to it at all which was great</li>
            <li> I should state that I naturally have very oily skin, but I use it on my face after I have showered to replace some of the oil.</li>
            <li> No real smell, just a light oil smell in the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great oil and not too too expensive.</li>
            <li> also, just mix 1-2 drops in your normal styling product</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily scalp but frizzy split ends.  </li>
            <li> After I shower (shampoo and condition like normal)</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in my laugh lines on the second day of use.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and trying to find something that actually works and isn&#x27;t full of chemicals rare.</li>
            <li> I have used a few drops on my hair before drying and truthfully, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking for there, but I bought it for the skin</li>
            <li> I was finally able to clear out my medicine cabinet and get rid of numerous bottles of hair toner, facial moisturizer, and wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bit of oil on my hair before straightening it and found my hair stays soft and smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops on the ends of my hair and it makes the ends look healthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, but it seems to have completely cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> I normally use Jose Moran&#x27;s Argon Oil and saw this and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write a review etc.</li>
            <li> Okay, it didn&#x27;t clear all of his acne up in a fortnight, but the difference in such a short time frame was remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal skin, but with a somewhat oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> The only warning I have is to be aware of how much you are using.</li>
            <li> For my hair, which is almost down to my chest and relatively thick, I use three drops for my whole head and then apply just a bit more to the area closest to my face where I can see the most heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this oil absorbed into my skin and healed some rough red patches on my fingers and elbows very quickly.</li>
            <li> May not look different, but there are significantly less effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing less brown spots on my skin where I use Poppy Austin Argan Oil and my skin feels considerably more soft.  </li>
            <li> Love the waves and curls, just needed to tame them to a manageable shape and style.</li>
            <li> you, I am only a week into using my Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan oil, but I can&#x27;t say enough how quickly I noticed the positive changes.</li>
            <li> you, I am only a week into using my Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan oil, but I can&#x27;t say enough how quickly I noticed the positive changes.</li>
            <li> It instantly made my skin super soft and cleared my face completely in like 3 days!</li>
            <li> I have been using josie maran&#x27;s argan oil for years yet wanted to look for an equally pure and organic argan oil that will work just as good but wont be as expensive.</li>
            <li> It certainly added shine to the surface area of my hair when I added a few drops to my hands and applied it with the palms of my hand to smooth the flyaway ends.  </li>
            <li> I then started using all of their other fabulous products.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell, this was a fantastic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I would feel envious of other women&#x27;s hair that looked so smooth and shiny,</li>
            <li> I decided to make my own concoction and started with argan oil mixed with a little rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have a new baby</li>
            <li> and I seem to keep finding new uses for it.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona now</li>
            <li> I live at altitude</li>
            <li> I just made a new order for another two bottles.</li>
            <li> LIVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> but I can live with the dropper.</li>
            <li> Live the purity of this&lt;br /&gt;argan oil.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without my Argan Oil from Poppy</li>
            <li> WOW, this oil is amazing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> It;s a lovey base for my light application of makeup and it makes a great night treatment.</li>
            <li> Intended to use it primarily as a facial moisturizer but find I am equally pleased with it on my hair &amp; cuticles as well as the rough skin areas of my feet.  </li>
            <li> My main purpose in ordering these products was to have a natural organic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , one thing thought i think it works too well because it kinda got my hair color back to almost my natural color, kinda odd but nice for me</li>
            <li> It seems ironic that oil would clear skin up, but I think it is the purity of what you are putting on your skin that makes the difference, along with the quality, and vitamins/antioxidants naturally within the product.  </li>
            <li> Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff, and having spent more than $3,500 on cosmetics this year alone</li>
            <li> For the last several months, I have honestly worn my hair up every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After cleaning my face for the evening I apply a couple of pure Argan oil drops to my face, then add my pure emu oil over than, and finally apply a natural herbal cream moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of girl who has tried COUNTLESS of amours of different brands ranging from chemical products (basically in all beauty facial cleansers/serums/moisturizers now&lt;br /&gt;W), to topicals recommended by a dermatologist, I&#x27;ve tried many brands high end</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Calmed the frizzies and made my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair is course and heat damaged from my regular blow drying and hot iron habits, and I needed something that would be light enough, help with heat protection, and LAST--</li>
            <li> have to say that I was hesitant to use it on my skin to begin with, as I am VERY sensitive to things on it</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, and with a very soft scent.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my face and neck, and chest area feel very soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it worked really well for my consistently irritated and dry skin.</li>
            <li> first, I simply applied it to my cheek, my elbow,</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone especially since you have so many different options of using it!!!</li>
            <li> I first got the Argan Oil, I put it on my left arm so that I could check to see if it was working and</li>
            <li> and I must say I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly gotten used to it, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Using this product makes your skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair sticky instead of soft! .</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that there are fewer fine lines around my eyes and my skin texture appears finer, the pores less visible.</li>
            <li> I noticed a BIG difference the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> it is even argan oil because it smells exactly like rancid Kalamata olives, plus I am not seeing the same results.  </li>
            <li> I usually bought Josie Maran Argan Oil but for the 1.7oz from Sephora for $48.00 &amp; I was so pleased with the brand &amp; the product, that it is my go to brand from now on.</li>
            <li> None so far!</li>
            <li> This has helped her skin during this time better than the hydrocortisone that she usually has to use.</li>
            <li> So overall, this product is just a miracle moisturizer and has many other uses.</li>
            <li> I normally use this as a skin care product and can&#x27;t even put it near my face.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell more like Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;m trying it on just one arm daily and another product on the other arm to see if I can tell any difference</li>
            <li> How I first used it is different how I use it now</li>
            <li> What can I say other then I love this stuff and have ordered several bottles over the year.</li>
            <li> She used the first bottle and it lasted several months.  </li>
            <li> Ordered first the smaller bottle, fell in love and just received the big bottle for daily use (saving the smaller as a travel bottle - it lasts 30 months, so no worries it will change composition or effectiveness.)  </li>
            <li> Instead, after using argan oil twice a day for two weeks, my pores have nearly disappeared and I haven&#x27;t had acne yet!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Makes me naturally glow!</li>
            <li> Light oil packaged in dark brown glass bottle.</li>
            <li> first night I used it I woke up the next day</li>
            <li> Tames the frizz from my natural curl!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hair rather than my skin, as I add a half dropper-full amount into my developer when I bleached my hair in hopes that I could reduce the damage to my processed, fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I was introduced to it was in a big box cosmetic store</li>
            <li> love how it made my hair feel, i placed it on towel dry hair and let it dry naturally to a very soft touch</li>
            <li> It works on my hair, but be aware that if you use too much on your hair, you hair will become very oily, and weighted down.</li>
            <li> My breakouts slowed down, my skin cleared up, it is so moisturizing and so smooth and applies effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin is dry, it makes me uneasy to think of adding pure oil to it, but since I&#x27;ve tried this Pure Argan Oil, I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> AND the best part is a little goes a long way, for my eyes I only need about half a drop and for my face about 3 drops, if I use it on my neck then maybe 4 drops.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and between the humidity where I live and the blow dryer, etc that I use, my hair often has a frizzy or brittle look around the ends.</li>
            <li> - I am really old (79 yrs) and I still live in hope that I can help fight the aging battle.  </li>
            <li> This oil works wonder specially on my hair, I put small amount on my hair and sculp before I dry my hair and my hair haven&#x27;t felt this nice for a really really long time.</li>
            <li> My nails have greatly improved over the past few months since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but a decent face moisturizer works just as well and is less hassle.</li>
            <li> I mixed several droppers full of oil with water in a 3 oz spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy oils or strong fragrances, and this oil is neither...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally perfect as a moisturizer, without a bunch of chemicals that may have weird side-effects down the road.</li>
            <li> Organic, less expensive than the famous brand and perhaps even better!</li>
            <li> Where I live the weather is changing already and my skin is getting dry and with just a few times using this my skin is soft and healing up nicely.</li>
            <li> My face has seemed to even out with it&#x27;s color too, in fact I am very pale and it seems like I have a bit more color in my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and with so little going such a long way, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pricing was very reasonable and much cheaper that other brands.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, like all the other bottles of Argan oil that I have purchased, so the smell goes away pretty quickly and it absorbs at the same rate as the other bottles.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for sure, especially for those who have such dry skin like myself.</li>
            <li> Well, I decided to try this specific one out because it&#x27;s 100% pure organic and EcoCert approved</li>
            <li> &quot; facial skin and this oil does not clog my large pores or leave my complexion greasy.  </li>
            <li> After I purchased this 100% pure product, I did some local shopping to see what I could find in comparison.</li>
            <li> I saw this was on sale by ten dollars and saw a picture of a large bottle with no size besides \\&quot;shipping weight is 4.8 oz\\&quot;</li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t even high compared to medium to high end creams and serums that give similar results</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good packaging and the oil does lovely things to my very dry skin in this very cold weather.</li>
            <li> but I am sensitive to cents and the Moroccan Oil not only is not pure but has a strong cent</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit on my hair to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> WELL I USE IT ON MY FACE AND HANDS AND SMOOTH A LITTLE ON MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> It sits on top of my skin and stays wet and oily until you just have to wipe it off, and my skin was still very dry after a couple days of using it.</li>
            <li> Without exception, no other company or individual is licensed to sale, replicate, reproduce, or manufacture any Poppy Austin branded product.&amp;#34; I am considering to buy but decided to check on poppyaustin.com first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the big name brand before, this is as good if not better!!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have tried this highly recommended oil - I was always a bit skeptical of the claims - and I am so glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my hair seems to stay nice as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> fact that Poppy Austin® only uses oil made by local Moroccan woman, to help support a fair wage, for their hard work, makes this the product to go to.&lt;br /&gt;Know</li>
            <li> I have been using every night after cleansing my face and found it to make my face smoother and my complexion has remained clear.</li>
            <li> My skin felt and stayed so soft the whole entire day!</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hands and body and it softened my rough hands immediately and left them smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hope was that these products would help clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I use us 3&#x3D;4 times daily and can really see changes in my face.  </li>
            <li> Smells natural.</li>
            <li> I got it from a highly-revered natural foods store, so didn&#x27;t even question the product.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using it ever sense I am 86 years old and</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, goes lightly onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair.  </li>
            <li> which is something I look for as an extra assurance that it is real, diluted argan oil.</li>
            <li> Then they felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs in almost immediately leaving soft waves and manageable soft to the touch hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my hair for 7-10 days, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> now use it daily on both my elbows and feet straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops after blowing out my hair, and the oil leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my color-treated hair....extremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I received the Poppy Austin oil 2 days early as well.</li>
            <li> It has made my face so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was weary about purchasing yet another product to help keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s natural too.</li>
            <li> I swim nearly 3 times a week, and the chlorine destroys my hair.</li>
            <li> And for use on sensitive skin like mine, I rate it with the highest mark.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this oil the dryness around my nose was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put an extra drop on my palm and use a finger to gently dab a bit directly onto the blemish/spot (letting it sink in naturally rather than rubbing it in).</li>
            <li> Works fantastic underneath makeup (I like to wait a few minutes to let the skin soak it up before applying makeup)</li>
            <li> and she went into this really lengthy description about where it comes from, all the different ways you can use it etc etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to mix with Castor Oil for a mixture in clearing up, and to keep clear of adult acne.  </li>
            <li> So far working well on my natural hair and keeps my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil controls the frizz and keeps my hair soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> There is no greasiness and my hair is soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily since and really like it.  </li>
            <li> A couple of drops is enough for your whole face.  </li>
            <li> My skin wasn\\&quot;t as smooth as it was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It was soft and didn&#x27;t look damaged.</li>
            <li> While my favorite use for this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin will be for my hair, I have to start out by saying that I&#x27;m amazed at how well a few drops of this oil will keep my hands, knees, and elbows soft for an entire day!</li>
            <li> was looking for a solution to help replenish my hair and return some of it&#x27;s natural strength and shine to the ends.</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> I know that argan oil supposedly has a nutty scent to it, but this is far from that.</li>
            <li> However,  since is a natural product it does take time getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Poppy offers a discount too that you can apply on Amazon)-</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair moist and soft, without a greasy build up.  </li>
            <li> all things natural.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old.</li>
            <li> My friend (a different one) REALLY noticed a difference to her sun/wind damaged skin and asked about buying a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
            <li> It feels like it does when I get it professionally done at the salon.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and  manageable.</li>
            <li> I can put this oil directly on my face and there are no issues.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and moisturizes my curls.</li>
            <li> I got mine early this spring...</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> You rub it in and within minutes you have soft skin, but not with an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No doubt about that because this a 100% natural product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it to my children-- teenagers and young adults-- to start using now.</li>
            <li> The issue with spraying it in my hair is it made it look oily, which is completely understandable, it is oil.</li>
            <li> It soaks directly into your skin -  not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has course hair and he uses it for his hair, said he&#x27;s never had his hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> the way, I am 60 years old with a combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate a miracle - - just something to soften these old age annoyances.  </li>
            <li> So far after a week of using PoppyAustin Argan Oil</li>
            <li> But after I used this, my hair is soft n tangle-free( which I can never imagine).</li>
            <li> This is the same Argan Oil I paid twice as much for from another brand.  </li>
            <li> And, I have extremely sensitive</li>
            <li> This has made a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I used  to have adult acne, and since using Argan oil, all acne has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put near my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural kinky hair girl;  argan oil  brings my hair alive.</li>
            <li> I use this day and night and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> , it matters to me how the workers are treated who produce the products, and if the products are farmed in a conscious, sustainable way.  </li>
            <li> and this product seems to help considerably.  </li>
            <li> My  hair feels so soft without  feeling greasy</li>
            <li> We were at a loss, complete and utter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is 60 years young and the Aragon oil helps it look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt or looked this soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This oil made both my hair and skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I am surprised with the effect it had ... really soft conditioning..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it to my hair, face, hands and body, and makes my skin feel so soft and</li>
            <li> It keeps my face soft but not oily.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference from extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> and my face is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Poppy Austin® Argan Oil seems to be the ticket so far.  </li>
            <li> There was a very prompt, noticeable, change in my facial complexion.</li>
            <li> Makes it soft and shiny</li>
            <li> put all of my old cleansers under my sink and started solely using the Poppy Austin Argan Oil and a Josie Maran cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li> leave hair soft and shinny</li>
            <li> so much I intend to have it delivered regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on my face since I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I purchased the Argon oil to use on my 3 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Prompt professional service.</li>
            <li> My skin is insanely sensitive for a guy.  </li>
            <li> Sent all the way to India completely intact.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles are not as noticeable and my face to touch is so soft.</li>
            <li> After my daily swim I shower and add a few drops and my  hair is shiny and healthy looking again.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t particularly bother me as the smell isn&#x27;t strong, nor does it last any longer than a few</li>
            <li> and it does not leave a scent of any kind behind.</li>
            <li> I have white heads from extreme sebum production, but I am noticing fine lines around my mouth and eyes, and the natural signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who has dry skin and nothing has really helped...</li>
            <li> The multiple 5 star reviews left by the manufacturer can&#x27;t cover the truth of other authentic reviews.</li>
            <li> I am of Norwegian descent and living in the Midwest and different locales in Wisconsin, even near Lake Michigan where high humidity is always and issue, I&#x27;ve had very frizzy, uncontrollably wavy hair.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to share how dry my skin is.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I know exactly how much or how little I am using when I add it to my hair care products or directly upon the hair.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little different, not terrible, however it dissipates quickly and is not noticeable within a few moments of application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin is less dry and more plump.  </li>
            <li> I have been pretty blessed with clear skin throughout my teenage years and beyond, but recently started developing zits on areas of my face</li>
            <li> I would say that it can be a bit pricey compared to other products but its worth it.</li>
            <li> If you want your face, neck and/or other parts of your body to look fresh and radiant +</li>
            <li> my skin it not necessarily dry, I did notice a new \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin.  </li>
            <li> have dry patchy skin but only in various places such as my right cheek, my right elbow where my arm rests on my desk 15 hours a day, and my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a shower on my entire body, mainly focusing on my elbows, knees, shoulders, hands, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;-Daily, after cleansing &amp; exfoliating my face.&lt;br /&gt;-After</li>
            <li> mainly wanted to use it as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Concerned about smell at first but seems to be just like my more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I now use it as my main ingredient in my personal BEARD OIL.</li>
            <li> For my short, color treated (and older) hair</li>
            <li> I love the oil, but when I received it the lid was cracked and most the oil was in the pkg :(</li>
            <li> If you research why argan oil would smell this way its due to the fact that it was Over-processed &amp; extracted at a really high temperature that kills the valuable properties at which the pure gold liquid is known for.</li>
            <li> My little daughter has light dry and damaged hair before we use Poppy Austin® 100% PURE ARGAN OIL  since the last 3 months her hair became magically thick ,shiny ,soft and healthy</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product....and the thanking Poppy Austin for such a prompt shipment.  </li>
            <li> After using this as described above, twice a day (morning and night) I was able to leave off my makeup, put on just a little cover up in just a couple places and only put on some blush and my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> finally something natural and organic that works!!</li>
            <li> Yet, as dry as my hands were, the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is so rich, that it only took one drop on the back of my hand to do both hands.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and was worried this would weigh it down and it did the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I was using Moroccan oil, but it has so many added ingredients that are not good for my hair and my husband could not stand the smell.</li>
            <li> and the dryness is gone and the skin is going back to normal texture.  </li>
            <li> (My hair is a mixture of normal and coarse hairs)</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, occasional acne, clogged pores, dryness, now dealing with some uneven tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li> it for about a couple of weeks now, I am down to 3 drops which is the golden number for me.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is a live saver for my skin - - it somehow &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; my facial skin and erases years.</li>
            <li> It is also very, very oily and does not absorb like other 100% organic argan oil that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that it is helping with dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add drops to my lotion and this really seems to quench dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it feels very balanced.</li>
            <li> No dry patches, just supple, soft skin.</li>
            <li> A second thing is that the bottle came very oily on the outside.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight nutty, warm scent that is natural to the product, but is not overwhelming nor barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I had bleached hair for over four years and have used &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; products to help smooth out the fried ends and frizz the harsh bleach left my hair with.</li>
            <li> Given that I have very oily skin, this only makes it extra oily.</li>
            <li> AT NIGHT, THE PRICE IS REASONABLE SINCE YOU CAN FIND IT MORE EXPENSIVE FROM OTHERS SELLERS</li>
            <li> Unlike other Argan Oils I have purchased this one is pretty stinky.  </li>
            <li> I barely even have to wash my face anymore, and no break outs or anything!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t my research about these other first 4 ingredient in the morracon oil</li>
            <li> I have spent more money that I would like to admit on products that promised to \\&quot;tame my mane\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> At first, i decided to use it only on my face overnight, but my skin is so dry</li>
            <li> A few drops on my fingertips helps tame my hair and provides a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Most of the other products I have used leave my hair heavy or oily looking, this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It really does help bring some life to split ends and is slowly making my hair feel more hydrated and less brittle.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and hydrated as I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I have body aches from getting older, especially from physical labor. </li>
            <li> I mean, she could have easily passed for a woman in her early to mid 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Has a very delicate scent, love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and keeps my skin quite moisturized, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You can use this as a face moisturizer by adding a few drops on your face and neck, you can add a few drops to your favorite facial toner, you can add a few drops to a face mask, you can use to moisturize your lips or by adding vanilla extract to fine brown sugar you can use a lip scrub.</li>
            <li> I was in the middle of my breakout time, I used the oil all over my face and in two days my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li> I used it overnight as a facial moisturizer and was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of drops used on each area is enough to keep them soft all day.  </li>
            <li> The product itself arrived on time from Poppy Austin, and I was pleasantly surprised at the generous quantity given the relatively low price.</li>
            <li> There are cheaper oils out there, but you definitely get what you pay for as far as nutraceuticals are concerned.</li>
            <li> It is a vital part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched about it and a lot of people are saying it actually does work, plus it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and strangely enough, fuller.  </li>
            <li> a small amount needed for hair and face,  so bottle is sure to last long.</li>
            <li> have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I was searching a an all natural facial moisturizer for my face.</li>
            <li> The redness on my cheeks (partially adult acne, with a bit of rosacea as well) is starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I have read raving reviews about its benefits to dry hair, particularly then ends.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that they have cleared my acne completely, but I can say that I have noticed a big change.</li>
            <li> only thing it isn&#x27;t doing is helping my hair as far as I can see.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extra soft and also my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used this product as a daily moisturizer on my face and nightly on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered the one product I was using had silicone in it and looked for a 100% natural oil.</li>
            <li> It actually smoothens them leaving them soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It really works well when I put in the oil when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I will only use all natural products on my face.</li>
            <li> Well, lets just say that my hair has never felt so soft, shiny and above all,</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly economical because a few drops is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li> YSL does the same doesn&#x27;t mean they are selling a better product if it all comes from the same source.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for others looking to treat their dry skin or scalp.  </li>
            <li> I saw this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin and thought I would give it a try because its pure Argan oil and none of the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> And, not a SINGLE zit!</li>
            <li> A few drops in the hair and she has less frizz and just healthy looking shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Her face was completely free of wrinkles, age spots, crows feet etc etc, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to figure out the right amount</li>
            <li> I must use dandruff shampoo which often leaves my scalp dry and itchy but normal moisturizing shampoos do not deal with the dandruff.  </li>
            <li> find that many commercial shampoos and other soaps are often too rough and leave my hair, face, and skin on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Even and lighter skintone with less pores are the first results I am seeing, since I started using it 1 week ago.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase from Poppy Austin, and I will definitely look at some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li> just a few drops worked in really makes hair soft and silky!  </li>
            <li> so I have seen a significant improvement in both only after using a few times!</li>
            <li> I have used expensive salon products and find this is much longer lasting - I don&#x27;t have to use ti daily - and does a better job.</li>
            <li> From the split ends of my hair, to my rough and dried out cuticles, to the fine lines around my lips and eyes...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say, other than I can&#x27;t really use this because it smells like cheese.</li>
            <li> Product is as as stated, oil is thick and rich, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and skin</li>
            <li> Fabulous product at half of the price of other Argan oils.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate</li>
            <li> What makes this product worth every penny is the fact that it is 100 percent raw organic oil.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and pleasing, the oil is silky and light.</li>
            <li> It only takes three drops to cover my entire face (one for forehead, two for the rest - gently massaged into the skin), and when I have breakouts or dry spots</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is to be careful not to use too much of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We got similar teenage angst from our 15-year old lad, but he knew that the brand products weren&#x27;t working and he needed to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use the argan oil daily on my sensitive skin and it helps keep my eyes from being red and wrinkly.</li>
            <li> i fell in love (almost in an unhealthy way) to argan oil... however upon further research...</li>
            <li> I watched a TV special on how they get the product going, they work hard.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to use on my face, but since my skin is extremely sensitive The Argan Oil caused it to break out, (not surprising, as almost every moisturizer causes the same)</li>
            <li> so when I used up my first bottle and got another, I used the empty bottle to put half of new product  to keep it from oxidizing and spoiling, and kept it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> My hair was no longer frizzy and dry, but instead was soft and radiant!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, just be careful to only put a few drops on the ends and not the roots, otherwise it can make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It also does not smell like real argan, it has a foul smell that is not right.</li>
            <li> I finally found out the right amount for my hair after trying a few times.</li>
            <li> I have a rough spot on my ankle that I have to apply lotion to a few times a day if I don&#x27;t want it getting scaly and super rough, but putting a few drops of this after a hot shower seems to do the trick for the whole day.</li>
            <li> had a blister on my finger that had accidentally been peeled off and left a deep gap in the skin - after a week of rubbing one drop of this oil into my hands it was nearly completely healed, not even a trace of a scar left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> feet, I do apply Argan oil, but I usually feel that I need more firepower for the poor neglected dears and add higher tech creams that give me an immediate sense of nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last for some time &amp; it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is easily irritated, and has been so dry lately.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the investment in this product is well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> tried it on my face but didn&#x27;t particularly care for the results, but will trust it for it&#x27;s other uses.  </li>
            <li> I rub a small amount into the ends of my hair right after the shower.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and look forward to trying it in other ways.</li>
            <li> For someone who absolutely did not believe I could live without a facial serum and THEN moisturizer, because my skin is SO dry, especially in the winter with the heater on constantly, all I need to do is dab on a few drops of this tremendous product on my face and brush a small quantity through my hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help clear up the dry skin caused by my beard.</li>
            <li> Hair is naturally curly and dry.</li>
            <li> It has transformed my extremely dry, brittle, color treated hair, to soft touchable hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and in winter, it gets quite itchy and scaly.  </li>
            <li> The product must last, and not dry up in the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about using some oil, but I love this product because of its versatility and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I received my little brown bottle of 100% pure organic argan oil.</li>
            <li> Anybody who has purchased a quality product will notice immediately -- it smells terrible, does not absorb properly, and frankly is too good to be true at this price.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this Argan Oil, I had been previously used the common Sephora brand Josie Maran</li>
            <li> Argan oil has nearly cured my dry skin which facilitates treating and controlling the psoriasis (especially on the soles of my feet).  </li>
            <li> I suffered from sensitive really dry red skin that felt like sandpaper !  </li>
            <li> I bought this after using Josie Maran argan oil for a while because it was less expensive and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and greasy, but I put it on as the last thing I do before going to bed and by morning it&#x27;s been well absorbed and on the back of my hands lasts well into the day.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the money because you only need a few drops at a time, so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have shopped around for other essential oil products at high end department store cosmetics counters and have seen such products sell for $60 to $75 for a bottle this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I am 68 year  old lady with very dry skin...  </li>
            <li> I put a little too much on my damp hair after towel drying it</li>
            <li> Maybe I used a little too much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as my high end Josie Moran, but it smells slightly nutty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just recieved my Argan oil within the last couple of days ( I live in the Caribbean and had a friend bring it down )</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, this seems to be completely pure and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is so versatile and pure and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it (mixed with other natural oils) in his beard and no complaints.</li>
            <li> (I have slight case of eczema) than it normally does in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and a newbie of knowing what pure argan oil is and using it.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way for my whole face.</li>
            <li> I believe was applying too much at a time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well on psoriasis, an unexpected plus, and as a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Will have to see what other products she offers</li>
            <li> like there is to some of the other natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li> skin is usually sensitive to other products</li>
            <li> It works really well, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a yellow oil, and comes in a dark bottle with a dropper, so far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face at night</li>
            <li> I have been using another popular big name Argan oil for years and was searching for a less expensive option.</li>
            <li> Another Argan Oil that I tried in the past was too thick and greasy - this is lovely.</li>
            <li> I live in an extreme dry area at altitude</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and the fancy oil I initially bought wasn&#x27;t doing the trick, especially around my mouth/nose.</li>
            <li> Since it arrived I&#x27;ve used it as part of my nightly regime first cleansing with my usual products which dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this on dry hair mid shaft to the ends just a drop or two is enough.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dry facial skin…seems to be working well enough.  </li>
            <li> When I use it it feels a lot more manageable and less broken at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much to use</li>
            <li> I would expect a product like this to cost twice as much as it did if not more.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the smell is, but is very over powering.</li>
            <li> BEWARE-too much is NOT BETTER</li>
            <li> I know I am going to flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops to make your skin feel soft for the entire day.</li>
            <li> Have always used a mixed blend of Argan Oil and was not wild about it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shinier and not so frizzy looking, it only takes a couple of drops and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For those who have normal skin grapeseed oil with a few drops of Argan oil and your set to go.</li>
            <li> originally bought the argan oil help repair my damaged hair, but because of the amount of oil I need to use (I have thick hair down to my waist), I haven&#x27;t gotten into the habit of using it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely look for this product again, but I think this bottle will last for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry, sensitive skin and other heavier products I&#x27;ve used have caused me to have some problems with breakouts and irritation.</li>
            <li> After three hair conditionings, six days of body moisturizing, and four heavy physical work days in the garden, I guess I have replaced five other products, that really were not working to begin with!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After three hair conditionings, six days of body moisturizing, and four heavy physical work days in the garden, I guess I have replaced five other products, that really were not working to begin with!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And a tiny bit of this product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have no dry flaky skin (hard to combat in the winter where I live), I don&#x27;t get anywhere near as oily in my t-zone, and it has even cleared up a couple odd red patchy areas.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of this product in some hand or body lotion and it will make your skin almost new</li>
            <li> Other brands that sell for a little less money are diluted and full of fillers.</li>
            <li> Makes my face soft and wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> also put it on the back of my hands which are so dry.</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out, frizz, and turn brittle without daily conditioning.</li>
            <li> What I have noticed is you have to keep using it because the following day my feet were dry again.  </li>
            <li> morning, all the white, dry skin was almost gone</li>
            <li> With just one week of daily use My dry skin is gone.</li>
            <li> and my face turned back into its&#x27; dry mottled look.</li>
            <li> It has a slight (natural) smell for a moment when I put it on</li>
            <li> Apply small amount, I use it a little because with my sensitive scalp I sometimes get dandruff for some reason when I apply to much.</li>
            <li> , my daughter&#x27;s skin is soft and smooth with no more irritating rashes.</li>
            <li> On day two, I used a few fewer drops and still achieved the same results (without being weighed down by too much oil).</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and very dry skin and using this especially on my hands and feet</li>
            <li> I feel that if you actually get this product to be greasy, you should cut back how much you use by at least half and work up from there if necessary.</li>
            <li> I will then blow dry and use a ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> As an aging white male who would like to hold onto what little he has left of his age, it helps.  </li>
            <li> the product is exactly as described in a small dark bottle.  </li>
            <li> I apply a small amount directly to my scalp and hair strands (Aftican American Hair).</li>
            <li> A few drops, for my long hair I use about 3-4 drops and my hair feels soft, well-moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have long color-treated hair and the argon oil improves the brittle tips.</li>
            <li> Without any strange smelling perfumes added.</li>
            <li> It has now been over two weeks, and I wish I could attach a picture so that you could see the difference, and even though it has not completely reversed the sun damage it has made it look years</li>
            <li> A few drops of this decadent oil applied to my over worked hands, resulted in soft succulent skin.</li>
            <li> My hair is really soft, just fluffy and no split ends.</li>
            <li> This is my (a guy with long hair)</li>
            <li> If you are concerned about the price, it may help to know that one drop of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m long overdue for a cut</li>
            <li> On the evening of my &amp;#34;second day unwashed hair&amp;#34; I will put a generous amount on the tips of my long hair and massage it into my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is a defect or normal.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my long hair from girls all the time and my skin being \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I applied it after washing my long mane</li>
            <li> Now, I simply place 5-10 drops at a time in the palm of my hand, and run it evenly thru her curls that are wet or damp.</li>
            <li> Previously I used a more expensive brand I got at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Way better than that less expensive &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> short, I applied this once a day, and about a week later, I felt a slight difference.</li>
            <li> but this is my new moisturizer when I&#x27;m having those days when I&#x27;m dryer than usual.  </li>
            <li> It was helped in this cold winter as a lip balm, dry hands soother, and for smoothing away static dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It got my hair, face and hands through the incredibly long and dry Maryland winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin weary of thick, heavy creams.</li>
            <li> a single drop goes a long way ...</li>
            <li> Lastly, some other reviewers said the oil smells, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> read that if processed correctly the oil is supposed to last in the bottle 12-18 months, which is about three times longer than any other cosmetic product on the market.</li>
            <li> read that if processed correctly the oil is supposed to last in the bottle 12-18 months, which is about three times longer than any other cosmetic product on the market.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered the Poppy Austin 100% Argan Oil, I had only ever used Argan oil as a hair conditioner, and only in products that had a little bit of Argan oil or a blend of oils.</li>
            <li> I checked amazon and looked at other products in the same price range.</li>
            <li> You only need a little tiny bit at a time.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> I actually use one drop added to my other hair smoothing products, and that&#x27;s all it takes for me.  </li>
            <li> I can also buy some for my daughter who is currently receiving Chemo Treatments and has extremely dry skin due to her treatments.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to stop using it just yet, because she is in the middle of a breakout, but now, she is not as itchy as she usually gets, and she&#x27;s very comfortable, especially at nights.</li>
            <li> It even helps dry skin on your eyelids.</li>

            <li> It worked on my dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> it was miraculous in its assist to my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin cracks and bleeds it gets so dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my dry skin (face/body/hair)  </li>
            <li> any dry areas.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face, where it gets particularly dry, after a shower and didn&#x27;t need another moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I always had a bit of dry flakiness on my chin and sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> Just note that I have dry hands and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a bit of dry skin.</li>
            <li> And with the products I used to combat the acne, my skin stayed dry.  </li>
            <li> My face is brighter, CLEARER, and the dry skin is gone.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I color so even with conditioners, it can be frizzy and dry looking.  </li>
            <li> It may seem counter intuitive to add oil to oily skin, but as you age, you will notice that your skin is dry underneath it all.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair rather often, and this has kept my hair from being so brittle.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair which was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> * on my hair to protect it from heat and dry ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is helping my cracked dry hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found something that can hydrate my skin (really well) without irritating it.</li>
            <li> After just a couple of days my hair already feels much softer and when I comb my hair at the end of the day or the next morning there is no fuzz (which I have never experienced in my life)  </li>
            <li> By the way, You could use this on dry wet legs too (which I did), but I found that if I put lotion on my wet legs it achieved the same results.</li>
            <li> I only need a few drops for face and neck, leaving enough in dropper to pamper dry areas like heels, knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I bought Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil in January and have finally gotten to the last few drops of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few argan oils and this one from Poppy Austin has the characteristic earthy smell (very faint), viscosity, and color of the other good quality argan oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you do a little research it turns out that there are many less expensive oils that will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> its up to you but as per the poppyaustin.com says:&amp;#34;For the avoidance of any doubt, our products are manufactured and sold exclusively by Poppy Austin Limited.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way for me, and it makes my perennially dry hair soft as can be without weighing down.</li>
            <li> My hair is really soft and just fluffy!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and while the oil has made it noticeably softer (for real!)</li>
            <li> I am someone who likes to be clean, but all of the products that I have tried have left me feeling greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> Never saw a change) to low end, such as Cetaphil (thumbs down) to Neutrogena (thumbs down).</li>
            <li> You need so little of it, the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair and a lot of it, but found that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that there is no fragrance, so it smells a little strange.</li>
            <li> This oil applied at night helps keep the dry, flakiness away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that it can also be used in dry hair before styling, and I look forward to trying that out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often sway outside my usual Essential Oils brand to buy another product, but this one stood out from the crowd to me and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it on and off for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> The only slight annoyance is the smell.</li>
            <li> , I realized when I applied the argan oil on my hair wet or dry</li>
            <li> I can put it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use an all-natural African black soap to wash my makeup off and it does the job.</li>
            <li> So I googled and found that Poppy Austin was selling the same thing for a 2oz for a lot lot less.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using argan oil faithfully and it has really been beneficial to my hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; in texture I can use less, especially on my silver hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and it&#x27;s hard, especially in the winter, to keep my skin moisturized without resorting to heavy creams.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work well on my dry skin, it hydrates my already-soft skin that needs a little shine.</li>
            <li> Used for very dry skin and the crows feet areas.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> so my ends are very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has been struggling with very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It gets very dry in MT and helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> my brush is not full of hair at the end of each day as it was prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> But since like many others, I suffer from very dry skin (painful) and frizzy, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Josie Moran Argan Oil, which is a great product but twice as expensive.</li>
            <li> Even though cheaper products may not be 100% argan oil, you don&#x27;t need 100% argan oil, since you only need to use a little of it.</li>
            <li> However, it has a little bit, just tiny, nutty frangrant.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try on my lips and heels also, just a little bit, because I have the same problem there.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair, especially on the ends, to keep them from flying away and to impart a little shine.</li>
            <li> I put on a little extra at night be before I go to be and let it absorb overnight.</li>
            <li> It left my hair a little gressy</li>
            <li> When I bought the trio I had a bit of dry skin around my nose due to using a beauty bar as a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with dry hair that resists every other attempts at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long, long way except when I add it to my developer/bleach.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was my batch or just this brand in general.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for one week, so I am not sure what the long term effects will be, but I am noticing an improvement in the size of pores and the elasticity of my skin overall.  </li>
            <li> Just one or a few drops rubbed into your hands or mixed into water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops and I rub any remaining in my hair to moisturize that also.</li>
            <li> I always put some on my wet hair</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> and I only used a few drops, as recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be curious about whether or not this would make me break out on the long-term, though.</li>
            <li> Have had only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The smell is sort of grassy, and lasts only for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Just received the item, have only been using it a few days.  </li>
            <li> Then, I apply a few drops (5-7) on the palm of my hands and rub the oil several times.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin&#x27;s oil has dramatically improved my skin and hair in just a few days, I can only imagine what this miraculous oil will do with continued use!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m guessing a few drops twice a day, at bedtime and under daily makeup.&lt;br /&gt;~Helena</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to everyday moisturizers and hair products.</li>
            <li> If I use it on my hair I also only use a few drops and for my belly</li>
            <li> I also used a few drops after I got out of the shower to give my hair a bit of extra conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product now as directed for a couple weeks and have seen absolutely no benefit to my hair or skin.</li>
            <li> A few drops should last you for plenty, too.  </li>
            <li> Since starting to use Argan Oil everyday on my skin the sores are healing and</li>
            <li> So I descided to use my John Frieda hair serum that has these silicone ingredient and mix my poppy Austin agran oil with two drops on each side of my hair while wet</li>
            <li> I refused to write as I didn&#x27;t know if this oil will work, but now after few months I and 2 of my kids used it for different treatment ( kids for acne -teenagers-</li>
            <li> Came carefully wrapped.</li>
            <li> I promise, I have absolutely NO connection with the PA Co., nor with Amazon whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It only takes few drops at a time</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL ARGAN OIL.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh, faintly &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; fragrance and the ability to be applied without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with my moisturizer after washing, and my skin is definitely benefiting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Argan Oil by Poppy Austin for a few weeks now, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fully with minimal fuss or bother.</li>
            <li> My layered, shoulder-length hair is thin, fragile, and naturally curly.</li>
            <li> My hair suffers from major damage from bleaching it too much, and when I don&#x27;t use this oil it feels like a dry heap of straw.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long long way, will be using this forever!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my VERY dry skin due to hormone changes after having a baby.  </li>
            <li> I heard miraculous effects about Argan Oil, and after just two applications to my very dry face, it did work miracles!  </li>
            <li> It is NOT easy to find facial products with ZERO fragrance or chemical additives.  </li>
            <li> This Argan Oil came highly recommended, I was slightly skeptical, but after only 2 days of use I noticed a change in the softness of my beard.</li>
            <li> Being a transitional natural (omitting relaxers from my hair regimen) going on 4 years now, it&#x27;s been difficult trying to find oils that help enhance the natural beauty in my hair, as opposed to weighing it down and looking overly shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is not really superb, but I suppose that pure Argan oil is not fragranced at all!</li>
            <li> I decided to read the label and saw that all it had was 100% Argan oil and that it was cold pressed and filtered to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li> After using my every day conditioner and putting Argan only on the ends, I used it all over my head just a little less at the scalp.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, a little goes a long way too</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for my face, scalp, and rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> But a little Argan oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I cant say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I find a little bit of Argan Oil goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Highly  recommend.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can tell this little bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> in my 30&#x27;s and still breaking out, I&#x27;ve seen less breakouts since using the oil in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick and dry hair</li>
            <li> recommended to 2 other people</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil is not as oily as other beauty.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after I start using it</li>
            <li> I put 3 drops (2 in the summer) in the palm of my hand and use the fingertips of my other hand to dab and spread it on my face.</li>
            <li> my shoulder and lower back, and my feet, and the rest of me got my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this brand or any other.</li>
            <li> suffer a lot of hair damage due to sun, salt and chlorine.</li>
            <li> I also take a small amount a rub on the back of my scalp at night before bed.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil does what my other moisturizing creams can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to find not only did it moisturize well with a small amount, but it also kept my skin well moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to choose this brand over any other if you are in the market.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been looking for a way to make your hair look and feel healthier without the sticky or crunchy feeling of other products, give this one a try</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair with other oils and shea butter.</li>
            <li> After I ordered it, I researched some of the other uses and decided to experiment.</li>
            <li> I use this oil exclusively instead of other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I tried another brand of argan oil and was disappointed, I&#x27;m glad I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> I put a small, not even dime-sized amount in my hair after washing it, and it left it looking oily.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way!</li>
            <li> not all these other chemicals I don&#x27;t know about.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Everything I found was blended with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops, otherwise, your hair will be a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely haopy with my poppy austin argan oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other oil on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I left off my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I got this recently with the bottle just in bubble-wrap (no box for the bottle or any usual instructions and documents) and the oil leaked all over the bag and the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will definately try the other products in the Poppy Austin line.</li>
            <li> I no longer need any products other than this argan oil.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair softer, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will help with my breakage because I&#x27;ve only used it for three days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but my results are undeniable.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was not entirely sure if this product would do what I hoped.</li>
            <li> for other uses, I rely on it as a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The other four were chemicals or preservatives.  </li>
            <li> Cycolensatasiloxane,dimethicone, &amp; cycolmethicone are in alot of hair products and makeup products they are silicones that temporary condition your hair with other ingredients that also can benefit even more.........like agran oil.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> IT CONTAINS NO PERFUMES OR OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face, hair and skin as well as adding it to other products.</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oils, but nothing compares to this one.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling like other brands.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave it oily like some other products that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Poppy Austin instead of my usual brand (Josie Maran) in order to save money.  </li>
            <li> Any other brand I have investigated is inferior.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I’ve been trying all kinds of moisturizers and night crèmes, very few things actually work for me.  </li>
            <li> The condition of dry, frizzies is going away!!!  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil lets me keep my hair long without needing it trimmed all the time and serves to tame the frizz, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like a goat or cow farm.</li>
            <li> Reminded me of cow manure.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave me feeling like I have dirty, oil hair.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick, long hair, so the ends can get a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It has not weighted down my hair like other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> , I was a bit skeptical about this Pure Organic Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  </li>
            <li> I think it was a result of me being too harsh on my skin in combination with a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> Use it at least daily.</li>
            <li> Argan oil should be purchased in a dark bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easily absorbed by my skin, it feels greasy.</li>
            <li> The dark glass bottles (I wouldn&#x27;t buy oil bottled in plastic) -</li>
            <li> Seems the dark spots on my hands have faded, too, since using it.</li>
            <li> Loved this oil except for one exception: it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I have course, thick, curly hair, and it has never been manageable without me spending several hours a day on it.</li>
            <li> This winter has been tough to deal with, but argan oil has helped me overcome dry skin not only on my face but my hands.  </li>
            <li> This product smoothed it all without weighing it down or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Put in on my hair and waited all day for it to absorb, instead it was greasy and weight down.</li>
            <li> Put in on my hair and waited all day for it to absorb, instead it was greasy and weight down.</li>
            <li> It still retains moisture due to this oil!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sad to say that it leaves my skin very oily after a few hours (which the other brand didn&#x27;t do), and I only use a couple small drops!  </li>
            <li> This oil has helped my severely cracked and dry hands to get softer in just a few applications!  </li>
            <li> I bought the Poppy Austin argan oil to try on her to see if it would help with the dry patches that she usually gets when she breaks out.</li>
            <li> I must say that within a week of using the oil, her skin is no longer as dry and scaly as it usually looks when she breaks out.</li>
            <li> I had slight dark circles..and they are now all lightened..</li>
            <li> If it is actually real (not just another oil marketed as argan as often happens), it is of very very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Goops of oil in July, decreasing as it gets less humid, down to four drops in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have also added a few drop to my moisturizer ( body&amp;face), and have not had any breakouts, which I have had from other oils.</li>
            <li> I could still tell where I had placed the oil on my face, as the wrinkles were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Seems oily for Black hair, though,</li>
            <li> grandmother told me years ago to put olive oil on my hands before bed; suppose to help them wrinkle less as you age.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super deal.</li>
            <li> My face showed less puffiness and redness</li>
            <li> I can see it does a difference, my hair is less frizzy that it would be with nothing.</li>
            <li> I received this product about a week and a half ago</li>
            <li> I’ve noticed too that I break out a lot less after having used the product.</li>
            <li> No more dry flakiness!</li>
            <li> Poppy&#x27;s Argan oil is thicker, so less is needed. , and I feel it penetrates quicker.</li>
            <li> And you use a lot less.  </li>
            <li> Even then, I&#x27;d get maybe half a day of calmness from my curls before they would frizz out.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odd smell when using it, but that goes away once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> , I have very dry heels and usually spend all winter with vaseline and socks to keep them from cracking.</li>
            <li> I researched long and hard about how the oil is made, where it comes from and the benefits of its use and decided to try Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t diminish a few sun damage dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a mess of frizzy hair ever since my adolescence.  </li>
            <li> have long hair which is fairly thick.</li>
            <li> I recently had a miscarriage and after that my hormones have been crazy therefore causing a major acne breakout.</li>
            <li> She especially likes it because of how it stops the incessant, dry skin itching that occurs in cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the scent, it is not a pleasant one.</li>
            <li> The oil is expensive but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight sesame seed oil smell that I&#x27;m not a fan of, but my mom couldn&#x27;t smell it at all and the smell goes away in a few seconds, anyway.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and my skin gets very dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I also rubbed 2-3 drops between my palms and smoothed it over my hair after drying to tame frizzing and add shine without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> In my search for moisturizing oil for everyday use, I previously used jojoba oil which made my hair look oiled-shiny but still left it dry, weird</li>
            <li> I had gel nails for a little while which totally ruined my already weak nails.  </li>
            <li> Little fragrance, nothing too overpowering though&lt;</li>
            <li> I often use NO hair products before blow drying..just a little Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased in the past from other manufacture&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit to get use to the application process.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of experimenting to find the correct amount to use.</li>
            <li> One little bottle of Argan oil does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little on my hair after I wash it and</li>
            <li> just a little gressy shine which isn&#x27;t want I just wanted.</li>
            <li> but at times my eyes are affected by this oil; they tend to burn a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little o&lt;br /&gt;Ily</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off putting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, one night, my wife came home from work with a little brown bottle with a drop of something in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> After a long summer in the sun my hair needed some serious help.</li>
            <li> I hate spending a ton of money on hair products when my hair just soaks it up so quickly!</li>
            <li> but I cannot use it as a final styling tough at all.</li>
            <li> FYI, I have tried other argan oil brands and they did not work as well on my hair as this brand does!!</li>
            <li> So much for &#x27;cold pressed&#x27; as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product at night on my face,decollete, &amp; hands and it has done wonders during these harsh winter months.  </li>
            <li> (I put it on rather heavy at night), and then light-touch up after blow-dry, if needed, during the day.  </li>
            <li> I felt like crying when I saw the results.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my hair, and left cheek where I have a broken blood vessel.</li>
            <li> I like the glass bottle and dropper which helps get all the product out and waste none.</li>
            <li> A few of my friends recommended it for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Applying the Aragon oil (just a few drops) to towel-dried hair followed by a hair dryer after a couple of minutes has made a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I just rub a few drops in my hands and stroke through my hair, and the itchy dryness in my hair is soothed immediately.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using it, as it helped my hair become a bit stronger, and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to use a few drops.</li>
            <li> I used it as an intensive conditioner - just a few drops on my scalp and massaged it in, then leave for a few minutes before washing.</li>
            <li> are a few ways I put it to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a heavy oil from others that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I also added a few drops of this oil to my hair conditioner and was in awe of the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Poppy Austin argan oil a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for my hands when they are dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in my hair now either before or after I style it and just use a few drops.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hands and rub them together an ran my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hands and rub them together an ran my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell was no problem at all after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I let it set a few minutes and there is no tell tale sign of oiliness.</li>
            <li> I decided to rub a few drops into my hair.</li>
            <li> so you do have to wait a few minutes before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my hands and rub through the ends of my hair while damp.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck and hands everyday</li>
            <li> A few drops will do you!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out everyday.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results on my skin in a few month.</li>
            <li> I feel the difference in my skin after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have used it for few days but for some reasons ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a few drops of this Argan oil on my face each morning.  </li>
            <li> I would say u can use any hair serum that it&#x27;s made for hair smoothing or silky and mix a few drops depending on hair type with it</li>
            <li> A few drops of this oil</li>
            <li> Just a few drops per container of skin cream.</li>
            <li> It comes protectively packaged to guard against breakage and came just a few days after ordering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received quite a few complements about  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face with avacado oil and a few drops of Argan oil to face and neck.  </li>
            <li> As long as its 100% agran oil, cold press, properly filtered, nothing added or taken or away in a dark bottle with a droplet</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before I wrote a review on this.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a few drops into my hands before running them through my pre hair-dryed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike some leave in hair products I have tried over the years, this does not in any way leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full marks to Poppy Austin, 5 stars all round.</li>
            <li> Less, in this case, is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My skin seems to be smoother with less small lines.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have the least bit of a rancid smell at all and without the addition of other scents there is nothing to hide it if it did.</li>
            <li> I grew up being called \\&quot;Fuzzy\\&quot;, \\&quot;Fluffy\\&quot;, and all sorts of names associated with being born with extremely curly, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Even if they were controlling the frizz, I felt like everyone could see the stiff parts of my hair.  </li>
            <li> AND IT TAME MY FRIZZY HAIR</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended I try either diamond oil or argon oil to help tame my split ends.</li>
            <li> I thought there was no more hope, thinking that it was a part of ageing that I had to accept but was I wrong - the frizz all gone, and every morning I wake up to soft bouncy hair</li>
            <li> For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails is only $19.99, which is less expensive than this bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning to Josie Maran after twice ordering and returning this one (thought at first I had maybe received a bad sample).</li>
            <li> Although it smells pretty bad, but can be used considering as a medicine because it worked miracles for my hair.</li>
            <li> I also use a few drops of the Argan Oil every few days on my hair ~ LUXURIOUS!</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and have a hard time finding products that condition my hair, without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> It smells rather rancid, which prompts me to suspect that the source of the argan kernels were not from raw fruits but from goats that have already digested these fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, the sun, sand, and surf makes my normally dry hair even worse.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil does not smell offensive and this brand being organic, I know I don&#x27;t have to fret about the bevy of nasty chemicals I read in certain products like it at the major drug store retail chains.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands that I have tried over the years, this Argan Oil was really not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> You need very little (1-3 drops) for your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it is all they say it is.  </li>
            <li> At first I began breaking out and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or overly fraganced, nothing artificial...</li>
            <li> if not better</li>
            <li> I put a small amount in the palm of my hands, rub them together and distribute all over my hair.  </li>
            <li> I started putting a small drop in my hand lotion and put that on my hands in the morning and before bed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually fall for this type of stuff...</li>
            <li> No more oil slick on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would purchase again</li>
            <li> I also use a small amount on my hair after every washing.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m too lazy to do all that.</li>
            <li> I have a small child</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews, I usually use Josie Maran</li>
            <li> Not a favorite at all</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist told me to find an over the counter product that contains urea (the prescription one&#x27;s are outrageously expensive), and it&#x27;s the only one I found.</li>
            <li> Since using this, I have had no more break outs.  </li>
            <li> I am mother of 8 and my hair often suffers as a result of my busy life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Josie Moran&#x27;s Argan Oil product for almost 2 years and switched to Poppy Austin within the past month</li>
            <li> I was anxious</li>
            <li> Hair usually grows an inch a month</li>
            <li> Within a few days my skin looked clearer, softer, luminous!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product a took some time to do it.</li>
            <li> you usually get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and it is now all she uses on her face - no more wrinkle creams, eye creams, etc.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs after a few minutes and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> Argan oil also works wonders for the rest of your body, especially for your cuticles and those creepy elbows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in this product now!</li>
            <li> It can be used by itself, but I find that I usually want to mix in with a thicker skin lotion.</li>
            <li> Sorry just not the same as I am use too!</li>
            <li> I finally was totally sick of having acne AND patchy dry skin around my nose and mouth</li>
            <li> I have been taking medications and having infusions for RA, LUPUS plus other frustrating conditions.  </li>
            <li> thank you the shop/company who sold this to me and sorry for not replying to your long and polite email of 2014;</li>
            <li> I have hair that frizzes in low humidity and gets outrageously frizzy in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> The feel of this is similar, but the initial smell is very unpleasant: almost as if the oil is rancid.</li>
            <li> I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to beat for day to day moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard sometimes to find a product that truly lives up to its claim.</li>
            <li> so finding a moisturizer that hydrates and doesn&#x27;t irritate can be hard.</li>
            <li> My hair felt greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> I have skin issues and it&#x27;s hard to get products to blend with my skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a mosturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to burn and peel.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad dry spot on my nose that seemed to be spreading despite my using almond oil and the other skin care products.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to at least check it out.</li>
            <li> Item does not own up to what I was told it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about the farmyard smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought different brand in health food stored and was unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Works at least as well as fancy name brands...</li>
            <li> especially in all of this cold weather</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re both organic and cold pressed FOR THE SAME PRICE!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been hearing a lot about argan oil lately</li>
            <li> In addition, my acne spots are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> the forced drying heat/air inside our homes, etc.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear thick of greasy.</li>
            <li> I opened this and tried a bit although I was very leery due to the terrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Moderator: Before you delete this review, take a look at all the other fake 5 stars reviews and judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I grab my morracon oil hair product and came to see that the agran oil was the 5th ingredients with other weird ingredient in front of it that I didn&#x27;t understand what it was.</li>
            <li> This morning I tried it on the dry patches on my sons scalp and when I picked him up from pre-school I was shocked to see that the area hadn&#x27;t dried during those hours.</li>
            <li> Some similar essential oils and products smell terrible, but I don&#x27;t notice the odor of this oil whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have seriously damaged hair from bleaching and dying it all sades of the rainbow.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit odd, but is extremely faint and fades within a minute or so.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> The oil itself seems very similar to the JM brand (consistency and the way it absorbs into your skin), however it smells really bad...</li>
            <li> Have any of you noticed the scent or is it possible that I got a bad one?</li>
            <li> and my skin stays hydrated all day even in the bitter cold weather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only was it knocking his confidence, you could see that it was painful, too.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my extra dry skin areas (elbows are the worst!)</li>
            <li> She showed me that she has been using Moroccan oil, her little secret, but it&#x27;s quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying from Josie Maran when I suspected her argan oil was deodorized, which could only mean that the smell was unpleasant because the kernels were from a questionable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the smell is not terribly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant, but not repugnant either.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I could not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> however it is pricey and it was very hard to spend the money on it.  </li>
            <li> I think that it will work well on my hands in the winter--they get very dry, cracked, and painful.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I started off with having thin, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> smells terrible and is VERY greasy</li>
            <li> I use it for my hands, as a night moisturizer around my face, on ends of my hair and for my tired, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced that before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bashing this product, but I do expect a company to stand behind its labeling.</li>
            <li> The idea of putting oil on my skin was a little scary but to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that its smells awful.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the nutty smell.</li>
            <li> I received my order today &amp; a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and usually breaks out really bad every six months.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed at this time!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and would like to know if anyone else is having the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it seems counterintuitive to add oil to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Switching shampoos (expensive ones), hair mask every week, but these didn&#x27;t solve the problem at all.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew and the way it was expensive.</li>
            <li> there is objection to my hypothesis, please prove me wrong by providing ne valid documentation for the production methods of this product.</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive cuticle or foot cream.</li>
            <li> it has a weird smell but</li>
            <li> Can&#x60;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I thought what the heck ill try it out, hopefully</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think Ill be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a product like that for African-American hair.</li>
            <li> The price is expensive.</li>
            <li> The weird smell is gone as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical,  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of using Argan oil on my face, but after hearing about this product I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Sorry, the argan oil ordered 4/18 is still in transit.  </li>
            <li> I have bought really expensive creams with stuff in it that I can&#x27;t pronounce</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but</li>
            <li> how can you go wrong with an oil that can be use on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> My oil doesn&#x27;t have a weird scent to it, some people described it as a nutty smell.</li>
            <li> but after I saw the results I felt obliged to write this long and boring review.</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on my nails and cuticles and my annoying, hard cuticles</li>
            <li> I prefer cold pressed products as I know how they are made, and what ingredients &#x60;don&#x27;t&#x27; get into them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In morning, I use an acne prone cleanser and wash it away with cold water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan because it&#x27;s organic, cold pressed, and they contribute a percentage of each purchase to women in Morocco.</li>
            <li> We put the argan oil in our bath water and I put a few drops on the area where my son has eczema the worst.</li>
            <li> Before buying I read the reviews about the nutty smell that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive,</li>
            <li> I use Poppy Austin Argan Oil every evening instead of a very expensive cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li> If proven to be false, I would be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the bad reviews this product received.</li>
            <li> could it be a bad batch or is this the norm, or it is in the processing?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really bad acne, but I do get monthly breakouts.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the bad reviews this product received.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was a bit hesitant to leave 5 stars cuz of the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> All these bad reviews on here scared me.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> I also used it to massage my painful swealing veins .</li>
            <li> Disappointed, i was hoping this would replace josie maran&#x27;s argan oil</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Girls throw out what you have now and start using this, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Argan oil for my hair to compare it with MOraccan Oil and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the advertising and packaging.  </li>
            <li> While I am  disappointed now, I hope it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I purchased this product base on the description of it&#x27;s benefits.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at bed time and in the morning as a base to my moisturizer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but it smells terrible!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how horrific it smells.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to moisturizer for the brutal winter.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> So I decided I wanted to buy it till I saw the stupid outrageous price.  </li>
            <li> When fall and winter arrive, it can be very painful as the skin seems to crack.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I made a rookie mistake and put about 8 drops to my hair, result was of course terrible!</li>
            <li> , I absolutely hate overpaying!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too terribly oily either, it&#x27;s a bit thicker than I thought.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> His terrible acne, despite everything we threw at it, just would not recede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not get greasy (use sparingly) and I haven&#x27;t detected any awful smells as some reviews have suggested.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not great. Just okay.  Found something that I like better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say, other than I can&#x27;t really use this because it smells like cheese. Literally, like cheese.</li>
            <li> This is awesome and the best there is for the skin, wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Best skin moisturizer in the world! I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face. My skin never dries out if I use argan oil.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  It does wonders for your face, all over body and hair.  I use us 3&#x3D;4 times daily and can really see changes in my face.  ts woarth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  My skin is easily irritated, and has been so dry lately.  I&#x27;ve finally found something that can hydrate my skin (really well) without irritating it.</li>
            <li> Smells natural. light, not too oily</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Great for skin and hair.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Does help frizzy hair, but don&#x27;t put on too much. Just one or a few drops rubbed into your hands or mixed into water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s quite expensive. Even though cheaper products may not be 100% argan oil, you don&#x27;t need 100% argan oil, since you only need to use a little of it.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. I started with an Argan Oil that I didn&#x27;t realize at the time of purchase was one of five oils on the bottle. I got it from a highly-revered natural foods store, so didn&#x27;t even question the product.  No wonder it was inexpensive! I should have read the fine print.&lt;br /&gt;The pure stuff is so much better...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, this product is so true to what they discribe. I really felt difference on my skin the first time I tried. This oil works wonder specially on my hair, I put small amount on my hair and sculp before I dry my hair and my hair haven&#x27;t felt this nice for a really really long time. My hair looks and feel beautiful. I will defenitly repurchase this again.</li>
            <li> Number one reason my hair has become healthy, has grown longer than it ever has, and maintains softness. Brilliant product.</li>
            <li> Great Argan Oil at a great value.</li>
            <li> Best product for dry to combination skin, it is really luxurious leaving your skin feel great. I use it from head to toe after every shower.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It helps my color stay in my hair and it is always silky smooth.  Literally 2 drops is all I need.  I have a bob though.  It is also a great all around moisturizer.  My 2yo has eczema and during a flair I put it on and almost instantly the redness subsided.  I cant say enough how great of a product this is.</li>
            <li> Got it really fast and it is great on my skin. Makes my face soft and wrinkles are less noticeable. Love the product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great for my combination skin – completely balanced it within 3 weeks. Just got the second bottle. The first one lasted more than six months. Amazing. Will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and is not greasy. Absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> First time user&lt;br /&gt;Looked through every listed product of this nature&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy with purchase&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way..no unpleasant smell ..skin feels tremendous after about a couple of weeks use&lt;br /&gt;Great value...great product!&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended to 2 other people</li>
            <li> FYI you only get one bottle although it shows three in the photo. I feel it is misleading to show more than you will actually receive in the photo.</li>
            <li> Very good. Have re-ordered.</li>
            <li> This was the first Poppy Austin product I used.  I had gel nails for a little while which totally ruined my already weak nails.  I researched what to use and read that argon oil was great for rejuvenating nails. I then checked out several argon oils and found that all of them were not the same, many were diluted. Then I found Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil which is 100% pure organic. l use it on my nails and hands twice a day.  It only takes a few drops and I rub any remaining in my hair to moisturize that also. My nails have greatly improved over the past few months since I started using it. I then started using all of their other fabulous products.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!!! Excellent value and the best argan oil out there!</li>
            <li> nice for hair and face</li>
            <li> I just found out about argan oil about four months ago and I have been using it ever sense I am 86 years old and my skin looks amazing. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it and will absolutely keep using it thank you</li>
            <li> First and foremost the delivery came even faster than expected; so that was a pleasant surprise.  As for the product....PHENOMENAL!! I&#x27;ve been using this product at night on my face,decollete, &amp; hands and it has done wonders during these harsh winter months.  My skin looks amazing and refreshed.  My skins feels so hydrated and unbelievably smooth. I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Good seller. I&#x27;ve very impressed with the quality of this product and would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is just as advertised. It is excellent for my hair but I don&#x27;t use it everytime I wash it. Just every 3 or 4 days. A little goes a long way and my hair seems to stay nice as long as I don&#x27;t use too much. I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Good hair product. I&#x27;m sure I will see the positive results soon.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of Argan oil and this is by far my favorite. It really does feel exquisite! My hair and nails LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Great skin conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lotion junkie since I was 15 (and am in my 30s now), but after reading about the unregulated chemicals and preservatives in skincare products I&#x27;ve been swayed to use face oils. I started out with a pricey oil combination that I loved but was setting me back $60/oz. I have dry skin, and the fancy oil I initially bought wasn&#x27;t doing the trick, especially around my mouth/nose. I decided to make my own concoction and started with argan oil mixed with a little rosehip oil. This combo really did the trick and though I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed it, being a lotion snob, I&#x27;m a complete convert. This was the first Argan oilI tried, but it seems to have a reasonable price for the purity, and my skin likes it. My diet is rich in organic veggies, fish etc 75% of the time and is less than perfect the other quarter, but I have yet to break out using this product and have been using it for several weeks. Lastly, some other reviewers said the oil smells, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have long color-treated hair and the argon oil improves the brittle tips.</li>
            <li> Very nice light weight oil.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair. I made a rookie mistake and put about 8 drops to my hair, result was of course terrible! I got the greasy looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;Using it for about a couple of weeks now, I am down to 3 drops which is the golden number for me. My curly frizzy hair is perfect now!</li>
            <li> Big difference between this product and the &amp;#34;MoroccanOil&amp;#34; blue-box product.  The oil stays with you much longer, is thicker, and doesn&#x27;t smell of fragrances that have been added.  It&#x27;s a nice leave-in at night to those dry ends (I put it on rather heavy at night), and then light-touch up after blow-dry, if needed, during the day.  Any excess on my hands, I apply to my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried different beauty oil product.  Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil is not as oily as other beauty.  It just blends with my skin perfectly.  However, it has a little bit, just tiny, nutty frangrant.  I skin has more glow and my skin texture has been changing go healthy looking.</li>
            <li> very nice Argan Oil.  Not too heavy, goes lightly onto my skin.  I can wear this even during the day, as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy look or feel to my face.  I combine it with a couple drops of Organic Rosehip Oil - hoping for noticeable results.  I would definitely purchase this brand again.  Another Argan Oil that I tried in the past was too thick and greasy - this is lovely.</li>
            <li> I am using this for face and hands here in the Dallas winter (well, sorta winter) and the argon oil has been helpful.  Lotion, facial moisturizers and humidifiers are not enough to keep my 70 y.o. skin  hydrated and comfortable, but use of the argon oil has reduced the dryness.  I use it morning and night, plus slap some on during the day when I feel crispy.  If I give it some soak in-time, I can use a little foundation over top.  Oil on my cuticles is an essential part of my home manicure and keeps these nails looking salon perfect all the time.  Just be sure to use on barely moistened skin, wherever you put it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after I start using it I was so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;just a couple of tropes applied it to my face  for about 1 week and my skin feels so soft.&lt;br /&gt;after I applied it to my face I just rubbed my hands through my hair  to use everything from this wonderful oil.&lt;br /&gt;I know I would buy this oil again&lt;br /&gt;thanks for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil is great. I have been using every night after cleansing my face and found it to make my face smoother and my complexion has remained clear. Very happy with this product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and I find it to be a very effective moisturizer for my skin. I have somewhat dry, sensitive skin and other heavier products I&#x27;ve used have caused me to have some problems with breakouts and irritation. This product is gentle and seems to be absorbed by the skin rather quickly compared to other oils I&#x27;ve used. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It&#x27;s also priced well, it tends to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This was no for me I dont know</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not sure that it is all they say it is.  Still working with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a face moisturizer for about 2 months and was really excited. It arrived fast and no damages. This is in a glass bottle, dark so the light doesn&#x27;t penetrate (it&#x27;s a good thing). At first I began breaking out and was disappointed.  I believe was applying too much at a time as a little goes a long way. Now I use about 3 drops max with wet hands and rub it on my face and the breakouts stopped and my skin is bright and soft. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The is a different formulation than I&#x27;ve used before, and it is very nice. It goes on easily (light patting all over the face). The fragrance is extremely mild, which is more than fine. And I like the way my skin looks and feels after it has had a chance to settle.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever purchased for my face, neck, and hair. Does not clog my pours and is so light you can&#x27;t even feel it on your skin!</li>
            <li> It even helps dry skin on your eyelids. And you need just a tiny bit!  Great on curly hair also, just mix 1-2 drops in your normal styling product</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  I have tried just about every product out there, and the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is by far the BEST facial moisturizer I have ever had!  Thank you for making outstanding, affordable, and natural products!</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair.  It goes to my lower back and had a client tell me to use Argan Oil but had a lot of difficulty finding some at local stores.  I found Poppy Austin and love it!  I use it on my hair and face.  It is a great moisturizer!  I always put some on my wet hair especially is I know I am going to flat iron my hair.  My boyfriend uses it (mixed with other natural oils) in his beard and no complaints.</li>
            <li> Being a transitional natural (omitting relaxers from my hair regimen) going on 4 years now, it&#x27;s been difficult trying to find oils that help enhance the natural beauty in my hair, as opposed to weighing it down and looking overly shiny. But, since purchasing and trying Poppy Austin&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil, I&#x27;m excited to say that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and adds just enough shine to intensify the healthiness in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried argan oil before from other brands and believe that this oil definitely achieves what I was looking for in my search for the best argan oil, plus more:&lt;br /&gt;- It repairs frizz and split ends on hair&lt;br /&gt;- Capable of treating damaged skin and acne&lt;br /&gt;- Capable of repairing damaged nails&lt;br /&gt;- Very light and non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Little fragrance, nothing too overpowering though&lt;br /&gt;- Natural, organic and pure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This product leaves a nice silky finish with plenty of shine. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very nice and great price!</li>
            <li> This oil is the real deal! I have tried a few argan oils and this one from Poppy Austin has the characteristic earthy smell (very faint), viscosity, and color of the other good quality argan oils I have tried. It&#x27;s also EcoCert certified which is something I look for as an extra assurance that it is real, diluted argan oil. I have been using argan oil on my skin as a moisturizer for about 9 months and I love it. Because I have combination skin, I thought it might make my skin too greasy, but it&#x27;s actually had the opposite effect--I don&#x27;t look as greasy by the end of the day as when I used regular moisturizer. I put 3 drops (2 in the summer) in the palm of my hand and use the fingertips of my other hand to dab and spread it on my face. I find that if my face is still a bit damp from washing that it makes this easier. I really feel like the texture and evenness of my skin has improved a lot since I started this regime, but I didn&#x27;t take any photos, so I can&#x27;t prove it definitively. But I am enjoying the simplicity of my routine and there is something to be said for using a basic, natural product instead of a lotion with lots of unpronounceable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the argan oil help repair my damaged hair, but because of the amount of oil I need to use (I have thick hair down to my waist), I haven&#x27;t gotten into the habit of using it. To oil my amount of hair (damp and post-wash) it takes 20-30 drops, but for my daughter I use only 3-5, so the amount of hair you have definitely makes a difference. I do need to try it though because my hair stylist claims that argan oil really helped her hair when she overprocessed it. My hair has not been chemically processed, but because of the length I do get some breakage. I do sometimes use the argan oil to smooth my hair and take the frizz out (when it&#x27;s dry) and it works very well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first 1 oz bottle lasted me about 6 months, so I expect this 2 oz bottle to last about a year, used primarily on my face.</li>
            <li> I just received my Argan Oil yesterday, and I decided to test it on my face. I placed the oil on the right side of my face in the morning, and again before I went to bed. When I got up this morning I was amazed. I could still tell where I had placed the oil on my face, as the wrinkles were less noticeable. I cannot wait to see how it is after using it for a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also put it on the back of my hands which are so dry. Yet, as dry as my hands were, the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is so rich, that it only took one drop on the back of my hand to do both hands. Then they felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase, this product is as good as it says it is.</li>
            <li> This Pure Organic Argan Oil is a top notch product.  I am a swimmer and my skin and nails and cuticles are always so dry and cracked  from the chlorine.. This oil is such a soothing relief for my skin and nails.  It also gives a nice healthy glow to my face.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft and healthy skin! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often sway outside my usual Essential Oils brand to buy another product, but this one stood out from the crowd to me and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I knew that Argan Oil had been used for centuries for culinary purposes, for its peanut buttery taste, and used in lots of Moroccan cooking. However, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with it&#x27;s cosmetic uses until recently, nor that it could help my achy pains I often have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is known to be great for the skin and hair, and I can testify that it works!&lt;br /&gt;*I have dry patchy skin but only in various places such as my right cheek, my right elbow where my arm rests on my desk 15 hours a day, and my feet.&lt;br /&gt;* I have normal to oily scalp but frizzy split ends.  &lt;br /&gt;* I have body aches from getting older, especially from physical labor. &lt;br /&gt;So with all of my problems that I have rolled into one, this product met the needs of each. When I saw it go on sale, I grabbed it while I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have important prerequisites for any product I use.&lt;br /&gt; * They must be 100% Pure and Organic, and be Ecologically Certified and approved.   &lt;br /&gt;* I prefer cold pressed products as I know how they are made, and what ingredients &#x60;don&#x27;t&#x27; get into them.  &lt;br /&gt;* They must be for all skin types, as mine is across the board as I am aging.  &lt;br /&gt;* They must not be oily on my hands as I type all day. * The product must last, and not dry up in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil by Poppy Austin has met all my requirements and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I simply applied it to my cheek, my elbow, my shoulder and lower back, and my feet, and the rest of me got my usual moisturizer. It worked so good I began using is all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same thing happen with my split ends. After using my every day conditioner and putting Argan only on the ends, I used it all over my head just a little less at the scalp. It brushed through my long hair just marvelously, and the ends dried just as smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I am only a week into using my Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan oil, but I can&#x27;t say enough how quickly I noticed the positive changes. After three hair conditionings, six days of body moisturizing, and four heavy physical work days in the garden, I guess I have replaced five other products, that really were not working to begin with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that if processed correctly the oil is supposed to last in the bottle 12-18 months, which is about three times longer than any other cosmetic product on the market. However, as it is this good, I am sure I will use it all long before then..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I am only a week into using my Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan oil, but I can&#x27;t say enough how quickly I noticed the positive changes.

            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was a bit timid when I ordered this product.  There has not been a time in my life where I have not had frizzy, uncontrollable hair.  I grew up being called \\&quot;Fuzzy\\&quot;, \\&quot;Fluffy\\&quot;, and all sorts of names associated with being born with extremely curly, thick hair.  I have spent more money that I would like to admit on products that promised to \\&quot;tame my mane\\&quot;.  It was frustrating.  I am someone who likes to be clean, but all of the products that I have tried have left me feeling greasy and dirty.  Even if they were controlling the frizz, I felt like everyone could see the stiff parts of my hair.  For the last several months, I have honestly worn my hair up every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Argan Oil by Poppy Austin as one last shot.  Autumn was coming, my favorite time of year, and I wanted one last shot to let my hair down and enjoy myself.  Compared to other brands that I have tried over the years, this Argan Oil was really not that expensive.  I liked it because it was organic (the more chemicals, usually, the more my hair protests).  It made me feel good to see that the company took time to protectively wrap the bottle before sending it.  Upon opening it, I did smell a tiny but of a nutty smell but it was not offensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, of course, tried it immediately.  I towel-dried my hair and gently worked fingertip-sized portions over some of my problems areas.  I felt like crying when I saw the results.  I thought that it was too good to be true, but as my hair completely dried, it stayed full, not frizzy.  I kept touching it all all.  I could not believe that I finally had the hair that I have been trying to get my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more bottles, especially since I finally did try it on my skin.  My husband and I have a new baby and he kept rubbing the baby&#x27;s cheeks to compare them to my own skin.  It really does make your skin feel soft and CLEAN.  I cannot stress enough how CLEAN this product feels.  Your face does not feel like you just dipped it in peroxide either.  It feels so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely recommending this to all of the girls are work!  Thank you, Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. Seems oily for Black hair, though, and I only used a few drops, as recommended.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about the benefits of Argan Oil and I decided to at least check it out. I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic that it could live up to everything I had heard, but surprisingly it did! The first thing I decided to give it a try on was my hands.  I have extremely dry skin on my hands, even in the summer. When fall and winter arrive, it can be very painful as the skin seems to crack. This product has done wonders!! I was mostly worried about a greasy feel but it soaked right in with no problems. My hands now feel AND look a million times better. I decided to give it a try on my lips and heels also, just a little bit, because I have the same problem there. It made such a big difference. The last thing I tried it on was my hair. I have naturally curly hair and between the humidity where I live and the blow dryer, etc that I use, my hair often has a frizzy or brittle look around the ends. This product smoothed it all without weighing it down or looking greasy. I love how versatile it is and I seem to keep finding new uses for it. I not only recommend it but I am buying another bottle. It&#x27;s well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Just got this little bottle of Argan Oil yesterday, and I am already in love with it.  I&#x27;ve tried many oil products in a search to find one that works exactly like this one does!  It&#x27;s not heavy or overly fraganced, nothing artificial...just Pure Argan Oil! I purchased this to use on my hair.  Living in Florida, the sun, sand, and surf makes my normally dry hair even worse.  Most of the other products I have used leave my hair heavy or oily looking, this one doesn&#x27;t.  It absorbs in almost immediately leaving soft waves and manageable soft to the touch hair.  And unlike chemical or silicon based products, I don&#x27;t feel the need to wash my hands after applying, I just rub the remaining Argan oil into my hands and nails.  It absorbs very quickly and my normally dry hands are soft again.  Thankfully, a little goes a long way too, no need to hide the bottle from my teen. The included dropper makes it easy to not over do it.  Definitely keeping this stuff around</li>
            <li> The product arrived on schedule and it was securely wrapped in bubble paper. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair for 7-10 days, and I like the fact that it&#x27;s not heavy and it does not leave a scent of any kind behind. It&#x27;s dispensed with a dropper so you control how much you want to use and where you&#x27;d like it to be placed.</li>
            <li> What I like best about this argan oil is that it is 100% pure and organic. If you look at the ingredients list on the label, it has one ingredient, and that is argan oil. The instructions indicate its use as a moisturizer for the face, but the product can also be used as a cuticle oil or for split ends. I used it overnight as a facial moisturizer and was pleasantly surprised by it. My skin felt soft and didn&#x27;t get super greasy like you would expect from putting straight oil on your face. I&#x27;d be curious about whether or not this would make me break out on the long-term, though.</li>
            <li> As a person who normally uses organic coconut oil as an overall body moisturizer, I liked the idea of trying a lighter weight oil for two persistent problem areas: my elbows and the heels of my feet.  I have never used Argan Oil before, but had heard all of the claims that it was lighter weight and easier to absorb. I decided to try Poppy Austin because theirs is an Organic product, and they donate a percentage back to the women&#x27;s co-operatives in Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was I impressed with how fast it arrived (4 days from order to door...and I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping), but I was instantly impressed with how truly lightweight and fast-absorbing this Argan oil really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use it daily on both my elbows and feet straight out of the shower.  Just a couple of drops used on each area is enough to keep them soft all day.  The lighter weight and fast absorption keeps my feet from sliding around in my shoes and my elbows from sliding across my desk at work. Great stuff for ladies who don&#x27;t want a greasy feel, and don&#x27;t have all day to get the moisturizing done!</li>
            <li> I use a few drops after blowing out my hair, and the oil leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Have had only a few weeks. I find that it is helping with dry skin very well. Not causing any breakouts, just softer skin! Would have more to tell when I have used a bit longer.  So far, so good!.</li>
            <li> I like the argan oil... It is a high quality oil</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil so much that I have shared it with my mom and sister. I use it on my face and nails. It Is odorless and absorbs quickly. Previously I used a more expensive brand I got at Sephora. I find the quality of Poppy Austin argan oil to be just as good if not better and it&#x27;s a bargain as well.</li>
            <li> It works on my hair, but be aware that if you use too much on your hair, you hair will become very oily, and weighted down. I finally found out the right amount for my hair after trying a few times.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my color-treated hair....extremely soft and manageable.  Also, after I run the product through my hair(avoiding the scalp), I&#x27;ll use it as a face moisturizer and again, leaves it smooth and not greasy.  Definitely am and will continue to recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the service!</li>
            <li> They are cheating. The price is for only one bottle, but show 3 bottle together.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Would recommend this product.  Light and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Good product and I have had good results since I began using it.  I am sure it will be a very good product for the cold months.  JJ</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this product. My husband uses it as his hair gel after his showers, and it does wonders to his hair. It feels stronger, thicker, and it has a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing, i have used it on my face as a moisturizer and it wows my features enormously. the fine lines are disappearing! Great for my dry heals on my feet, never been so soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change after 2 weeks of use.  I used it on my hair, and left cheek where I have a broken blood vessel.</li>
            <li> Item does not own up to what I was told it was suppose to do. Don&#x27;t know why I continue to use it except for spending $25. I will not buy this brand or any other.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot before buying this product.  I use it sparingly on my hair before blow drying and several times a week on my face as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, excellent price, works as well as any other, and more expensive oils.  Combine with palm oil and its the best you can do for a treatment</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my new oil. It leaves my skin nicEly moisturized.  It also arrived very promptly after I ordered it. An Amazon customer.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my dry elbows and face to moisturize. It soaks right in with no after greasy feel or look. I only need to use a few drops so this is a very good &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product for skin and hair.  I&#x27;m a African America female and I use only essential oils on my hair and skin I love Aragon oil it absorbs in your skin and keeps it moisturizes all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love how the oil moisturizes skin and hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! A little goes a long way for my face, scalp, and rest of my skin. I like the glass bottle and dropper which helps get all the product out and waste none. It is a lot of product so when I used up my first bottle and got another, I used the empty bottle to put half of new product  to keep it from oxidizing and spoiling, and kept it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> Although usage is stated for hair, I use on my skin. Very satisfied and will purchase here again. Better pricing and quality than what I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Feels very light. Use it at least daily.</li>
            <li> Feels so good, it gives me a happy face!  Hands and cuticles love it too!</li>
            <li> I made my own face oil, tried Poppy Austin, loved the price n the products, I ordered their argan oil again plus their rose water which I use as face toner. Both smell pleasant. I recently started to use the argan oil for my hair too. Looks like I will need to order more soon</li>
            <li> Makes skin look and feel so smooth and vibrant. Puts a temporary hold on neck wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just recieved my Argan oil within the last couple of days ( I live in the Caribbean and had a friend bring it down ) so can only comment on a couple of applications.i suffer a lot of hair damage due to sun, salt and chlorine. My hair was feeling like straw, yet after only a couple of uses my hair feels great, soft and easy to brush. The product is extremely easy to use and non-greasy. I have used similar types of product (although most are not 100% pure) and have had minimal success. I&#x27;m going to try this for another month and if the results are still as good I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I used this after a my anti-wrinkle treatment to soften my skin- you can use it for hair,body as well. This is very pure, 100% Argan oil and it does not have an overpowering scent. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. A really great product well worth the money, especially with all the care given into making it.&amp;#60;3 Will be a staple in my beauty regimen for years to come!:)</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. The oil is kind of dense and it absorbs very well. So a little goes a long way. I use two drops of this oil to cover all my hair, I have med-long hair.</li>
            <li> My layered, shoulder-length hair is thin, fragile, and naturally curly. It tends to dry out, frizz, and turn brittle without daily conditioning. The argan oil from Poppy Austin is perfect for smoothing the ends of the layers, and can be applied lightly to smooth overall frizziness, without looking greasy or feeling heavy (a little goes a long way). It has only a very light pleasant fragrance, unlike many commercial products. I have also used the argan oil on my cuticles and hands - it is a great moisturizer, and absorbs readily. The product itself arrived on time from Poppy Austin, and I was pleasantly surprised at the generous quantity given the relatively low price. This is my first purchase from Poppy Austin, and I will definitely look at some of their other offerings.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful little Gem!  I first started using Argan oil because my sister-in-law (who is a hair stylist) recommended it to me.  I have thin, dry hair and have a hard time finding products that condition my hair, without weighing it down.  This product did wonders for me.  After I shower (shampoo and condition like normal) I put a small amount in the palm of my hands, rub them together and distribute all over my hair.  I put a little extra on my ends and the very top of my head.  I live in the south and the humidity normally gives me a lot of frizz on top.  I then use my heat protection spray and blow dry my hair.  It is the very first product I have ever found that leaves my hair frizz free, shiny and not flat/greasy!  It is wonderful.  I noticed a difference immediately and the condition of my hair improved within weeks.  I also take a small amount a rub on the back of my scalp at night before bed.  I will never stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandmother told me years ago to put olive oil on my hands before bed; suppose to help them wrinkle less as you age.  I found the olive oil to be too greasy; I stopped doing it after a couple nights. When I started using the Argan Oil on my hair, I read you can use it on your body too. I started putting a small drop in my hand lotion and put that on my hands in the morning and before bed.  I have seen a difference with my skin feeling smoother.  I need more time to know if it helps wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Poppy Austin, it is Organic and most Argan Oil in the stores is not.  Ask your Hair Stylist and most will tell you it is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> seems good.  Very good when one has a cold and a tissue-sore nose.  And it really does to seem to treat blemishes well, which seems rather surprising, but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Used for very dry skin and the crows feet areas. We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s better than my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; sandalwood aftershave, which I dislike tremendously. What male uses sandalwood or lavender aftershave?  I&#x27;ve switched to Harry&#x27;s and they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Looked all over for this.  Found on Amazon of course, and at decent price.  excellent for skin, hair, whatever</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; of argan oil wasn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;pretty smelling&amp;#34;, so I was very pleased that the odor went away quickly  -- and believe meI know, because I rub this on my face every night.  The results of the argan oil are wonderful!  My hair looks shiny, but not greasy, and better yet, is how it affects my skin.  I use it now as my only moisturizer. My cheeks and face are smooth and soft.  I had a rough patch of eczema on my hand that was catching on my clohthes, but after only one night of rubbing the oil on it, that spot is smooth!  Argan oil does what my other moisturizing creams can&#x27;t do. I even took this with me to a &amp;#34;favorite things&amp;#34; Christmas party and told them why it was &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34;.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive the argan oil.  I looked forward to it because of hearing so many wonderful things about it.  A few of my friends recommended it for moisturizing.  I tried it as soon as I got the package and it does wonders!  I received the product quickly and with no fuss.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> I love the Argan Oil! It had a really mild scent and left my skin feeling great. I received the Poppy Austin oil 2 days early as well.</li>
            <li> I am a happy with the product - I mix it with lotion and apply, definitely improved my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I bought it for my dry skin and haven&#x27;t had a problem ever since I got it. Love it</li>
            <li> made my face really dry and i broke out with acne</li>
            <li> Amazing! I use it on my face at night time before bed. It&#x27;s too oily for me to apply in the morning. It has made my face so soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was weary about purchasing yet another product to help keep my skin moisturized. I live in a dry climate and it&#x27;s hard, especially in the winter, to keep my skin moisturized without resorting to heavy creams. Argan oil was the perfect solution! I applied it to my arms at first just to test it out. I was amazed to find not only did it moisturize well with a small amount, but it also kept my skin well moisturized throughout the day. Oh, and did I mention...no irritation! I am so excited to have found Argan oil. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin weary of thick, heavy creams. A must have!</li>
            <li> The item does give my hair a shine and a light weight when I use it for my scalp. I also use it on my Grandson hair and it becomes manageable to brush his hair and give the hair a shine. Amazon has it for a reasonable price and also specials if you purchase two items.</li>
            <li> This arrived faster than expected. I am very pleased with this particular brand of Argan Oil. I find it doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy by any means. From what I can tell, this seems to be completely pure and a little goes a long way. I would not hesitate to choose this brand over any other if you are in the market. There are cheaper oils out there, but you definitely get what you pay for as far as nutraceuticals are concerned. Cheers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use alone in the OCM (oil cleansing method) on my face. Within 2 days of using it, I could see a huge difference! After one week, my acne is almost gone and my complexion is glowing! It evened out my color and took away redness and scarring! I have also been using it on my nails and cuticles and my annoying, hard cuticles have softened up big time! I will use this stuff until i die!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using the oil for several months.  It really is great both for hair and face.  I mix it with my curl activating conditioner to get well defined curls that do resist frizzing to a great degree.  The proportions of conditioner to oil depend on the season.  Goops of oil in July, decreasing as it gets less humid, down to four drops in the winter.  Also great for dry winter skin.  Some reviewers have complained about the farmyard smell.  Really, this is not an issue.  The smell is sort of grassy, and lasts only for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different brand of Argan Oil before, but this one is definitely a better deal and more potent. I have REALLY thick, long hair, so the ends can get a bit dry. Argan Oil lets me keep my hair long without needing it trimmed all the time and serves to tame the frizz, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been looking for a way to make your hair look and feel healthier without the sticky or crunchy feeling of other products, give this one a try &#x3D;). I absolutely love it and will continue to use it for years to come!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Has a pleasant nutty scent. Will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for the dry winter months. And it&#x27;s natural too. Without any strange smelling perfumes added. You can use it on your lips, face and hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. First time I used this in my hair it made it silkier and it left me feeling beautiful. I recommend this product to anyone. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> With just one use I have received so many compliments on my hair with this product, this is a new staple for me!  Product came quickly and securely, very satisfied with my purchase and will repurchase from poppy Austin again!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this oil absorbed into my skin and healed some rough red patches on my fingers and elbows very quickly. It has a very light, pleasant smell which fades quickly, which I also like. I don&#x27;t like heavy oils or strong fragrances, and this oil is neither... it&#x27;s really wonderful. Organic, less expensive than the famous brand and perhaps even better!</li>
            <li> This oil smells amazing!  It&#x27;s almost as if you can call it &amp;#34;yummy!&amp;#34;. I love it as a face moisturizer alone or a carrier oil with an Essential oil(s) for perfume. I am also looking forward to using this oil as the next addition to a mixed oil facial moisturizer and body butters as well. The price is very good but an exceptional value after the promo code, thank you!</li>
            <li> Seems legit! I use it in my hair with other oils and shea butter. It does seem to make my hair softer and more manageable. I have very damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the bad reviews this product received. The oil is clear like canola oil instead of the nice golden hue the real stuff has. Put in on my hair and waited all day for it to absorb, instead it was greasy and weight down. Then i though maybe i will use it in my face... big mistake, the next couple of days i started to break out and now have a skin issue to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found nothing particularly wonderful about this product.  It does help the dryness on my arms and legs, but so do many other lotions and creams for a fraction of the price.  My face is breaking out... coincidence... I don&#x27;t think so.  Since I have no choice, I&#x27;ll use  it up but will not order again.  I don&#x27;t usually fall for this type of stuff...but I did this time.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift item and I have received glowing feedback.</li>
            <li> I am a 60+ yo male with thinning gray hair that was somewhat brittle and full of split or unruly ends. Applying the Aragon oil (just a few drops) to towel-dried hair followed by a hair dryer after a couple of minutes has made a noticeable difference. This oil seems a bit heavier, or thicker, than moroccan oil but it works great for my situation.</li>
            <li> I swim nearly 3 times a week, and the chlorine destroys my hair. My barber recommended Moroccan oil to me and I found this version. It&#x27;s legit. I just rub a few drops in my hands and stroke through my hair, and the itchy dryness in my hair is soothed immediately. I also apply it to my face and...it works. Don&#x27;t know what else to say. It&#x27;s great, even though it may smell a bit weird at first. The super cool glass dropper is a great touch!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil every day for over a year, and I am always getting compliments on my skin. I have combination skin, and I use it under my daily moisturizer, with no breakouts. I use less in the summer, since the air is more humid, but I put it on my hands and lips and use it as a hair treatment. It is a vital part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in my laugh lines on the second day of use.  I was shocked.  I must have applied more to one side because it was extremely noticeable.  At first I used this by itself, but found it too oily.  It didn&#x27;t sink in.  So I started adding a couple of drops to my usual moisturizer and it worked great.  No more oil slick on my skin.  I also tried it on my heals.  It made them very nice and soft.  What I have noticed is you have to keep using it because the following day my feet were dry again.  I probably should have exfoliated first.  Also, I could not believe how fast the product got to me.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> seems to work well but the smell is not terribly pleasant. I am not sure if I would purchase again</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops to make your skin feel soft for the entire day. And it really doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice quality argan oil.  It is hydrating and gentle on my skin and hair. It does not leave a filmy residue when I apply this on my face. I feel that this product is just as good as the most expensive argan oil sold on Amazon. I definitely recommend Poppy Austin Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I received my two bottles of Argan Oil promptly.  I have been using it on my skin and hair, cuticles and hands, and I love the results.  It really is helping my facial skin look good without any additional product.  I am curious, since I am 62 years old, if I should consider your Barbary Fig Oil.  I have white heads from extreme sebum production, but I am noticing fine lines around my mouth and eyes, and the natural signs of aging.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product, and I like being able to support the women who make it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I received the product  very promptly, and I enjoy using it every day. Thank you so much for what you do in helping others</li>
            <li> This oil has replaced ALL of my eye and skin care creams...it is wonderful !  I also use a small amount on my hair after every washing.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I read many product labels before deciding on this brand.  It is 100% pure Argon Oil and processed in the USA.  It has FDA approval.  And for use on sensitive skin like mine, I rate it with the highest mark.  It is the best!</li>
            <li> Just received the item, have only been using it a few days.  So far, so good.  I will return at a later date to give a full review.</li>
            <li> Best argan oil I have used. Non-greasy, odorless and makes my skin feel great. Very happy. Will purchase again :).</li>
            <li> great product.  Argan oil should be purchased in a dark bottle.  If it is in a clear or plastic bottle it will not be good.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  This is the first time that I have tried this highly recommended oil - I was always a bit skeptical of the claims - and I am so glad I gave it a try.  This oil from Poppy Austin is wonderful.  I use it mostly on my skin and am amazed at how beautifully it absorbs, leaving my skin soft and hydrated.  My son used it on some dry spots, too, and liked it.  I tried it on my hair, but it seemed to  disappear into my fine, fine hair and I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  That may have also been because I was traveling and the humidity kept changing rather dramatically, possibly muting the effects of the oil.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance and try this brand of argan oil.  I am happy with the results.  My skin just drinks it up!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Poppy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol S.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face wrinkles and it does works! awesome for under my eyes! love it!</li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy, especially in humid weather. Poppy Austin Argan Oil kept the frizz under control, even on a rainy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also applied the oil to my chin where I felt a pimple coming on. I was skeptical because it seems counterintuitive to add oil to oily skin. Next day, no signs of a pimple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> You can use this as a face moisturizer by adding a few drops on your face and neck, you can add a few drops to your favorite facial toner, you can add a few drops to a face mask, you can use to moisturize your lips or by adding vanilla extract to fine brown sugar you can use a lip scrub. I like to use this and add some to my foundation and also love to use this on my hair it works great for split ends and you can use daily to repair your hair from damage of blow drying as well. I have also used this on my cuticles and bottom of my heels to soften it really does the job! You can also add to your favorite lotion and put on after you take a shower! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone especially since you have so many different options of using it!!!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I started off with having thin, brittle hair. I started to bald a year or two ago, and I figured now was a good time to start doing something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I applied this once a day, and about a week later, I felt a slight difference. My hair became a bit softer, and more pliable. It gained some strength, and I can now style my short hair a bit more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using it, as it helped my hair become a bit stronger, and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to use a few drops. Less, in this case, is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to share how dry my skin is. I have tried using so many moisturizers and I have yet to find one that lasts longer than a couple of hours to keep my skin looking nice and radiant. I had been reading about Argan Oil for some time now and how it&#x27;s beneficial in nourishing the skin and hair. Well, I decided to try this specific one out because it&#x27;s 100% pure organic and EcoCert approved and I have to say that I am so glad that I did! The oil did not have any type of weird odor to it at all which was great and it was not one of those shiny oil moisturizers that make your skin shiny and greasy thank goodness! After washing my face with warm water and drying it off, I applied the Argan Oil to it by rubbing a little in. It was nice how it absorbed into my skin as I rubbed it. My skin felt and stayed so soft the whole entire day! It&#x27;s refreshing to finally have found something that really keeps my skin nourished and moisturized &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; and I definitely recommend it to others to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have this dandruff problem for a year now. I&#x27;ve tried almost every way possible I know to treat it. Switching shampoos (expensive ones), hair mask every week, but these didn&#x27;t solve the problem at all. My friends have been telling me to try mayonnaise, avocado, do this and that but I&#x27;m too lazy to do all that. I needed something easy to put on and would actually work. I heard about Argan oil and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve researched about it and a lot of people are saying it actually does work, plus it&#x27;s natural. So I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, shipping with this seller was very fast. Didn&#x27;t have to wait. Secondly, I worried oil like this would smell but this one is not bothersome. It&#x27;s got a mild smell that you will forget you have it on. You can leave it overnight on your hair and wash it the following morning, but I just apply this Argan oil 30-60 minutes before I wash my hair in a towel wrap. My hair and scalp feels so much better now. My hair is softer and looks healthier, my scalp is no longer dry, and dandruff gone. I&#x27;ll probably try it on my face too as everyone is talking about.Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does exactly what it says. This is a very good moisturizer that is not overly greasy or has a strong order. I use this product on my skin and on my hair. I love the glow it give my skin and the smooth silky softness. I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> This argan oil does work well on my hair; leaves it frizz free for sure. It&#x27;s more concentrated than I was expecting and has a light nutty aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a regular user of Josie Maran for a good few years and I have to say there&#x27;s no difference between Poppy Austin&#x27;s and Josie&#x27;s argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kicking myself a bit though as I paid almost forty pounds for this 2 oz bottle at the Harvey Salon in London. Please don&#x27;t make the same mistake, I absolutely hate overpaying!!!</li>
            <li> Before I ordered the Poppy Austin 100% Argan Oil, I had only ever used Argan oil as a hair conditioner, and only in products that had a little bit of Argan oil or a blend of oils. After I ordered it, I researched some of the other uses and decided to experiment. This product works wonders! I used it as an intensive conditioner - just a few drops on my scalp and massaged it in, then leave for a few minutes before washing. I also rubbed 2-3 drops between my palms and smoothed it over my hair after drying to tame frizzing and add shine without weighing my hair down. I have really dry skin, and it was listed as one of the popular uses, so I&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, and it leaves my skin silky soft. And a tiny bit of this product goes a long way! It only takes 5 or 6 drops to moisturize my skin, and it works far better than my L&#x27;Oreal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I love that the Poppy Austin Argan Oil is cruelty-free, organic and doesn&#x27;t have a long list of unpronounceable ingredients that I&#x27;m putting on my skin. It&#x27;s naturally perfect as a moisturizer, without a bunch of chemicals that may have weird side-effects down the road. I would definitely look for this product again, but I think this bottle will last for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It worked wonderfully on my dried-out hands without making them feel clammy or overly moist, and it has a very light, non-offensive fragrance. Some similar essential oils and products smell terrible, but I don&#x27;t notice the odor of this oil whatsoever. I have a small child and I have to wash my hands a LOT - this argan oil makes them feel smooth again. I like the dropper applicator as well, which keeps you from getting too much oil on your hands or hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like manure...i can&#x27;t even put it on my body I wish I knew and the way it was expensive. Am not buying it anymore</li>
            <li> Compared to Josie Maran, this product is a better deal.  I have psoriasis and dry skin accompanies this condition.  Argan oil has nearly cured my dry skin which facilitates treating and controlling the psoriasis (especially on the soles of my feet).  I have \\&quot;T-zone\\&quot; facial skin and this oil does not clog my large pores or leave my complexion greasy.  Hair - wow!!  After rubbing the oil on a part of my body, I massage my scalp and hair last.  NOT greasy.  Leaves my hair shiny, soft, and strangely enough, fuller.  I often use NO hair products before blow drying..just a little Argan Oil.  I use this oil exclusively instead of other moisturizers.  Compare product labels - this is 100% pure Argan oil.  Then compare prices.  This is a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> After each hand washing, use it. After walking around barefoot all day, use it. After you bathe, USE IT. ITS BY FAR THE BEST MOISTURIZER IVE USED. When I bought the trio I had a bit of dry skin around my nose due to using a beauty bar as a cleanser. After a week of using this oil the dryness around my nose was completely gone. I absolutely recommend this product ladies, and the trio together works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few ways I put it to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-After each hand wash.&lt;br /&gt;-After a shower on my entire body, mainly focusing on my elbows, knees, shoulders, hands, and feet.&lt;br /&gt;-Daily, after cleansing &amp; exfoliating my face.&lt;br /&gt;-After doing my nails, (LED-Gel Polish) I massage it into my cuticles.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil came highly recommended, I was slightly skeptical, but after only 2 days of use I noticed a change in the softness of my beard. The oil also has a slightly musky / pleasant smell which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> This argon oil is a revelation! Light, unscented (key for me) and absorbs in just a moment.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and supple. It;s a lovey base for my light application of makeup and it makes a great night treatment. Love it! I will be back for all of the Poppy Austin products that I&#x27;ve tried to date. They are beautiful products&lt;br /&gt;NEXT on the list is the Fig oil..........my next fabulous treat. Try the products they are lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy oil from others that I have purchased.  Fine for hair and skin but not so much for the face.</li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Moran argan oil for a while. I thought I would try this brand since it&#x27;s cheaper. The oil itself seems very similar to the JM brand (consistency and the way it absorbs into your skin), however it smells really bad...like a goat or cow farm. The smell does seem to fade significantly after wearing it for a while, but I just got grossed out every time I tried to put it on my face. I returned it and will go back to JM.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super deal. Good product at an average price</li>
            <li> Best  product ever I will never change it for anything!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night and in the morning with my make up routine and it just so amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Argan Oil by my hairdresser, I really liked it but I am sensitive to cents and the Moroccan Oil not only is not pure but has a strong cent so I went to amazon to find a replacement and found this product. So happy I bought it, not only does it work great on my hair but unlike the Moroccan Oil I can use it on my skin and it&#x27;s cent is so mild I hardly notice it. Works wonders on your face and now I am saving the $60 I used to spend on moisturizer. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have read that Argan Oil is very good for the skin, hair &amp; nails.  This is the first time I have tried it and I really love it.  It is not a real heavy oil and seems to be absorbed very quickly.  This product seems very pure to me.  It was delivered very quickly and was well packaged well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my skin and I have noticed a vast improvement, especially in the skin around my eyes and my forehead.  The lines aren&#x27;t as deep and the skin feels smoother.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed for my dry hair.  Have always used a mixed blend of Argan Oil and was not wild about it.  So glad I saw the u-tube info about yours.  It makes so much sense that 100% would be so much better. I&#x27;m very happy with your product, Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Toni</li>
            <li> This oil is very light and is so nice on my face. Not at all greasy and is a great moisturizer, especially for winter!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product for the skin and for the hair too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil! I use it on my skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For skin - I put it on every morning after cleansing. It only takes three drops to cover my entire face (one for forehead, two for the rest - gently massaged into the skin), and when I have breakouts or dry spots I&#x27;ll put an extra drop on my palm and use a finger to gently dab a bit directly onto the blemish/spot (letting it sink in naturally rather than rubbing it in). If there&#x27;s extra on my hands I simply rub it in as a hand moisturizer. Works fantastic underneath makeup (I like to wait a few minutes to let the skin soak it up before applying makeup) - it makes my concealer blend in incredibly. I repeat the same process after washing my face at night before bed. I use a bit of witch hazel after washing and let it dry before applying the oil; I&#x27;ve found this helps any moisturizer (argan oil included) sink in better/faster.&lt;br /&gt;I had a blister on my finger that had accidentally been peeled off and left a deep gap in the skin - after a week of rubbing one drop of this oil into my hands it was nearly completely healed, not even a trace of a scar left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair - I have short hair, about collarbone length, and I rub three drops of oil into my hands and then quickly apply it to my hair (so it doesn&#x27;t soak too much into my hands - it absorbs pretty fast!), root to tip. Calms any fly-aways or frizzies instantly without making my hair look greasy. I use it only after straightening my hair and it lasts several days until my next wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a very light scent, I wouldn&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it disappears immediately after application. I&#x27;m completely hooked on this stuff; it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I have completely fallen in love with the Organic Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  Having grown up in sun and from a time when we did not know how much damage the sun could cause I have what we call leathery skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different products that have not helped, and the oils I have tried have been so greasy I would have to put the oil on before bedtime and wear a long-sleeve shirt but the Argan Oil absorbs into the skin, so I am able to put it on during the day and not have to worry about getting the oil on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the Argan Oil, I put it on my left arm so that I could check to see if it was working and almost right away I could see a difference.  It has now been over two weeks, and I wish I could attach a picture so that you could see the difference, and even though it has not completely reversed the sun damage it has made it look years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having read the reviews my next use for the oil is going to be to try it on my hair, and if it works even half as well as it did on my skin, I will be a very happy person.</li>
            <li> I recently visited with family that I had not seen for many years.  My Aunt, who is now 56, looked awesome.  I mean, she could have easily passed for a woman in her early to mid 30&#x27;s ( I am 38 and she looked younger than me!). Her face was completely free of wrinkles, age spots, crows feet etc etc, you know what I mean. I asked her what she uses and she told me 100% Pure Argan Oil. What is Argan Oil I asked her and she went into this really lengthy description about where it comes from, all the different ways you can use it etc etc. She said she buys it from Amazon and I should try it. I received my bottle yesterday and decided to try it on my feet and face overnight, I have very dry heels and usually spend all winter with vaseline and socks to keep them from cracking. I put the oil on my feet and decided to see what would happen if I didn&#x27;t cover them with socks. After I cleansed my face I put the oil on my face and I was really impressed with how quickly it absorbed and did not feel greasy at all. My normal moisturizer (about $20 more than Argan Oil), I won&#x27;t mention the name, takes about 20 - 30 minutes before the greasy feeling goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, all the white, dry skin was almost gone and my feet felt so much nicer than they did yesterday.  My face showed less puffiness and redness (I have slight case of eczema) than it normally does in the morning.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of using this on my face and feet daily, I have no doubt that this product will do the job. I also applied some of the oil to my Daughters hair this morning ( she has thick hair that knots easily) and her hair was so smooth and manageable after a minute or two and when she came home from school today, her hair was tangle free!. I will post again after using this for a couple more weeks. I am also ordering an additional bottle to have on hand as I have been told ( by my Aunt) this product is in such demand, it sometimes becomes unavailable for short periods of time.</li>
            <li> Thumbs up for this product.  I’ve been trying all kinds of moisturizers and night crèmes, very few things actually work for me.  I have dry skin that&#x27;s very fair and sensitive.  But this oil is definitely a winner; it is lightweight and doesn’t have an overpowering smell.  I used it on my face overnight and had really nice results the next day.  My skin was noticeably softer and it had a more even tone.  I’ve been using it every night since.</li>
            <li> It is first time I use argan oil so I can&#x27;t compare. I am using for my hair I can see it does a difference, my hair is less frizzy that it would be with nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews, I usually use Josie Maran but it&#x27;s very expensive, so,I thought I&#x27;d try this. I use it on my face as a moisturizer. I opened this and tried a bit although I was very leery due to the terrible chemical smell. I hope I don&#x27;t wake up with welts on my face!  I&#x27;m returning it  and paying the price for the Josie Maran a  proven good quality product.</li>
            <li> Received quickly, in great shape and my wife loves it.  She especially likes it because of how it stops the incessant, dry skin itching that occurs in cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> It smells like camel dung!  And it does not work on hair which is why I purchased it.....just leaves your hair looking greasy and unwashed.  Not a favorite at all</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I love this oil for my hair and face. It makes my hair shiny without looking greasy! In addition, my acne spots are slowly disappearing. As well as, this Argan oil is a very nice face moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t use any facial lotions or creams ever since I use this oil. Even this winter, my skin does not feel dry. It still retains moisture due to this oil! Also, it did not cause me to break out, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product twice daily: morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;In morning, I use an acne prone cleanser and wash it away with cold water. Then, I apply a few drops (5-7) on the palm of my hands and rub the oil several times. Next, I apply the oil on my face. The residue of oil can go to the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;In the evening, it is the same ritual except I add some drops of Argan oil to the ends of my hair to condition it. This oil works perfectly fine with damp or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle contains 2 oz and it I have use it religiously. It has been a month now, I still have 2/3 of the product left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product again! :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Pure Argan oil. I used moracan oil and my head was itchy. This product is great. No additives. I like the web site too.</li>
            <li> Loved this oil except for one exception: it smells terrible. If you&#x27;re like me and have a very heightened sense of smell, then you&#x27;ll notice the foul odor coming from this oil. Reminded me of cow manure. I&#x27;m not sure if it was my batch or just this brand in general. The only way that Argan oil ends up smelling foul is when it&#x27;s over heated and I think that&#x27;s exactly what happened to this product. Other than the smell, this was a fantastic Argan oil. Did everything, from smoothing my skin to smoothing my hair. If you&#x27;re not too sensitive to smell this product will work great for you.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my face, feet and hands. It worked well on my face, but not on my feet or hands. I have diabetes and very dry skin and using this especially on my hands and feet really did&#x27;t get the job done. I put it on at bedtime and by morning it had mostly disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Eucerin Intensive Repair on my feet and it&#x27;s been very effective. My Dermatologist told me to find an over the counter product that contains urea (the prescription one&#x27;s are outrageously expensive), and it&#x27;s the only one I found. I put it on heavily right after a shower and put socks on right away. That does the trick. I think you can buy it on this site, but I find an occasional coupon that I use at the local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hands, I use pure lanolin. It&#x27;s very heavy and greasy, but I put it on as the last thing I do before going to bed and by morning it&#x27;s been well absorbed and on the back of my hands lasts well into the day. I have ordered two lanolin products from Amazon and been happy with both, but one is no longer available and the other used to come in a four pack but is now only sold singly, and it&#x27;s pricey and has shipping costs. I see they have a new one that has a better price point which I&#x27;ll try next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan worked well on my face, but didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; effects. It didn&#x27;t diminish a few sun damage dark spots. It did moisturize well when I put it on before bed, but you have to wait 15 to 30 minutes before going to bed because it takes awhile to soak in and even then is a bit greasy. Not a bad product, but a decent face moisturizer works just as well and is less hassle.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to mix with Castor Oil for a mixture in clearing up, and to keep clear of adult acne.  Never had it in my life until age 56.  Go figure.  Since using this, I have had no more break outs.  My skin cleared up in two days.  I only had a couple of bumps, but since they cleared up so quickly, I would think if someone had a lot of acne, it would work just as well.  I understand people use this for their hair, but I fortunately have great hair, so don&#x27;t need it.  I would assume it works well.  This is 100% pure Argan Oil which was very important to me in ordering this particular brand.  Will certainly order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Somehow Argan oil doesnt suit my skin and hair</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I&#x27;ve only been using for about 1 1/2 weeks, but already see a difference! A little goes a long way, so the bottle will last for some time &amp; it absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve used on my face, hands &amp; feet. Seeing the improvements on those areas, I am now going to use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, give it a try. You will be amazed at how well it works!</li>
            <li> Great product and I recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> This essential oil is amazing! What makes this product worth every penny is the fact that it is 100 percent raw organic oil. I am an avid user of all natural health and beauty products, yet find that in many instances they do not live up to their claim, however this product exceeded my expectations! A few drops of this decadent oil applied to my over worked hands, resulted in soft succulent skin. I also added a few drops of this oil to my hair conditioner and was in awe of the results. My hair was no longer frizzy and dry, but instead was soft and radiant! Poppy Austin&#x27;s oil has dramatically improved my skin and hair in just a few days, I can only imagine what this miraculous oil will do with continued use!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this argan oil is.  I have been using it on my extra dry skin areas (elbows are the worst!) and the dryness is gone and the skin is going back to normal texture.  Just a drop does it for each elbow.  I am also using it on my cuticles with great success.  I have never used anything else this good at moisturizing my skin.  I am using it on a recent surgical scar and the oil is keeping it supple so that I can bend my knee easily.  I definitely plan on suggesting this oil for my patients with their scars.  I would recommend this oil to anyone who needs moisturizing--skin, hair, nails.  One bottle covers it all quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair care products with Argan oil since about 2010 when I was first introduced to a conditioner with Argan oil by my hair stylist. Now all my shampoos, conditioners and sprays contain this nourishing ingredient. Recently, a FB friend posted about using the Argan oil for her acne. I was intrigued. I began searching for information on how it helped with acne. I stumbled upon Poppy Austin&#x27;s site and was excited to see that it not only helped with mild acne but eczema as well. I checked amazon and looked at other products in the same price range. I decided to go with Poppy Austin since it was reasonable and where I&#x27;d learned the info. Since it arrived I&#x27;ve used it as part of my nightly regime first cleansing with my usual products which dry my skin. I apply the Argan oil and when I wake up my skin is still supple and moisturized. This morning I tried it on the dry patches on my sons scalp and when I picked him up from pre-school I was shocked to see that the area hadn&#x27;t dried during those hours. I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase. Thanks!</li>
            <li> At night, I use this on top of my retinol products to calm any irritation I might have! I didn&#x27;t want to pay &amp;#34;Josie Maran&#x27;s&amp;#34; price (at Sephora) for her oil, so I happened upon this oil just doing a search and it got excellent reviews on all sites!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, their head-quarters are in the UK. I had a concern about the smell and they got back promptly and explained to me that the August batches have a stronger aroma and not to be concerned.</li>
            <li> I love to put this in my hair for dry hair relief. My dog loves me to rub this into his hair too. (I know it&#x27;s not advertised as such but my vet said it seemed okay to him.)</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days and I can already see results.  I have used it on my hands and body and it softened my rough hands immediately and left them smooth.  I am very happy with the product and the mild scent.  I tried another brand of argan oil and was disappointed, I&#x27;m glad I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> I like it but not so sure what all the hype is about.  I use on my face in certain areas, elbows, nails....I also use coconut oil for skin and considering the price difference I probably will just keep to the coconut oil when I run out of the Argan oil.  I will continue to use it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have used Argan Oil for about a year now.  I am in my 60s and it is the only product I use.  I have purchased more expensive organic products but I like Poppy Austins&#x27; better.  The quality is excellent, the scent is great (some Argan oil can have a less than lovely fragrance) and the results are great.  What more can you wish from a skin care product that is good for your skin, the environment and the people who produce it?  Thank you.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this for my hair and skin! I have replaced my moisturizer and have referred many friends who have complimented me on my hair and skin. Try this, you will love it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious oil that is totally the moisturizer you need to follow the C oil. You&#x27;ll love it and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> very pure and feels good on the skin, I would purchase again</li>
            <li> So love how the Argon oil is working on my skin. It is really all you need as a moisturizer. A few drops go a long long way, will be using this forever!</li>
            <li> Lets be transparent- after buying josie marans 100% pure organic argan oil... i fell in love (almost in an unhealthy way) to argan oil... however upon further research... i heard that argan oil can be found cheaper but just as good through online methods like amazon.... THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE... i got two ounces of argan for $25 in comparison to JM $48 dollar argan oil...and honestly... poppy austin is so much better in my opinion...</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to us by our doctor for dry skin and it&#x27;s amazing! You need so little of it, the bottle will last a long time. We are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it ....So far working well on my natural hair and keeps my hair shiny. Pure Argan!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband&#x27;s extremely dry skin. He loves it. With virtually no fragrance and the speed with which it absorbed, it&#x27;s perfect for him.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but not any more.  I normally have fine frizz prone hair and have tried Moroccan Oil and Living Proof products to control the frizz.  Moroccan Oil was OK but my hair still felt dry.  The Argan Oil controls the frizz and keeps my hair soft and conditioned.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face as well and my acne break out came under control.  I unreservedly recommend this project.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and I use it all the time.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is very good for your, especially oily skin. This appears to be high quality</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great things about this oil and had to try it for myself. I had read that some were using it on their hands and I figured that it would work for feet too. My feet get really dry - especially my heels and nothing works on them! I&#x27;ve tried everything. All kinds of lotions that are meant just for feet and nothing ever works! Or, it traps the heat in after I put it on and then I am uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the oil on my feet and I must say I am pleasantly surprised! My feet actually feel softer than they have all summer and they don&#x27;t feel like I still have a &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; on them! I wish I had found this at the beginning of the summer so I wouldn&#x27;t have been embarrassed by my dry feet all summer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again! :)</li>
            <li> Great transaction with Poppy Austin. The Argan Oil arrived quickly and after two weeks, my hair is loving it!! I tried this as a substitute for the product I was using before (BioSilk) that was all chemicals. This works better.  I have very coarse hair and a lot of it, but found that a little bit goes a long way. There is no greasiness and my hair is soft.  It is a nice complement to my homemade pomade.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth the $$ to stop the chemical contamination and support companies who are committed to fair trade and sustainability.</li>
            <li> Nice and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy! I will use it again. I would recommend it to others. Argan oil is good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it for my skin. I apply it to my face at night&lt;br /&gt;and it leaves a glowing shine to my face. People ask am I wearing&lt;br /&gt;makeup or am I pregnant because my face is so clear and glowing.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Also, its good for your hair, I apply it to my ends and it helps stops&lt;br /&gt;the shedding of my hair.</li>
            <li> You can tell this product is worth its weight in gold and is of the highest quality to be found.  You can tell it is 100% organic and the smell is not offensive at all.  I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING POPPY AUSTIN&#x27;S ARGAN OIL ON MY HAIR AND MY FACE I LOVE IT, MY HAIR LOOKS MORE SHINE AND IT TAME MY FRIZZY HAIR AND I PUT ON MY FACE AT NIGHT, THE PRICE IS REASONABLE SINCE YOU CAN FIND IT MORE EXPENSIVE FROM OTHERS SELLERS AND THE QUALITY IS GREAT A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG WAY. THANKS POPPY AUSTIN</li>
            <li> I purchased this Poppy Austin argan oil a few weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily since and really like it.  I highly recommend it for those looking for an authentic, good quality argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Morroccan Oil brand for about 5 years.  That stuff changed my hair - I loved it... however it is pricey and it was very hard to spend the money on it.  I saw this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin and thought I would give it a try because its pure Argan oil and none of the other stuff.  I can say honestly say that I was surprisingly pleased at this.  After just a couple of days my hair already feels much softer and when I comb my hair at the end of the day or the next morning there is no fuzz (which I have never experienced in my life)  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that I am trying to figure the best way to apply it.  I don&#x27;t feel like I can spread it out evenly very well.. I believe that is because it absorbs very quickly into my hair.  I am still trying to figure out the best way get this spread out evenly and not just on my ends.  I am glad that I tried this and I am sure that will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> the product is exactly as described in a small dark bottle.  A couple of drops is enough for your whole face.  I&#x27;ve only used it for one week but I feel like it is already plumping up my skin.  I was worried about break outs but it hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and keeps my skin quite moisturized, a little goes a long way.  Use it day and night.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been very satisfied with the Argan oil I received. It leaves my hair very soft and shiny. The only thing I would say is to be careful not to use too much of it. I put a small, not even dime-sized amount in my hair after washing it, and it left it looking oily. The next time I used it, I only used 3 drops and that seemed to be a good amount for me. It may just be my hair (it&#x27;s already very healthy and soft, and shoulder length). I&#x27;m sure if my hair was longer or damaged, I would need more. Just something to keep in mind! :)</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by Dr. Oz as a moisturizer for dry frizzy aging hair.  It helped just as Dr. Oz said it would.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful for extremely dry skin. The only complaint is that its smells awful. I&#x27;ve mostly gotten used to it, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great oil. It&#x27;s authentic like u get in Morocco.  I had bought a bottle wen I was in Morocco and has da same authenticity.  Def wld buy it again.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face prior to putting on my makeup. I also use it for my hands when they are dried out. I still have some experamenting to do with this as I have not fallen in love with it yet. It did help my face were I had some wrinkles, after puting it on it smoothed out the skin so the wrinkel was no longer there.</li>
            <li> I like this and use it on  my hair and have noticed a difference. Hair is naturally curly and dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the real benefits of it , but so far I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This oil is really great. The smell is not really superb, but I suppose that pure Argan oil is not fragranced at all!</li>
            <li> Using this product makes your skin so soft!  7 months and my face feels like a baby&#x27;s butt...lol. Trusted brand and great quality!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it . It doesn&#x27;t work like the real oil . Leaves your hair sticky instead of soft! .</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face, neck and hands.  It works great , softens the skin without being greasy.  I used on my hair the result was amazing.  Calmed the frizzies and made my hair very soft and manageable.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love the Argan oil I ordered from Poppy Austin ! I use it everywhere, body, hair. It came quickly, and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for a facial skin moisturizer but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized. I&#x27;ve had better luck with jojoba oil. I&#x27;ve been using it in my hair now either before or after I style it and just use a few drops. I would say it&#x27;s just ok for hair. It is 100% pure argan oil, which is nice</li>
            <li> I love argan oil. It is hard to beat for day to day moisturizing. And when I have a sunburn or acne outbreak. it is superb!</li>
            <li> I had heard of Argan oil, but never purchased...now I know what all the hoopla is about!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it and can see it vital to skin replenishing care!!</li>
            <li> So far so good worked well on my hair it just arrived yesterday.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I already use oils to wash my face.  I was using coconut oil to moisturize but found with my dry skin it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  This Argan oil is perfect.  I still use my coconut oil to remove my eye makeup but this is my new moisturizer when I&#x27;m having those days when I&#x27;m dryer than usual.  My husband is using it some in his hair also.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about  4 weeks and I see a difference. I put a few drops on my hands and rub them together an ran my hands through my hair. My hair is really soft, just fluffy and no split ends. I highly recommend Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever shopped for argan oil, you&#x27;ll see that most of them are no longer at its purest form. Argan oil is most effective when it is not mixed with other products and chemicals and packaged in a dark bottle. Poppy Austin obviously takes pride in their line and delivers true argan oil.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a date on my bottle of Organ oil? I have not used Organ oil before but giving it a good try. I&#x27;m going to be 70 this month and my friends keep saying how nice my complexion is. I live in Arizona now and I find I need more moisturizer so this is why I&#x27;m trying Organ oil. Hopefully this is the answer? I&#x27;m not sure how much to use so I&#x27;m guessing a few drops twice a day, at bedtime and under daily makeup.&lt;br /&gt;~Helena</li>
            <li> Seems very hydrating and light on the skin. So far so good.</li>
            <li> For this price, this product is AMAZING! I have long hair and trying to find something that actually works and isn&#x27;t full of chemicals rare. You only need a little tiny bit at a time. A little bit does go a long way! I would recommend this to anyone! Way better than that less expensive &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, the packaging exemplary, and delivery prompt! Telling everyone about this product and Poppy Austin!&amp;#34;  My daughter-in-law loves it too. Poppy Austin is my source for all things beautiful!</li>
            <li> I use Poppy Austin Argan Oil every evening instead of a very expensive cream I had been using.  I feel it moisturizes my skin better than the cream.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin.  This winter has been tough to deal with, but argan oil has helped me overcome dry skin not only on my face but my hands.  I did get a first time buyer discount from Poppy Austin.  Check her website for a discount code.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Its really helping my hair! I love to know I&#x27;m putting a natural oil in my hair and not all these other chemicals I don&#x27;t know about.</li>
            <li> Almost required for winter life in the north. Use it on wet skin (before you towel off after a shower) then towel as usual and your skin will feel like skin again -- skin on a good day!</li>
            <li> fabulous product. Couldn&#x27;t say enough about it will continue to order.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Poppy Austin Argan Oil, but I had such a wonderful experience I will continue to purchase from Poppy Austin. I will tell my friends who use Argan Oil to try Poppy Austin. I have such soft flowing hair and it is not greasy, it is very lightweight and very effective for my hair type. I am mother of 8 and my hair often suffers as a result of my busy life. But a little Argan oil goes a long way. Try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using Josie Moran&#x27;s Argan Oil product for almost 2 years and switched to Poppy Austin within the past month and I absolutely love it. Great product with a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I received my little brown bottle of 100% pure organic argan oil. I have to admit I was skeptical at first. I have extremely dry skin and my hair is dry from so many hair dyes. My skin wasn\\&quot;t as smooth as it was a few years ago. I read the reviews an decided to try it. An within days my skin was as supple as it was years ago. I tried it in my hair. I put a few drops on my hands and rub them together an ran my hands through my hair. I could tell after the first use the change in my hair. It was soft and didn&#x27;t look damaged. The product does what it says it will do an am glad I decided to order it. I will continue using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The best! Just wish it was cheaper. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product does way more then you would expect, it offers your hair the perfect shine without weighing your hair down or making it greesy. After a long summer in the sun my hair needed some serious help. I have super long hair and was worried this would weigh it down and it did the exact opposite. My hair is shiny, healthy, and no signs of split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have extremely sensitive skin and was worried to use this as a moisturizer and found out that this is the best thing for my skin. Where I live the weather is changing already and my skin is getting dry and with just a few times using this my skin is soft and healing up nicely. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for something that will make your hair gorgeous and your skin soft.</li>
            <li> While my favorite use for this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin will be for my hair, I have to start out by saying that I&#x27;m amazed at how well a few drops of this oil will keep my hands, knees, and elbows soft for an entire day! I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out the oil on my face, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a solution to help replenish my hair and return some of it&#x27;s natural strength and shine to the ends. My hair is course and heat damaged from my regular blow drying and hot iron habits, and I needed something that would be light enough, help with heat protection, and LAST-- I hate spending a ton of money on hair products when my hair just soaks it up so quickly! It took me a few days to figure out the right amount so I&#x27;d recommend starting it over a weekend, or starting with the minimum amount they recommend (2 drops or so). For my hair, which is almost down to my chest and relatively thick, I use three drops for my whole head and then apply just a bit more to the area closest to my face where I can see the most heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just one use i could see more shine and moisture in my hair throughout the day. On day two, I used a few fewer drops and still achieved the same results (without being weighed down by too much oil). Both times I applied it to my lightly towel-dried hair. My best results, however, have been using it as a heat protectant after drying and before using the hot iron-- I can localize where to apply the oil based on need, and better control how much I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited yo continue use and see it helps over time. I&#x27;ll make sure to post any updates or tips based on my experience!</li>
            <li> This oil has helped my severely cracked and dry hands to get softer in just a few applications!  I originally bought it to use on my face, but since my skin is extremely sensitive The Argan Oil caused it to break out, (not surprising, as almost every moisturizer causes the same) so I used it on my cuticles and then both hands.  I am a fused glass artist and my hands take a beating with glass cuts, water, and alcohol exposure.  This oil applied at night helps keep the dry, flakiness away!</li>
            <li> I am going to say that I love this product because it does make my hair fuller and just makes it look healthy. I have only been using it on and off for about a week and a half and I see a difference. My hair is really soft and just fluffy! HOWEVER........ be carful not to use too much or else it will build up and just look greasy. All in all, I bought 2 bottles that will probably last awhile and I see myself buying again!</li>
            <li> The item was received promptly in excellent packaging. I have been using the oil for a few days now and am amazed at how good this product is. I learned a lot watching Poppy Austin videos on YouTube, and am even more convinced in the quality of their product after using it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product has made my thirsty skin very happy.  It also works great on my cuticles. This will be forever a part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Product is as as stated, oil is thick and rich, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and skin and I&#x27;m satisfied with results and product quality.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It absorbs easily &amp; quickly with no greasy feeling.  Looks good under makeup.  I checked around &amp; this is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The product arrived promptly. I loved the packaging as it had a dropper top already for easy application. The consistency was just right. I have tried a few argon oil products before finding the right product and this is the perfect product. Thanks for your attention to detail and providing an excellent item!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this oil is real. I have used the Josie Maran brand as well as this oil and they have performed similarly. I stopped buying from Josie Maran when I suspected her argan oil was deodorized, which could only mean that the smell was unpleasant because the kernels were from a questionable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is not deodorized, but it does contain a very foul scent. It smells rather rancid, which prompts me to suspect that the source of the argan kernels were not from raw fruits but from goats that have already digested these fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is objection to my hypothesis, please prove me wrong by providing ne valid documentation for the production methods of this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. .Great service..This oil is the best I&#x27;ve found for hair and skin. I recommend highly. Poppy Austin provides a great service that helps the women of Morocco. .it also helps save the trees, that produce this wonderful product, from being cut down. This amazing product is great for hair and skin while at the same time it helps save forests and provides economic help to the women of Morocco. ..I also want to add that like many other products,  They may have a scent that I don&#x27;t like. This has no scent that I&#x27;ve noticed. In addition,  the environmental information I provided came from research I did on the internet. So I derived it from that. A add I am not an expert, I made my opinion on this research.  If proven to be false, I would be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I chose to purchase after reading an anti-aging book that recommended Argan Oil.  I chose this specific brand because of the reviews.  I&#x27;ve been really happy - using on my face and neck as part of my evening face wash routine.  After only a couple weeks my skin feels so much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> feels better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, even the most expensive cream...my skin looked flawless just after two nights of using the oil...it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;m putting on my skin right now...highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this product and the Argan Oil did not disappoint. I use it daily on my face, and it feels great. Love it!</li>
            <li> My first reaction was the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant. In my opinion, I thought it smelled like a farm. Because of that, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or buy again.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeping my face smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Only a small amount needed for hair and face,  so bottle is sure to last long.</li>
            <li> I am truly please with this product. I have purchased in the past from other manufacture&#x27;s. I find this product is better and more reasonably priced. I recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at different Argan Oils and decided to give Poppy Austin&#x27;s a try. I could not be happier! The price was right (compared to others out there) and it was also organic. Oh my! This is my favorite treat for my skin! Super silky, smells great and my skin feels so wonderful. You officially now have a loyal customer. ^_^.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is good for dry skin and hair. Makes my hair shiny without being oily. Good product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love! Bought this twice and ready to buy again. Such a good value and my cuticles and feet are no longer dry. No need to buy expensive cuticle or foot cream. I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen a great difference in my hair since using this product, i would totally reccommend  it thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Yes it does not smell very good but the smell quickly fades once applied. The smell was no problem at all after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets. I use it for my Hair and Face.&lt;br /&gt;Its made my hair soft, shiny, moist and more controllable and on my face its helped keep my acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously i would highly recommend this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One request i have is that there should be a more convenient way to use it besides the dropper.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It Arrived quickly and matches the picture on amazon. My daughter and I are thrilled and use the oil daily.</li>
            <li> Having been a fan of the Josie Maran argan oil for a while now, I was excited to get my order of Poppy Austin, since it&#x27;s much more cost effective. But while the oil itself is lovely, it smells *exactly* like kalamata olives, and the smell is quite strong to my nose. I use argan oil as a general moisturizer as well as for my face and hair, and while this brand is probably fine for the latter two uses, it just won&#x27;t do for the rest of my skin. I&#x27;m a perfume lover and I can&#x27;t have &amp;#34;eau d&#x27;olive&amp;#34; interfering with my scents. Back to Josie Maran!</li>
            <li> I live at altitude so right now I am primarily using this product on my face before bed. In the morning, my skin feels hydrated and looks healthy -- I love it!</li>
            <li> Simply the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin! I highly recommend this for anyone who has dry skin and nothing has really helped...It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard sometimes to find a product that truly lives up to its claim. This one does, the search is over.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly wanted to use it as a facial moisturizer. Before bedtime, it was a little scarey applying &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;  to my face after I washed it clean, but the oil absorbed into my skin quickly leaving a smooth and more radiant looking complexion. I applied it all over my face including my eye lids, eye lashes, and my lips. It feels so wonderful!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the little dropper that is provided in the glass bottle. No worries about pouring out too much, just a drop or two will do for your face.&lt;br /&gt; After I purchased this 100% pure product, I did some local shopping to see what I could find in comparison. This product is far superior to anything I could find. Everything I found was blended with other ingredients. Some products claimed to be Argon oil but in fact contained none. What a time saver and gas saver ordering online knowing I was getting a great product. My friends maybe getting this for Christmas! :-)</li>
            <li> Just perfect! I use it for my skin, my hair after the shower and notice how much fuller it is reducing split ends giving your haircut a longer life. My skin seems to be smoother with less small lines. no bumps on it. just better overall.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it for a month yet so I am still checking it out. I also make my own skincare products from natural ingredients and I have added it to my formula.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this product. Nice consistency and best of all, no strange odor like other brands I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ll write more later after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Absorbs quickly. Great for hair, face and nails! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> I have used many Argan oil products and this is the best and true one; I am glad I have now beauty  product to trust.</li>
            <li> I have been using another popular big name Argan oil for years and was searching for a less expensive option. The Poppy Austin brand moisturizers just as well as my &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; product at a much more afordable price in a bigger bottle too. I&#x27;ve had great results with no greasy feeling on the skin and no breakouts on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a high quality, pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It is okay, not all that as they made it seem on the amazon website and you tube for this oil.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil.  It works well on your skin, hair, and nails.  It&#x27;s a dry oil so it absords quickly.  No greasy hands after application.  A must have if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I just made a new order for another two bottles. Can I pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee get a promotion code of some sort?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna keep coming back because I love this stuff...it has a weird smell but it does the job on my skin and under my eyes and that&#x27;s all that matters :)</li>
            <li> Love the Argan Oil!  Have noticed more softness and glow.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times on my hair since I&#x27;ve received it.  I used to use Moroccanoil prior to this purchase, but decided to try something different.  It works similarly, makes my hair soft and smooth, but you have to be mindful of how much you use.  You only need a few drops, otherwise, your hair will be a greasy mess.  Overall, a great product!!</li>
            <li> My hair always looks great after a visit to my hairdresser, but after I shampoo it looks damaged with dead ends. I am planning a vacation and asked why my hair looks damaged when I do it, but not when she does. She showed me that she has been using Moroccan oil, her little secret, but it&#x27;s quite expensive. I went home and did some research and found that the important ingredient is argan oil and since I don&#x27;t want the perfume I found this pure argan oil for a really good price. After shampoo, I use about a dime size drop, work into ends and then what&#x27;re is left on my hands I work into the rest of my hair.  It has looked great ever since.  I also have dry patches on my nose and I put a drop on it and work into my shin and it has been helpful there as well.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome, makes dry brittle hair look smooth and healthy ,and is an awesome skin product. Can&#x60;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> A great natural oil to have at home  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to order and gr8 for dry skin!  Really helps sun damage.  Several different sizes and they shi very quickly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. This stuff is amazing. Great quality. Highly recommend. Use it on my face and hair everyday. Absorbs quick. Non greasy. No breakouts. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel however I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I am extremely haopy with my poppy austin argan oil. After three or four days my face feels great. And sone bumbs have gotten smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using josie maran&#x27;s argan oil for years yet wanted to look for an equally pure and organic argan oil that will work just as good but wont be as expensive. Placed an order based on the rave reviews here on amazon, got it, opened the bottle and wow...the scent is so strong!! It smells kind of rancid quite frankly. I know that argan oil supposedly has a nutty scent to it, but this is far from that. Disappointed, i was hoping this would replace josie maran&#x27;s argan oil but I guess not. Have any of you noticed the scent or is it possible that I got a bad one?</li>
            <li> product did not do anything for me after using it for over 4 months.</li>
            <li> Very nice but I was hoping for a fragrance which is in the oil purchased in Moroco.  But I like it anyway.</li>
            <li> I love the Argan Oil because it is so versatile.  I use it primarily to take off make-up and as a night-time facial moisturizer.  The skin absorbs it so that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.  I have also noticed that there are fewer fine lines around my eyes and my skin texture appears finer, the pores less visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Poppy Austin argan oil for about a year now. I&#x27;m a fan because it&#x27;s organic, cold pressed, and they contribute a percentage of each purchase to women in Morocco. I use it in my hair, especially on the ends, to keep them from flying away and to impart a little shine. I also use it on the dry areas of my face and on my lips when they&#x27;re chapped. It smells great and I think does a fantastic job of keeping things moisturized. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to everyday moisturizers and hair products.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is amazing.  I love the look of my skin now.  It is also very versatile.  It benefits so many areas on your body.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product with beautiful results!  I use on my skin each night and on my hair after each washing.  Give it a try and be prepared for the compliments that will surely come your way!</li>
            <li> Love the argan oil, had spine surgery aND it took a toll on my whole body, skin and hair included. Feels wonderful on face (little goes a long way). Noticeable difference.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with Poppy Austin Argan Oil. It is great for my hair and my skin. I have dermatitis  on my chin and I have tried everything but nothing worked until I started using Argan oil. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin company sent this out to me ASAP! It came in a glass tinted bottle which I really appreciated for purity and to keep it from degrading. I was originally going to buy from JM on home shopping but this price was much more reasonable and the reviews were good. I went to the You Tube site and watched the video from this company which helped to familiarize myself with them.  The product is very hydrating and light weight. I don&#x27;t know what the complaint with the scent is about, it has a nice organic very light scent and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t filled with colognes etc.  It came as pure product which is exactly what I wanted. It also doesn&#x27;t have the least bit of a rancid smell at all and without the addition of other scents there is nothing to hide it if it did. I would hope that this company would gladly replace the product if an older bottle inadvertently made it to customer. Nice for my hair too. I used it right away on my wind and sun tortured hands and it really helped immediately and later. The nice thing is I can add a bit to other lotions too so I can have some in everything. Thanks Poppy Austin, for a nice product, excellent packaging, and speedy shipping! Lisa</li>
            <li> Excellent product that seems to be doing what I need</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I live in Florida and the humidity here kills your hair and makes you look dead but the Keratin treatment and this combined makes my life so much easier. I use it on my skin also and it keeps it moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing skin care treatment. Works extremely well on psoriasis, an unexpected plus, and as a face moisturizer. Not as excited about it for use on hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product base on the description of it&#x27;s benefits.  I like using Argan Oil for my hair and skin. This oil works well. The only problem is the scent, it is not a pleasant one. However,  since is a natural product it does take time getting used to it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This stuff works. It does just what it says it does and there is no substitute for the best.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m using to correct a severe dry and brittle hair problem that I got from using another product.  I am very thankful that this product was available or I would be wearing a hat right now to cover my dry, brittle hair!  Thank you Poppy Austin for a FABULOUS product!!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this oil to me, and I found it by Poppy Austin.  I watched her video and liked what I heard and saw.  I ordered the product, and it was quickly shipped to me and arrived in perfect condition.  The bottle is larger than I thought.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hair a couple of times already and like the result.  It doesn&#x27;t take alot and feels very nice.</li>
            <li> Seems to be clearing up my skin!</li>
            <li> I do like this as a moisturizer. However, I have extremely dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t do quite enough for me. But I will use it for me hair.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side.  If you do a little research it turns out that there are many less expensive oils that will do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I am of Norwegian descent and living in the Midwest and different locales in Wisconsin, even near Lake Michigan where high humidity is always and issue, I&#x27;ve had very frizzy, uncontrollably wavy hair. Love the waves and curls, just needed to tame them to a manageable shape and style. Argan oil is the solution. I&#x27;ve never had such silky, soft wavy hair that feels wonderful to the touch and looks great, not even reacting to running a brush through it with frizz and less static electricity! Argan oil does not smell offensive and this brand being organic, I know I don&#x27;t have to fret about the bevy of nasty chemicals I read in certain products like it at the major drug store retail chains. If you are fighting frizz and want to know the real potential of your hair, you simply must invest in this product!</li>
            <li> Love this oil - it&#x27;s amazing how my hair just sucks it up, but there is no greasiness. (My hair is a mixture of normal and coarse hairs) Also, it&#x27;s fragrance free - so that is a plus for my family.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Poppy Austin Argan Oil is the best product that I have ever used on my natural, kinky, curly hair ( Hair type 3c/4a). I noticed a BIG difference the first time I tried it. After VERY lightly misting my hair with water first, I then applied the oil. It sealed in the moisture, added shine and definition, eliminated ANY frizz, and really brought out my natural curl pattern! It is not heavy or oily and is wonderful on my face too!  I got compliments on my hair and have purchased several more as gifts!</li>
            <li> I did some extensive online research to find argan oil that met all of my requirements and came across poppy austins youtube. I thought what the heck ill try it out, hopefully its alright. I AM SO HAPPY I SWITCHED TO ARGAN OIL. My makeup glides on like never before and my skin stays hydrated all day even in the bitter cold weather. Hoping it will work for me in the heat as well, but for now, so far so good. Timely shipping, great packaging, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month or so and don&#x27;t really see any changes in my skin.  It goes on well, but I don&#x27;t see any difference between using this and a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Found Poppy Austin on youtube w/a very informative video about Argan oil. I learned on a TV show that French women use it for their faces and ONLY it.  No eye creams, nigh time routines, etc....That is how they look so young!!!  So searched for a pure product online and found Poppy on youtube.  After watching the video -(and Poppy offers a discount too that you can apply on Amazon)- it educated me about the product. I&#x27;ve been using it over a few weeks and my skin is gorgeous! I will be a forever customer and user.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I absolutely love Poppy Austins Argan Oil. I use it every night and my face really responds. My husband liked my results so now he uses it with me. I have used a few drops on my hair before drying and truthfully, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking for there, but I bought it for the skin and I am a believer! I let it set a few minutes and there is no tell tale sign of oiliness. I use moisturizer after.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FACT THat this oil is pure Argan.  I HAVE MIXED IT WITH MY BODY CREAM AND WITH MY FACE  CREAM.  LIVE THE WAY IT FEELS.  SOMETIMES I USE IT ON MY FACE WITH NO EXTRA CREAM.  WILL BUY IT AGAIN.  PIE</li>
            <li> smells terrible and is VERY greasy</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for nourishing the body and hair. Both my and my husband use it and like the way it feels and that it is absorbed so well that we don&#x27;t feel oily after using it.</li>
            <li> I really love this argan oil for my face, around my eye area, hair, and my baby bump!  Its a great all around oil, it also absorbs great into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily.  I even use it during the day under my eye make up and I don&#x27;t have any issues.  I just dab some around my eye area and brush my teeth and by the time I am don&#x27;t I can put on my concealer and make up and you would never know.  I currently only use it all over the rest of my face at night time under my glycolic acid serum and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily at all.  AND the best part is a little goes a long way, for my eyes I only need about half a drop and for my face about 3 drops, if I use it on my neck then maybe 4 drops.  If I use it on my hair I also only use a few drops and for my belly and back I use more since its a larger area.  Also a little back ground on my skin, I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and this argan oil works great and I would recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Aegean oil.  Intended to use it primarily as a facial moisturizer but find I am equally pleased with it on my hair &amp; cuticles as well as the rough skin areas of my feet.  It truly makes a difference !</li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle of Poppy Austin about 8 months ago, used it up,&lt;br /&gt;then decided to save a couple dollars and so I purchased another&lt;br /&gt;nicely reviewed argan oil.  Simply not the same.  Just didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;give my hair/skin the same boost as Poppy Austin does. I was anxious&lt;br /&gt;to use it up and return to your argan oil.  It goes on my face, hands, harms, legs hair.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could drink the stuff (:  Over 60, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my hair&lt;br /&gt;and skin since I started using argan oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan...love the product.</li>
            <li> helped on my weathered cracked hands and also good as a moisturizer on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;my hair will benefit even more from Argan oil in the summer months, once the sun begins to take its toll</li>
            <li> My Poppy Austin is about 60%  gone. I cant say I notice softer skin or hair.  I cant say it was much better at moisturizing. I cant say a little goes a long way. I cant say it was worth 26 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I can say I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now.</li>
            <li> It is much thicker to apply than my sweet almond oil I&#x27;ve been using which goes on the skin like silk, it also has a slightly funny smell, I wouldn&#x27;t say hot garbage, but theres nothing to compare it to. Not pleasant, but not repugnant either. I don&#x27;t think it adds anything to the sweet almond oil I already use so I don&#x27;t think Ill be buying it again. Seems to make my hair happy though, just dont need it for my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally was looking for coconut oil for a facial moisturizer when I stumbled across a reviewer on another site saying she had a similar search to mine and found the coconut oil wasn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough. I have a body lotion with coconut oil that leaves me needing more moisture so I decided to trust in that reviewer and try her suggestion, Argan Oil. So far I am extremely happy! It don&#x27;t really have any odor and 2-3 drops is plenty for face and neck.I just rub it in my hands and pat it on. It soaks in quick and my skin looks fantastic! I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dry skin on my hands and elbows. With just one week of daily use My dry skin is gone. Since it worked so well on my hands and elbows I decided to rub a few drops into my hair. Works better than any conditioner I have ever used. I really like the fact that it absorbs so well. Within minutes there is no oily residue like vitamin e or coco butter.</li>
            <li> Great moisture product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 months ago based on customer reviews. I was searching a an all natural facial moisturizer for my face. I have very sensitive and dry skin so finding a moisturizer that hydrates and doesn&#x27;t irritate can be hard. I absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend it. It does take a little bit to get use to the application process. Since it is an oil, it doesn&#x27;t absorb into your skin right away so you do have to wait a few minutes before applying makeup. Otherwise, my skin has never looked so good. It has evened out my skin tone, reducing the redness of my skin. For the first time in my life, I can confidently go without make up. My facial skin is super supple and hydrated as well. I&#x27;ve said goodbye to flaky dry patches. I have never been happier with my skin. As a bonus, I&#x27;ve used this product for my cuticles and hair. My cuticles look great and it really tames frizz (just don&#x27;t use a lot of it as it can make your hair oily). A little goes a long way, so the investment in this product is well worth it to me. I&#x27;ve maybe used a quarter of the bottle in 4 months.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. I have used Argan oil before, but this is by far a superior oil to the others I have purchased. The fragrance is subtle and pleasing, the oil is silky and light. A small amount is all that is needed for excellent results. I use on my skin and hair and as a hand &#x27;lotion&#x27;; I will not buy lotions any longer because this is so very effective. Being extremely satisfied with this brand, I will no longer search for a &#x27;better&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li> Love it. Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Couple of my friends loves it. It&#x27;s time to try it</li>
            <li> Argan Oil for hair and skin by Poppy Austin is the best  hair product I have every used. It leaves my hair moist and soft, without a greasy build up.  It is difficult to find a product like that for African-American hair. I was also pleased that it arrived sooner than the projected delivery date. I will continue to use it daily. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other oil on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and have noticed a huge difference in my hair. I put a few drops on my hands and rub through the ends of my hair while damp. After blow drying, my hair is shiny and silky. If you have fine hair, just be careful to only put a few drops on the ends and not the roots, otherwise it can make your hair look greasy. It is also very useful for fly-aways. I think it is worth the money because you only need a few drops at a time, so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and they loved it, I liked the price I got it for. Thanks for running specials.</li>
            <li> Amazing for your skin. Don&#x27;t like it for my hair though.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Im using this as a facial moisturizer and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> This is my (a guy with long hair) first time trying argan oil and I really like it.  I live in an extreme dry area at altitude and I use it for both my face and hair.  I should state that I naturally have very oily skin, but I use it on my face after I have showered to replace some of the oil. When I put it in my hair it gives it much more volume and overall my hair feels better and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I  really wanted to like this, since it&#x27;s an affordable Argan oil.  It&#x27;s a nice, light facial oil, but really hasn&#x27;t improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil that does absolute wonders for the hair, replacing &amp; locking in lost moisture. Highly recommended if you are growing your hair out and want to protect against split ends, etc.</li>
            <li> I adore Argan and Rosehip oil. Argan oil has helped my acne scars and doesnt cause any breakouts. Skin is instantly smoother and pores are shrinking. Good quality and will definitely buy it again. I use it for my face, hair and cuticles. I do a lot of swimming in our pool and my hair does dry out from the chlorine. After my daily swim I shower and add a few drops and my  hair is shiny and healthy looking again. Argan oil is a must for every woman! I seriously have never had good skin and Tried so many different creams etc..nothing ever worked until I found this.  And now I cant live without my Argan oil! This is great quality and quantity for a great price!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Argan Oil is my new favorite cosmetic! I use it on my face, neck and hands everyday and it&#x27;s really made the difference this winter with my skin. No dry patches, just supple, soft skin. Has a very delicate scent, love the way it feels on my skin. The eyedropper is great for hygienic application. I love this product! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Got my product very fast.....and this is good argan oil.  Easy to mix into my night cream for extra moisturizer.  I also dye my hair a lot and argan oil is perfect for dry damaged areas.</li>
            <li> Works great at making my hair and skin soft and healthy. I really like that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Before buying I read the reviews about the nutty smell that is unpleasant. Argan oil comes from a nut! So it should smell nutty if its 100% real! I was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the nutty smell. But I know its great for the skin etc. all things natural. The price is expensive. I just started using this product and I will give an update.</li>
            <li> This is the best Argan oil I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many. It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34; I highly recommend this seller, as the customer service is fantastic! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil is great. I put it in my hair before going to sleep at night and my husband does not complain because there are not any added perfumes. This is a must because my hair must have argan oil nightly for damage repair from coloring (my hair broke off). I was using Moroccan oil, but it has so many added ingredients that are not good for my hair and my husband could not stand the smell. Thank you Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> I discovered (to my surprise) that this is an amazing oil! I tried it on my face for a whim. At first it just did not rub around well, however I found out that if I wet my face and put a drop on my wet forehead, top of each cheek, nose and chin - then rubbed it around, it spread nicely. I also did this on my neck and upper chest below my neck too. After about 2 weeks I began to see phenomenal results! Let me explain. I am 57 years old. I ALWAYS wear makeup since I have mottled dry skin. After using this as described above, twice a day (morning and night) I was able to leave off my makeup, put on just a little cover up in just a couple places and only put on some blush and my eye makeup.I left off my usual moisturizer. My face has seemed to even out with it&#x27;s color too, in fact I am very pale and it seems like I have a bit more color in my face. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it! NOTE:  I did stop for a couple weeks and my face turned back into its&#x27; dry mottled look. After restarting use of this oil, my face is now restoring back to its new great look! The bottle lasted me two months! By the way, You could use this on dry wet legs too (which I did), but I found that if I put lotion on my wet legs it achieved the same results. I plan on using for my face exclusively.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a week and I absolutely love it, my skin is softer and already noticing so reduction in fine lines.  It smells great also.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome oil!! I&#x27;ve used the big name brand before, this is as good if not better!!  Save money and great results.</li>
            <li> The oil has a mild smell and feels wonderful on my skin.  I also use it on the dry ends of my hair to make it softer.</li>
            <li> I received this item as a gift from a friend.  We took it on a girls holiday, and it was terrific!!&lt;br /&gt;We added it to our cleansers and bath water.  My friend (a different one) REALLY noticed a difference to her sun/wind damaged skin and asked about buying a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Although my skin it not necessarily dry, I did notice a new \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my skin.  I cannot really explain it better then that.  It just looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I was hesitant to use it on my skin to begin with, as I am VERY sensitive to things on it and after about a week of constant use, my skin looks just great, not one single \\&quot;pimple\\&quot; has shown itself.  As far as a \\&quot;healing\\&quot; type product, using this on my feet for one week has made them look better then they have ever looked!&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Poppy Austin® only uses oil made by local Moroccan woman, to help support a fair wage, for their hard work, makes this the product to go to.&lt;br /&gt;Know that you are getting a high quality product when you purchase this item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> It works great on my coarse frizzy hair.  It takes a little bit of experimenting to find the correct amount to use.</li>
            <li> I saw results from using Poppy Austin Argan Oil the morning after I put it on. My skin looked very healthy and felt soft. I think that it will work well on my hands in the winter--they get very dry, cracked, and painful. If you are concerned about the price, it may help to know that one drop of this goes a long way. I also used a few drops after I got out of the shower to give my hair a bit of extra conditioner. I&#x27;ve heard that it can also be used in dry hair before styling, and I look forward to trying that out!</li>
            <li> This bottle of 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil has been the single best purchase I&#x27;ve made all year!  I use this fantastic oil on everything. From the split ends of my hair, to my rough and dried out cuticles, to the fine lines around my lips and eyes... It&#x27;s even good for stretch marks and acne scars! (Not that I would know about that, though!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Amazing&#x27; is truly an understatement when it comes to Argan oil; it moisturizes, protects, soothes, and nourishes all over, without creating an oily texture on my skin or hair. I was finally able to clear out my medicine cabinet and get rid of numerous bottles of hair toner, facial moisturizer, and wrinkle creams. One little bottle of Argan oil does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m especially happy that I bought my Argan oil from Poppy Austin because it is guaranteed 100% pure, natural, and undiluted. Other brands that sell for a little less money are diluted and full of fillers. May not look different, but there are significantly less effective. Thank you Poppy Austin for this wonderful 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil! I love it, my skin loves it, and I will definitely continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of days to use this now and I am very impressed! I have a rough spot on my ankle that I have to apply lotion to a few times a day if I don&#x27;t want it getting scaly and super rough, but putting a few drops of this after a hot shower seems to do the trick for the whole day. I&#x27;ve used a bit of oil on my hair before straightening it and found my hair stays soft and smooth all day long. I highly recommend it and look forward to trying it in other ways.</li>
            <li> Love this product my skin is feeling softer after just one week I would highly recommend the Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about Argan Oil. I have tried Aloe Vera gel, Aveeno lotions, Coconut Oil, you name it. This beats them all. I have very dry skin and my son has eczema. We put the argan oil in our bath water and I put a few drops on the area where my son has eczema the worst. Literally, in 3 days my sons eczema cleared up. My skin also fills moisturized! This will be my go to moisturizer for the brutal winter.&lt;br /&gt;And as an added bonus, I oiled my hair with this and not only does my scalp feel amazing but my hair looks healthy. I can assure you my hair is damaged from years of perms, but the argan oil gives it a natural healthy sheen that makes me appear to have healthy hair. I have been getting compliments all week. I know there are a lot of Argan Oil brands out here, but this one is truly the way to go for beautiful skin and hair! I am going to stock up on this - because I never want to be without. It is my staple.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is an exceptional product, I have tried it and I think that this one is even better the one from Sephora (which I&#x27;ve tried as well). If I had to choose between them I would choose this one. I don&#x27;t know, it feels different in a good way.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT. HAVE NEVER USED IT BEFORE BUT AM IMPRESSED WITH HOW IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL. ALSO VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT IT IS PART OF A WOMENS CO-OP IN MOROCCO. MAKES ME FEEL GOOD TO GIVE BACK. WILL BE BACK FOR MORE ITEMS.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I only purchased this oil one week ago and I&#x27;m happy with the product .&lt;br /&gt;However I can not find a date of the batch on the bottle as advertised .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends and family since I don&#x27;t like chemicals in my Skincare products .&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you deciding .</li>
            <li> This Argan oil seems to leave my hair silky without frizz, even after a perm.  So I&#x27;ll continue to use it after every shampoo.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for everything with my frizzy hair, dry skin, and moisturizer for my face. It really works. It&#x27;s amazing how this oil works for everything. I loved it.</li>
            <li> I have AfAm relaxed (4x/year) and highlighted hair.  I&#x27;m long overdue for a cut so my ends are very dry.  I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks (after conditioning and daily) and the roughness is gone.  I also use it on the dry parts of scalp (around the part area) and it looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an all-over oil.  I rubbed it on my cuticles and smoothed it on my hands.  This is worth having as a staple beauty product.</li>
            <li> Love it,  I have used Argan Oil for 2 yrs &amp; this is my favorite!  Also,  I love the dropper/ bottle.</li>
            <li> Better than the celebrity brand I was using. This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this oil twice now.  I like it a lot for a night moisturizer.  I add a couple of drops of lavender oil...it&#x27;s great.  My skin has improved since using this at night.</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product right after I have used one, but this one I had too.  WOW!!!!  The first word that comes to mind when using this product.  I noticed as soon as I started blow drying my hair.  No frizzes, incredibly smooth.  It feels like it does when I get it professionally done at the salon.  I love, love this product.  Girls throw out what you have now and start using this, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I like the bottle with dropper and oil is wonderful. I put on my hair and on face and neck. I bought different brand in health food stored and was unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used other oils in the past and have to say this is wonderful. It comes in a large size and the quality of the product is exceptional. I use it for my hands, as a night moisturizer around my face, on ends of my hair and for my tired, cracked feet. I understand it will last some time but I go thru it quickly especially in the winter months. I have researched how to tell genuine quality product since there are so many imitations and mixed products on the market now and this one is the best. The package came intact, the glass bottle (which is the only way to bottle this oil) was wrapped in protective wrap and arrived safely. I will absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product for my dry hair. Use it every day. thanks.</li>
            <li> Great transaction- fast shipping, easy payment options with this sellar. Oil is effective, potent, but not pungent. I apply a small amount directly to my scalp and hair strands (Aftican American Hair). This product makes my hair soft and  manageable. It also allows me to extend the time between relaxers. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth every penny. I&#x27;ve used other oil products before and so far this meets my needs and expectations the best.</li>
            <li> Outstanding, Excellent, I feel so strongly about my positive experience that I find myself bereft of words.  Highest possible recommendation</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil. this product is pure . I just wish it had a fragrance. Some will like the fact that there is none.</li>
            <li> This oil is marvelous. It helps with hair to restore healthy ends and helps with styling,too. I&#x27;ve used it on dry skin areas and it is a wonderful healing balm. Thank you for your great product and service!</li>
            <li> Well packaged; arrived promptly. I am very sensitive to grease and smell and this product is neither greasy or smelly! I am really liking it. Sometimes I add drops to my lotion and this really seems to quench dry skin. I can put this oil directly on my face and there are no issues. I like to put it on before bed. I feel that if you actually get this product to be greasy, you should cut back how much you use by at least half and work up from there if necessary.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Keeps skin feeling great with no break outs. Finally, something this is all natural and works great. Thx for a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product now as directed for a couple weeks and have seen absolutely no benefit to my hair or skin.</li>
            <li> very good product..!! Really worth the money. Would definitely buy another product soon. Would love if provided some special discounts.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and moisturizes my curls. Would recommend to anyone with dry hair that resists every other attempts at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Product sealed and exactly as described. I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase, it was worth every dime! One bottle goes a long way! THANK YOU!!! WILL USE AGAIN for sure, because I&#x27;m hooked! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes my skin and hair feel wonderful I will purchase it again with no doubt, doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my skin or weigh my hair down :)</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for one week, so I am not sure what the long term effects will be, but I am noticing an improvement in the size of pores and the elasticity of my skin overall.  I did have someone comment on how nice my skin looked this week, so hopefully this product is for real.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this Argan Oil product.  Yes I would definitely order Poppy Austin&#x27;s product again. Will have to see what other products she offers</li>
            <li> Unlike other Argan Oils I have purchased this one is pretty stinky.  They are supposed to have a mild nutty smell, but this one is pretty pungent.</li>
            <li> I was looking up articles on products to help with rosacea- like skin issues and happened upon a comment on one of the sites recommending Argan oil. I have heard great things about Poppy Austin in the past so I tried this and am loving it. I have only used it for about a week - I put it on in the morning about an hour before I apply my make-up. It is completely absorbed within about 15 minutes and my face is incredibly soft. I put on a little extra at night be before I go to be and let it absorb overnight. My skin always feels amazing and a lot of my dryness issues are beginning to clear up. The redness on my cheeks (partially adult acne, with a bit of rosacea as well) is starting to fade. There is no odor and it does not have a greasy feel to it. I have read raving reviews about its benefits to dry hair, particularly then ends. People suggest using it on the ends of your hair while it is damp. Also I have heard that it is great for dry feet and elbows also. I haven&#x27;t tried this yet but I will. Also, the bottle lasts for ever. A little bit goes a long way so it is very reasonably priced. Definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom as Argan oil is so popular for use on the hair. I wanted something that would help with frizz and give her a glossy shine. This product as no fragrance so don&#x27;t expect it to spell like another very popular brand that sells this oil. A few drops in the hair and she has less frizz and just healthy looking shiny hair. Works wonderfully on the skin as well and really moisturizes. Totally pure product that seems to have nothing added.</li>
            <li> I had bought Pre de Provence argan oil in a body shop and loved it, I think it may be a blend but it says 100% argan oil.  I had great results and loved how my skin looked and felt.  When I ran out I looked online for more argan oil since the shop was in NJ and I am in NY.  Anyway I had difficulty deciding between this Poppy Austin brand and ordering organic argan oil from Swanson or ordering the Pre de Provence.  Anyway I saw all of the great reviews so I decided to try this one.  The smell is so offensive.  I am not sue it is even argan oil because it smells exactly like rancid Kalamata olives, plus I am not seeing the same results.  I am very disappointed and would like to know if anyone else is having the same problem.  I got mine early this spring...could it be a bad batch or is this the norm, or it is in the processing?</li>
            <li> Wow. So far so good.  Use on my face every night and love the way my skin feels.  Making a change from coconut oil to argan oil</li>
            <li> This product seems OK  I WILL KNOW MORE IN A MONTH OR SO BUT I SHOULD HAVE RE ORDERED THE FIG OIL IT DID NOT MAKE ME RED.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!!</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair, I noticed a significant difference in the first week.</li>
            <li> Love this oil I use it for everything hair, face, body. I love it as a face moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make you greasy at all is perfect before putting your foundation. I also put a few drops on the ends of my hair and it makes the ends look healthy.</li>
            <li> Got my sister hooked on it as well. We can&#x27;t moisturize with anything else now.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery. Great product.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice oil - smell is not so good</li>
            <li> I usually bought Josie Maran Argan Oil but for the 1.7oz from Sephora for $48.00 &amp; I was so pleased with the brand &amp; the product, that it is my go to brand from now on. Not to mention that it&#x27;s 100% organic.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily and is none greasy. Smells a bit like hazlenuts.</li>
            <li> Hair usually grows an inch a month but when I started using this argan oil my hair grew more than just an inch a month! Of course with the help of coconut oil but either way this argan oil Is amazing especially on the tips of my hair. Went from slip ends to great looking hair didn&#x27;t need a trim. The bottle is small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is amazing! It makes my skin look 10 years younger. Totally worth it and I plan to buy more when I run out! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Simplemente asombroso, puedes notar la diferencia al instante, it&#x27;s amazing, you can notice result instantly in your skin, soft and non greasy, love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Josie Maran argan oil for a while because it was less expensive and had good reviews. I got this recently with the bottle just in bubble-wrap (no box for the bottle or any usual instructions and documents) and the oil leaked all over the bag and the bottle. Nothing was included to prove it is real and there is no actual ecocert approval. Sketchy at first glance but I thought I&#x27;d try it out anyway. It does not even absorb into my skin like real argan oil does. It sits on top of my skin and stays wet and oily until you just have to wipe it off, and my skin was still very dry after a couple days of using it. It also does not smell like real argan, it has a foul smell that is not right. If it is actually real (not just another oil marketed as argan as often happens), it is of very very poor quality. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for a specific few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a deep conditioner.  On the evening of my &amp;#34;second day unwashed hair&amp;#34; I will put a generous amount on the tips of my long hair and massage it into my scalp.  I let it sit overnight and then wash out in the morning with my regular shower regimine.  This product is not oily so don&#x27;t worry about your pillowcase being all oiled up.  The product is absorbed by your hair and although I wouldn&#x27;t go out on the town while going through this process you won&#x27;t even realize you have a treatment in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as a hand, elbow and foot oil.  Again, this stuff will just seep into your skin.  You rub it in and within minutes you have soft skin, but not with an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face but didn&#x27;t particularly care for the results, but will trust it for it&#x27;s other uses.  Will use it again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product... but had heard that it is an awesome moisturizer for your face...  I have been using it and can honestly say that it leaves my skin feeling moisturized without being sticky or oily...  I can see a difference in my skin...  I am 68 year  old lady with very dry skin...  I am out in the elements most every day so do need a good moisturizer...  After I put it on my face then I rub into my hands....  Will continue to order this as this is all I am using on my face and neck now...  Love this stuff...  Thanks for making it available at such a good price...  Blessings..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks on my face and hair and it&#x27;s been wonderful. My hair is shinier and not so frizzy looking, it only takes a couple of drops and it goes a long way. My face feels smoother and not so dry either.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I love it especially on my face. I was very pleased with the packing &amp; the time shipping</li>
            <li> I purchased this Argan oil for my hair to compare it with MOraccan Oil and I was disappointed. My hair felt greasy and dull. I decided to use it on my skin since I&#x27;m not going to use it on my hair and it&#x27;s not easily absorbed by my skin, it feels greasy. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> My skin has always been sensitive to new products, but the moment I started using this Poppy Austin Argon Oil, my skin has been smooth, and hydrated. I barely even have to wash my face anymore, and no break outs or anything! I even think my pores are getting smaller! Really awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I used it to replace gel in my hair, and it works fantastic. Apply small amount, I use it a little because with my sensitive scalp I sometimes get dandruff for some reason when I apply to much. (I&#x27;m a male with short hair)</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and was to the quality described in the description. Great argan oil product.. great for hair and skin. Seller is definitely recommended by me!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Josie Moran Argan Oil, which is a great product but twice as expensive. The feel of this is similar, but the initial smell is very unpleasant: almost as if the oil is rancid. Thankfully, the smell goes away almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feels so soft, it is also great on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it softens my skin and lays the foundation for my daily moisterizer.  The only slight annoyance is the smell.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from a mess of frizzy hair ever since my adolescence.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to deal with my hair, and it always made me feel as if my hair is not that pretty. I would feel envious of other women&#x27;s hair that looked so smooth and shiny, totally the opposite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Moroccan Oil, and I love it.  But I learned that it is not as pure as Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil for Hair and Skin, so I thought since I already loved Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;ll give Poppy Austin a try.  Oh man, am I so glad I did! It smelled good, made my hair smooth and shiny, and I use it on my daughters&#x27; hair (they both are in kindergarten and first grade), and they love it because I&#x27;d apply it to help with brushing their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Josie Morans argon oil, which is very good product, but Yours is just as good and half the price!</li>
            <li> Great price, smells good, you can tell it&#x27;s good quality. I will order again, I use it on my hair and face</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long but I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. A couple of tiny drops on my hands was all it took. Made my skin feel soft and smooth and soaked right in, didn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy. So excited to try it on my color-treated hair and my husband&#x27;s psoriasis! The best thing is that there is no fragrance to this oil like there is to some of the other natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have seriously damaged hair from bleaching and dying it all sades of the rainbow. I wanted to try to heal my hair without the BS of up charged products. I order this, having ordered from this company before, and I am glad I did. From just a few days of use I found my ends looking so much better! It absorbs so quickly into my hair, and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell or anything. My maintains a shine, but not that oily shine you get with some products but a health glow almost. I will use this for oil scalp massages here really soon. It would be prefect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No real smell, just a light oil smell in the bottle only.&lt;br /&gt;- A few drops will do you!&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;- Organic. No BS in there!&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- None so far!</li>
            <li> Just looking through all the reviews made me laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 5 stars within a month or two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All by someone who only wrote one review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea, believe it! Santa clause is real too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Moderator: Before you delete this review, take a look at all the other fake 5 stars reviews and judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> I had to come back here and tell everyone about my purchase.  First of all it, I was a bit skeptical about this Pure Organic Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  I confess that, I’ve tried other brands that claims the similar purity and that didn’t turn out as good as I was hoping for then.  But since like many others, I suffer from very dry skin (painful) and frizzy, dry hair.  So, I took a chance with Poppy Austin.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it arrived quickly and neatly packaged with no spills.  I put it to the test right on the spot. It is non-greasy, and with a very soft scent.  My achy skin absorb it nicely, and I got an immediate relief.  It is concentrated, so please be conscious when you try it for the first time.  A few drops should last you for plenty, too.  So anyway, of course I’m also using it for my hair.  Such a luxurious feel!!  It is like an all-in-one product.  Who wouldn’t love something like that? I know, I do!&lt;br /&gt;I plan to order more for myself and give out a couple of bottles as gifts for this upcoming Christmas season.  I know my sister in Texas would appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, what is good for my family and me, it must be for you too. No doubt about that because this a 100% natural product.  It is not a processed product.  I am now part of those who highly recommend this product by Poppy Austin, and we do so by experience.  Give it a chance too; trust me, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Josie Moran. Same quality-better price. Very satisfied. Great for skin and hair. I have very sensitive skin and it does not aggravate at all.</li>
            <li> Love my new find! Poppy Austin! Fabulous product at half of the price of other Argan oils. I will definately try the other products in the Poppy Austin line.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend, she Loves it! She uses it on her hair and body with great results!!  I have to get me some!!</li>
            <li> I used this for quite a while. Things that they advertise that I did not experience: shinier, healthier hair; acne clearing up; overall &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I experienced instead: greasy hair; face burning; acne exacerbated; greasy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good packaging and the oil does lovely things to my very dry skin in this very cold weather.</li>
            <li> this oil is great on my skin. hydrating, smoothing, everything you want. I use it alone or with moisturizer. My face has improved.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this oil on my skin. Who knows if it will do anything for wrinkles (earned well!) but I don&#x27;t care. It just feels so light and nice.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil Softens and moisturizes your hair and is light weight with no additive or preservatives according to the label ingredients.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product along with the Poppy Austin Argan Oil and Vitamin C oil. My main purpose in ordering these products was to have a natural organic moisturizer. I recently had a miscarriage and after that my hormones have been crazy therefore causing a major acne breakout. My hope was that these products would help clear my skin. I can&#x27;t say that they have cleared my acne completely, but I can say that I have noticed a big change. My breakouts are dramatically less, but the thing that I have loved is that my face looks much smoother. I have been using these products for almost a month. I have noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it feels very balanced. I will continue to use these products. I love them. I am still hoping to find something to help with the breakouts a little bit more. I think I need to try a different cleanser as I didn&#x27;t notice that Poppy Austin had one. The Argan Oil has been great to replace my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil for the second time. I have great experience to use it for the  skin treatment. The result is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it regular for the every day treatment. My daughter and her closest friend use it as well with a lot  of compliments.</li>
            <li> Using this for hair...just a few drops worked in really makes hair soft and silky!  The condition of dry, frizzies is going away!!!  Love this stuff.  Haven&#x27;t tried it for skin tho...Perhaps I should!</li>
            <li> This oil did exactly what they said it can do.  I also used it to massage my painful swealing veins . And to  my surprise , all the pain went away!!  Then also my hair started looking better  .</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my hair almost daily. I have wavy/frizzy hair and would need gel or hairspray when I put my hair up.  I no longer need any products other than this argan oil. I bought the oil in February 2014 and I still have a good amount left. The oil is expensive but it does last a long time. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been taking medications and having infusions for RA, LUPUS plus other frustrating conditions.  My hair was falling out everyday.  My skin could not get enough cream on it to stop the sores, dryness and itching.  Since starting to use Argan Oil everyday on my skin the sores are healing and my face is glowing.  I&#x27;ve been using a little on my hair after I wash it and my brush is not full of hair at the end of each day as it was prior to using this product.  I told my Doctor about it yesterday and she told me my face looks much healthier.  My cuticles are healing too!  I find a little bit of Argan Oil goes a long way.  At first I was using it on my thirsty skin 2 or 3 times a day.  Now I can stay hydrated all day with just one application.  Thank you Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> Love this! Have noticed a big diff in my skin and nails since I started using it about a month ago. My nails had been brittle and peeling for like 20 yrs. No more! My face looks smoother and more hydrated. I&#x27;m 54 and wish I would&#x27;ve discovered Argan oil 30 yrs ago! I&#x27;ve given it to my children-- teenagers and young adults-- to start using now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great products and company.  Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Just one word AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t remember what I did before I started using this majical oil💓💓💓</li>
            <li> Love the product.  It works great on my hair, leaving it soft and shinny, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hands and face.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Highly  recommend.</li>
            <li> Only using the one drop as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Any more than that is too much for my hair (I rub it through AFTER putting on face and neck).&lt;br /&gt;I put a drop in the palm of my hand and rub my hands together and gently pat over face and neck, then rub gently in.&lt;br /&gt;Any cream I&#x27;ve used on my face has not been effected by using the oil.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it isn&#x27;t doing is helping my hair as far as I can see.  Argan oil is supposed to be excellent for the hair (especially if it is brittle, or thinning.  Not seen any difference with that.  But that could just be my hair.</li>
            <li> I had watched a show on &amp;#34;How They Make It&amp;#34; recently and saw the story about Argan Oil. The benefits sounded amazing so I had to try it. I received this product about a week and a half ago and I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily on my face and neck. OH MY GOODNESS! I LOVE IT! I can&#x27;t say for sure, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, but it seems to have completely cleared up my acne. I don&#x27;t have really bad acne, but I do get monthly breakouts. I was in the middle of my breakout time, I used the oil all over my face and in two days my face was completely clear. And, it still is. The Oil goes on light and smooth and dries very nice. I put it on at bed time and in the morning as a base to my moisturizer and then I apply my makeup. I love it! I had originally purchased the Oil to put in my hair. My hair is dry and breaks easily. I used in my hair for about three days in a row earlier this week (while on vacation). I mixed several droppers full of oil with water in a 3 oz spray bottle. After my evening shower I sprayed my hair. It did make my hair softer, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will help with my breakage because I&#x27;ve only used it for three days. The issue with spraying it in my hair is it made it look oily, which is completely understandable, it is oil. I was fine with that while on vacation, we were at the beach and pool, so no problem. I would not use it as a daily leave in conditioner. I could possibly use it in the shower and rinse it out. But, for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with how it has worked on my face. I highly recommend this product, even if you don&#x27;t have acne breakouts. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So far this product is just wonderful !! My skin feels soft and hydrated as I live in a dry climate. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results on my skin in a few month.</li>
            <li> Just got it ,and Looove it !!!! . My hair is extra soft and also my skin. Definitely recommend this products !!!</li>
            <li> Great product, received my it exactly as described. Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and usually breaks out really bad every six months. I&#x27;ve been hearing alot about argan oil from some family members who used it, and they had nothing but good things to say about it. I bought the Poppy Austin argan oil to try on her to see if it would help with the dry patches that she usually gets when she breaks out. I must say that within a week of using the oil, her skin is no longer as dry and scaly as it usually looks when she breaks out. I am afraid to stop using it just yet, because she is in the middle of a breakout, but now, she is not as itchy as she usually gets, and she&#x27;s very comfortable, especially at nights. This has helped her skin during this time better than the hydrocortisone that she usually has to use. I think I&#x27;ll stick to this!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Argan Oil after hearing A LOT of wonderful things about not only the product, but this company as well. To start, the item was shipped quickly and packed great inside of a bag and also sealed so it would not leak. So far, I have used this product as a daily moisturizer on my face and nightly on the ends of my hair. My hair is soft and manageable when usually it is dry &amp; brittle; My skin which is combination between dry &amp; oily is now almost flawless so I have seen a significant improvement in both only after using a few times! I was skeptical at first, but my results are undeniable. This product has worked its way into my daily beauty regime.</li>
            <li> After trying other Essential Oils I am convinced this product is one of the best ones I have used to date.  Compared to other Organic Argan Oil products available on the market this one provides the best value and best use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is usually sensitive to other products but I notices a great difference instantly.  My skin feels very well moisturized and has better color tone to it after using this Argan Oil by Poppy Austin.  I would expect a product like this to cost twice as much as it did if not more.  I have shopped around for other essential oil products at high end department store cosmetics counters and have seen such products sell for $60 to $75 for a bottle this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and feels great on my skin.  I highly recommend this product for others looking to treat their dry skin or scalp.  My scalp feels much better after applying this oil.  I have very irritated patches in my scalp which feel fine and much better after applying this oil.  I must use dandruff shampoo which often leaves my scalp dry and itchy but normal moisturizing shampoos do not deal with the dandruff.  With this product I am now able to use my dandruff shampoo and apply the oil to eliminate the dry irritated parts.  Thank you Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it worked really well for my consistently irritated and dry skin. Initially, I was not entirely sure if this product would do what I hoped. Not only does it work well on my dry skin, it hydrates my already-soft skin that needs a little shine. My skin sometimes bumps up and gets rough from the littlest things, and this was a nice relief. It&#x27;s not too terribly oily either, it&#x27;s a bit thicker than I thought. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased! I would recommend this product for sure, especially for those who have such dry skin like myself.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first about using some oil, but I love this product because of its versatility and effectiveness. I use it on a daily basis for all my moisturizing needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that many commercial shampoos and other soaps are often too rough and leave my hair, face, and skin on the dry side. This is where the Argan oil comes in. I use it on my hair to give it some much needed moisture, smooth it out, and add shine to it. The oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave me feeling like I have dirty, oil hair. And it’s also great to bring my hair back to life after using many different harsh products and blow drying. It does wonders for the texture and appearance of my hair. It works well to control flakes too. I just massage the Argan oil into my scalp to moisturize it and get rid of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for other uses, I rely on it as a face moisturizer. It absorbs into my skin quickly, and my face doesn’t feel greasy afterwards. It leaves my face feeling well-moisturized and refreshed. I’ve noticed too that I break out a lot less after having used the product. Not only that but if I ever notice any patches or areas of dryness on my body, I just drop some Argan oil onto the area and massage it in to hydrate any ashy skin. So overall, this product is just a miracle moisturizer and has many other uses. I give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product. I  will continue to use it ... a single drop goes a long way ... it was a great find</li>
            <li> just received this Argan oil. don&#x27;t know much about it, but it does absorb very fast. Am trying it on my hands at this time and also on dry area&#x27;s of my arm. So I do not know how it is working yet.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help with my dry hair (occurred after baby #2) and the fact that I use a blow dryer every day. A friend recommended Argan Oil so I&#x27;ve been trying it on my hair. It really does help bring some life to split ends and is slowly making my hair feel more hydrated and less brittle. I rub a small amount into the ends of my hair right after the shower. I recommend the product and this company does offer it at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is pure argan oil. I was using another brand and paying almost double the price. This is as good as any I&#x27;ve tried. Wish it had a pump top but I can live with the dropper.</li>
            <li> This oil is very nice.  My husband and I have been using it on our faces and hair. It is also great on our infant&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I use it every morning as my moisturizer, under my makeup.  It&#x27;s very light, goes on easitly and there is no scent or by-products to worry about.  It is surprisingly economical because a few drops is all that is needed.  I also love that they give back to the womens cooperatives in Morocco. I&#x27;ve been using the product for more than a year now, and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I feel the difference in my skin after a few days. No greasy feel, no fragrance or odor detected. I only need a few drops for face and neck, leaving enough in dropper to pamper dry areas like heels, knees and elbows. I think this is my go-to for soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer for hair and for body.</li>
            <li> As a first time user/buyer of argan oil I did a extensive research on line to really know what I needed in order to get a genuine product I chose this brand, and so far I am very satisfied with it. One exemption though it does not have the seal of authenticity that it must heve to be certified as % pure. Othe than that I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works at least as well as fancy name brands... The only issue is that there is no fragrance, so it smells a little strange. I use it as a facial moisturizer and rub 5 drops between my hand for my hair. It makes my hair so soft and smooth after hear styling. The weird smell is gone as soon as it dries.</li>
            <li> It soaks directly into your skin -  not greasy at all.  My boyfriend has course hair and he uses it for his hair, said he&#x27;s never had his hair so soft.  I now have to buy 2 bottles - one for him and one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep ordering Argan oil from Poppy Austin - it ships quickly and has an expiration date.  You know you are getting the real thing</li>
            <li> shipping was fast .and I have used it for few days but for some reasons ..me and my girl friend both start getting acne and we never had it before .have to try it more to see benefits</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and my skin gets very dry in the winter.  I&#x27;ve been using a few drops of this Argan oil on my face each morning.  It absorbs well, keeps skin hydrated, and has a subtle, pleasant scent.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Thank you very much for prompt shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Within a few days my skin looked clearer, softer, luminous! I love this product! I had purchased a different brand before that was almost twice the price of this one but this one is superior to the other. I&#x27;ll be purchasing again!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I am 60 years old with a combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I started out trying olive oil and Vitamin E oil (after having radiation for breast cancer.  This doesn&#x27;t work on my faceial wrinkles.  I have noticed that everywhere it is touted that Argan oil is the best oil to use on facial lines and wrinkles.  Let&#x27;s face it - I am really old (79 yrs) and I still live in hope that I can help fight the aging battle.  I don&#x27;t anticipate a miracle - - just something to soften these old age annoyances.  So far after a week of using PoppyAustin Argan Oil I am feeling hopeful.  My skin feels wonderful - not flaky and dry.  I am happy and will keep on using this oil.  Thanks for asking.  S A L</li>
            <li> I have been using the product (Argan Oil) for approx. a week now and I can already feel the difference in my skin, my face and neck, and chest area feel very soft. I also use it on my cuticles at night. I would definitely recommend it and would purchase again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before. I normally use Jose Moran&#x27;s Argon Oil and saw this and thought I would try it. The smell is horrible. I normally use this as a skin care product and can&#x27;t even put it near my face. I read the reviews and thought this would be a great product for a lot less money. Not sure what the smell is, but is very over powering.</li>
            <li> Easy service and a good product</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Argan Oil for my skin after showering. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I also use a little bit on my hair to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the argan oil by Poppy Austin!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I value pure, safe products with limited or no chemical processing.  My 14-year-old daughter heard about Moroccan oil and she wanted to try it on the dry ends of her hair. When we went to the salon, they had Moroccan oil in a very attractive aqua packaging.  Since I am all about purchasing personal care products that are organic and vegan certified, I went home to do my homework.  Well, that &amp;#34;Moroccan &amp;#34; oil&#x27;s FIFTH ingredient was argan oil.  The other four were chemicals or preservatives.  I researched long and hard about how the oil is made, where it comes from and the benefits of its use and decided to try Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil.  I was delivered a product that states exactly what it really is 100% argan oil!  I would absolutely recommend and purchase again.  Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner. Would definitely order again. I used Josie Maran Argan oil and this is much better priced.</li>
            <li> I simply adore argan oil .. and I LOVE this brand.  Great quality, fragrance, feel and economical too!!!</li>
            <li> I received my order today &amp; a little disappointed.  First off, I have not tried it yet so I have no idea if it will work on my hair.  I am disappointed with the advertising and packaging.  The add shows 3 bottles and that was what I was expecting.  I would had thought twice about paying so much for just 1 bottle.  If they want to show 3 bottles it should be more clear that the price is for 1 bottle.  A second thing is that the bottle came very oily on the outside.  I am not sure if that is a defect or normal.  I have never experienced that before.  While I am  disappointed now, I hope it works.  For now I will give it the benefit of the doubt &amp; give it  three stars.</li>
            <li> I  have bought this argon oil for quite some time, it is absolutely wonderful! It is so versatile and pure and a little goes a long way. I will continue to buy this as long as they sell it!</li>
            <li> It worked on my dry and frizzy hair. I can never keep my hair untie because my hair get tangled before using this product. But after I used this, my hair is soft n tangle-free( which I can never imagine). I use this on dry hair mid shaft to the ends just a drop or two is enough. It really helped my dry and tangle prone hair to look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love Poppy Austin&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil! I was skeptical at first and a newbie of knowing what pure argan oil is and using it. I first bought the Josie Maran brand from Sephora to try, however, after watching Poppy Austin&#x27;s videos of what pure argan oil really is I ended up returning it. I absolutely love Poppy Austin, you can definitely tell the distinct difference between Poppy&#x27;s and Josie&#x27;s. Poppy&#x27;s is a golden liquid with a slight nutty scent that I think smells so good whereas Josie&#x27;s is clear and smelled like cooking oil. I bought Poppy Austin&#x27;s argan oil in January and have finally gotten to the last few drops of the bottle. I apply argan oil to my scalp for dandruff and dry scalp control, to my face and skin to moisturize, and of course to my hair to eliminate frizz and give me flawless celebrity smooth hair. I definitely plan on purchasing it again and recommend to anyone considering buying this bottle to get it!</li>
            <li> Has a photo of three bottles for $25 but you only get one.  I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I use this oil with added geranium essential oil and just Argan Oil for my hair. I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product, trust this brand and am convinced it has made a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s health and appearance.  I use it every morning and evening on my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> love how it made my hair feel, i placed it on towel dry hair and let it dry naturally to a very soft touch, one thing thought i think it works too well because it kinda got my hair color back to almost my natural color, kinda odd but nice for me</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I used it everywhere from face to body as a moisturizer.  No breakout noted and the subtlety of the smell is nice.  No sticky residue after application, just the right smoothness of after skin application is wonderfully felt!!!</li>
            <li> My little daughter has light dry and damaged hair before we use Poppy Austin® 100% PURE ARGAN OIL  since the last 3 months her hair became magically thick ,shiny ,soft and healthy thank you Poppy Austin®.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! It has transformed my extremely dry, brittle, color treated hair, to soft touchable hair. It has no smell. I&#x27;ve tried so many traditional hair products and wished I had purchased this sooner. I have also added a few drop to my moisturizer ( body&amp;face), and have not had any breakouts, which I have had from other oils.</li>
            <li> A friend brought me Argon oil recently from her trip to Morocco.  it was miraculous in its assist to my dry skin.  Medication and Texas&lt;br /&gt;heat take their toll, and the tiniest bit of oil healed and lasted all day. Finding Poppy Austin, and obviously the real thing as it is identical to the oil she brought from Morocco, is a very good thing. Thanks for making this product available.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I read you can use it on your face along with your hair and I know longer buy face moisturizer! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second order! Promptly delivered, great product.</li>
            <li> I love this as it leaves my skin feeling smooth &amp; soft, not greasy at all. Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair (been amazing for my curly hair) as well as my face and I saw a difference in my hair immediately. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> The product arrived right away and exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I love what it is doing for my overworked hands and it doesn&#x27;t leave them greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell more like Moroccan Oil, I&#x27;m trying it on just one arm daily and another product on the other arm to see if I can tell any difference</li>
            <li> This is the same Argan Oil I paid twice as much for from another brand.  So happy with this product!  I just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil!! This is a good one for the price.  Josie maran Argan oil would be my first choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Argan Oil.. perfect for dry/oily skin, my hair, and all over my body. I had a shipping problem and the Customer service was simply amazing.. they sent me another bottle for free! Absolutely recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product, I would say its 100 pure agran oil because of its nutty smell but it&#x27;s not to strong which is how it suppose to be. Not sticky and not watery which is also a good sign. How I first used it is different how I use it now, I realized when I applied the argan oil on my hair wet or dry it doesn&#x27;t do the same as the marrocan oil hair product that does have argan oil in it as well. It left my hair a little gressy and I thought to my self maybe I put to many drops. I also realized my hair wasn&#x27;t feel silky smooth or soft just a little gressy shine which isn&#x27;t want I just wanted. I grab my morracon oil hair product and came to see that the agran oil was the 5th ingredients with other weird ingredient in front of it that I didn&#x27;t understand what it was. I didn&#x27;t my research about these other first 4 ingredient in the morracon oil so I can understand why this product gave me silky, smooth hair and this product didn&#x27;t. Cycolensatasiloxane,dimethicone, &amp; cycolmethicone are in alot of hair products and makeup products they are silicones that temporary condition your hair with other ingredients that also can benefit even more.........like agran oil. So I descided to use my John Frieda hair serum that has these silicone ingredient and mix my poppy Austin agran oil with two drops on each side of my hair while wet and it did exactly what my morracon oil does for my hair. I would say u can use any hair serum that it&#x27;s made for hair smoothing or silky and mix a few drops depending on hair type with it and it should work even better.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil is wonderful! The improvement in my hair texture and shine was evident from the first applications. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended I try either diamond oil or argon oil to help tame my split ends. I opted for this 100% argon oil and love it. A few drops on my fingertips helps tame my hair and provides a nice shine. I am grateful that the scent is light to non-existent, and I also appreciated that the product was well sealed and didn&#x27;t leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this Argan oil, my hair is more cooperative, my skin is looking better, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I can put it on wet or dry hair. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell weird. Plus, delivery  was fast and my product was well protected. Another plus is that a portion of the sales goes to help others. Will buy again &#x3D;D ...</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Great texture. Can tell its quality.</li>
            <li> pleasant scent and absorbs well. At first, i decided to use it only on my face overnight, but my skin is so dry, it absorbed too quick, so i decided to apply right after washing my face and a light application just before bed, which helped. Haven&#x27;t tried it on the ends of my hair yet, but will soon.</li>
            <li> This is a great Argan oil. It&#x27;s been wonderful for my skin with the harsh winter conditions we have in the Northeast.</li>
            <li> I have been using different brands of Argan oil for years.  And, I have extremely sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;As far as Argan Oil goes...........compared to the other &amp;#34;famous&amp;#34; brand; you cannot get much better than this!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful on my face and hair, too!  I highly, highly recommend.....especially in all of this cold weather&lt;br /&gt;and the forced drying heat/air inside our homes, etc.</li>
            <li> Argan oil stands alone when it comes to essential oils ... I&#x27;ve tested and tried all oils ! For me Argan oil smooths , tightens , hydrates , gives my skin a healthy glow and it also keeps skin hydraded while I work out :)</li>
            <li> When I bought this, right on the 2nd day I received a very touchy email from the seller very polity asking for a review stating its important for them. I refused to write as I didn&#x27;t know if this oil will work, but now after few months I and 2 of my kids used it for different treatment ( kids for acne -teenagers- and I for face moisturizing and hair conditioner. It is outstanding!!!! I normally don&#x27;t write a review etc. but after I saw the results I felt obliged to write this long and boring review. I ordered 4 more bottles few minutes earlier but noticed that it is from another supplier as in Ipad didn&#x27;t know how to search for same supplier in amazon, but I need the product which works perfect not the seller ;) thank you the shop/company who sold this to me and sorry for not replying to your long and polite email of 2014;) cheers</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER. this product not only protects, moisturize my skin but also helped me with my acne problem. I would say that it can be a bit pricey compared to other products but its worth it. I have been using this Poppy Austin for 2 years now and decided to write a review. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product a took some time to do it. If you decide to use Poppy Austin I also recommend &amp;#34;Rose water&amp;#34;. it works like a cleanser and its really good too.</li>
            <li> I, too, ordered this after seeing the great reviews (and the price was good). I was shocked at how horrific it smells. Finally tonight, after my third time using it, I decided to look up some of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; reviews to see if others had an issue with the smell...sure enough, many people do. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t put this stuff in my hair and walk out the door! I&#x27;ve only used on my skin at night when no one is around to gag at the odor. It&#x27;s also very greasy like I&#x27;ve put veggie oil on my skin. I&#x27;m going to complain to the company and hope I can get a refund, but I have a feeling they will only want to replace it with another bottle of this rank-ness. I won&#x27;t be ordering from them again. I should know better- you usually get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It works really well, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> What can I say other then I love this stuff and have ordered several bottles over the year. Don&#x27;t hesitate if you have acne prone skin it has helped my skin a lot!</li>
            <li> First rate product. I have combination skin that is more dry at times than oily. A few drops of this oil and I&#x27;m good. in my 30&#x27;s and still breaking out, I&#x27;ve seen less breakouts since using the oil in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Fast shipping and a great product! What a wonderful combination! I love the fast shipping, I received it in about a week after ordering it. I have skin issues and it&#x27;s hard to get products to blend with my skin but this oil left the skin feeling so smooth! No sign of dryness! I love it! Thanks!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product and I was really hoping that I found a great argan product.  First of all, this product arrived quickly and the bottle is very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,  there is a very strong odor that just smells \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  I checked the bottle and it appears that it is expired.  It is also very, very oily and does not absorb like other 100% organic argan oil that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Again, I&#x27;m dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of organic argan oil and am very pleased with the product.  The oil arrived in amber bottles with stoppers to help with dispensing the right amount. Delivery was on-time. I am excited about using this product for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Simply put...I mix it with my lotion and my skin feels better. Just a few drops per container of skin cream.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law heard about this oil on Dr. Oz and wanted to try it. Received the product promptly from Poppy Austin and she is delighted with it. She was having problems with her hands and nails and this oil is working wonders. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Well done to all.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for my hair love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Works Great ...Will be back for more thanks a lot :)</li>
            <li> Works wonders on hair &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> Nice to have all natural oil that makes my face and hair wonderful!! Thanks.  Will be buying more for gifts for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my new face skincare regimen. This aragon oil never looks too gresy, but gives my skin a nice glow and feel even when I am not applying make up over it. I absolutely love it and with so little going such a long way, it is well worth the money. Thank you, Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> I know that must seem too good to be true - but this time it actually is! For someone who absolutely did not believe I could live without a facial serum and THEN moisturizer, because my skin is SO dry, especially in the winter with the heater on constantly, all I need to do is dab on a few drops of this tremendous product on my face and brush a small quantity through my hair and I look and feel better than I have ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sincerely grateful to Poppy Austin and their tremendous team who works together to make their products available. Truly, they are have the best products I have ever tried - and my garbage can has had its share of bags and bags of recyclables!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Poppy Austin! I will be back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
            <li> Th Quick delivery made me very happy and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. 100% argan oil. You get your money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for your hair and skin. Your hair will love it. Great product and the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> This has made a marked difference in my skin. I use it morning and before bed. I am well pleased .Miriam Mays</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love the Argan oil for the way my skin feels, really smooth. Also works good on my hair, makes it look shiny.</li>
            <li> Concerned about smell at first but seems to be just like my more expensive brand. So far so good and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  Pricing was very reasonable and much cheaper that other brands.</li>
            <li> This is a very good Argan oil.  It has a slight nutty, warm scent that is natural to the product, but is not overwhelming nor barely noticeable.  It absorbs quickly and smoothly.  I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for about a year now, and it is probably the best moisturizer you can use on your face-- so simple but ridiculously amazing.  I used  to have adult acne, and since using Argan oil, all acne has cleared up.  My skin glows, and is smoother.  It seems ironic that oil would clear skin up, but I think it is the purity of what you are putting on your skin that makes the difference, along with the quality, and vitamins/antioxidants naturally within the product.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this is what I have experienced.  After trying several brands of Argan oil, I would say that Poppy Austin is the best oil for the money value and quality of the product.  It feels &amp;#34;purer&amp;#34; than the rest of the brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I will continue to use this brand.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dry facial skin…seems to be working well enough.  I need to give it more time to see if I will stay with the product once I&#x27;ve completed the bottle.  I don&#x27;t put near my eyes but at times my eyes are affected by this oil; they tend to burn a little.</li>
            <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;You can see the difference as soon as you try it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair and my skin is soften.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It is very hydrating to my skin and hair.  I actually use one drop added to my other hair smoothing products, and that&#x27;s all it takes for me.  I use nightly for my fac .</li>
            <li> Purchased the first bottle for my wife after reading up on the oil.  She used the first bottle and it lasted several months.  She likes it so much we ordered 2 more and it is now all she uses on her face - no more wrinkle creams, eye creams, etc. And at 58 years old, she never looked better!</li>
            <li> Only use one dot for hair and skin. Its wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, I love argan oil. I&#x27;m a natural kinky hair girl;  argan oil  brings my hair alive. This is my first purchase from Poppy Austin and the oil is not greasy feeling but silky to touch. I tried another argan oil by elma and its comparable to that one.  It&#x27;s a great oil and not too too expensive. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product line!!</li>
            <li> Very good it protects my hair &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> Once again I am lauding the virtues of this superb authentic argan oil. This is my second bottle from Poppy Austin, following my introduction to argan oil at the site of its production in the mountains of Morocco. It is truly great for my 85 yr.old skin and a lovely non-greasy foundation for my makeup. (Oh, dear, it doesn&#x27;t remove wrinkles, but that does not diminish its value to me!) Thank you for making it available so that I do not have to fly back to Morocco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;/Users/patriciafinder-stone/Desktop/Pat portraits folder/pat portrait small.jpeg</li>
            <li> finally something natural and organic that works!!</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely manner. I love how it is improving my dry frizzy hair. Even my skin tone is evening out. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it for overnight use and for the ends of my hair. Also use on my hands after dish washing.</li>
            <li> Great product. Came carefully wrapped. Does wonders for the skin. Delivers as promised. I use this day and night and my skin feels so soft. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Argan Oil was with Josie Moran and I was surprised with how well it worked on my already oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would give this brand a try after reading all the great reviews. However, I&#x27;m sad to say that it leaves my skin very oily after a few hours (which the other brand didn&#x27;t do), and I only use a couple small drops!  Since I bought a big bottle, I guess I&#x27;m stuck with this... but I was hoping it would work better than it did.</li>
            <li> First off, I think everyone should pay attention to the &#x27;foul smell&#x27; reviews. If you research why argan oil would smell this way its due to the fact that it was Over-processed &amp; extracted at a really high temperature that kills the valuable properties at which the pure gold liquid is known for. So much for &#x27;cold pressed&#x27; as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its called liquid gold for a reason... the color of argan oil! So poppy austin should explain the reason for clear (cheap, canola like) oil color. .... ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oil does not absorb as an authentic one should immediately confirms that it is 99% fillers. So your paying a hefty price for chemicals with a 1% &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oil (if any in there). You can certanly purchase chemicals in a bottle for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, marketing. Their lavishing, convincing wording and ads. I say, let the product speak for itself. The multiple 5 star reviews left by the manufacturer can&#x27;t cover the truth of other authentic reviews. I&#x27;m not bashing this product, but I do expect a company to stand behind its labeling. For multiple reasons it just doesn&#x27;t match up to their fancy claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I should have paid attention to the bad reviews this product received. The oil is clear like canola oil instead of the nice golden hue the real stuff has. Put in on my hair and waited all day for it to absorb, instead it was greasy and weight down. Then i though maybe i will use it in my face... big mistake, the next couple of days i started to break out and now have a skin issue to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing!</li>
            <li> I have a skin autoimmune disease.  My skin cracks and bleeds it gets so dry.  This wonderful oil even helps my cream absorb easily</li>
            <li> WOW, this oil is amazing to say the least.  I am seeing huge results in about a week!  My fine lines on my forehead are starting to fade and the redness on my cheeks is almost gone!  No need to try Botox folks, this is the answer to a beautiful glowing face!!  Can&#x27;t wait to see my results after a month of use.  A definite must try product.  Highly recommended Poppy Austin Argan oil!!  Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of girl who has tried COUNTLESS of amours of different brands ranging from chemical products (basically in all beauty facial cleansers/serums/moisturizers now&lt;br /&gt;W), to topicals recommended by a dermatologist, I&#x27;ve tried many brands high end (Murad- LOL what a joke. Never saw a change) to low end, such as Cetaphil (thumbs down) to Neutrogena (thumbs down). Basically, I&#x27;ve tried so many and nothing improved my skin. It always stayed the same. So I finally started doing some research and went ALL-NATURAL. (Yay!!!!) I use an all-natural African black soap to wash my makeup off and it does the job. Then once out the shower with cleansed skim, I apply this Argan Oil and let me tell you, it has CHANGED my skin for the better! My breakouts slowed down, my skin cleared up, it is so moisturizing and so smooth and applies effortlessly. I have FINALLY found a product that truly works and I love this oil! I don&#x27;t mind the smell. Hey if it works, I&#x27;m willing to be friends with any smell. And the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all, I know some people don&#x27;t like it but trust me, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker at all. I have oily acne prone skin and this product works. So happy that Poppy Austin stays 100% natural because natural is the way to go in my book. I hope this product works for you like it did me, I am positive it will!</li>
            <li> great stuff and a really good price. I bought more expensive brand last time and this is every bit as good. Why pay more?</li>
            <li> I use this on myself, my kids and now my mother has taken a bottle back to India! High quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a fine Argan oil. The only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 starts is because Argan oil as a haircare product simply doesn&#x27;t work for me as even the tiniest amount I use makes my hair look greasy even when used only at the ends. I&#x27;m sure I can use it as a healthy conditioner and rinse it out but I cannot use it as a final styling tough at all. Who knows...it&#x27;s probably just my hair texture</li>
            <li> This product was shipped Super Fast and I am loving how my skin looks after applying the oil at night!</li>
            <li> I had bleached hair for over four years and have used &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; products to help smooth out the fried ends and frizz the harsh bleach left my hair with. I recently discovered the one product I was using had silicone in it and looked for a 100% natural oil. And here it is. I put a little too much on my damp hair after towel drying it and when I did my hair this morning it&#x27;s never felt or looked so healthy. I&#x27;m so pleased just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much. 3-4 drops will do.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS LIGHT AND ABSORBS WELL I USE IT ON MY FACE AND HANDS AND SMOOTH A LITTLE ON MY HAIR.  IT CONTAINS NO PERFUMES OR OTHER PRODUCTS JUST AS ADVERTISED.  IT WAS WELL PACKAGED FOR SHIPPING AND ARRIVED ON TIME.  I WILL BE BUYING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical,  but I know see that product delivers the promised results.</li>
            <li> Just started using this, so I can not rate it yet.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.  I use this on my dry skin (face/body/hair)  You need very little (1-3 drops) for your face and neck.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It took me just over fifty (50!) years to find it, but FINALLY!  The absolutely PERFECT substance for skin.  Oh how I wish I&#x27;d known about this in my twenties and since. The oil is light,  smooth as silk, subtlety fragrant and the best of all, with a soft massage, it totally disappears, leaving no residue or &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34;, just totally velvet skin.  I heard about argan oil somewhere, went on Google, read a lot of the information and ads and determined that the most trustworthy product and company was the Poppy Austin Company.  Ordered first the smaller bottle, fell in love and just received the big bottle for daily use (saving the smaller as a travel bottle - it lasts 30 months, so no worries it will change composition or effectiveness.)  I promise, I have absolutely NO connection with the PA Co., nor with Amazon whatsoever.  I am just a walking billboard when I find a product that is total perfection and Argan Oil is IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Popo, Louisville, Kentucky, USA</li>
            <li> amazon does an amazingly fast delivery and I&#x27;m very impressed by that.  I&#x27;ve only been using the argan oil a short time  but i like what i see and how my skin feels and it does wonders to my hair.  i also think its a great value because the same oil from josie maran costs a lot more.  so you can be sure ill be buying this again from you.</li>
            <li> I saw this was on sale by ten dollars and saw a picture of a large bottle with no size besides \\&quot;shipping weight is 4.8 oz\\&quot; I assumed it was 4 oz but I got a tiny 2 oz bottle in the mail today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already bought 2 4-oz bottles of argan oil from Savannah&#x27;s and Elma something and they we&#x27;re both organic and cold pressed FOR THE SAME PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is a miracle oil and as a guy I get compliments on my long hair from girls all the time and my skin being \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lather my whole body in this stuff but with 2 oz! I know it is a rip off and that I am paying for the brand, but i think it would cost more to ship it back.... Bottom line try another brand that&#x27;s organic and cold pressed, Savannah&#x27;s was the best imo</li>
            <li> I like to mix about 3 or 4 drops with my night time moisturizer and 1 or 2 drops in the morning. Since I can&#x27;t seem to find any moisturizer that leaves my skin feel moisturized, adding argan oil is perfect. It absorbs very well into my skin. I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan oil and it just sits on top of my face. I did also use it on my hair, but it did not absorb as well. Maybe I used a little too much. I mainly use it on my face and I love it!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MY FIRST PURCHASE FROM POPPYAUSTIN AND I LOVE IT. I AM SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PRODUCT.AND THE PRICE IS GREAT.AND IT IS 100% PURE.</li>
            <li> Have you ever seen hair more beautiful?! A drop or two rubbed on your hands then lightly, sparingly through your hair. Sunshine in a bottle! If your hair is your crowning glory, this is its polish. Work carefully, and preferably with a good bristle brush that works properly with your hair. BEWARE-too much is NOT BETTER</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of Poppy Austin Argan Oil.  This product is a miracle oil!  It can be used on hair, face, and body.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer, leaves skin so soft and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I use Argan oil for my beard. Feels great!</li>
            <li> Great product leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Great oil!  I have coarse, thick and dry hair and I&#x27;m always looking for something to make my hair look healthy and easy to manage.  Now that I finally found Argan oil, I don&#x27;t have to look any where else.  It only takes few drops at a time and I applied it after washing my long mane and it did the trick.  Extremely happy with it and strongly recommend it. Poppy Austin, the company who sells it through Amazon is great to deal with and the product is of 100% quality.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping, but is a tad bit oily, so it takes a while to absorb. But, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil, using it on hair, skin and cuticles. Definately will reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It not only makes my hair look and feel great, but it works wonders on my hands and face as well!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my VERY dry skin due to hormone changes after having a baby.  I really like this product!  I recommend it.  I use it on my face in addition to cream and it works for me.  I will continue to use this.  I am on my second bottle.  I consider this a great buy since it last for 2-3 months, perhaps even longer if your skin is more normal than mine!</li>
            <li> Great product  .....  :)</li>
            <li> So far I love it!  My face really does feel smooth which allows my makeup to go on much easier (I can skip the primer!).  Thank you for the quick service also.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT REAL ARGAN OIL. Anybody who has purchased a quality product will notice immediately -- it smells terrible, does not absorb properly, and frankly is too good to be true at this price. I&#x27;ll be returning to Josie Maran after twice ordering and returning this one (thought at first I had maybe received a bad sample).</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> both product and delivery were perfect. love the oil. I use it on my face at night and ad it to my hair products. use it on my chapped lips and around my fingernails. any dry areas. will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> My wife likes the oil and it makes her skin feel soft and smooth. It&#x27;s just a little o&lt;br /&gt;Ily when first applied but dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and the price. Great for skin and hair and no unpleasant smell. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The care in producing the oil is appreciated. The dark glass bottles (I wouldn&#x27;t buy oil bottled in plastic) - well packaged - arrived on time.  I liked the convenience of ordering through Amazon and could take advantage of free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what is great is the 100% pure oil with it&#x27;s fresh, faintly &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; fragrance and the ability to be applied without being greasy.  It was helped in this cold winter as a lip balm, dry hands soother, and for smoothing away static dry hair.  I was glad to find a product that I could add to my bag of natural healing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it matters to me how the workers are treated who produce the products, and if the products are farmed in a conscious, sustainable way.  A fair wage and protecting the natural resources matters to me. Plus, people who pay attention to that, also seem to pay attention to quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you for the care you took in producing this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this product seems to help considerably.  The smell is a little off putting but once it&#x27;s on, it soaks right in and disappears.  It comes protectively packaged to guard against breakage and came just a few days after ordering.  I will be reordering this item.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Argan oil from Poppy Austin. Especially being in last trimester of pregnancy the oil does the job for the skin.</li>
            <li> I have the driest processed hair and dry skin, The product really make my hair soft and skin smooth. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The best Argan oil, I&#x27;ve tried several brands, this one leaves my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve received quite a few complements about  the texture of my skin. I use it on my face and hands, a bit pricey but worth it. No allergic reactions. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my face every day for about a year and I really love it.  Hoping it keeps the wrinkles away for many more years to come!</li>
            <li> This pure argan oil is a wonderful multi tasker. I use it on my face, hair and skin. I apply a few drops to my fingers rub them to warm the oil and apply. The oil absorbs after a few minutes and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking that I&#x27;d find a recipe to put it in an atomizer--I haven&#x27;t even bothered to do so.  A couple of drops of this and my hair is shiny, healthy and without static, even in the desert of Arizona, all day long without being greasy.  Highly recommend this product.  Also, shipping was fast and the price was better than anywhere else.  Also recommend the company.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this product. It&#x27;s like a mix of fish and manure, definitely does not smell pleasant like Moroccan Oil. Luckily the smell goes away after it&#x27;s been absorbed into the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it on my nails and cuticles and I think it&#x27;s working but my palms still feel like they need lotion.</li>
            <li> Feels light and absorbs very well.  I&#x27;m happy with this product so far after a few days application.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great for my face which is very fussy. I will get tiny bumps very easily if it doesn&#x27;t agree with the product, which is why I have tried many many products. I love that this brand is organic and responsibly-sourced.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and my hair. My  hair feels so soft without  feeling greasy</li>
            <li> i tried this product and didn&#x27;t really see any effects for what it is suppose to do for your hair. I even signed up on the website and was really hoping for good results from this product but i haven&#x27;t seen anything of this oil doing anything to prove it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price</li>
            <li> My wife and I were starting to get genuinely concerned about our son.  His terrible acne, despite everything we threw at it, just would not recede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was it knocking his confidence, you could see that it was painful, too.  We were at a loss, complete and utter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, one night, my wife came home from work with a little brown bottle with a drop of something in the bottom.  I thought it was medicine.  Hey, anything was worth a try by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, it was Argan Oil.  One of the Asian women at my wife&#x27;s work had had a similar issue with her teenage son.  Despite his protestations at the &#x27;girlie&#x27; name, he used it for three months and his skin had totally cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got similar teenage angst from our 15-year old lad, but he knew that the brand products weren&#x27;t working and he needed to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I say, there was only a splash left in the &#x27;medicine&#x27; bottle, but it lasted two weeks.  Okay, it didn&#x27;t clear all of his acne up in a fortnight, but the difference in such a short time frame was remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s not stopped using Poppy Austin Argan Oil since - oh, and it has to be \\&quot;Poppy Austin\\&quot;; go figure! - and his acne is a shadow of its former self, as is his lack of confidence.  And the store of my Mach 3 razors, which I&#x27;m suddenly getting through a lot faster, funnily enough.  So thank you, Poppy Austin...I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the only time we get attitude off him now is if he catches me or the wife snaffling a bit.  And we do.  We use a drop in our hair and even though we&#x27;re both well into our forties, we get compliments wherever we go.  It&#x27;s absolutely astonishing.  Brucie Bonus, or what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, you cannot buy a child&#x27;s confidence, but by investing in Poppy Austin, we&#x27;ve sure put down a healthy deposit on his future.  It is that darned good.</li>
            <li> This is very nice oil leaves my skin feeling smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It soaks right into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and dewy.  The scent is a little different, not terrible, however it dissipates quickly and is not noticeable within a few moments of application.</li>
            <li> Every bottle of Argan oil I have purchased has smelled slightly different. This one has the strongest nutty smell and the August 2014 batch smells like meat to me, which I don&#x27;t like. It absorbs quickly, like all the other bottles of Argan oil that I have purchased, so the smell goes away pretty quickly and it absorbs at the same rate as the other bottles. There are some other bottles of Argan oil on Amazon that have better prices. Example: Pura d&#x27;or 100% Pure &amp; USDA Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.) For Face, Hair, Skin and Nails is only $19.99, which is less expensive than this bottle. I bought that one too and the smell is milder. I don&#x27;t know if Josie Maran does something to the oil that takes away most of its smell, but that&#x27;s the only brand of Argan Oil I have that doesn&#x27;t have a strong nut smell (I have purchased 2 bottles and both exhibit the same smell and absorption characteristics.)</li>
            <li> Oh, this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after cleansing my skin.  It softens and soothes.  My skin is 60 years young and the Aragon oil helps it look 50.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fair price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have got very frizzy hair. But this product works great for frizzy and dry hair. It actually smoothens them leaving them soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Poppy Austin Argan oil for 2 weeks now, along with the Vitamin C serum... The results are amazing and my skin looks and feels beautiful. It has actually transformed my skin!&lt;br /&gt;This Argan Oil is luxurious and is the best quality Argan oil I&#x27;ve come across so far. It&#x27;s also a great price for the amount of Argan oil you get. I absolutely love it and am excited to try other products by Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil. I have very dry skin and hair and it is helping both problems.  When you are 64 and have health problems it&#x27;s nice to find a produce that really works.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I had a really bad dry spot on my nose that seemed to be spreading despite my using almond oil and the other skin care products.  After using the Aragon Oil for a week it is gone.  I would recommend this to anyone who has been struggling with very dry skin.  This oil is awesome and you only need a drop or two to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is the best I have bought,it leaves my frizzy hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help clear up the dry skin caused by my beard. I apply the argan oil on my face after I get out of the shower. It seems to be working very well, and I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s freshness and purity and will make it part of my daily beauty routine for face, skin and nails. I appreciate the ease of the pump dispenser so it always ready to use easily. Also, I am grateful that some of the profits are sent to a woman&#x27;s co-op. I will reorder this fine product again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin and hair love this product.  I mix a few drops with my moisturizer after washing, and my skin is definitely benefiting.  I use it undiluted on &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;Nice on elbows, too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful customer service and product.  I have only been using the Argan oil for a couple of weeks, but already like the way it feels on my skin, nails and hair.  I find myself carrying the bottle with me in every room, so that I can keep it on my hands during these winter days. I will definitely repurchase a bigger bottle, when I start to get low on this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received the product as stated in the description, a good size bottle for the price. I have been using it on my split ends after showering and LOVE the results. My hair is soft and shiny. I was worried it would weigh my hair down or make it oily, but if I use it when my hair is damp it dries nice and soft and shiny. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It leaves my hair nice and soft. What I did was put a few drops in my conditioner and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Argan Oil recently, I never took the plunge to try it out until now. I admit to being hesitant. Even though my skin is dry, it makes me uneasy to think of adding pure oil to it, but since I&#x27;ve tried this Pure Argan Oil, I&#x27;m a believer. I put it on my face, where it gets particularly dry, after a shower and didn&#x27;t need another moisturizer. My skin was left smooth and did not feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle I was very put off by the smell, but when it&#x27;s actually on my skin it is a much warmer and more bearable scent (if you&#x27;re looking for something that smells like chocolate chips cookies or fields of flowers, however, argan oil of any brand is not the answer). I also like that this Argan Oil is organic and would recommend this product overall.</li>
            <li> The argan oil is just what was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is organic. It is easy to&lt;br /&gt;apply and you feel right away that you are&lt;br /&gt;doing something nice for your skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product. It penetrates n feels wonderful. I put it on n instantly put makeup on. I feel n look younger. Can&#x27;t wait to try her vitamin c oil!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this product! I use it on my face every night and it actually does what it says it will do. I have celiac so I appreciate that it&#x27;s a pure oil with no chemicals or gluten.  I live in a dry climate so I always had a bit of dry flakiness on my chin and sides of my nose. No more dry flakiness! My skin has never felt or looked this soft and supple. My only regret is not finding out about Poppy Austin Argon oil sooner.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil.  It is a very high quality that absorbs completely into my hair, which leaves it thoroughly moisturized</li>
            <li> Love it.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> It was as good as the seller described ! Great Buy</li>
            <li> It has served its purpose. Although it smells pretty bad, but can be used considering as a medicine because it worked miracles for my hair. About the smell, I&#x27;ve added fragrance to overcome that.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I never thought I&#x27;d put oil on my hair...but a few drops does a wonderful job of fluffing, shining and defining my slightly dry blonde hair. It&#x27;s delightful on skin. It is very economical too --A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is a live saver for my skin - - it somehow &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; my facial skin and erases years. Argan oil also works wonders for the rest of your body, especially for your cuticles and those creepy elbows.  Just Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Was excited when I read the reviews and decided to order, once I recieved the oil I used it right away and it is amazing!!! Didnt think I would be happy, but was pleasantly surprised. This oil made both my hair and skin feel so soft. I have very dry hands from working with paper all day and they are so dry and rough, I&#x27;ve used this product every day, and my hands feel amazing!! first product to make my hands feel soft and I&#x27;m no longer ashamed, and dont mind if I have to shake hands with someone now. Thank you for making such a good product, its worth every cent!!</li>
            <li> I heard miraculous effects about Argan Oil, and after just two applications to my very dry face, it did work miracles!  I&#x27;ve applied it daily for a week now, and my skin is silky smooth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my hair. It really works well when I put in the oil when hair is wet. I will then blow dry and use a ceramic flat iron. I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> At 1st I was a bit hesitant to leave 5 stars cuz of the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as my high end Josie Moran, but it smells slightly nutty. It is a yellow oil, and comes in a dark bottle with a dropper, so far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face at night and I love it for that. Its a great moisturizer, and a great buy for something I was kinda unsure about buying. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I started with another brand name of this oil, but noticed right away this one smelled different(better), more like what it is, because the other brand smelled more like oil, just plan oil.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing a lot about argan oil lately so I decided to give it a try. The idea of putting oil on my skin was a little scary but to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t make me break out! Instead, after using argan oil twice a day for two weeks, my pores have nearly disappeared and I haven&#x27;t had acne yet! I highly recommend Poppy Austin argan oil!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of using Argan oil on my face, but after hearing about this product I decided to give it a try. I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate so I needed something that would thoroughly moisturize my face. My order was in my mailbox 2 days after I ordered it and was in great condition. I have been using this for four days and cannot believe how much better my face looks already! It has helped my acne, reduced my crows feet dramatically, and added a dewy glow! I&#x27;m a firm believer in this product now!</li>
            <li> this oil isn&#x27;t greasy nor does it feel greasy on your skin or hair. you apply a few drops and your skin absorbs it very nicely and that&#x27;s it. No left over greasy feeling on your hands or hair. Just note that I have dry hands and dry hair. so absorption may differ by hair and skin type.</li>
            <li> Received shipment in less than 48 hours--that is better than I could ever hope for.  And once it got here--I began using argon and haven&#x27;t stopped. Love it!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this argan oil quite a bit. The consistency is rich (and works even in the hot and humid South!) and a little goes a long way for my whole face. The smell is a bit odd, but is extremely faint and fades within a minute or so. I think this has made my face look more refreshed. And I like it for my hair but I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the right amount to use on it yet. I have thin hair and while the oil has made it noticeably softer (for real!), it only takes a tiny amount or else it starts getting greasy looking. This would be an ideal everyday product for thick hair and is a good treatment for thinner hair. I would recommend especially as the price is very good for the quality.</li>
            <li> I use several drops of Argan oil on my hair almost daily to keep my hair conditioned and shining.  I use it every night and morning under makeup to keeps my skin moist.</li>
            <li> I am surprised with the effect it had ... really soft conditioning..I used it both for hair and skin..I had slight dark circles..and they are now all lightened..my hair needed a good conditioner..and this just works so well..!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great assistance and support! Way to go Poppy Austin team! Satisfied here. Love, love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Josie&#x27;s Argan oil for years and now that I&#x27;ve tried Poppie&#x27;s, I will not order again. Poppy&#x27;s Argan oil is thicker, so less is needed. , and I feel it penetrates quicker. I also like the batch number information posted on bottle, so you know you are getting real Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft! I have rosacia and this works great to reduce the redness. Great product! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I make sure I stock up. I love using this. I either use it alone as a moisturizer on my face, and sometimes I will mix it with my moisturizer. Great product.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin provided important upfront information about the harvesting and processing of their oils as well as conveniently placed batch numbers and bottling dates right on the label. The product was promptly delivered and has lived up to the high quality they promised. I use this product on my face, hair and skin as well as adding it to other products.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on schedule. It came packaged properly and was in pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;The product has been wonderful to use. I&#x27;ve applied it to my hair, face, hands and body, and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best relief I&#x27;ve had for dry chapped winter skin. Although I think I&#x27;ll be using this product year round.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again. As a plus I was able to use my Prime free shipping with this seller</li>
            <li> This really is the oil of gold.</li>
            <li> Bought this oil because I heard it might help with psoriasis. I have very sensitive skin and did not have any reactions and was happy about that. I&#x27;ve used it and it seems to be helping. The bottle was packeged very well and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin and saadia organics are the only brands of argan oil that I trust. It has cleared up every skin issue I have had! I no longer have acne or blackheads, fine lines around my eyes are no longer noticeable and best of all, my daughter&#x27;s skin is soft and smooth with no more irritating rashes. I would highly recommed this to anyone, with any skin issue, please don&#x27;t be scared to put this oil on your face!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every night.  It keeps my face soft but not oily.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have used other argan oils, but nothing compares to this one.  It is 100% pure and it makes my hair and face feel so silky and soft.  And you use a lot less.  Doesn&#x27;t have that greasy feeling like other brands.  It is great!  Thank you, ladies!</li>
            <li> Nice oil. Use it on my face. Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference from extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> Live the purity of this&lt;br /&gt;argan oil.  It is my second bottle and I use it daily on my hands and nails.  Seems the dark spots on my hands have faded, too, since using it.</li>
            <li> I used it on face and all over my body. It made the skin smooth and youthful. Even and lighter skintone with less pores are the first results I am seeing, since I started using it 1 week ago. I have orderd already a second one.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with everything from shipping to the product itself. I like that its organic, it has nothing else in it, and it helps women from Morroco. I watched a TV special on how they get the product going, they work hard. I would recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> Love, love love this product.  I use it on my face with avacado oil and a few drops of Argan oil to face and neck.  Mix also with my hand cream just a drop or 2 and when the hand cream is gone will also mix with the avacado oil for my hands as well.  I have very dry skin.  For those who have normal skin grapeseed oil with a few drops of Argan oil and your set to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing less brown spots on my skin where I use Poppy Austin Argan Oil and my skin feels considerably more soft.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face, not my hair.  It feels very good!  Don&#x27;t need much.  Put on after washing your face so their is some moisture already there.  It gets very dry in MT and helps a lot.  I should get a big bottle for legs and arms. Didn&#x27;t make me break out at all and my face is rather sensitive.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a bit of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and arrive on time</li>
            <li> I feel like the only thing I can say is that this stuff is fantastic. A little goes a very long way, so the price is definitely worth it; and as most people say, it is very lightweight and absorbs easily. I have fairly normal skin, but with a somewhat oily t-zone. I have been pretty blessed with clear skin throughout my teenage years and beyond, but recently started developing zits on areas of my face I&#x27;d never had in my life and at a much higher frequency than normal (this was ongoing for several months). I think it was a result of me being too harsh on my skin in combination with a very dry climate. To remedy the issues, I tried switching to gentler face washes, making sure to moisturize consistently, etc., and nothing helped. But, then I decided to take the dive and try out this argan oil. It is for sure what helped bring my skin back to its original state--if not better. I have no dry flaky skin (hard to combat in the winter where I live), I don&#x27;t get anywhere near as oily in my t-zone, and it has even cleared up a couple odd red patchy areas. My skin looks far better than it has in a long time! And, not a SINGLE zit! I waited about a month to leave a review to see how it got along with my skin around the time of my period, and it has certainly passed the test. I would highly recommend trying this out. Don&#x27;t be scared of oil!</li>
            <li> Oil is wonderful. It makes my hair shiny and no Frizzies. Great product.</li>
            <li> great product.  Couldn&#x27;t live without my Argan Oil from Poppy</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Argan Oil for about a week now and her hair is smoother and more shiny, oh and tangle free I might add. Just a few drops of this product in some hand or body lotion and it will make your skin almost new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for its purpose, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-J</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Argan oil for hair and skin by Poppy Austin . Makes me naturally glow! Five stars all the way.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Finding many ways to use it.</li>
            <li> It is NOT easy to find facial products with ZERO fragrance or chemical additives.  Poppy Austin® Argan Oil seems to be the ticket so far.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and my skin is less dry and more plump.  It provides a radiant glow but is not greasy.  It has a slight (natural) smell for a moment when I put it on but it dissipates in seconds.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil..keeps my hair shiny, soft and moisturised. Light oil packaged in dark brown glass bottle. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Dear Poppy Austin, I have studied and analyzed Argan oil. I have come to the conclusion as many others also, that, it is one of the top organic carrier oils in the world (if it is not diluted or anything added or taken away from it) for its healing, health, and conditioning properties. There was a very prompt, noticeable, change in my facial complexion. Quite clear, smooth, and soft. Very healthy looking. Now, it has proven to be one of the best carrier oils that also promote healthy hair, as well as growth. I now use it as my main ingredient in my personal BEARD OIL. My beard is about 12 inches long now and still growing, and the Argan oil has significantly increased the health and thickness, fullness, and ultra softness of my beard. It also has added a very gleaming shine to my beard, and is very manageable now, as well as the hair on my head. Anything organic is the best, as this is how the Good Lord Jesus intended us to eat, and take care of our personal hygiene. Anyone reading this should sence this for themselves, so if you are able to, obtain this PURE ARGAN OIL, and learn how to use it for your specific needs, and you will be blessed. Thank you Poppy Austin for your truthful information and very informative and cheerful you tube on this oil. Your neighbor and friend Barry. John 3:16</li>
            <li> I originally learned about Argan oil when Sephora gave me a large sample of Josie Maran Argan Oil. I threw it in my closet and didn&#x27;t think of it again for like ever. However one day reading reviews I saw that Argan oil has amazing properties for the skin.  So I started using it and loved it. So I decided I wanted to buy it till I saw the stupid outrageous price.  $58 bucks for a 1.2oz of Josie&#x27;s product.  Hell to the no!  I decided to read the label and saw that all it had was 100% Argan oil and that it was cold pressed and filtered to keep it clean.  So I googled and found that Poppy Austin was selling the same thing for a 2oz for a lot lot less. So I bought it and loved it! Truth be told, its up to the consumers to read labels and not be taken for a ride.  Just because I get a bottle and fill it up with tap water and sell it for 2 bucks and YSL does the same doesn&#x27;t mean they are selling a better product if it all comes from the same source.  I appreciate Poppy Austin not taking advantage of that and charging up the wazo for Agran oil which you can also buy at any health food store for the same price.  As long as its 100% agran oil, cold press, properly filtered, nothing added or taken or away in a dark bottle with a droplet then you good to go!!! Nonetheless I will keep buying it from Poppy Austin as they charge a decent price for a decent size bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days and I&#x27;m hooked. Easy to apply, easily absorbed and virtually no scent. My skin looks great and my hair is shinier and smoother than before. I chose this product because it&#x27;s organic and pure, which makes me feel good about using it on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Asian friends of mine.  As an aging white male who would like to hold onto what little he has left of his age, it helps.  Makes skin shine but not look oily or greasy.  Feels light and smells light.</li>
            <li> I have hair that frizzes in low humidity and gets outrageously frizzy in high humidity.  I wanted to get a keratin treatment but was concerned about the chemicals in the formula, even those that say they have no chemicals.  My cousin told me to use argan oil so I researched argan oil and read reviews on amazon and poppy austin was the one that came out the best.  The first time I used to much oil and didn&#x27;t like the way it worked...but I now just use one drop mixed with my gel and today is the most humid day of the summer at 100% humidity and my hair is not frizzy and looks nice and clean and shiny.  I highly recommend Poppy Austin Argan Oil for Hair!!  FYI, I have tried other argan oil brands and they did not work as well on my hair as this brand does!!</li>
            <li> Argon oil is a wonderful moisturizer and this product was well worth the price.  It was exactly as described which is why I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.  Great product, great vendor.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients. The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available. Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price. Furthermore, the company donates a portion of the proceeds of EVERY bottle sold to a women&#x27;s charity in Morocco. (Read all about it on the Poppy Austin website.) You will love this product as well as their rose water toner, barbary fig oil and Vitamin C Serum. So glad I found these amazing products. I will never switch skin care products again. Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer. I recommend argan during the day and barbary fig before bed (as it tends to make skin a bit shiny).</li>
            <li> Does wonders on my hair! Makes it soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin.  The price is good.  Very effective oil.  Have not tried the hair yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, thought it would work but haven&#x27;t seen results.</li>
            <li> My dry, brittle, frizzy hair became soft, shiny, bouncy happy hair since I started using this product. I thought there was no more hope, thinking that it was a part of ageing that I had to accept but was I wrong - the frizz all gone, and every morning I wake up to soft bouncy hair and I&#x27;m so thrilled! I&#x27;m repurchasing for sure. Thank you, Poppy Austin for such an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wonderful product!  Great for your skin which absorbs the oil over night.  Also smooths and conditions my flatiron weary hair restoring shine and controlling frizz.  I will definitely purchase this again when needed.</li>
            <li> SO - I wanted to try this out as an experiment.  All my life I&#x27;ve used various drugstore cleansers and face lotions.  Most of the cleaners had some sort of salicylic acid treatment in them because I was trying to stick it to my acne - because acne hates salicylic acid, right?  NOT.  I still had acne.  Not terrible acne, but still sucky acne.  And with the products I used to combat the acne, my skin stayed dry.  I finally was totally sick of having acne AND patchy dry skin around my nose and mouth so I decided to give this baby a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put all of my old cleansers under my sink and started solely using the Poppy Austin Argan Oil and a Josie Maran cleansing oil.  In the morning, I&#x27;d wash with the Josie Maran cleansing oil, add 3 drops of Argan Oil to my face, and finish with a face lotion with sunscreen.  At night, I&#x27;d clean with the cleansing oil and add 4 drops to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I have to say is HALLE-ARGAN-LUJAH!  I&#x27;m so happy.  My face is brighter, CLEARER, and the dry skin is gone.  Now - I have definitely had some acne while using this product BUT it&#x27;s so dramatically reduced that I feel confident saying this stuff helped.  I&#x27;ve been using both products for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to anyone who asked.</li>
            <li> I always feel good about using products which are produced with care for Planet Earth and Poppy Austin fits the bill perfectly as well as giving back to women in need.  I love the Argan Oil and use it for my curly frizzy hair.  It keeps the frizzies away and leaves the curls shiny therefore it makes my life happier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Poppy Austin Argan oil for about two weeks now and I can honestly say this is a wonderful product. I have very frizzy hair and this leaves my hair smooth and luxurious looking. Does not leave it oily like some other products that I&#x27;ve used before. It is worth every penny. :-)</li>
            <li> Just received the product and can already tell I&#x27;ll be very happy. Smooth a little on my ends to give them a more polished finish. Doesn&#x27;t appear thick of greasy. I can tell this little bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I color so even with conditioners, it can be frizzy and dry looking.  This product is great for calming the frizz as well as improving the hair.  I have used expensive salon products and find this is much longer lasting - I don&#x27;t have to use ti daily - and does a better job.</li>
            <li> works good leave hair soft and shinny</li>
            <li> love it...so far the best I have found in the US.</li>
            <li> its up to you but as per the poppyaustin.com says:&amp;#34;For the avoidance of any doubt, our products are manufactured and sold exclusively by Poppy Austin Limited. Without exception, no other company or individual is licensed to sale, replicate, reproduce, or manufacture any Poppy Austin branded product.&amp;#34; I am considering to buy but decided to check on poppyaustin.com first and there i found their statement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and like it so much I intend to have it delivered regularly. The trick is finding how much to use and when. For my short, color treated (and older) hair, I find it works best when I apply the Argan oil when I&#x27;m about 3/4 through a blow dry. I use only a tiny amount on two fingers, rub it into the skin, and then dab  to ends of hair. After the hair is completely dried and styled, I put an even tinier amount on one finger tip, rub that in among all five finger tips and lightly touch to hair ends to smooth and then rake fingers through top of hair and bangs to add texture. A little goes a very long way for me, and it makes my perennially dry hair soft as can be without weighing down. (By the way, I love the way my hair looks when my stylist uses a Moroccan oil product with silicone for the sheen it adds, but I find it is terribly difficult to wash out the residue which tends to weigh the hair down for a week following the first delightful effects of the application).  For me, the 100% pure Argan oil is the most practical conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For face and body, I use more Argan oil (several drops in palm). It can be used by itself, but I find that I usually want to mix in with a thicker skin lotion. It&#x27;s interesting that Argan oil seems to act to super charge products so that drug store products (I like Cetaphil) now work well enough that I don&#x27;t feel as moved to buy more expensive moisturizers for face and body as I used to. My skins actually feels nourished in the way I sense it ought to if I hadn&#x27;t been so neglectful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For feet, I do apply Argan oil, but I usually feel that I need more firepower for the poor neglected dears and add higher tech creams that give me an immediate sense of nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a low-tech but for me highly effective basic.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! It has really helped to make my hair silky smooth and my skin as well. I am happy I heard about it and tried it because the difference is unbelievable! I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> Sorry, the argan oil ordered 4/18 is still in transit.  it&#x27;s my second order and it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after trying coconut oil, which I really liked, but it seemed to make my pores bigger. Argan oil is soooo much better! It moisturizes and tightens my pores. It does have a slight sesame seed oil smell that I&#x27;m not a fan of, but my mom couldn&#x27;t smell it at all and the smell goes away in a few seconds, anyway. I definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I can use the argan oil daily on my sensitive skin and it helps keep my eyes from being red and wrinkly.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using argan oil faithfully and it has really been beneficial to my hair and skin.  I recently ordered Poppy Austin instead of my usual brand (Josie Maran) in order to save money.  Poppy Austin is equally as good a product in every way and my pocketbook is very pleased as well.  Customer service was great and I will continue to order this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I chose the 5 star rating because my skin absolutely loves this Argan oil. I have used rosehip oil, bio-oil, emu oil (do not use straight emu oil, it made me break out), so I know a good oil when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I used it I woke up the next day and my skin looked happy-all over my face. I use it at night on my hair, hands, legs, face, chest, etc.  It&#x27;s really light and I reapply during the day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it has a kind of funny light smell that goes away after a while, or maybe I just get used to the smell. I used it on my husband he did not seem to notice anything. They say it smells nutty on their website- but I don&#x27;t know about that. Anyway, it will not deter me from continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different skin types so I don&#x27;t know who can use this. I actually have oily skin but when I apply oils to my face, my face doesn&#x27;t oil up on its own. I have been using it for one week now with no break outs from the Argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research and went with this brand because they really explained stuff, on youtube and on their website, about the oil, that others did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for the results I am getting. I will only use all natural products on my face. I have bought really expensive creams with stuff in it that I can&#x27;t pronounce, that did not work as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can tell,  I really like this product. But I can only tell you about my experience. I think it really depends on the type of skin you have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Argan Oil by Poppy Austin for a few weeks now, but I do like it. I use it mostly on my hair. I&#x27;ve decided to stop putting relaxers in my and I now have very short hair. I never thought I would have my hair this short but being 65 and not having to put the relaxers in and dealing with styling it makes me happy, it&#x27;s so much easier to maintain.  The Argan Oil gives it a nice shine, my scalp is not as flaky and it feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;KDAD</li>
            <li> Okay you Argan Oil lovers. You will be so thrilled with this product. I have oily/combo skin, leaning towards oily. It may seem counter intuitive to add oil to oily skin, but as you age, you will notice that your skin is dry underneath it all. As well, if you are dry, your skin will naturally produce more oil. My skin has been much more nourished and acne free after using this product, It has been many months before I posted this review, just to be sure it worked.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice and I love it! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. It&#x27;s great to put a couple drops in your favorite moisturizer for an extra boost.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure about this Argan oil.  Has a much different smell , perfume, just cannot explain it well.  Not very impressed at this time!  Sorry just not the same as I am use too!</li>
            <li> So far the Argan Oil seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> Was on time and there was no issues with the product everything looked good.</li>
            <li> I do like the Argan Oil very much.  Once it&#x27;s rubbed in there is no greasy feel on hair or skin.  My skin does feel softer and it&#x27;s looking good.  I&#x27;ll stay a customer.&lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
            <li> I have course, thick, curly hair, and it has never been manageable without me spending several hours a day on it. Even then, I&#x27;d get maybe half a day of calmness from my curls before they would frizz out. I&#x27;ve been using the Poppy Austin argan oil for almost two weeks and my hair is so happy with it!  I blow dry and straighten my hair rather often, and this has kept my hair from being so brittle. I&#x27;ve already noticed that the breakage has been reduced. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my face since I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to find a mosturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause my face to burn and peel. My skin and hair look amazing! The only warning I have is to be aware of how much you are using. Your hair can get greasy looking very quickly.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this Argan Oil, I had been previously used the common Sephora brand Josie Maran and I was please.  When I purchased this one on Amazon I was blown away, the texture is amazing! my skin feels supple and moisturized all day! I apply it everywhere!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product and the seller. I purchased the Argon oil to use on my 3 year old daughters hair. She has very curly hair. I began noticing her hair was becoming more and more dry with the products I used to detangle and style. I saw immediate results. After the first day of use I noticed her curls looked much more defined and moisurized. We have been using it for a week and I love it. I don&#x27;t even need to comb thru her hair. I use my fingers and she actually let&#x27;s me do her hair now. As gentle as I was before, and with all the detangler i used, it still pulled. Now, I simply place 5-10 drops at a time in the palm of my hand, and run it evenly thru her curls that are wet or damp. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Plus, my order arrived 3 days before promised!</li>
            <li> Love this product this is my second  bottle</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that this is a high-quality product, and probably will work well for others. Despite trying it multiple times and in different ways, it seems to cause acne for me. I am hoping to find another use for it.</li>
            <li> If you want your face, neck and/or other parts of your body to look fresh and radiant + Baby Smooth - then I HIGHLY Recommend Poppy Austin&#x27;s Products. I use the &amp;#34;Finest Rose Water Facial Toner&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; and finish with the Argan Oil! I also use a few drops of the Argan Oil every few days on my hair ~ LUXURIOUS! Tames the frizz from my natural curl! AND if you have any questions, their Cust. Srv. is TOPS! LOVE POPPY AUSTIN - AND I&#x27;M STICKING WITH THEIR PRODUCTS! :)</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, works on my combination skin. Does not cause me to break out. I use it at night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hair rather than my skin, as I add a half dropper-full amount into my developer when I bleached my hair in hopes that I could reduce the damage to my processed, fine textured hair.  I think it helped.  It certainly added shine to the surface area of my hair when I added a few drops to my hands and applied it with the palms of my hand to smooth the flyaway ends.  It is expensive, but but a little goes a long, long way except when I add it to my developer/bleach.  It has a neutral fragrance, pleasant enough, and seems to be as pure as the description states.  I like the fact that I know exactly how much or how little I am using when I add it to my hair care products or directly upon the hair.  Good product so far.</li>
            <li> fast shipment, great product</li>
            <li> Great product. Prompt professional service. recommend.</li>
            <li> like it.  can&#x27;t see immediate results.  how can you go wrong with an oil that can be use on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil just purely is awesome!.  I suffered from sensitive really dry red skin that felt like sandpaper !  My skin is insanely sensitive for a guy.  I put this on my face in the morning and no irritation or burning sensation at all!  It instantly made my skin super soft and cleared my face completely in like 3 days! this thing is magic</li>
            <li> I am so glad to discover this product and a multi use product is a plus !&lt;br /&gt;Love how it feels on my face and I will definitely rebuy.&lt;br /&gt;So nice to find an organic product that I like and believe in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer !</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am 49 and color my hair.  My hair feels like it did when I was younger!  It does not get greasy (use sparingly) and I haven&#x27;t detected any awful smells as some reviews have suggested. The price is right, I know how much pure organic oils can be.  Will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Sent all the way to India completely intact.  The product seems to be great too without any roasted seed smell.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin  hydrated , Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels.  Every morning after I thoroughly wash it, I apply the oil and I can tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift, they said it was okay</li>
            <li> Great product! Light weight &amp; easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how this product makes my face feel. The first time I was introduced to it was in a big box cosmetic store and I paid much much more for it. I was trying to figure out how I could afford to purchase it each month and then I found Poppy Austin! Not not only can I afford it for myself each month I can also buy some for my daughter who is currently receiving Chemo Treatments and has extremely dry skin due to her treatments. We both love the Poppy Austin Pure Argan Oil and now I am ready to try some of there other products. Thanks so much Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin vs. Josie Maran Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was introduced to argan oil last year after watching a presentation on TV by Josie M, and bought a huge 6 oz bottle.  It got my hair, face and hands through the incredibly long and dry Maryland winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when it was time for a refill I decided to try Poppy A&#x27;s.  To be honest, it has more body to it and takes a little longer to absorb into the skin.  (I have not used it on my face yet.)  Since it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; in texture I can use less, especially on my silver hair.  It really brings out the highlights!  At night I&#x27;m layering it on my hands before applying hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I&#x27;m definitely a fan.  And I love not having to ration it out.  I imagine I&#x27;ll appreciate it even more next winter when I&#x27;m running the heater 24/7.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It is a pure Argan Oil, but it is not greasy on your face. It feels light and smooth when it is applied. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a very big fan of Poppy Austin now that I have my 100% pure argan oil, my hair is liking fabulous, I put this on my face, my body, every where on my self! I have good faith in this company, I received my shipment in about 5 days after I ordered, maybe 7, but it was really fast! I love them, I&#x27;m thinking of ordering additional product&#x27;s in the future from them, I&#x27;ll definitely go back &amp; order my argan oil, that&#x27;s for sure! Thanks poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> There is a slight odd smell when using it, but that goes away once it&#x27;s on. I think I&#x27;ve liked competing argan oils better, but since this is half the price, I think that&#x27;s a fair trade. It still moisturizes the skin nicely, and for the price I can overlook the smell.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and as advertised</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Bought it for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair which was dry and brittle. After the first application it turned smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Far superior in every way to other so called Argan oils. Any other brand I have investigated is inferior. This is the one to buy and the price is fair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but it smells terrible! Might have gone rancid.</li>
            <li> Got it for my grandma in Las vegas. She raves about it. I&#x27;m the number one grandchild...again!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. My skin the epitome of &amp;#34;combination skin&amp;#34;- I have rosacea, occasional acne, clogged pores, dryness, now dealing with some uneven tone and fine lines. This oil makes my skin look perfect. I&#x27;ve ised it at night for a week now and every morning I look in the mirror and am so surprised at how even the tone is and bright and healthy it looks. Definitely worth the price- which isn&#x27;t even high compared to medium to high end creams and serums that give similar results</li>
            <li> Best argan oil of the market!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have dry, sensitive skin and in winter, it gets quite itchy and scaly.  This oil does a great job in rehydrating my skin without creating a greasy sheen or feel.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, especially considering the more than reasonable price.  If you are remotely interested in argan oil and its benefits, this is the product to try.</li>
            <li> I have been doing lots and lots of research on Argan oil and this is hands down the most pure I have found. I use it for pretty much anything.&lt;br /&gt;* Moisturizer for my face, arms, legs. I never use lotion anymore.&lt;br /&gt;* Use it on my tattoos to help them heal. It&#x27;s perfect. The anti-itch and anti-inflamitory properties help them heal up really quick.&lt;br /&gt;* in place of Chapstick&lt;br /&gt;* cuticle oil&lt;br /&gt;* on my hair to protect it from heat and dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing stuff. Well worth the price. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am onto my second bottle of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair which is fairly thick. I have used oil on my hair forever! In my search for moisturizing oil for everyday use, I previously used jojoba oil which made my hair look oiled-shiny but still left it dry, weird I know!&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to shell out for Argan oil and am I glad I did! A few drops, for my long hair I use about 3-4 drops and my hair feels soft, well-moisturized and manageable. It has a nutty fragrance to it which does not linger either.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my face too, leaves it moisturized without making it look oily.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone on the fence about this stuff, take the leap and try it out! You will love it!</li>
            <li> I love the oil, but when I received it the lid was cracked and most the oil was in the pkg :(</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product....and the thanking Poppy Austin for such a prompt shipment.  Will definitely be reordering.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product. I will buy more when my supply is empty.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a week and seeing results! It is helping my cracked dry hands. I use a couple of drops on my hands after bathing and sealing it in with my body lotion. After cleaning my face for the evening I apply a couple of pure Argan oil drops to my face, then add my pure emu oil over than, and finally apply a natural herbal cream moisturizer with sunscreen. I have notice a big difference to my face. I do this before again before I put my makeup on in the morning too. The wrinkles are not as noticeable and my face to touch is so soft. I do put it in my hair before drying. It has not weighted down my hair like other oils I have used. It does add a nice shine too! Over all if you can&#x27;t tell I really, really like Poppy Austin Argan Oil and will continue to order it to use!! Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I could not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> All these bad reviews on here scared me. My oil doesn&#x27;t have a weird scent to it, some people described it as a nutty smell. I&#x27;ve smelled no such thing. I wanted to wait a few weeks before I wrote a review on this. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and on my face every time I shower. Given that I have very oily skin, this only makes it extra oily. I think I&#x27;m going to stop using it on my face for that reason. However, on the hair it&#x27;s been nothing short of phenomenal. My hair suffers from major damage from bleaching it too much, and when I don&#x27;t use this oil it feels like a dry heap of straw. When I use it it feels a lot more manageable and less broken at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Don&#x27;t use too much at one time, your hair WILL look greasy. a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a self confessed hair and skin product junkie. I can&#x27;t get enough of the stuff, and having spent more than $3,500 on cosmetics this year alone, it&#x27;s safe to say that I know what works for me and what doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, here&#x27;s my candid review of Poppy Austin&#x27;s Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: Despite the claims that this product is \\&quot;odourless\\&quot;, I did detect a very mild nutty fragrance when I first opened the bottle. This didn&#x27;t particularly bother me as the smell isn&#x27;t strong, nor does it last any longer than a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: I initially used this product on my hair after showering each morning. To be honest, I dye my hair way more than I should and was already looking for a repair and / or conditioning treatment to fix the damaged areas. I rubbed a few drops into my hands before running them through my pre hair-dryed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: In truth, this product is extremely good and well worth the hefty price tag. Unlike some leave in hair products I have tried over the years, this does not in any way leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy. It absorbs fully with minimal fuss or bother. And as for result? Well, lets just say that my hair has never felt so soft, shiny and above all, manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full marks to Poppy Austin, 5 stars all round. I&#x27;ve already purchased a second bottle.</li>
